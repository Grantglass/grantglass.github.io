BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF
DANIEL DE FOE.
PERHAPS there exists no work, either of instruction
or entertainment, in the English language, which
has been more generally read and more universally
admired than the " Life and Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe." It is difficult to say in what the charm
consists by which persons of all classes and deno-
minations are thus fascinated; yet the majority of
readers will recollect it as amongst the first works
which awakened and interested their youthful atten-
tion; and feel, even in advanced life, and in the
maturity of their understanding, that there are still
associated with Robinson Crusoe the sentiments
peculiar to that period, when all is new, all glitter-
ing in prospect, and when those visions are most
bright, which the experience of after-life tends only
to darken and destroy.
This work was first published in April 1719; its
reception, as may be supposed, was universal. It
is a singular circumstance that the Author (the
subject of our present Memoir), after a life spent in
political turmoil, danger, and imprisonment, should
have occupied himself, in its decline, in the produc-
tion of a work like the present; unless it may be
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
supposed that his wearied heart turned with disgust
from society and its institutions, and found solace in
picturing the happiness of a state such as he has
assigned to his hero. Be this as it may, society is
for ever indebted to the memory of De Foe for his
production of a work, in which the ways of Provi-
dence are simply and pleasingly vindicated, and a
lasting and useful moral is conveyed through the
. ,channel of an interesting and delightful story.
DANIEL DE FOE was born in London in the year
^6>/ * 1663- His father was James Foe, of the parish of
St. Giles', butcher. Much curious speculation, with
which we shall not trouble our readers, has arisen
from the circumstance of Daniel's having, in his
own instance, prefixed the De to the family name.
We are inclined to adopt the opinion of that critical
inquirer, who supposes that Daniel did so, being
ashamed of the lowness of his origin. His family,
as well as himself, were Dissenters; but it does not
appear that his tenets were so strict as his sect re-
quired; for he complains, in the Preface to his More
Reformation, "that some Dissenters had reproached
him as if he had said, that the gallows and the gal-
leys ought to be the penalty of going to the conven-
ticle; forgetting that I must design to have my father,
my wife, six innocent children, and myself, put into
the same condition."
De Foe's education was rather circumscribed, which
is the more to be lamented, as, in so many instances,
he has exhibited proofs of rare natural genius. He
was sent by his father, at twelve years old, to the
Newington Green Dissenting Academy, then kept by
Mr. Morton, where he remained about four years;
OF DANIEL DE FOE. xiii
and this appears to have been all the education he
ever received. When he was remanded from school,
it would seem that his genius not lying towards the
marrow-bone and cleaver, his father had put him to
some other trade; of what nature we are unable to
learn, De Foe himself being very reserved on the sub-
ject. When charged by Tutchin * with having his
breeding as an apprentice to a hosier, he asserts (May
1705), "that he never was a hosier,f or an apprentice,
but admits that he had been a trader."
This, however, had occupied but a short period of
his youth; for in 1685, when he was in his twenty-
second year, he took up arms in the cause of the
Duke of Monmouth. On the destruction of Mon-
mouth's party Daniel had the good fortune to escape
unpunished amidst the herd of greater delinquents;
but, in his latter years, when the avowal was no
longer dangerous, he boasts himself much of his
exploits, in His Appeal to Honour and Justice, being
a true Account of his Conduct in Public Affairs.
Two years afterwards (1688) De Foe was admitted
a liveryman of London. As he had been through-
out a steady advocate for the Revolution, he had
now the satisfaction of witnessing that great event.
Oldmixon says (Works, vol. ii. p. 276), that at a
feast, given by the Lord Mayor of London to King
William on the 29th October 1689, De Foe appeared
gallantly mounted and richly accoutred amongst
the troopers commanded by Lord Peterborough,
* Tutchin, the publisher of the Observator, and a steady opponent
of De Foe's both in politics and literature.
t Perhaps the salvo he laid to his conscience for this apparently
false assertion was, that though he dealt in hose, he did not make
them.
who attended the king and queen from Whitehall
to the Mansion House. All Daniel's horsemanship,
however, united to the steady devotion of his pen to
the cause of William, were unable to procure him
the notice of that cold-charactered monarch; and
our author was fain to content himself (as his adver-
sary Tutchin asserts) with the humble occupation
of a hosier in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill;—wisely
considering that if the court could do without
political tracts, the people could not do without
stockings.
With the ill fortune, however, attendant upon those
men of genius, who cultivate their superior powers to
the neglect of that common sense which is requisite
to carry a man creditably through this everyday
world, De Foe's affairs declined from bad to worse;
he spent those hours, which he ought to have de-
voted to his shop, in a society for the cultivation of
polite learning, and he was under the necessity of
absconding from his creditors in 1692. One of those
creditors, who had less consideration for polite learn-
ing, and more irritability than the rest, took out a
commission of bankruptcy against him; but, fortu-
nately for our author, this was superseded on the
petition of those to whom he was most indebted, and
a composition was accepted. This composition he
punctually paid by efforts of unwearied diligence;
and some of the creditors, whose claims had been
thus satisfied, falling into distress themselves, he
waited upon them and paid their debts in full. He
was next engaged in carrying on tile-works on the
banks of the Thames, near Tilbury; but with little
success; for it was sarcastically said of him, that he
XV
did not, "like the Egyptians, require bricks without
straw, but, like the Jews, required bricks without
paying his labourers." United to his tile-making,
our author, stimulated by an active mind and em-
barrassed circumstances, devised many other schemes,
or, as he called them, projects. He wrote many
sheets about the English coin; he projected banks
for every county, and factories for goods; he ex-
hibited a proposal (very feelingly no doubt) for a
commission of inquiry into bankrupts' estates; he
contrived a pension-office for the relief of the poor,
and finished by publishing a long essay upon pro-
jects themselves.
About this period (1695), our author's indefa-
tigable endeavours procured him some notice from
the Court, and he was appointed accountant to the
commissioners for managing the duties on glass.
Here also his usual ill luck attended him; he was
thrown out of his situation by the suppression of the
tax in 1699.
But the time at length arrived when the sun of
royal favour was to shine out upon our author's pro-
spects. About the end of 1699 there was published
what De Foe calls, "a horrid pamphlet, in very ill
verse, written by one Tutchin, and called The Fo-
reigners: in which the author fell personally upon
the king, then upon the Dutch nation, and after
having reproached His Majesty with crimes that his
worst enemies could not think of without horror,
he sums up all in the odious name of Foreigner.
This filled me with rage against the book, and gave
birth to a trifle, which I never could hope should
have met with so general an acceptation."
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
The trifle which De Foe here alludes to, was his
True Born Englishman; a poetical satire on the
Foreigners, and a defence of King William and the
Dutch; of which the sale was great without example,
and our author's reward proportionate. He was even
admitted to the honour of a personal interview with
the king, and became with more ardour than ever
a professed partizan of the Court.
His first publication afterwards was, The Origi-
nal Power of the Collective Body of the People of
England Examined and Asserted; next, An Argu-
ment to prove that a Standing Army, with Consent
of Parliament, was not Inconsistent with a free Go-
vernment; but as we do not mean to follow De Foe
through the career of his politics, and intend only
to notice such as, in their consequences, materially
affected his personal situation and affairs, we shall
pass to the death of his sovereign and patron, which
took place 8th March 1702.*
The accession of Anne having restored the line of
Stuart, to whom the politics and conduct of De Foe
had been peculiarly obnoxious, our author was shortly
reduced, as before, to live on the produce of his wits;
and it is perhaps lucky for the world that there is so
much truth in the universal outcry against the neglect
of living authors; for there seems a certain laziness
concomitant with genius, which can only be incited
to action by the pressure of necessity. Had William

the fifty-second year of his age.

lived, probably the world would never have been delighted with the Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.
Whether De Foe found politics the most vendible produce of the press, or, like Macbeth, felt himself
Stept in so far, that should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er,—
we are yet to learn; but he ventured to reprint
his Shortest Way with the Dissenters; and to pub-
lish several other treatises, which were considered
libellous by the Commons: and on the 25th of
February 1702-3, a complaint being made in the
House of a book entitled, The Shortest Way with
the Dissenters; and the folios 11-18 and 26 being
read, "Resolved, that this book, being full of false
and scandalous reflections on this Parliament, and
tending to promote sedition, be burnt by the hands
of the common hangman, in New Palace Yard."
Our unfortunate author's political sins were now
all mustered in array against him, and a tremendous
catalogue they made. He had been the favourite
and panegyrist of William; he had fought for Mon-
mouth, and opposed James; he had vindicated the
Revolution, and defended the rights of the people;
he had bantered, insulted, and offended the whole
Tory leaders of the Commons; and, after all, he
could not be quiet, but must republish his most
offensive productions.
Thus overpowered, De Foe was obliged to secrete
himself; and we are indebted to a very disagreeable
circumstance for the following accurate description
of his person. A proclamation was issued by the
Secretaries of State, in January 1703, in the following
terms:— VOL. I. c
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
"St. James's, Jan. 10, 1702-3.
"Whereas Daniel De Foe, alias De Fooe, is charged with
writing a scandalous and seditious pamphlet, entitled, 'The
Shortest Way with the Dissenters:' he is a middle-sized,
spare man, about forty years old, of a brown complexion,
and dark-brown coloured hair, but wears a wig; a hooked
nose, a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole near his
mouth; was born in London, and for many years was a
hose-factor in Freeman's Yard in Cornhill, and now is
owner of the brick and pantile works near Tilbury Fort, in
Essex: whoever shall discover the said Daniel De Foe to
one of her Majesty's principal secretaries of state, or any of
her Majesty's justices of peace, so as he may be apprehended,
shall have a reward of ^50, which her Majesty has ordered
immediately to be paid upon such discovery."
He was shortly after caught, fined, pilloried, and
imprisoned. "Thus," says he, "was I a second
time ruined; for by this affair I lost above ^3500 sterling."
While he was confined in Newgate, he occupied
his time in correcting for the press a collection of
his own writings, which was published in the course
of the year; and he even amused himself by writ-
ing an Ode to the Pillory; of which he had so
lately been made the unwilling acquaintance. But
the chief object to which he directed his mind, was
the projection of The Review. The publication of
this periodical work commenced in 410, on the 19th
February 1704, and continued at the rate of two
numbers a week, till March 1705, when an additional
weekly number was published, and it was continued
every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, till May
1713, forming in the whole nine thick volumes. De
Foe was the sole writer. This work treats of foreign
and domestic intelligence, politics, and trade; but as
xix
our author foresaw that it was not likely to become
popular unless amusing, he discusses various other
topics, under the head of a Scandal Club; Love,
Marriage, Poetry, Language, and the prevailing
tastes and habits of the times. Neither did these
occupations find sufficient employment for his active
mind. While he was still in Newgate (1704), he
published The Storm; or a collection of the most
remarkable casualties which happened in the tem-
pest, 26th November 1703. Nor was this work a
dry detail of disasters only, De Foe having taken
the occasion, with his usual felicity, to inculcate
the truths of religion, and the superintendency of
Providence.*
About the end of 1704, when, as our author tells
us, he lay ruined and friendless in Newgate, without
* The following account of this tremendous visitation is extracted
from the records of the period :—
"November 26.—About midnight began the most terrible storm
that had been known in England, the wind W.S.W. attended with
flashes of lightning. It uncovered the roofs of many houses and
churches, blew down the spires of several steeples and chimneys, tore
whole groves of trees up by the roots. The leads of some churches
were rolled up like scrolls of parchment, and several vessels, boats and
barges, were sunk in the river Thames; but the royal navy sustained
the greatest damage, being just returned from the Straits: four third-
rates, one second-rate, four fourth-rates, and many others of less force
were cast away upon the coast of England, and above fifteen hundred
seamen lost, besides those that were cast away in merchant ships. The
loss that London alone sustained was computed at one million sterling,
and the city of Bristol lost to the amount of two hundred thousand
pounds. Among the persons who were drowned was Rear-Admiral
Beaumont.
"Upon this calamity the Commons addressed her Majesty, that she
would give directions for rebuilding and repairing the royal navy; and
that she would make some provision for the families of those seamen
that perished in the storm; with which her Majesty complied."

BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
hopes of deliverance, Sir Robert Harley, then Se-
cretary of State, of whom De Foe had no previous
personal knowledge, sent a verbal message to him,
desiring to know "what he could do for him." Our
author, no doubt, made a suitable reply; in conse-
quence of which, Sir Robert took an opportunity to
represent to the queen his present misery and un-
merited sufferings. Anne, however, did not imme-
diately consent to his liberation, but she inquired
into the circumstances of his family, and sent, by
Lord Godolphin, a considerable sum to his wife.
She afterwards, through the same medium, conveyed
a sum to himself, equal to the payment of his fine
and discharge, and thus bound him eternally to her
interest. He was liberated from Newgate the end
of 1704, and retired immediately to his family at
St. Edmund's-Bury. He was not allowed, however,
to enjoy the quiet he courted. Booksellers, news-
writers, and wits, circulated everywhere reports that
he had fled from justice, and deserted his security.
He despised their spite, and resumed his labours;
the first fruits of which were a Hymn to Victory, and
a Double Welcome to the Duke of Marlborough; the
subjects for both of which were furnished by the
glorious achievements of that general.
Our author now continued his Review, and his
political pamphleteering, for several years; in the
course of which he was subjected to much disquiet,
and frequently to danger; but the consciousness of
his situation as an English freeholder, and a livery-
man of London, united to a considerable degree of
resolution and personal courage, enabled him to en-
counter and overcome the machinations of his ene-
xxi
mies. It will scarcely be believed at this time of
day, that, on a journey which his affairs led him to
take to the western parts of England, a project was
formed to kidnap and send him as a soldier to the
army; that the western justices, in the ardour of
their party zeal, determined to apprehend him as a
vagabond; and that suits were commenced against
him in his absence for fictitious debts: yet all these
circumstances De Foe has asserted in his Review;
and we have not learnt that any attempt was ever
made to controvert the truth of his statements.
About this time (1706) a situation occurred, for
which our author's abilities were peculiarly fitted.
The cabinet of Queen Anne was in want of a person
of general commercial knowledge, ready talents, and
insinuating manners, to go to Scotland for the pur-
pose of promoting the great measure of the Union.
Lord Godolphin determined to employ De Foe: he
accordingly carried him to the queen, by whom our
author was graciously received, and in a few days
he was sent to Edinburgh. The particular nature
of his instructions has never been made public; but
on his arrival at Edinburgh, in October 1706, De
Foe was recognised as a character almost diplomatic.
We must refer our readers to his History of the
Union for the various and interesting particulars of
this mission; the detail of which, here, would occupy
an extent beyond the limits of our biography,
De Foe appears to have been no great favourite
in Scotland, although, while there he published Cale-
donia, a poem in honour of the nation. He mentions
many hairbreadth escapes which, by "his own pru-
dence, and God's providence," he effected; and it is
not wonderful that where almost the whole nation
was decidedly averse to the Union, a character like
De Foe, sent thither to promote it by all means,
direct or indirect, should be regarded with dislike,
and even exposed to danger. The Act for the Union
was passed by the Scotch Parliament in January, and
De Foe returned to London in February 1707. It
is believed that his services were rewarded by a
pension from Queen Anne.
During the troublous period at the conclusion of
the war by the treaty of Utrecht, De Foe, wiser by
experience, lived quietly at Newington, publishing
his Review. He encountered, however, in the ful-
filment of this task, much contentious opposition and
obloquy, which he manfully resisted and retorted:
but, after the political changes, by which his first
patron Sir Robert Harley, and next Lord Godolphin,
were turned out of power, his pecuniary allowance
from the Treasury seems to have ceased, and he
was compelled, as before, to launch out as a general
writer for the supply of his necessities. The political
agitation of the times dictated his subjects; but,
unfortunately for De Foe, both Tories and Jacobites
in those days were such plain matter-of-fact men,
that his raillery was misunderstood, and he was
arrested, and committed to his old habitation, for
several squibs, which were obviously ironical.
The writings on which he was indicted, were two;
What if the Pretender should come? and, What if
the Queen should die ?" Nothing," says De Foe,
"could be more plain than that the titles of these
are amusements, in order to get the books into the
hands of those who had been deluded by the Jaco-
xxiii
bites." His explanation would not suffice; he was
tried and found guilty, fined in £800, and committed to
Newgate. He was now compelled to drop the publi-
cation of his Review; and it is singular, that he did
so while confined in Newgate, the very place in which
its idea had first entered his head nine years before.
After lying in jail a few months, he was liberated
by the queen's order in November 1713.
Although thus released, and the innocence of his
intentions admitted, if not established, nothing was
done for him: and the queen's death, which took
place shortly after (in July 1714), left him defence-
less to the attacks of his rancorous enemies. "No
sooner," says he, "was the queen dead, and the king,
as right required, proclaimed, but the rage of men
increased upon me to that degree that their threats
were such as I am unable to express; and though I
have written nothing since the queen's death, yet a
great many things are called by my name, and I
bear the answerer's insults." This was the darkest
period of our author's life. He had lost his appoint-
ment, whatever it was; he had been obliged to give
up his Review; everything he ventured to publish,
besides, was received with suspicion, and he was on
all hands overborne by faction, injury, and insult- His health declined fast under these unmerited suf-
ferings, but the vigour of his mind remained; and he
determined to assert the innocence of his conduct
and to clear his blemished fame. He accordingly
published, in 1715, "An Appeal to Honour and Jus-
tice, though it be of his worst Enemies, being a True
Account of his Conduct in Public Affairs" This
work contains a long account and defence of his
political conduct from the outset, and a most affect-
ing detail of his sufferings; but the subject had been
too much for him. When he reviewed what he had
done, and how he had been rewarded; how much he
had deserved, and how heavily he had suffered; the
ardent spirit of De Foe sunk before the picture, and
he was struck with apoplexy before he could finish
his work. It was published nevertheless by his
friends, and the profits of its sale seem to have been
the only source of his support. This was the ter-
minating period of our author's political career. He
recovered his health, but his mind had changed its
tone; and it was now that the history of Selkirk first
suggested to him the idea of Robinson Crusoe. It
has been thought by some to detract from the merit
of De Foe, that the idea was not originally his own:
but really the story of Selkirk, which had been pub-
lished a few years before, in Woodes Rogers'* "Voyage
Round the World," appears to have furnished our
author with so little beyond the bare idea of a man
living upon an uninhabited island, that it appears
quite immaterial whether he took his hint from that,
or from any other similar story, of which many were
then current. In order to enable our readers to
judge how very little De Foe has been assisted by
Selkirk's narrative, we have extracted the whole
from Woodes Rogers' Voyage.
* Woodes Rogers, who relieved Selkirk from his solitude, was at
that time commodore of a commercial expedition round the world,
which sailed February 1709, and returned to Britain, 1711. A pro-
ject for the re-settlement of the Bahama Islands having been submitted
to Mr. Addison (then Secretary of State) in 1717, the measure was
determined on, and Rogers was appointed to head the expedition.
He died, governor of those islands, in 1732.
XXV
THE REMARKABLE HISTORY OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK.
"On February ist, 1709, we came before the island of
Juan Fernandez, having had a good observation the day
before, and found our latitude to be 34 degrees 10 minutes
south. In the afternoon we hoisted out our pinnace; and
Captain Dover, with the boat's crew, went in her to go
ashore, though we could not be less than four leagues off.
As soon as the pinnace was gone I went on board the
OF DANIEL DE FOE.
at that distance from land. It was against my inclination:
but, to oblige Captain Dover, I let her go. As soon as it
was dark, we saw a light ashore. Our boat was then about
a league off the island, and bore away for the ships as soon
as she saw the lights. We put our lights aboard for the
boat, though some were of opinion, the lights we saw were
our boat's lights; but as night came on, it appeared too
large for that We fired our quarter-deck gun and several
muskets, showing lights in our mizen and fore-shrouds, that
our boat might find us whilst we were in the lee of the
island: about two in the morning our boat came on board,
having been two hours on board the 'Duchess,' that took
them up astern of us; we were glad they got well off, be-
cause it began to blow. We were all convinced the light
was on the shore, and designed to make our ships ready to
engage, believing them to be French ships at anchor, and
we must either fight them, or want water. All this stir
and apprehension arose, as we afterwards found, from one
poor naked man, who passed in our imagination, at present,
for a Spanish garrison, a body of Frenchmen, or a crew of
pirates. While we were under these apprehensions, we
stood on the back side of the island, in order to fall in with
the southerly wind, till we were past the island; and then
we came back to it again, and ran close aboard the land
that begins to make the north-east side.
"We still continued to reason upon this matter; and it
is in a manner incredible, what strange notions many of
our people entertained from the sight of the fire upon the
island. It served, however, to show people's tempers and
spirits; and we were able to give a tolerable guess how
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
our men would behave, in case there really were any
enemies upon the island The flaws came heavy off the
shore, and we were forced to reef our topsails when we
opened the middle bay, where we expected to have found
our enemy; but saw all clear, and no ships, nor in the
other bay next the north-east end. These two bays are
all that ships ride in, which recruit on this island; but
the middle bay is by much the best. We guessed there
had been ships there, but that they were gone on sight of
us. We sent our yawl ashore about noon, with Captain
Dover, Mr. Fry, and six men, all armed: meanwhile we
and the 'Duchess' kept turning to get in, and such heavy
flaws came off the land, that we were forced to let go our
topsail sheet, keeping all hands to stand by our sails, for
fear of the winds carrying them away: but when the flaws
were gone, we had little or no wind. These flaws proceeded
from the land, which is very high in the middle of the
island. Our boat did not return; we sent our pinnace
with the men armed, to see what was the occasion of the
yawl's stay; for we were afraid that the Spaniards had a
garrison there, and might have seized them. We put out
a signal for our boat, and the 'Duchess' showed a French
ensign. Immediately our pinnace returned from the shore,
and brought abundance of cray-fish, with a man clothed in
goats' skins, who looked wilder than the first owners of
them. He had been on the island four years and four
months, being left thereby Captain Stradling in the 'Cinque
Ports;' his name was Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman,
who had been master of the ' Cinque Ports,' a ship that came
here last with Captain Dampier, who told me that this was
the best man in her. I immediately agreed with him to be
a mate on board our ship: it was he that made the fire last
night when he saw our ships, which he judged to be English.
During his stay here he saw several ships pass by, but only
two came to anchor. As he went to view them, he found
them to be Spaniards, and retired from them, upon which
they shot at him: had they been French he would have
submitted; but chose to risk his dying alone on the island,
rather than fall into the hands of Spaniards in these parts;
because he apprehended they would murder him, or make
xxvii
a slave of him in the mines; for he feared they would spare
no stranger that might be capable of discovering the South
Seas.
"The Spaniards had landed before he knew what they
were; and they came so near him, that he had much ado
to escape; for they not only shot at him, but pursued him
to the woods, where he climbed to the top of a tree, at the
foot of which they made water, and killed several goats just
by, but went off again without discovering him. He told
us that he was born in Scotland, and was bred a sailor from
his youth. The reason of his being left here was a differ-
ence between him and his captain; which, together with
the ship's being leaky, made him willing rather to stay here,
than go along with him at first; but when he was at last
willing to go, the captain would not receive him. He had
been at the island before, to wood and water, when two of
the ship's company were left upon it for six months, till the
ship returned, being chased thence by two French South
Sea ships. He had with him his clothes and bedding, with
a firelock, some powder, bullets, and tobacco, a hatchet, a
knife, a kettle, a Bible, some practical pieces, and his mathe-
matical instruments and books. He diverted and pro-
vided for himself as well as he could; but for the first eight
months had much ado to bear up against melancholy, and
the terror of being left alone in such a desolate place. He
built two huts with pimento trees, covered them with long
grass, and lined them with the skins of goats, which he killed
with his gun as he wanted, so long as his powder lasted,
which was but a pound; and that being almost spent, he
got fire by rubbing two sticks of pimento wood together
upon his knee. In the lesser hut, at some distance from
the other, he dressed his victuals; and in the larger he
slept, and employed himself in reading, singing psalms, and
praying: so that he said, he was a better Christian while in
his solitude than ever he was before, or than, he was afraid,
he should ever be again.
"At first he never ate anything till hunger constrained him,
partly for grief, and partly for want of bread and salt: nor
did he go to bed till he could watch no longer; the pimento
wood, which burnt very clear, served him both for fire and
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
candle, and refreshed him with its fragrant smell. He
might have had fish enough, but would not eat them for
want of salt, because they occasioned a looseness, except
cray-fish, which are as large as our lobsters, and very good:
these he sometimes boiled, and at other times broiled, as
he did his goat's flesh, of which he made very good broth,
for they are not so rank as ours. He kept an account
of 500 that he killed while there, and caught as many
more, which he marked on the ear and let go. When his
powder failed, he took them by speed of foot; for his way
of living, continual exercise of walking and running, cleared
him of all gross humours; so that he ran with wonderful
swiftness through the woods, and up the rocks and hills,
as we perceived when we employed him to catch goats for
us: we had a bull-dog, which we sent with several of our
nimblest runners, to help him in catching goats; but he
distanced and tired both the dog and the men, caught the
goats, and brought them to us on his back.
"He told us that his agility in pursuing a goat had once
like to have cost him his life; he pursued it with so much
eagerness, that he catched hold of it on the brink of a
precipice, of which he was not aware, the bushes hiding
it from him; so that he fell with the goat down the pre-
cipice, a great height, and was so stunned and bruised with
the fall, that he narrowly escaped with his life; and when
he came to his senses, found the goat dead under him; he
lay there about twenty-four hours, and was scarce able to
crawl to his hut, which was about a mile distant, or to stir
abroad again in ten days.
"He came at last to relish his meat well enough without
salt or bread; and in the season had plenty of good tur-
nips, which had been sown there by Captain Dampier's
men, and have now overspread some acres of ground. He
had enough of good cabbage from the cabbage-trees, and
seasoned his meat with the fruit of the pimento-trees, which
is the same as Jamaica pepper, and smells deliciously. He
found also a black pepper, called Malageta, which was very
good to expel wind, and against griping in the guts.
"He soon wore out all his shoes and clothes by running
in the woods; and, at last, being forced to shift without
xxix
them, his feet became so hard, that he ran everywhere
without difficulty; and it was some time before he could
wear shoes after we found him; for, not being used to any
so long, his feet swelled when he came first to wear them
again.
"After he had conquered his melancholy, he diverted
himself sometimes with cutting his name on the trees, and
the time of his being left, and continuance there. He was
at first much pestered with cats and rats, that bred in great
numbers, from some of each species which had got ashore
from ships that put in there to wood and water. The rats
gnawed his feet and clothes whilst asleep, which obliged
him to cherish the cats with his goats' flesh, by which many
of them became so tame, that they would lie about him in
hundreds, and soon delivered him from the rats. He like-
wise tamed some kids; and, to divert himself, would, now
and then, sing and dance with them, and his cats: so that,
by the favour of Providence, and vigour of his youth, being
now but thirty years old, he came, at last, to conquer all
the inconveniences of his solitude, and to be very easy.
"When his clothes were worn out, he made himself a
coat and a cap of goat skins, which he stitched together with
little thongs of the same, that he cut with his knife. He
had no other needle but a nail; and when his knife was
worn to the back, he made others, as well as he could, of
some iron hoops that were left ashore, which he beat thin,
and ground upon stones. Having some linen-cloth by
him, he sewed him some shirts with a nail, and stitched
them with the worsted of his old stockings, which he pulled
out on purpose. He had his last shirt on when we found
him in the island
"At his first coming on board us, he had so much forgot
his language, for want of use, that we could scarce under-
stand him; for he seemed to speak his words by halves.
We offered him a dram; but he would not touch it, having
drank nothing but water since his being there; and it was
some time before he could relish our victuals. He could
give us an account of no other product of the island than
what we have mentioned, except some black plums, which
are very good, but hard to come at; the trees which bear
them growing on high mountains and rocks. Pimento
trees are plenty here; and we saw some sixty feet high,
and about two yards thick; and cotton trees higher, and
near four fathoms round in the stock. The climate is so
good that the trees and grass are verdant all the year
round. The winter lasts no longer than June and July,
and is not then severe, there being only a small frost and
a little hail; but sometimes great rains. The heat of the
summer is equally moderate; and there is not much thunder,
or tempestuous weather of any sort He saw no venomous
or savage creature on the island; nor any sort of beasts but
goats, the first of which had been put ashore here, on
purpose for a breed, by Juan Fernandez, a Spaniard, who
settled there with some families, till this continent of Chili
began to submit to the Spaniards; which, being more
profitable, tempted them to quit the island, capable, how-
ever, of maintaining a good number of people, and being
made so strong that they could not be easily dislodged from
thence."
We are indebted for the following additional par-
ticulars, respecting the life and fate of this singular
character, to the research of A. Gibson Hunter, Esq.
of Balskelly, in Scotland; who, we believe, is yet in
possession of his will, and some other curious relics.
Through this gentleman we learn that Selkirk was
born at Largo in Fife, in the year 1676, where he
possessed some trifling landed property. He went
mate with Captain Stradling, in the " Cinque Ports,"
on a trading voyage round the world in 1704. In the
course of which, a difference arising betwixt him and
his captain, the causes of which must now remain for
ever unexplained, Selkirk, with all the hardihood of
the seaman's character, desired to be landed on the
island of Fernandez. Here he remained in perfect
solitude, existing as he has described himself, until
discovered by Captain Rogers. Selkirk died on
board a king's ship, the " Weymouth," of which he was
mate, in 1723; leaving his effects, by will, to sundry
"loving female friends," with whom he had contracted
intimacies in the course of his peregrinations. His
chest, his gun, and his drinking cup, the last made of
a cocoanut shell, are, or were till lately, the property
of his descendants at Largo.
The sale of "Robinson Crusoe" was, as we have
already stated, rapid and extensive, and De Foe's
profits were commensurate. The work was attacked
on all sides by his ancient opponents, whose labours
have long since quietly descended with their authors
to merited oblivion; but our author, having the
public on his side, set them all at defiance; and the
same year he published a second volume with equal
success. Thus far
"With steady bark and flowing sail
He ran before the wind,"
but incited by the hope of further profit, and con-
ceiving the theme of Crusoe inexhaustible, he shortly
after published " Serious Reflections during the Life of
Robinson Crusoe, with his Visionof the Angelic World."
These Visions and Reflections were well received at
the time, although by no means so much in requisi-
tion now.
With the return of his good fortune, our author's
health was re-established, and the vigour of his mind
restored. He published, in 1720, "The Life and
Piracies of Captain Singleton;" and finding it safer, it
would seem, as well as more profitable, to amuse the
public than to reform them, he continued this course,
with little variation, for the remainder of his life.
His subsequent publications, to all of which a con-
siderable degree of popularity was attached, though
none of them equalled the reputation of "Robinson
Crusoe," were the "Dumb Philosopher," "History of
Duncan Campbell," "Remarkable Life of Colonel
Jack," " Fortunate Mistress," and " New Voyage round
the World."
We are now to take leave of our author, who died
in 1731, at the age of sixty-eight, in Cripplegate,
London, leaving a widow and large family in tolerable
circumstances.
It does not fall within our plan either to attempt a
critical analysis of " Robinson Crusoe," or a detailed
view of the character of Daniel De Foe; the one is
before our readers, and the other may be estimated
from his life. That De Foe was a man of powerful
intellect and lively imagination is obvious from his
works; that he was possessed of an ardent temper, a
resolute courage, and an unwearied spirit of enterprise,
is ascertained by the events of his changeful career:
and whatever may be thought of that rashness and
improvidence by which his progress in life was so
frequently impeded, there seems no reason to with-
hold from him the praise of integrity, sincerity, and
unvaried consistency. As the author of "Robinson
Crusoe," his fame promises to endure as long as the
language in which he wrote.

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
CHAPTER I.
MY BIRTH AND PARENTAGE—AT NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE I DETERMINE TO GO TO SEA—DISSUADED BY MY PARENTS ELOPE WITH A SCHOOLFELLOW. AND GO
ON BOARD SHIP A STORM ARISES, DURING WHICH
1 AM DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED SHIP FOUNDERSMYSELF AND CREW SAVED BY A BOAT FROM ANOTHER VESSEL, AND LANDED NEAR YARMOUTH
—MEET MY COMPANION'S FATHER THERE, WHO
ADVISES ME NEVER TO GO TO SEA MORE, BUT ALL
IN VAIN.
I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of
a good family, though not of that country, my father
being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull:
he got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off
his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he
had married my mother, whose relations were named
Robinson, a very good family in that country, and
from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but,
VOL. I. A
by the usual corruption of words in England, we are
now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our
name, Crusoe; and so my companions always called
me.
I had two elder brothers, one of which was a lieu-
tenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flan-
ders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel
Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards: what became of my second
brother I never knew, any more than my father or
mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to
any trade, my head began to be filled very early with
rambling thoughts: my father, who was very ancient,
had given me a competent share of learning, as far
as house education and a country free-school gene-
rally goes, and designed me for the law; but I would
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my
inclination to this led me so strongly against the will,
nay, the commands of my father, and against all the
entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in
that propension of nature, tending directly to the life
of misery which was to befall me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was
my design. He called me one morning into his
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject:
he asked me what reasons, more than a mere wander-
ing inclination, I had for leaving my father's house
and my native country, where I might be well intro-
duced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3
by application and industry, with a life of ease and
pleasure: he told me it was men of desperate for-
tunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes
on the other, and who went abroad upon adventures,
to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in
undertakings of a nature out of the common road;
that these things were all either too far above me, or
too far below me; that mine was the middle state,
or what might be called the upper station of low life,
which he had found, by long experience, was the
best state in the world, the most suited to human
happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships,
the labour and sufferings, of the mechanic part of
mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury,
ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind.
He told me I might judge of the happiness of this
state, by this one thing, viz., that this was the state
of life which all other people envied; that kings have
frequently lamented the miserable consequences of
being born to great things, and wished they had
been placed in the middle of the two extremes,
between the mean and the great; that the wise man
gave his testimony to this, as the just standard of
true felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty
nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the middle
station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed
to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part
of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so
many distempers, and uneasinesses, either of body or
mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury,
and extravagances on one hand, or by hard labour,
want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet
on the other hand, bring distempers upon them-
selves by the natural consequences of their way of
living; that the middle station of life was calcu-
lated for all kind of virtues and all kind of enjoy-
ments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids
of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation,
quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions,
and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attend-
ing the middle station of life; that this way men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and com-
fortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of
the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery
for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed circum-
stances, which rob the soul of peace, and the body
of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or
the secret burning lust of ambition for great things;
but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without
the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning
by every day's experience to know it more sensibly. After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, or
to precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and
the station of life I was born in, seemed to have
provided against; that I was under no necessity of
seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and
endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life
which he had been just recommending to me; and
that if I was not very easy and happy in the world,
it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder
it; and that he should have nothing to answer for,
s
having thus discharged his duty in warning me
against measures which he knew would be to my
hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind
things for me if I would stay and settle at home as
he directed, so he would not have so much hand in
my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement
to go away; and, to close all, he told me I had my
elder brother for an example, to whom he had used
the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going
into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail,
his young desires prompting him to run into the
army, where he was killed; and though he said he
would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture
to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step God
would not bless me, and I would have leisure here-
after to reflect upon having neglected his counsel,
when there might be none to assist in my recovery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which
was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did
not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the
tears run down his face very plentifully, especially
when he spoke of my brother who was killed; and
that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke
off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full
he could say no more to me.
I was sincerely afflicted with this discourse, as
indeed who could be otherwise? and I resolved not
to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at
home according to my father's desire. But, alas! a
few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any
of my father's farther importunities, in a few weeks
after, I resolved to run quite away from him. How-
ever, I did not act so hastily neither, as the first heat
of my resolution prompted, but I took my mother at
a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than
ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so
entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should
never settle to anything with resolution enough to go
through with it, and my father had better give me his
consent than force me to go without it; that I was
now eighteen years old, which was too late to go
apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney; that
I was sure, if I did, I should never serve out my time,
but I should certainly run away from my master
before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father to let me go one voyage
abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I
would go no more, and I would promise, by a double
diligence, to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion: she told
me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to
my father upon any such subject; that he knew too
well what was my interest, to give his consent to any
such thing so much for my hurt; and that she won-
dered how I could think of any such thing after the
discourse I had had with my father, and such kind
and tender expressions as she knew my father had
used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself,
there was no help for me; but I might depend I
should never have their consent to it: that, for her
part, she would not have so much hand in my de-
struction; and I should never have it to say, that
my mother was willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my father,
yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the
discourse to him; and that my father, after showing
a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, " That
boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but
if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable
wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent
to it."
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the meantime I continued obsti-
nately deaf to all proposals of settling to business,
and frequently expostulating with my father and
mother about their being so positively determined
against what they knew my inclinations prompted
me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I went
casually, and without any purpose of making an
elopement that time; but, I say, being there, and
one of my companions being going by sea to London
in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with
them, with the common allurement of a seafaring
man, that it should cost me nothing for my passage,
I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor
so much as sent them word of it; but leaving them
to hear of it as they might, without asking God's
blessing or my father's, without any consideration of
circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour,
God knows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went
on board a ship bound for London. Never any
young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began
sooner, or continued longer, than mine: the ship
was no sooner got out of the Humber, but the wind
began to blow, and the sea to rise in a most frightful
manner; and as I had never been at sea before, I
was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in
mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what I
had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the
judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my
father's house, and abandoning my duty. All the
good counsel of my parents, my father's tears, and my
mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind;
and my conscience, which was not yet come to the
pitch of hardness to which it has been since, re-
proached me with the contempt of advice, and the
breach of my duty to God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea
went very high, though nothing like what I have
seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few
days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who
was but a young sailor, and had never known any-
thing of the matter. I expected every wave would
have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship
fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow
of the sea, we should never rise more. In this agony
of mind, I made many vows and resolutions, that if it
would please God to spare my life in this one voyage,
if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I
would go directly home to my father, and never set
it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take
his advice, and never run myself into such miseries
as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness
of his observations about the middle station of life,
how easy, how comfortable he had lived all his days,
and never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or
trouble on shore; and, in short, I resolved that I
would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my
father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time
9
after; but the next day the wind was abated, and
the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to
it. However, I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fine evening followed; the sun went down
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and
having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun
shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most
delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no
more sea-sick, but very cheerful; looking with won-
der upon the sea, that was so rough and terrible the
day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in
so little a time after: and now, lest my good resolu-
tions should continue, my companion, who had in-
deed enticed me away, comes to me. "Well, Bob,"
says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, "how do
you do after it? I warrant you were frighted, wer'n't
you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?"
"A capful d'ye call it?" said I"; "'twas a terrible
storm." "A storm, you fool you!" replies he; "do
you call that a storm? why, it was nothing at all;
give us but a good ship, and sea-room, and we think
nothing of such a squall of wind as that; but you're
but a fresh-water sailor, Bob; come, let us make a
bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that; d'ye see
what charming weather 'tis now?" To make short
this sad part of my story, we went the way of all
sailors; the punch was made, and I was made half
drunk with it; and in that one night's wickedness I
drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon
my past conduct, all my resolutions for the future.
In a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness
of surface and settled calmness by the abatement
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed
up by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my
former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows
and promises that I made in my distress. I found,
indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious
thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again
sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself
from them, as it were from a distemper; and applying
myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the
return of those fits (for so I called them); and I had,
in five or six days, got a complete victory over my
conscience, as any young fellow that resolved not to
be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have
another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such
cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse; for if I would not take this for a
deliverance, the next was to be such an one as the
worst and most hardened wretch among us would
confess both the danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to
an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing
contrary, viz., at south-west, for seven or eight days;
during which time a great many ships from New-
castle came into the same roads, as the common
harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for
the river.
We had not, however, rid here so long, but we
ii
should have tided it up the river, but that the wind
blew too fresh; and, after we had lain four or five
days, blew very hard. However, the roads being
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good,
and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were
unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of
danger; but spent the time in rest and mirth, after
the manner of the sea: but the eighth day, in the
morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at
work to strike our top-masts, and make everything
snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as
possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed,
and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas,
and we thought once or twice our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-
anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and
the cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and
now I began to see terror and amazement in the
faces even of the seamen themselves. The master,
though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship,
yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could
hear him, softly to himself, say several times, "Lord,
be merciful to us! we shall be all lost, we shall be all
undone," and the like. During these first hurries I
was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the
steerage, and cannot describe my temper. I could
ill resume the first penitence which I had so appa-
rently trampled upon, and hardened myself against:
I thought the bitterness of death had been past; and
that this would be nothing too, like the first. But
when the master himself came by me, as I said just
now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully
frighted: I got up out of my cabin, and looked out;
but such a dismal sight I never saw: the sea went
mountains high, and broke upon us every three or
four minutes: when I could look about, I could see
nothing but distress round us. Two ships that rid
near us, we found had cut their masts by the board,
being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a ship,
which rid about a mile ahead of us, was foundered.
Two more ships, being driven from their anchors,
were run out of the roads to sea, at all adventures,
and that with not a mast standing. The light ships
fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea;
but two or three of them drove, and came close by
us, running away with only their sprit-sail out, before
the wind.
Towards the evening, the mate and boatswain
begged the master of our ship to let them cut away
the foremast, which he was very unwilling to do:
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did
not, the ship would founder, he consented; and when
they had cut away the foremast, the mainmast stood
so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were
obliged to cut her away also, and make a clear deck.
Any one must judge what a condition I must be
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who
had been in such a fright before at but a little. But
if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had
about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror
of mind upon account of my former convictions, and
the having returned from them to the resolutions I
had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death
itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm,
put me into such a condition, that I can by no words
13
describe it. But the worst was not come yet; the
storm continued with such fury, that the seamen
themselves acknowledged they had never seen a
worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every now
and then cried out she would founder. It was my
advantage in one respect that I did not know what
they meant by founder, till I inquired. However,
the storm was so violent, that I saw, what is not
often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others
more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and
expecting every moment when the ship would go to
the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under
all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had
been down on purpose to see, cried out we had sprung
a leak; another said, there was four feet water in the
hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At
that very word, my heart, as I thought, died within
me; and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed
where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused
me, and told me, that I, that was able to do nothing
before, was as well able to pump as another; at which
I stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked very
heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm,
were obliged to slip and run away to the sea, and
would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal
of distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant,
was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke,
or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was
so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this
was a time when everybody had his own life to think
of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me;
but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrust-
ing me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had
been dead; and it was a great while before I came to
myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder;
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not possible she could swim till we might run
into a port, so the master continued firing guns for
help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead
of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with
the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was
impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to
lie near the ship side, till at last the men rowing very
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our
men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to
it, and then veered it out a great length, which they,
after much labour and hazard, took hold of, and we
hauled them close under our stern, and got all into
their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after
we were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own
ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull
her in towards shore as much as we could; and our
master promised them, that if the boat was staved
upon shore, he would make it good to their master:
so partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went
away to the northward, sloping towards the shore,
almost as far as Winterton Ness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our ship, but we saw her sink: and then I
understood, for the first time, what was meant by a
ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I
had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me
she was sinking; for, from that moment they rather
put me into the boat, than that I might be said to go
in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly
with fright, partly with horror of mind, and the
thoughts of what was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see (when, our boat mounting the waves, we
were able to see the shore) a great many people
running along the shore to assist us when we should
come near; but we made but slow way towards the
shore, nor were we able to reach the shore till, being
past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off
to the westward towards Cromer, and so the land
broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we
got in, and, though not without much difficulty, got
all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to
Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used
with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by par-
ticular merchants and owners of ships, and had money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or
back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's para-
ble, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for,
hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in
Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had
any assurance that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy
that nothing could resist; and though I had several
times loud calls from my reason and my more com-
posed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to
do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I urge
that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries us on
to be the instruments of our own destruction, even
though it be before us, and that we push upon it with
our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such
decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it
was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed
me forward against the calm reasonings and per-
suasions of my most retired thoughts, and against
two such visible instructions as I had met with in
my first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before,
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days,
for we were separated in the town to several quar-
ters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his
tone was altered; and looking very melancholy, and
shaking his head, asked me how I did: and telling
his father who I was, and how I had come this
voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther abroad;
his father, turning to me with a grave and concerned
tone, "Young man," says he, "you ought never to
go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a
plain and visible token that you are not to be a sea-
faring man." "Why, sir," said I, "will you go to
sea no more?" "That is another case," said he;
"it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as
you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a
taste Heaven has given you of what you are to ex-
pect if you persist; perhaps all^this has befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish.''
'7
Pray," continues he, "what are you? and on what
account did you go to sea?" Upon that I told him
some of my story; at the end of which he burst out
with a strange kind of passion: "What had I done,"
says he, "that such an unhappy wretch should come
into my ship? I would not set my foot in the same
ship with thee again for a thousand pounds." This
indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits,
which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and
was farther than he could have authority to go.
However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me,
exhorted me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; told me, I might see a visible
hand of Heaven against me; "And, young man,"
said he, "depend upon it, if you do not go back,
wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but
disasters and disappointments, till your father's words
are fulfilled upon you."
We parted soon after; for I made him little an-
swer, and I saw him no more: which way he went,
I know not. As for me, having some money in my
pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there,
as well as on the road, had many struggles with
myself what course of life I should take, and whether
I should go home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best
motions that offered to my thoughts; and it imme-
diately occurred to me how I should be laughed
at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to
see, not my father and mother only, but even every-
body else; from whence I have since often observed,
how incongruous and irrational the common temper
of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason
VOL. I. B
which ought to guide them in such cases, viz., that
they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed
to repent; nor ashamed of the action for which they
ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of
the returning, which only can make them be esteemed
wise men.
In this state of life, however, I remained some
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance con-
tinued to going home; and as I stayed awhile, the
remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off;
and as that abated, the little motion I had in my
desires to a return wore off with it, till at last I quite
laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a
voyage.
That evil influence which carried me first away
from my father's house, that hurried me into the
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune;
and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to
the entreaties and even the command of my father;
I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view;
and I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of
Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage
to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune, that in all these ad-
ventures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet, at the same time, I had learnt
the duty and office of a foremastman; and in time
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant,
if not for a master. But as it was always my fate
19
to choose for the worst, so I did here; for, having
money in my pocket, and good clothes upon my
back, I would always go on board in the habit of a
gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the
ship, or learnt to do any.
CHAPTER II.
MAKE A TRADING VOYAGE TO GUINEA VERY SUCCESSFULLY —DEATH OF MY CAPTAIN—SAIL ANOTHER TRIP WITH HIS MATE THE VENGEANCE OF PROVIDENCE FOR
DISOBEDIENCE TO PARENTS NOW OVERTAKES ME
TAKEN BY A SALLEE ROVER, AND ALL SOLD AS
SLAVESMY MASTER FREQUENTLY SENDS ME A-FISH- ING, WHICH SUGGESTS AN IDEA OF ESCAPE MAKE MY ESCAPE IN AN OPEN BOAT, WITH A MORESCO SOY.
It was my lot, first of all, to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early: but it was not so with
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship
who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who hav-
ing had very good success there, was resolved to go
again; and who taking a fancy to my conversation,
which was not at all disagreeable at that time, hear-
ing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me,
if I would go the voyage with him I should be at no
expense; I should be his messmate and his com-
panion; and if I could carry anything with me, I
should have all the advantage of it that the trade
would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.
I embraced the offer; and entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest and
plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and
carried a small adventure with me, which, by the
disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I
increased very considerably; for I carried about £40
in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me
to buy. This £40 I had mustered together by the
assistance of some of my relations, whom I corres-
ponded with, and who, I believe, got my father, or at
least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my
first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain;
under whom also I got a competent knowledge of
the mathematics, and the rules of navigation; learned
how to keep an account of the ship's course, take an
observation, and, in short, to understand some things
that were needful to be understood by a sailor: for,
as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to
learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both
a sailor and a merchant: for I brought home five
pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London, at my return, almost
£300; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin.
Yet, even in this voyage, I had my misfortunes
too; particularly that I was continually sick, being
thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive heat
of the climate; our principal trading being upon
21
the coast, from the lat. of 15 degrees N. even to the
Line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again; and
I embarked in the same vessel with one who was
his mate in the former voyage, and had now got the
command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage
that ever man made; for though I did not carry
quite ^100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had
£200 left, and which I lodged with my friend's
widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into
terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the first
was this: viz., our ship, making her course towards
the Canary Islands, or rather between those islands
and the African shore, was surprised in the grey of
the morning, by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave
chase to us with all the sail she could make. We
crowded also as much canvas as our yards would
spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear; but
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would cer-
tainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared
to fight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rover
eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up
with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart
our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he
intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on
that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire,
and pouring in also his small shot, from near two
hundred men which he had on board. However,
we had not a man touched, all our men keeping
close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to
defend ourselves; but laying us on board the next
time upon our other quarter, he entered sixty men
upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and
hacking the decks and rigging. We plied them with
small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like,
and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to
cut short this melancholy part of our story, our ship
being disabled, and three of our men killed and
eight wounded, we were obliged to yield; and were
carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to
the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended; nor was I carried up the coun-
try, to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover, as
his proper prize, and made his slave, being young
and nimble, and fit for his business. At this surpris-
ing change of my circumstances, from a merchant to
a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and
now I looked back upon my father's prophetic dis-
course to me, that I should be miserable, and have
none to relieve me; which I thought was now so
effectually brought to pass, that I could not be worse;
that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me,
and I was undone without redemption. But, alas!
this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through,
as will appear in the sequel of this story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would be some time or other his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-of-war; and
that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope
=3
of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to sea,
he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and
do the common drudgery of slaves about his house;
and when he came home again from his cruise, he
ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and
what method I might take to effect it; but found no
way that had the least probability in it. Nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational; for
I had nobody to communicate it to that would
embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman there, but myself; so that
for two years, though I often pleased myself with
the imagination, yet I never had the least encourag-
ing prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance pre-
sented itself, which put the old thought of making
some attempt for my liberty again in my head: my
patron lying at home longer than usual, without
fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want
of money, he used constantly, once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take
the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing;
and as he always took me and a young Moresco with
him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and
I proved very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch,
that sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one
of his kinsmen, and the youth, the Moresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.
It happened one time, that going a-fishing with
him in a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though we were not half a league from the shore, we
lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither, or
which way, we laboured all day, and all the next
night; and when the morning came, we found we had
pulled off to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore;
and that we were at least two leagues from the land:
however, we got well in again, though with a great
deal of labour, and some danger; for the wind began
to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but, particularly,
we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved
to take more care of himself for the future; and
having lying by him the long-boat of our English
ship which he had taken, he resolved he would not
go a-fishing any more without a compass and some
provision; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who also was an English slave, to build a little state-
room, or cabin, in the middle of the longboat, like
that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to
steer, and haul home the main-sheet; and room be-
fore for a hand or two to stand and work the sails.
She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton
sail; and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin,
which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for
him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on,
with some small lockers to put in some bottles of
such liquor as he thought fit to drink; particularly
his bread, rice, and coffee.
We were frequently out with this boat a-fishing;
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened one day,
that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either
for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of
some distinction, and for whom he had provided
extraordinarily; and had therefore sent on board the
boat over night a larger store of provisions than
usual; and had ordered me to get ready three fusils
with powder and shot, which were on board his ship;
for that they designed some sport of fowling, as well
as fishing.
I got all things ready, as he had directed; and
waited the next morning with the boat washed clean,
her ancient and pendants out, and everything to
accommodate his guests; when by and by my patron
came on board alone, and told me his guests had put
off going, upon some business that fell out; and
ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go
out with the boat, and catch them some fish, for that
his friends were to sup at his house; he commanded
me too, that as soon as I had got some fish, I should
bring it home to his house; all which I prepared to
do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts: for now I found I was like
to have a little ship at my command; and my master
being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for
fishing business, but for a voyage; though I knew
not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I
would steer; for anywhere to get out of that place
was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our sub-
sistence on board; for I told him we must not pre-
sume to eat of our patron's bread; he said, that was
true: so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit
of their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the
boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles
stood, which, it was evident by the make, were taken
26
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into
the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they had
been there before for our master: I conveyed also
a great lump of bees'-wax into the boat, which
weighed above half a hundred weight, with a parcel
of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer,
all which were of great use to us afterwards, espe-
cially the wax to make candles. Another trick I
tried upon him, which he innocently came into
also; his name was Ismael, whom they call Muly
or Moley; so I called to him: "Moley," said I, "our
patron's guns are on board the boat; can you not
get a little powder and shot? it may be we may kill
some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves,
for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."
—"Yes," says he, "I'll bring some;" and accord-
ingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held
about a pound and a half of powder, or rather more;
and another with shot, that had five or six pounds,
with some bullets, and put all into the boat; at
the same time I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one
of the large bottles in the case, which was almost
empty, pouring what was in it into another; and thus
furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of
the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance
of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice
of us: and we were not above a mile out of the port
before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish.
The wind blew from the north-north-east, which was
contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly,
I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain,
and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my
27
resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would
be gone from that horrid place where I was, and
leave the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time and catched nothing,
for when I had fish on my hook I would not pull
them up, that he might not see them, I said to the
Moor, " This will not do; our master will not be thus
served; we must stand farther off." He, thinking no
harm, agreed, and being in the head of the boat, set
the sails; and as I had the helm, I run the boat out
near a league farther, and then brought her to as if I
would fish; when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped
forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I
stooped for something behind him, I took him by
surprise with my arm under his twist, and tossed him
clear overboard into the sea; he rose immediately, for
he swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to
be taken in, told me he would go all over the world
with me. He swam so strong after the boat, that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being but
little wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and
fetching one of the fowling pieces, I presented it at
him, and told him, I had done him no hurt, and if he
would be quiet I would do him none: "But," said I,
"you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and the
sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore and
I will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat,
I'll shoot you through the head, for I am resolved to
have my liberty:" so he turned himself about, and
swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he
reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was
no venturing to trust him. When he was gone, I
turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said
to him, "Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll make
you a great man; but if you will not stroke your face
to be true to me," that is, swear by Mahomet and his
father's beard, "I must throw you into the sea too."
Theboy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that
I could not mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to
me, and go all over the world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me
gone towards the Straits' mouth, as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been supposed
to do; for who would have supposed we were sailed
on to the southward to the truly Barbarian coast
where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround
us with their canoes, and destroy us; where we could
never once go on shore, but we should be devoured
by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human
kind?
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending my course a little toward the east,
that I might keep in with the shore; and having a
fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I
made such sail, that I believe by the next day at
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the
land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of
Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts,
for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
29
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, or
come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till I
had sailed in that manner five days; and then the
wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that
if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also
would now give over; so I ventured to make to the
coast, and come to an anchor in the mouth of a little
river, I knew not what, or where; neither what lati-
tude, what country, what nation, or what river: I
neither saw, nor desired to see, any people; the prin-
cipal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore
as soon as it was dark, and discover the country; but
as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the poor
boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not
to go on shore till day. "Well, Xury," said I, "then
I won't; but it may be we may see men by day, who
will be as bad to us as those lions."—" Then we give
them the shoot gun," says Xury, laughing, "make
them run wey." Such English Xury spoke by
conversing among us slaves. However, I was glad
to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram
(out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him up.
After all, Xury's advice was good, and I took it; we
dropped our little anchor, and lay still all night; I
say still, for we slept none; for in two or three hours
we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to
call them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore,
and run into the water, wallowing and washing them-
selves for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and
they made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was
I too: but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming
towards our boat; we could not see him, but we
might hear him by his blowing, to be a monstrous,
huge, and furious beast; Xury said it was a lion,
and it might be so for aught I know. Poor Xury
cried to me to weigh the anchor, and row away.
"No," says I, "Xury, we can slip our cable with a
buoy to it, and go to sea; they cannot follow us far."
I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature
(whatever it was) within two oars' length, which
something surprised me; however I immediately
stepped to the cabin-door, and taking up my gun,
fired at him; upon which he immediately turned
about, and swam to the shore again.
But it was not possible to describe the horrible
noises and hideous cries and howlings, that were
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore, as higher
within the country, upon the noise or report of a
gun; a thing I have some reason to believe those
creatures had never heard before. This convinced
me that there was no going on shore for us in the
night upon that coast; and how to venture on shore
in the day, was another question too; for to have
fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been
as bad as to have fallen into the paws of lions and
tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the
danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on
shore somewhere or other for water, for we had not
31
a pint left in the boat; when or where to get to it
was the point: Xury said, if I would let him go on
shore with one of the jars, he would find if there
was any water, and bring some to me. I asked him
why he would go? why I should not go, and he stay
in the boat? The boy answered with so much affec-
tion, that made me love him ever after. Says he,
"If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey."
"Well, Xury," said I, "we will both go, and if the
wild mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat
neither of us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk-
bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of
bottles, which I mentioned before; and we hauled
the boat in as near the shore as we thought was
proper, and waded on shore; carrying nothing but
our arms, and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fear-
ing the coming of canoes with savages down the
river: but the boy, seeing a low piece about a mile
up the country, rambled to it; and by and by I saw
him come running towards me. I thought he was
pursued by some savage, or frighted with some wild
beast, and I run forward towards him to help him;
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something
hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature
that he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour,
and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it,
and it was very good meat; but the great joy that
poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found
good water, and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take
such pains for water, for a little higher up the creek
where we were, we found the water fresh when the
tide was out, which flows but a little way up; so we
filled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed,
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no foot-
steps of any human creature in that part of the
country.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I
knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and
the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off from
the coast. But I had no instruments to take an
observation to know what latitude we were in, and
did not exactly know, or at least not remember, what
latitude they were in, and knew not where to look
for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them;
otherwise I might now easily have found some of
these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood
along this coast till I came to that part where the
English traded, I should find some of their vessels
upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve
and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where I
now was must be that country, which, lying between
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Ne-
groes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except by wild
beasts; the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone
farther south for fear of the Moors; and the Moors
not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its
barrenness; and indeed both forsaking it because of
the prodigious number of tigers, lions, leopards, and
other furious creatures which harbour there; so that
the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they
go like an army, two or three thousand men at a
time; and indeed for near a hundred miles together
upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste unin-
33
habited country by day, and heard nothing but
howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw
the Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the
mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a great
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but having tried twice, I was forced in again by con-
trary winds, the sea also going too high for my little
vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and
keep along the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water,
after we had left this place; and once in particular,
being early in the morning, we came to an anchor
under a little point of land which was pretty high;
and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him
than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells
me that we had best go farther off the shore; "For,"
says he, "look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the
side of that hillock fast asleep." I looked where he
pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it
was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the
shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that
hung as it were a little over him. "Xury," says I,
"you shall go on shore and kill him." Xury looked
frighted, and said, "Me kill! he eat me at one
mouth ;" one mouthful he meant: however, I said
no more to the boy, but bade him lie still, and I took
our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and
loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with
two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another
gun with two bullets; and the third, for we had
three pieces, I loaded with five smaller bullets. I
VOL. I. C
took the best aim I could with the first piece to have
shot him into the head, but he lay so with his leg
raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his
leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He started
up, growling at first, but finding his leg broke, fell
down again, and then got up upon three legs, and
gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I
was a little surprised that I had not hit him on the
head; however, I took up the second piece immedi-
ately, and though he began to move off, fired again,
and shot him into the head, and had the pleasure to
see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie
struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and
would have me let him go on shore; "Well, go,"
said I; so the boy jumped into the water, and taking
a little gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other
hand, and coming close to the creature, put the
muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him into
the head again, which despatched him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food;
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing
to us. However, Xury said he would have some of
him; so he comes on board, and asked me to give
him the hatchet. "For what, Xury?" said I. "Me
cut off his head," said he. However, Xury could
not cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and
brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great
one.
I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin
of him might one way or other be of some value to
us; and I resolved to take off his skin, if I could. So
Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was
33
much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill
how to do it. Indeed, it took us both up the whole
day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and,
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effec-
tually dried it in two days time, and it afterwards
served me to lie upon.
CHAPTER III.
MAKE FOR THE SOUTHWARD IN HOPES OF MEETING WITH SOME EUROPEAN VESSEL SEE SAVAGES ALONG SHORESHOOT A LARGE LEOPARD—AM TAKEN UP BY A MERCHANTMAN—ARRIVE AT THE BRAZILS, AND BUY
A SETTLEMENT THERE CANNOT BE QUIET, BUT
SAIL ON A VOYAGE OF ADVENTURE TO GUINEA—SHIP STRIKES ON A SAND-BANK IN UNKNOWN LAND—ALL LOST BUT MYSELF, WHO AM DRIVEN ASHORE, HALF
DEAD.
AFTER this stop, we made on to the southward con-
tinually for ten or twelve days, living very sparing on
our provisions, which began to abate very much, and
going no oftener into the shore than we were obliged
to for fresh water: my design in this was, to make
the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, anywhere
about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to
meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I
knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for
the islands, or perish there among the negroes. I
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this Cape, or those islands; and,
in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some ship,
or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten
days longer, as I have said, I began to see that the
land was inhabited; and in two or three places, as
we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to
look at us; we could also perceive they were quite
black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to have
gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better
counsellor, and said to me, "No go, no go." How-
ever, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk
to them, and I found they run along the shore by me
a good way: I observed they had no weapons in
their hands, except one, who had a long slender stick,
which Xury said was a lance, and that they would
throw them a great way with good aim; so I kept at
a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I
could; and particularly made signs for something to
eat; they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they
would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the
top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up
into the country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh
and some corn, such as is the produce of their country;
but we neither knew what the one nor the other was;
however, we were willing to accept it, but how to
come at it was our next dispute, for I was not for
venturing on shore to them, and they were as much
afraid of us: but they took a safe way for us all, for
they brought it to the shore, and laid it down, and
37
went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on
board, and then came close to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity
offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully •
for while we were lying by the shore, came two
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took
it) with great fury from the mountains towards the
sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female, or
whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not
tell, any more than we could tell whether it was usual
or strange, but I believe it was the latter; because,
in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom
appear but in the night; and, in the second place, we
found the people terribly frighted, especially the
women. The man that had the lance, or dart, did
not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the
two creatures ran directly into the water, they did
not seem to offer to fall upon any of the negroes, but
plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about as
if they had come for their diversion. At last one of
them began to come nearer our boat than at first I
expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury
load both the others; as soon as he came fairly with-
in my reach I fired, and shot him directly into the
head; immediately he sunk down into the water, but
rose instantly, and plunged up and down as if he was
struggling for life; and so indeed he was: he imme-
diately made to the shore; but between the wound,
which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the
water, he died just before he reached the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of
38
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
these poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my
gun; some of them were even ready to die for fear,
and fell down as dead with the very terror. But
when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to the
shore, they took heart, and came to the shore, and
began to search for the creature. I found him by
his blood staining the water, and by the help of a
rope, which I slung round him, and gave the negroes
to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that
it was a most curious leopard, spotted and fine to an
admirable degree, and the negroes held up their
hands with admiration to think what it was I had
killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran
up directly to the mountains from whence they came,
nor could I at that distance know what it was. I
found quickly the negroes were for eating the flesh
of this creature, so I was willing to have them take
it as a favour from me, which, when I made signs
to them that they might take him, they were very
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with
him, and though they had no knife, yet with a shar-
pened piece of wood they took off his skin as readily,
and much more readily, than we could have done
with a knife. They offered me some of the flesh,
which I declined, making as if I would give it them,
but made signs for the skin, which they gave me
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of
their provision, which, though I did not understand,
yet I accepted; then I made signs to them for some
water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning
it bottom upward, to show that it was empty, and
that I wanted to have it filled. They called imme-
diately to some of their friends, and there came two
women, and brought a great vessel made of earth,
and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun; this they set
down for me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore
with my jars, and filled them all three. The women
were as stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as
it was, and water; and leaving my friendly negroes,
I made forward for about eleven days more, without
offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run
out a great length into the sea, at about the distance
of four or five leagues before me; and the sea being
very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point:
at length, doubling the point at about two leagues
from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side
to sea-ward; then I concluded, as it was most certain
indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those
the islands, called from thence Cape de Verd Islands.
However, they were at a great distance, and I could
not well tell what I had best to do; for if I should be
taken with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach one
nor the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped
into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the
helm, when on a sudden the boy cried out, "Master,
master, a ship with a sail!" and the foolish boy was
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when
I knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach.
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw not
only the ship, but what she was, viz., that it was a
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to
the coast of Guinea for negroes. But when I
observed the course she steered, I was soon con-
vinced they were bound some other way, and did
not design to come any nearer to the shore; upon
which I stretched out to sea as much as I could,
resolving to speak with them, if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they
would be gone by before I could make any signal
to them: but, after I had crowded to the utmost,
and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the
help of their perspective-glasses, and that it was some
European boat, which, as they supposed, must belong
to some ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to
let me come up. I was encouraged with this; and
as I had my patron's ancient on board, I made a
waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and fired
a gun, both which they saw, for they told me they
saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun;
upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and
lay by for me, and in about three hours' time I came
up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French; but I understood none of
them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was
an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of
slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, as any one
would believe, that I was thus delivered, as I
41
esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost hope-
less condition as I was in, and immediately offered
all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return for
my deliverance; but he generously told me, he would
take nothing from me, but that all I had should be
delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils;
"for," says he, "I have saved your life on no other
terms than I would be glad to be saved myself; and
it may one time or other be my lot to be taken up
in the same condition; besides," said he, "when I
carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your
own country, if I should take from you what you
have, you will be starved there, and then I only
take away that life I have given. No, no, Seignor
Inglese," says he, "Mr. Englishman, I will carry you
thither in charity, and those things will help you to
buy your subsistence there, and your passage home
again."
As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered
the seamen, that none should offer to touch anything
I had: then he took everything into his own pos-
session, and gave me back an exact inventory of
them, that I might have them; even so much as my
three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the
ship's use, and asked me what I would have for it?
I told him, he had been so generous to me in every-
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of
the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which he
told me, he would give me a note of his hand to pay
me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when
42
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
it came there, if any one offered to give more, he
would make it up: he offered me also sixty pieces of
eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loath to
take; not that I was not willing to let the captain
have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring
my own. However, when I let him know my reason,
he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium,
that he would give the boy an obligation to set him
free in ten years, if he turned Christian. Upon this,
and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let
the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints'
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I
was once more delivered from the most miserable
of all conditions of life; and what to do next with
myself, I was now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I
can never enough remember; he would take nothing
of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the
leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin which I
had in my boat, and caused everything I had in the
ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was
willing to sell he bought, such as the case of bottles,
two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees'
wax, for I had made candles of the rest; in a word,
I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight
of all my cargo; and with this stock I went on shore
in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended
to the house of a good honest man like himself, who
had an ingeino, as they call it; that is, a plantation
43
and a sugar-house; I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner of
their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how
well the planters lived, and how they grew rich
suddenly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle
there, I would turn planter among them; resolving,
in the meantime, to find out some way to get my
money, which I had left in London, remitted to me.
To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of natural-
isation, I purchased as much land that was uncured
as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my
plantation and settlement, and such a one as might
be suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself
to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born
of English parents, whose name was Wells, and in
much such circumstances as I was. I call him neigh-
bour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and
we went on very sociable together. My stock was
but low, as well as his; and we rather planted for
food, than anything else, for about two years. How-
ever, we began to increase, and our land began to
come into order; so that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of
ground ready for planting canes in the year to come;
but we both wanted help; and now I found, more
than before, I had done wrong in parting with my
boy Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did
right, was no great wonder: I had no remedy but
to go on; I was gotten into an employment quite
remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life
I delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's
house, and broke through all his good advice; nay,
I was coming into the very middle station, or upper
degree of low life, which my father advised me to
before; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I
might as well have stayed at home, and never have
fatigued myself in the world as I had done; and I
used often to say to myself, I could have done this
as well in England among my friends, as have gone
five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and
savages in a wilderness, and at such distance, as never
to hear from any part of the world that had the least
knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbour; no work to
be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some
desolate island, that had nobody there but himself.
But how just has it been, and how should all men re-
flect that, when they compare their present conditions
with others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them
to make the exchange, and be convinced of their
former felicity by their experience; I say, how just
has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on
in an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who
had so often unjustly compared it with the life which
I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all
probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich.
I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend, the
captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went back;
for the ship remained there, in providing his loading,
and preparing for his voyage, near three months; when,
45
telling him what little stock I had left behind me in
London, he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:
"Seignor Inglese," says he, for so he always called
me, " if you will give me letters, and a procuration
here in form to me, with orders to the person who
has your money in London, to send your effects to
Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such
goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you
the produce of them, God willing, at my return; but
since human affairs are all subject to changes and
disasters, I would have you give orders but for one
hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your
stock, and let the hazard be run for the first; so that
if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way;
and if it miscarry, you may have the other half to
have recourse to for your supply."
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the
best course I could take; so I accordingly prepared
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain,
as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account
of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I
had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the human-
ity of his behaviour, and what condition I was now
in, with all other necessary directions for my supply;
and when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he
found means, by some of the English merchants there,
to send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story, to a merchant at London, who represented
it effectually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered
the money, but out of her own pocket, sent the
Portugal captain a very handsome present for his
humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in English goods, such as the captain had
writ for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he
brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among
which, without my direction (for I was too young in
my business to think of them), he had taken care to
have all sort of tools, iron-work, and utensils neces-
sary for my plantation, and which were of great use
to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprised with joy of it; and my
good steward, the captain, had laid out the five
pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present
for himself, to purchase, and bring me over a servant
under bond for six years' service, and would not
accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco,
which I would have him accept, being of my own
produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize,
and things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means to sell them to a very great
advantage; so that I may say, I had more than four
times the value of my first cargo, and was now
infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the
advancement of my plantation; for the first thing I
did, I bought me a negro slave, and an European
servant also; I mean another besides that which the
captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with
47
me. I went on the next year with great success in
my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco
on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty
rolls, being each of above a hundred weight, were
well cured and laid by against the return of the fleet
from Lisbon. And now, increasing in business and
in wealth, my head began to be full of projects and
undertakings beyond my reach; such as are indeed
often the ruin of the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen
me, for which my father so earnestly recommended
a quiet retired life, and of which he had so sensibly
described the middle station of life to be full; but
other things attended me, and I was still to be the
wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly
to increase my fault, and double the reflections upon
myself, which in my future sorrows I should have
leisure to make; all these miscarriages were pro-
cured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my
foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing
that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views
of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of
those prospects and those measures of life which
nature and providence concurred to present me with,
and to make my duty.
As I had done thus in my breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must
go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich
and thriving man in my new plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I
48
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps
could be consistent with life and a state of health in
the world.
To come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars
of this part of my story; you may suppose, that
having now lived almost four years in the Brazils, and
beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my
plantation, I had not only learnt the language, but
had contracted acquaintance and friendship among
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants
at St. Salvadore, which was our port; and that in
my discourse among them, I had frequently given
them an account of my two voyages to the coast of
Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the
coast, for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives, scissors,
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold-
dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c., but negroes
for the service of the Brazils in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only not far entered into, but,
as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal,
and engrossed in the public, so that few negroes
were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company with some mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of those things very earnestly, three of them came
to me the next morning, and told me they had been
musing very much upon what I had discoursed with
49
them of the last night, and they came to make a
secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me secrecy,
they told me, that they had a mind to fit out a
ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations
as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much
as servants; that as it was, a trade could not be
carried on, because they could not publicly sell the
negroes when they came home, so they desired to
make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore
privately, and divide them among their own planta-
tions; and, in a word, the question was, whether I
would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage
the trading part upon the coast of Guinea? and they
offered me, that I should have my equal share of the
negroes, without providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had
it been made to any one that had not had a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,
and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that
was thus entered and established, and had nothing
to do but go on as I had begun, for three or four
years more, and to have sent for the other hundred
pounds from England, and who in that time, and
with that little addition, could scarce have failed of
being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling,
and that increasing too; for me to think of such a
voyage, was the most preposterous thing that ever
man in such circumstances could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist the offer, than I could restrain
my first rambling designs, when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them
VOL. I. P
I would go with all my heart, if they would under-
take to look after my plantation in my absence, and
would dispose of it to such as I should direct if I
miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered
into writings or covenants to do so; and I made a
formal will, disposing of my plantation and effects,
in case of my death, making the captain of the ship,
that had saved my life as before, my universal heir,
but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had
directed in my will, one half of the produce being to
himself, and the other to be shipped to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve
my effects, and keep up my plantation; had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own
interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought
to have done, and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking,
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum-
stance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended
with all its common hazards; to say nothing of the
reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes to
myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason: and
accordingly the ship being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour again, the 1st of September 1659, being
the same day eight years that I went from my father
and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about one hundred and twenty ton
burden, carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides
the master, his boy, and myself; we had on board no
large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were
fit for our trade with the negroes, such as beads,
bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially little
looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the
like.
The same day I went on board we set sail, stand-
ing away to the northward upon our own coast, with
design to stretch over for the African coast; when
they came about 10 or 12 degrees of northern lati-
tude, which it seems was the manner of their course
in those days. We had very good weather, only
excessive hot, all the way upon our own coast, till
we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino, from
whence keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of
land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle
Fernand de Noronha, holding our course north-east
by north, and leaving those isles on the east. In
this course we passed the line in about twelve days'
time, and were by our last observation in 7 degrees 22
minutes, northern latitude, when a violent tornado,
or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge:
it began from the south-east, came about to the north-
west, and then settled into the north-east; from
whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for
twelve days together we could do nothing but drive;
and scudding away before it, let it carry us whither
ever fate and the fury of the winds directed; and
during these twelve days, I need not say that I ex-
pected every day to be swallowed up, nor indeed did
any in the ship expect to save their lives.
In this distress we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and one
man and the boy washed overboard. About the
twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master
made an observation as well as he could, and found
that he was in about 11 degrees north latitude, but
that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference west
from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was
gotten upon the coast of Guinea, or the north part of
Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward that of the
river Oroonoque, commonly called the Great River,
and began to consult with me what course he should
take; for the ship was leaky, and very much dis-
abled, and he was going directly back to the coast
of Brazil.
I was positively against that, and looking over the
charts of the sea-coasts of America with him, we
concluded there was no inhabited country for us to
have recourse to, till we came within the circle of the
Caribbee islands; and therefore resolved to stand
away for Barbadoes, which, by keeping off at sea, to
avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we
might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen
days' sail; whereas we could not possibly make our
voyage to the coast of Africa without some assist-
ance, both to our ship and to ourselves.
With this design we changed our course, and
steered away N.W. by W. in order to reach some of
our English islands, where I hoped for relief; but
our voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in
the latitude of 12 degrees 18 minutes a second storm
came upon us, which carried us away with the same
impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very
way of all human commerce, that, had all our lives
been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of
53
being devoured by savages than ever returning to our
own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men, early in the morning, cried out, Land!
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look
out in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a
moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke
over her in such a manner that we expected we should
all have perished immediately; and we were imme-
diately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us
from the very foam and spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one who has not been in the
like condition, to describe or conceive the consterna-
tion of men in such circumstances: we knew nothing
where we were, or upon what land it was we were
driven, whether an island or the main, whether inha-
bited or not inhabited; and as the rage of the wind
was still great, though rather less than at first, we
could not so much as hope to have the ship hold
many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the
winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately
about. In a word, we sat looking one upon another,
and expecting death every moment, and every man
acting accordingly, as preparing for another world;
for there was little or nothing more for us to do in
this: that which was our present comfort, and all the
comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expecta-
tion, the ship did not break yet, and that the master
said the wind began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand,
and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off,
we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had
nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well
as we could. We had a boat at our stern, just before
the storm; but she was first staved by dashing against
the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke
away, and either sunk or was driven off to sea; so
there was no hope from her. We had another boat
on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a
doubtful thing; however, there was no room to de-
bate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces
every minute, and some told us she was actually
broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of
the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men,
they got her slung over the ship's side, and getting all
into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven
in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea; for
though the storm was abated considerably, yet the
sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and might
well be called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea
in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we
all saw plainly that the sea went so high that the
boat could not live, and that we should be inevitably
drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, if we
had, could we have done anything with it; so we
worked at the oar towards the land, though with
heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all
knew that, when the boat came nearer the shore, she
would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach
of the sea. However, we committed our souls to God
in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us
towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with
55
our own hands, pulling as well as we could towards
land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation
was, if we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the
mouth of some river, where, by great chance, we might
have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the land,
and perhaps made smooth water. But there was
nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer
and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful
than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly
bade us expect the coup degrace. In a word, it took
us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at once;
and separating us as well from the boat, as from
one another, gave us not time hardly to say, O God!
for we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the water; for though
I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself
from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave
having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way
on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but
half dead with the water I took in. I had so much
presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing
myself nearer the main land than I expected, I got
upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards
the land as fast as I could, before another wave
should return, and take me up again. But I soon
found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea
come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious
as an enemy, which I had no means or strength to
contend with; my business was to hold my breath,
and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so,
by swimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot
myself towards the shore, if possible; my greatest
concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry
me a great way towards the shore when it came on,
might not carry me back again with it when it gave
back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me
at once twenty or thirty foot deep in its own body;
and I could feel myself carried with a mighty force
and swiftness towards the shore a very great way;
but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim
still forward with all my might. I was ready to
burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt my-
self rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found
my head and hands shoot out above the surface of
the water; and though it was not two seconds of
time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me
greatly, gave me breath, and new courage. I was
covered again with water a good while, but not so
long but I held it out; and finding the water had
spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to
recover breath, and till the water went from me,
and then took to my heels, and run with what
strength I had farther towards the shore. But
neither would this deliver me from the fury of the
sea, which came pouring in after me again; and
57
twice more I was lifted up by the waves, and carried
forward as before, the shore being very flat.
The last time of these two had well near been fatal
to me; for the sea having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or rather dashed me against a piece of
a rock, and that with such force, as it left me sense-
less, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance;
for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the
breath as it were quite out of my body; and had
it returned again immediately, I must have been
strangled in the water; but I recovered a little
before the return of the waves, and seeing I should
be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold
fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath,
if possible, till the wave went back. Now, as the
waves were not so high as at first, being near land, I
held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched
another run, which brought me so near the shore,
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did
not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the
next run I took I got to the main land, where, to
my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the
shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from
danger and quite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began
to look up and thank God that my life was saved in
a case wherein there was, some minutes before,
scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible
to express to the life what the ecstacies and trans-
ports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may
say, out of the very grave; and I do not wonder,
now, at that custom, viz., that when a malefactor,
who has the halter about his neck, is tied up, and
just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve
brought to him: I say, I do not wonder that they
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very
moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may
not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and
overwhelm him:
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe; re-
flecting upon all my comrades that were drowned,
and that there should not be one soul saved but
myself; for, as for them, I never saw them after-
wards, or any signs of them, except three of their
hats, one cap, and two shoes, that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could
hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord!
how was it possible I could get on shore!
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to
see what kind of place I was in, and what was next
to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate,
and that in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance:
for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any-
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither
did I see any prospect before me, but that of perish-
ing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts;
and that, which was particularly afflicting to me, was,
that I had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any
creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against
59
any other creature that might desire to kill me for
theirs: in a word, I had nothing about me but a
knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box;
this was all my provision, and this threw me into
terrible agonies of mind, that, for awhile, I ran about
like a madman. Night coming upon me I began,
with a heavy heart, to consider what would be my
lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country,
seeing at night they always come abroad for their
prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at
that time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like
a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I
resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day
what death I should die, for, as yet, I saw no pro-
spect of life. I walked about a furlong from the
shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink,
which I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and
put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger,
I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endea-
voured to place myself so as that if I should sleep I
might not fall; and having cut me a short stick, like
a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging,
and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast
asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few
could have done in my condition, and found myself
the most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on
such an occasion.
CHAPTER IV.
APPEARANCE OF THE WRECK AND COUNTRY NEXT DAY—
SWIM ON BOARD OF THE SHIP, AND, BY MEANS OF A
CONTRIVANCE, GET A QUANTITY OF STORES ON SHORE —SHOOT A BIRD, BUT IT TURNS OUT PERFECT CAR-
RION—MORALISE UPON MY SITUATION—THE SHIP BLOWN OFF LAND, AND TOTALLY LOST—SET OUT IN SEARCH OF A PROPER PLACE FOR A HABITATION SEE NUMBERS OF GOATS MELANCHOLY REFLECTIONS.
WHEN I waked it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage
and swell as before: but that which surprised me
most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night
from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of the
tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock
which I first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by the dashing me against it; this being within about
a mile from the shore where I was, and the ship
seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on
board, that at least I might save some necessary
things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I looked about me again, and the first thing I
found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the
sea had tossed her up upon the land, about two miles
on my right hand. I walked as far as I could upon
the shore to have got to her, but found a neck, or
inlet of water, between me and the boat, which was
about half a mile broad; so I came back for the pre-
sent, being more intent upon getting at the ship,
61
where I hoped to find something for my present
subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within
a quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I found a
fresh renewing of my grief: for I saw evidently, that
if we had kept on board, we had been all safe, that is
to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of
all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced
tears from my eyes again; but as there was little
relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the
ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was
hot to extremity, and took the water; but when I
came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to
know how to get on board; for as she lay aground,
and high out of the water, there was nothing within
my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice,
and the second time I spied a small piece of a rope,
which I wondered I did not see at first, hang down
by the fore-chains so low as that with great difficulty
I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope, got up
into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that
the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water
in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank
of hard sand, or rather earth, and her stern lay lifted
up upon the bank, and her head low almost to the
water: by this means all her quarter was free, and all
that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure
my first work was to search and to see what was
spoiled, and what was free : and first I found that all
the ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the
water; and being very well disposed to eat, I went
to the bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit,
and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no
time to lose. I also found some rum in the great
cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I
had indeed need enough of to spirit me for what was
before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to
furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was
not to be had; and this extremity roused my appli-
cation. We had several spare yards, and two or three
large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in
the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and
flung as many of them overboard as I could manage
of their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they
might not drive away. When this was done I went
down to the ship's side, and, pulling them to me, I
tied four of them fast together at both ends as well
as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or
three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I
found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was
not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being
too light; so I went to work, and with the carpen-
ter's saw, I cut a spare topmast into three lengths,
and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour
and pains; but hope of furnishing myself with neces-
saries encouraged me to go beyond what I should
have been able to have done upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any rea-
sonable weight; my next care was what to load it
with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from
the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering
this; I first laid all the planks or boards upon it
63
that I could get, and having considered well what I
most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered
them down upon my raft. The first of these I filled
with provisions, viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
five pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much
upon, and a little remainder of European corn, which
had been laid by for some fowls which we brought
to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. There had
been some barley and wheat together, but, to my
great disappointment, I found afterwards that the
rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I
found several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and in all
above five or six gallons of rack: these I stowed by
themselves, there being no need to put them into the
chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing
this, I found the tide began to flow, though very calm,
and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and
waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon the sand,
swim away; as for my breeches, which were only
linen, and open knee'd, I swam on board in them
and my stockings: however, this put me upon rum-
maging for clothes, of which I found enough, but
took no more than I wanted for present use, for I
had other things which my eye was more upon; as,
first, tools to work with on shore; and it was after
long searching that I found out the carpenter's chest,
which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much
more valuable than a ship-loading of gold would have
been at that time: I got it down to my raft, even
whole as it was, without losing time to look into it,
for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the
great cabin, and two pistols: these I secured first,
with some powder-horns, and a small bag of shot,
and two old rusty swords. I knew there were three
barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them; but with much search
I found them, two of them dry and good, the third
had taken water; those two I got to my raft, with
the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well
freighted, and began to think how I should get to
shore with them, having neither sail, oar, or rudder,
and the least capful of wind would have overset all
my navigation.
I had three encouragements: 1. A smooth, calm
sea; 2. The tide rising and setting in to the shore;
3. What little wind there was blew me towards the
land: and thus, having found two or three broken
oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools
which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe,
and a hammer; and with this cargo I put to sea:
for a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well,
only that I found it drive a little distant from the
place where I had landed before; by which I per-
ceived that there was some indraft of the water,
and consequently I hoped to find some creek or river
there, which I might make use of as a port to get
to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before
me a little opening of the land, and I found a strong
current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as
well as I could to keep in the middle of the stream;
but here I had liked to have suffered a second ship-
6S
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broke my heart; for, knowing nothing of the coast,
my raft run aground at one end of it upon a shoal,
and not being aground at the other end, it wanted
but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards
that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water.
I did my utmost, by setting my back against the
chests, to keep them in their places, but could not
thrust off the raft with all my strength; neither durst
I stir from the posture I was in, but, holding up the
chests with all my might, stood in that manner near
half an hour, in which time the rising of the water
brought me a little more upon a level; and, a little
after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, and
I thrust her off with the oar I had, into the channel;
and then, driving up higher, I at length found myself
in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides,
and a strong current, or tide, running up. I looked
on both sides for a proper place to get on shore; for
I was not willing to be driven too high up the river,
hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and there-
fore resolved to place myself as near the coast as I
could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty,
I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that,
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her
directly in; but here I had liked to have dipped all
my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no
place to land, but where one end of the float, if it
run on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink
lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo
VOL. I. E
again: all that I could do, was to wait till the tide
was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like
an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the shore,
near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the
water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as
I found water enough, for my raft drew about a foot
of water, I thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground,
and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my
two broken oars into the ground; one on one side
near one end, and one on the other side near the other
end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and
left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek
a proper place for my habitation, and where to stow
my goods, to secure them from whatever might
happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on
the continent or on an island, whether inhabited or
not inhabited, whether in danger of wild beasts or
not. There was a hill, not above a mile from me,
which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed
to overtop some other hills which lay as in a ridge
from it northward: I took out one of the fowling-
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder;
and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the
top of that hill; where, after I had with great labour
and difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate to my
great affliction, viz., that I was in an island environed
every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except
some rocks which lay a great way off, and two small
islands less than this, which lay about three leagues
to the west.
I found also, that the island I was in was barren,
and as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited,
67
except by wild beasts, of which, however, I saw none;
yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their
kinds; neither, when I killed them, could I tell what
was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back,
I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree
on the side of a great wood—I believe it was the first
gun that had been fired there since the creation of
the world. I had no sooner fired, but, from all parts
of the wood, there arose an innumerable number of
fowls of many sorts, making a confused screaming,
and crying every one according to his usual note but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As
for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a
hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but had no
talons or claws more than common; its flesh was
carrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day; and what
to do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed
where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the
ground, not knowing but some wild beast might
devour me; though, as I afterwards found, there was
really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of a hut for that night's
lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to
supply myself, except that I had seen two or three
creatures like hares run out of the wood where I shot
the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship, which would be
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging
and sails, and such other things as might come to
land, and I resolved to make another voyage on
board the vessel, if possible; and as I knew that the
first storm that blew must necessarily break her all
in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, till
I got everything out of the ship that I could get.
Then I called a council (that is to say, in my
thoughts) whether I should take back the raft; but
this appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go as
before, when the tide was down, and I did so, only
that I stripped before I went from my hut, having
nothing on but a checked shirt and a pair of linen
trousers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared
a second raft; and having had experience of the
first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it
so hard, but yet I brought away several things very
useful to me; as first, in the carpenter's stores, I
found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a
great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and,
above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone:
all these I secured, together with several things be-
longing to the gunner, particularly two or three iron-
crows, and two barrels of musket-bullets, seven mus-
kets, and another fowling-piece, with some small
quantity of powder more; a large bag full of small
shot, and a great roll of sheet lead; but this last was
so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the
ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes
that I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, hammock,
and some bedding; and with this I loaded my
69
second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to
my very great comfort.
I was under some apprehensions, during my ab-
sence from the land, that at least my provisions
might be devoured on shore; but when I came back,
I found no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature,
like a wild cat, upon one of the chests, which, when
I came towards it, ran away a little distance, and
then stood still; she sat very composed and un-
concerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had
a mind to be acquainted with me; I presented my
gun at her, but as she did not understand it, she was
perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir
away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit,
though, by the way, I was not very free of it, for my
store was not great: however, I spared her a bit, I
say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and
looked as pleased for more; but I thanked her, and
could spare no more; so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore, though I
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
casks, I went to work to make me a little tent, with
the sail and some poles which I cut for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought everything that I knew
would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled all
the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the
tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either
from man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of
the tent with some boards within, and an empty
chest set up on end without, and spreading one of
the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just
at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went
to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all
night, for I was very weary and heavy; as the night
before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard
all day, as well to fetch all those things from the
ship, as to get them on shore.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that
ever were laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was
not satisfied still; for while the ship sat upright in
that posture, I thought I ought to get everything
out of her that I could; so every day, at low water,
I went on board, and brought away something or
other; but particularly the third time I went, I
brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as
also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get,
with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the
sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder:
in a word, I brought away all the sails first and
last, only that I was fain to cut them in pieces,
and bring as much at a time as I could; for they
were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas
only.
But that which comforted me more still, was, that
at last of all, after I had made five or six such
voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more
to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling
with; I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead
of bread, and three large runlets of rum or spirits,
and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this
was surprising to me, because I had given over ex-
pecting any more provisions, except what was spoiled
by the water: I soon emptied the hogshead of that
bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in 'pieces
71
of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got
all this safe on shore also.
The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable and
fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and cutting
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I
got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the
iron-work I could get; and having cut down the
spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and everything
I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those
heavy goods, and came away; but my good luck
began now to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy
and so overladen, that after I had entered the little
cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods, not
being able to guide it so handily as I did the other,
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the
water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I
was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great
part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected
would have been of great use to me: however, when
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable
ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite
labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the water;
a work which fatigued me very much. After this,
I went every day on board, and brought away what
I could get.
I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had
been eleven times on board the ship; in which time
I had brought away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed capable to bring, though I believe
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have
brought away the whole ship, piece by piece: but,
preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found
the wind began to rise; however, at low water I
went on board, and though I thought I had rum-
maged the cabin so effectually, as that nothing more
could be found, yet I discovered a locker with
drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three
razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten
or a dozen of good knives and forks; in another I
found about thirty-six pounds value in money, some
European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight,
some gold, some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. "O
drug!" said I aloud, " what art thou good for? thou
art not worth to me, no, not the taking off of the
ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap;
I have no manner of use for thee; even remain where
thou art, and go to the bottom, as a creature whose
life is not worth saving." However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another
raft; but while I was preparing this, I found the sky
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter
of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It
presently occurred to me that it was in vain to pre-
tend to make a raft with the wind off shore, and that
it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the
shore at all: accordingly, I let myself down into the
water, and swam across the channel which lay between
the ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty
enough, partly with the weight of things I had about
me, and partly the roughness of the water, for the
wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high
water, it blew a storm.

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I
lay with all my wealth about me very secure. It blew
very hard all that night, and in the morning, when I
looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen! I
was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this
satisfactory reflection, viz., that I had lost no time,
nor abated no diligence, to get everything out of her
that could be useful to me, and that indeed there was
little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I
had had more time.
I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or
of anything out of her, except what might drive on
shore from her wreck, as, indeed, divers pieces of her
afterwards did; but those things were of small use to
me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about
securing myself against either savages, if any should
appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island; and
I had many thoughts of the method how to do this,
and what kind of dwelling to make; whether I should
make me a cave in the earth, or a hut upon the earth:
and, in short, I resolved upon both, the manner and
description of which it may not be improper to give
an account of.
I soon found the place I was in was not for my
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low
moorish ground near the sea, and I believed would
not be wholesome, and more particularly because
there was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to find
a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.
I consulted several things in my situation, which I
found would be proper for me: 1st, Health, and fresh
water I just now mentioned. 2dly, Shelter from
the heat of the sun. 3dly, Security from ravenous
creatures, whether man or beast. 4thly, A view
to the sea, that, if God sent any ship in sight, I
might not lose any advantage for my deliverance,
of which I was not willing to banish all my expec-
tation yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards
this little plain was steep as a house-side, so that
nothing could come down upon me from the top: on
the side of this rock there was a hollow place worn a
little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave, but
there was not really any cave or way into the rock at
all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was
not above an hundred yards broad, and about twice
as long, and lay like a green before my door, and
at the end of it descended irregularly every way
down into the low grounds by the sea-side. It was
on the north-north-west side of the hill, so that I was
sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a
west and by south sun, or thereabouts, which in those
countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle
before the hollow place, which took in about ten
yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and
twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning
and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of
the ground about five foot and a half, and sharpened
75
at the top: the two rows did not stand above six
inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship, and laid them in rows one upon another,
within the circle between these two rows of stakes,
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside,
leaning against them, about two foot and a half
high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so
strong, that neither man nor beast could get into
it, or over it: this cost me a great deal of time
and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods,
bring them to the place, and drive them into the
earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not by
a door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top:
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me:
and so I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as
I thought from all the world, and consequently
slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could
not have done, though, as it appeared afterward,
there was no need of all this caution from the
enemies that I apprehended danger from.
Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores, of which you have the account above;
and I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me
from the rains, that in one part of the year are very
violent there, I made double, viz., one smaller tent
within, and one larger tent above it, and covered
the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed
which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged
to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and
everything that would spoil by the wet; and having
thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance,
which till now I had left open, and so passed and
repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way
into the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones
that I dug down, out through my tent, I laid them
up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, that
so it raised the ground within about a foot and a
half; and thus I made a cave just behind my tent,
which served me like a cellar to my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before
all these things were brought to perfection; and
therefore I must go back to some other things,
which took up some of my thoughts. At the same
time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for
the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that
a storm oPrain falling from a thick dark cloud,
a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that
a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of
it. I was not so much surprised with the lightning,
as I was with a thought which darted into my mind
as swift as the lightning itself: O my powder! my
very heart sunk within me, when I thought that
at one blast all my powder might be destroyed;
on which, not my defence only, but the providing
me food, as I thought, entirely depended: I was
nothing near so anxious about my own danger;
though had the powder took fire, I had never known
who had hurt me.
77
Such impression did this make upon me, that,
after the storm was over, I laid aside all my works,
my building, and fortifying, and applied myself to
make bags and boxes to separate the powder, and
to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope
that, whatever might come, it might not all take fire
at once, and to keep it so apart, that it should not
be possible to make one part fire another. I finished
this work in about a fortnight; and I think my
powder, which in all was about two hundred and
forty pounds weight, was divided in not less than a
hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been
wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that, so
I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I
called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down
in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come
to it, marking very carefully where I laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I
went out once at least every day with my gun, as
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any-
thing fit for food, and as near as I could to acquaint
myself with what the island produced. The first
time I went out, I presently discovered that there
were goats in the island, which was a great satis-
faction to me; but then it was attended with this
misfortune to me, viz., that they were so shy, so
subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most dif-
ficult thing in the world to come at them. But I
was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I
might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened;
for, after I had found their haunts a little, I laid
wait in this manner for them: I observed, if they
saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the
rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright;
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
whence I concluded, that, by the position of their
optics, their sight was so directed downward, that
they did not readily see objects that were above them:
so afterward I took this method; I always climbed
the rocks first to get above them, and then had fre-
quently a fair mark. The first shot I made among
these creatures I killed a she-goat, which had a
little kid by her which she gave suck to, which
grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell, the
kid stood stock still by her till I came and took her
up; and not only so, but when I carried the old
one with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed
me quite to my enclosure; upon which I laid down
the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and carried
it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame;
but it would not eat; so I was forced to kill it, and
eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a
great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my pro-
visions (my bread especially) as much as possibly I
could.
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it ab-
solutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire
in, and fuel to burn; and what I did for that, as also
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I
made, I shall give a full account of in its place; but
I must first give some little account of myself, and
of my thoughts about living, which, it may well be
supposed, were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as
I was not cast away upon that island without being
79
driven, as is said, by a violent storm, quite out of
the course of our intended voyage, and a great way,
viz., some hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary
course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason
to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that, in
this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I
should end my life. The tears would run plentifully
down my face when I made these reflections; and
sometimes I would expostulate with myself, why
Providence should thus completely ruin His creatures,
and render them so absolutely miserable, so without
help abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could
hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to
check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and par-
ticularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand
by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the subject
of my present condition, when reason, as it were,
expostulating with me the other way, thus: "Well,
you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but pray
remember, where are the rest of you? Did not you
come eleven of you into the boat? Where are the
ten? Why were they not saved, and you lost?
Why were you singled out? Is it better to be here
or there?" And then I pointed to the sea. All
evils are to be considered with the good that is in
them, and with what worse attended them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
furnished for my subsistence, and what would have
been my case if it had not happened, which was an
hundred thousand to one, that the ship floated from
the place where she first struck, and was driven so
near the shore, that I had time to get all these
things out of her. What would have been my case,
if I had been to have lived in the condition in which
I at first came on shore, without necessaries of life,
or necessaries to supply and procure them ?" par-
ticularly," said I (loud, though to myself), "what
should I have done without a gun, without ammuni-
tion, without any tools to make anything, or to work
with; without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner
of covering?" and that now I had all these to a
sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
myself in such a manner, as to live without my gun
when my ammunition was spent; so that I had a
tolerable view of subsisting, without any want, as
long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning,
how I should provide for the accidents that might
happen, and for the time that was to come, even not
only after my ammunition should be spent, but even
after my health or strength should decay.
I confess I had not entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean
my powder being blown up by lightning; and this
made the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it
lightened and thundered, as I observed just now.
And now, being about to enter into a melancholy
relation of a scene of silent life, such perhaps as was
never heard of in the world before, I shall take it
from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It
was, by my account, the 3Oth of September, when,
in the manner as above said, I first set foot upon
this horrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its
autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head;
for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the
latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north of the Line.
81
After I had been there about ten or twelve days it came into my thoughts, that I should lose my
reckoning of time for want of books and pen and
ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from
the working days; but, to prevent this, I cut it with
my knife upon a large post, in capital letters, and
making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore
where I first landed, viz., "I came on shore here on
the 30th of September 1659." Upon the sides of
this square post, I cut every day a notch with my
knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as
the rest, and every first day of the month as long
again as that long one; and thus I kept my calendar,
or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place, we are to observe, that among
the many things which I brought out of the ship in
the several voyages which, as above-mentioned, I
made to it, I got several things of less value, but
not all less useful to me, which I omitted setting
down before; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper,
several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and
carpenter's keeping, three or four compasses, some
mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts,
and books of navigation; all which I huddled to-
gether, whether I might want them or no. Also, I
found three very good Bibles, which came to me in
my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things; some Portuguese books also, and
among them two or three Popish prayer-books, and
several other books; all which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog
and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have
occasion to say something in its place; for I carried VOL. I. F
both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped
out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and
was a trusty servant to me many years; I wanted
nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company
that he could make up to me; I only wanted to have
him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I ob-
served before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I
husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall show,
that while my ink lasted I kept things very exact;
but after that was gone I could not, for I could not
make any ink by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all that I had amassed to-
gether; and of these, this of ink was one, as also
spade, pickaxe, and shovel, to dig or remove the
earth; needles, pins, and thread. As for linen, I
soon learnt to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded habita-
tion: the piles, or stakes, which were as heavy as I
could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre-
paring in the woods, and more by far in bringing
home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting
and bringing home one of these posts, and a third day
in driving it into the ground; for which purpose I got
a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought
myself of one of the iron crows, which, however, though
I found it, yet it made driving those posts or piles
very laborious and tedious work.
But what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of anything I had to do, seeing I had
83
time enough to do it in? Nor had I any other em-
ployment, if that had been over, at least that I could
foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food,
which I did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstances I was reduced to, and I drew
up the state of my affairs in writing, not so much to
leave them to any that were to come after me (for
I was like to have but few heirs), as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflicting
my mind; and as my reason began now to master
my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well
as I could, and to set the good against the evil, that
I might have something to distinguish my case from
worse; and I stated it very impartially, like debtor
and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the
miseries I suffered, thus:
Evil.
I am cast upon a hor-
rible desolate island, void
of all hope of recovery.
I am singled out and
separated, as it were,
from all the world, to be
miserable.
I am divided from
mankind, a solitaire, one
banished from human
society.
Good.
But I am alive, and not
drowned, as all my ship's
company was.
But I am singled out
too from all the ship's
crew to be spared from
death; and He that mira-
culously saved me from
death, can deliver me
from this condition.
But I am not starved
and perishing on a bar-
ren place, affording no
sustenance.
I have not clothes to
cover me.
I am without any de-
fence, or means to resist
any violence of man or
beast.
I have no soul to speak
to, or relieve me.
But I am in a hot cli-
mate, where, if I had
clothes, I could hardly
wear them.
But I am cast on an
island, where I see no
wild beasts to hurt me,
as I saw on the coast of
Africa: and what if I
had been shipwrecked
there?
But God wonderfully
sent the ship in near
enough to the shore, that
I have gotten out so
many necessary things as
will either supply my
wants, or enable me to
supply myself even as
long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony,
that there was scarce any condition in the world so
miserable, but there was something negative or some-
thing positive to be thankful for in it; and let this
stand as a direction from the experience of the most
miserable of all conditions in this world, that we may
always find in it something to comfort ourselves from,
and to set in the description of good and evil, on the
credit side of the account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my
condition, and given over looking out to sea, to see
if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over these things,
I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of
living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which was
a tent, under the side of a rock, surrounded with a
strong pale of posts and cables; but I might now
rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up
against it of turfs, about two foot thick on the outside;
and after some time, I think it was a year and a half,
I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and
thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such
things as I could get to keep out the rain, which I
found at some times of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had
made behind me; but I must observe, too, that at
first this was a confused heap of goods, which as
they lay in no order, so they took up all my place:
I had no room to turn myself; so I set myself to
enlarge my cave and works farther into the earth;
for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to
the labour I bestowed on it; and so when I found I
was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked side-
ways to the right hand into the rock; and then,
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and
made me a door to come out, on the outside of my
pale, or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it
were a back-way to my tent and to my storehouse,
but gave me room to stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu-
larly a chair and a table; for without these I was not
able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I
could not write or eat, or do several things with so
much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs observe,
that as reason is the substance and original of the
mathematics, so, by stating and squaring everything
by reason, and by making the most rational judg-
ment of things, every man may be in time master of
every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in
my life, and yet in time, by labour, application, and
contrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing
but I could have made it, especially if I had had tools; however, I made abundance of things, even
without tools, and some with no more tools than an
adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made
that way before, and that with infinite labour; for
example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way
but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me,
and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had
brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it
smooth with my adze. It is true, by this method I
could make but one board out of a whole tree; but
this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than
I had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which
it took me up to make a plank or board; but my
time or labour was little worth, and so it was as well
employed one way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served above, in the first place; and this I did out of
the short pieces of boards that I brought on my raft
from the ship; but when I had wrought out some
boards, as above, I made large shelves of the breadth
of a foot and a half one over another, all along one
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron
37
work, and, in a word, to separate everything at large
in their places, that I might come easily at them. I
knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my
guns, and all things that would hang up.
So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things; and
I had everything so ready at my hand, that it was a
great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such
order, and especially to find my stock of all neces-
saries so great.
And now it was that I began to keep a journal of
every day's employment; for indeed at first I was in
too much a hurry; and not only hurry as to labour,
but in too much discomposure of mind, and my
journal would have been full of many dull things.
For example, I must have said thus: Sept. the 30th,
after I got to shore, and had escaped drowning,
instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited with the great quantity of salt
water which was gotten into my stomach, and re-
covering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wring-
ing my hands, and beating my head and face,
exclaiming at my misery, and crying out, "I was
undone, undone!" till tired and faint, I was forced
to lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not
sleep for fear of being devoured.
Some days after this, and after I had been on board
the ship, and got all that I could out of her, yet I
could not forbear getting up to the top of a little
mountain, and looking out to sea in hopes of seeing
a ship; then fancy, at a vast distance, I spied a sail;
please myself with the hopes of it; and then, after
looking steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite,
and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase
my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things in some mea-
sure, and having settled my household stuffand habita-
tion, made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome
about me as I could, I began to keep my journal, of
which I shall here give you the copy (though in it
will be told all these particulars over again) as long
as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I was forced to
leave it off.
CHAPTER V.
/ BEGIN TO KEEP A JOURNAL — CHRISTEN MY DESERT ISLAND THE ISLAND OF DESPAIR FALL UPON VARIOUS SCHEMES TO MAKE TOOLS, BASKETS, &>C.,
AND BEGIN TO BUILD MY HOUSE AT A GREAT LOSS OF AN EVENING FOR CANDLE, BUT FALL UPON
AN EXPEDIENT TO SUPPLY THE WANT—STRANGE DISCOVERY OF CORN A TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKE, AND STORM.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30, 1659.
I, POOR miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm in the offing, came
on shore on this dismal unfortunate island, which I
called the Island of Despair; all the rest of the ship's
company being drowned, and myself almost dead.
All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself
89
at the dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz., I
had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, or place to
fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw nothing but
death before me, either that I should be devoured by
wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death
for want of food. At the approach of night I slept
in a tree, for fear of wild creatures, but slept soundly,
though it rained all night.
October i. In the morning I saw, to my great sur-
prise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and
was driven on shore again much nearer the island;
which, as it was some comfort on one hand, for, seeing
her sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if
the wind abated, I might get on board, and get some
food and necessaries out of her for my relief; so, on
the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my
comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on
board, might have saved the ship, or at least that
they would not have been all drowned, as they were;
and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps
have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to
have carried us to some other part of the world. I
spent great part of this day in perplexing myself on
these things; but at length, seeing the ship almost
dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and
then swam on board. This day also it continued
raining, though with no wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in many several voyages to get
all I could out of the ship, which I brought on
shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain
also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I
had got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the
things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them
when the tide was out.
Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with
some gusts of wind; during which time the ship
broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be seen, except the
wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent
this day in covering and securing the goods which
I had saved, that rain might not spoil them.
Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all
day, to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly
concerned to secure myself from any attack in the
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards
night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a semicircle for my encampment, which
I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or forti-
fication, made of double piles, lined within with cable
and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the
island with my gun, to see for some food, and dis-
cover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and
her kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed
also, because it would not feed.
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and
lay there for the first night, making it as large as I
could, with stakes driven in to swing my hammock
upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and
9'
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with
them formed a fence round me, a little within the
place I had marked out for my fortification.
Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In
the afternoon went to work to make me a table.
Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times
of work; of going out with my gun, time of sleep,
and time of diversion; viz., every morning I walked
out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did
not rain, then employed myself to work till about
eleven o'clock, then ate what I had to live on, and
from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather
being excessive hot, and then in the evening to work
again: the working part of this day and of the next
were wholly employed in making my table; for I was
yet but a very sorry workman, though time and neces-
sity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after,
as I believe it would do any one else.
Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft,
but her flesh good for nothing; every creature I
killed I took off the skins, and preserved them.—
Coming back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of
sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was sur-
prised, and almost frighted, with two or three seals,
which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what
they were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that
time.
Nov. 6. After my morning walk, I went to work
with my table again, and finished it, though not to
my liking; nor was it long before I learned to mend
it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the
nth was Sunday), I took wholly up to make me a
chair, and, with much ado, brought it to a tolerable
shape, but never to please me; and even in the
making, I pulled it in pieces several times. Note—
I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for omitting
my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was
which.
Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was ac-
companied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frighted me dreadfully for fear of my powder: as
soon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock
of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that
it might not be in danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in
making little square chests or boxes, which might
hold about a pound, or two pound at most, of powder;
and so putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as
secure and remote from one another as possible. On
one of these three days I killed a large bird that was
good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my
tent into the rock, to make room for my further con-
veniency. Note—Three things I wanted exceedingly
for this work, viz., a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheel-
barrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and
began to consider how to supply that want, and make
me some tools: as for a pickaxe, I made use of the
iron-crows, which were proper enough, though heavy;
but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this was
so absolutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing
93.
effectually without it; but what kind of one to make
I knew not.
Nov. 18. The next day in searching the woods,
I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the
Brazils they call the Iron Tree, for its exceeding
hardness: of this, with great labour, and almost
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home
too with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding
heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this ma-
chine; for I worked it effectually by little and little
into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle ex-
actly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom,
it would not last me so long; however, it served
well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put
it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after
that fashion, or so long a-making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a
wheel-barrow; a basket I could not make by any
means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker-ware, at least none yet found
out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of,
neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I
had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for
the spindle, or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave
it over; and so, for carrying away the earth which
I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the labourers carry mortar in when they serve
the bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt
which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took
me up no less than four days, I mean always except-
ing my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom
failed; and very seldom failed also bringing home
something to eat.
Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were
finished I went on, and working every day, as my
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
might hold my goods commodiously.
Note—During all this time, I worked to make this
room, or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as
a warehouse, or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room,
and a cellar: as for my lodging, I kept to the tent,
except that sometimes in the wet season of the year,
it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry,
which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
within my pale with long poles in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and load them with flags
and large leaves of trees like a thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my cave or
vault finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell down
from the top and one side, so much that, in short, it
frighted me, and not without reason too; for if I
had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-digger.
Upon this disaster I had a great deal of work to do
over again; for I had the loose earth to carry out,
and which was of more importance, I had the ceiling
to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would
come down.
95
Dec. II. This day I went to work with it ac-
cordingly, and got two shores, or posts, pitched
upright to the top, with two pieces of boards across
over each post; this I finished the next day; and
setting more posts up with boards, in about a week
more I had the roof secured; and the posts, stand-
ing in rows, served me for partitions to part off my
house.
Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I placed
shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts to hang
everything up that could be hung up; and now I
began to be in some order within doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carried everything into the cave,
and began to furnish my house, and set up some
pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my victuals
upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me:
also I made me another table.
Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no
stirring out.
Dec. 25. Rain all day.
Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler
than before, and pleasanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another,
so that I caught it, and led it home in a string; when
I had it home, I bound and splintered up its leg,
which was broke. N. B.—I took such care of it, that
it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong as ever;
but by nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed upon
the little green at my door, and would not go away.
This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding 'up some tame creatures, that I might
have food when my powder and shot was all spent. Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats, and no breeze; so
that there was no stirring abroad, except in the
evening for food. This time I spent in putting all
my things in order within doors.
January I. Very hot still; but I went abroad
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the
middle of the day. This evening going farther into
the valleys, which lay towards the centre of the
island, I found there was plenty of goats, though
exceeding shy and hard to come at; however, I
resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt
them down.
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day I went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was mis-
taken, for they all faced about upon the dog: and
he knew his danger too well; for he would not come
near them.
Jan. 3. I began my fence, or wall, which, being
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I
resolved to make very thick and strong.
N.B.—This wall being described before, I pur-
posely omit what was said in the Journal; it is
sufficient to observe, that I was no less time,
than from the 3d of January to the I4th of
April, working, finishing, and perfecting this
wall, though it was no more than about twenty-
four yards in length, being a half-circle, from
one place in the rock to another place about
eight yards from it, the door of the cave being
in the centre behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hin-
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks to-
gether; but I thought I should never be perfectly
97
secure, until this wall was finished; and it is scarce
credible what inexpressible labour everything was
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the
woods, and driving them into the ground; for I
made them much bigger than I need to have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside
double fenced with a turf wall raised up close to it,
I persuaded myself that if any people were to come
on shore there, they would not perceive anything
like a habitation; and it was very well I did so, as
may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable
occasion.
During this time, I made my rounds in the woods
for game, every day, when the rain admitted me,
and made frequent discoveries, in these walks, of
something or other to my advantage; particularly,
I found a kind of wild pigeons, who built not as
wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons,
in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame; and
did so: but when they grew older, they flew away,
which perhaps was at first for want of feeding
them; for I had nothing to give them. However, I
frequently found their nests, and got their young
ones, which were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs,
I found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at first it was impossible for me to make, as
indeed as to some of them it was; for instance, I
could never make a cask to be hooped. I had a
small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I could
never arrive to the capacity of making one by them,
though I spent many weeks about it; I could neither
VOL. I. G
put in the heads, or joint the staves so true to one
another, as to make them hold water, so I gave
that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle,
so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was
generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to
bed. I remembered the lump of bees'-wax with which
I made candles in my African adventure; but I had
none of that now. The only remedy I had, was,
that when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow,
and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked
in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum,
I made me a lamp; and this gave me a light, though
not a clear, steady light like a candle. In the middle
of all my labours, it happened, that rummaging my
things, I found a little bag which, as I hinted before,
had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry,
not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when
the ship came from Lisbon. What little remainder
of corn had been in the bag was all devoured with
the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and
dust; and being willing to have the bag for some
other use, I think it was to put powder in, when I
divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use,
I shook the husks of corn out of it, on one side of my
fortification, under the rock.
It was a little before the great rains just now men-
tioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice
of anything, and not so much as remembering that I
had thrown anything there; when about a month
after, or thereabout, I saw some few stalks of some-
thing green shooting out of the ground, which I
fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I
99
was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after
a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears
come out, which were perfect green barley, of the
same kind as our European, nay, as our English
barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion. I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all.
Indeed I had very few notions of religion in my
head, or had entertained any sense of anything that
had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as
we lightly say, what pleases God; without so much
as inquiring into the end of Providence in these
things, or His order in governing events in the world.
But after I saw barley grow there, in a climate
which I knew was not proper for corn, and especially
that I knew not how it came there, it startled me
strangely, and I began to suggest that God had
miraculously caused this grain to grow, without any
help of seed sown; and that it was so directed purely
for my sustenance on that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears
out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself that
such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my
account; and this was the more strange to me, be-
cause I saw near it still, all along by the side of the
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to
be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had
seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions
of Providence for my support, but not doubting but
that there was more in the place, I went all over that
part of the island, where I had been before, peeping
in every corner, and under every rock, to see for more
of it; but I could not find any. At last it occurred
to my thought that I had shook a bag of chickens'
meat out in that place, and then the wonder began
to cease; and I must confess, my religious thankful-
ness to God's providence began to abate too, upon
discovering that all this was nothing but what was
common, though I ought to have been as thankful for
so strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had
been miraculous; for it was really the work of Provi-
dence, as to me, that should order or appoint ten or
twelve grains of corn to remain unspoiled, when the
rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been
dropped from heaven : as also, that I should throw it
out in that particular place, where, it being in the
shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately;
whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else at that time,
it had been burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of corn, you may be sure,
in their season, which was about the end of June, and,
laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again,
hoping in time to have some quantity sufficient to
supply me with bread; but it was not till the fourth
year that I could allow myself the least grain of this
corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall
say afterwards in its order; for I lost all that I sowed
the first season, by not observing the proper time;
for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it
never came up at all, at least not as it would have
done: of which in its place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the same kind, or to
101
the same purpose, viz., to'make me bread, or rather
food; for I found ways to cook it up without baking,
though I did that also after some time. But to return
to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four months
to get my wall done; and the I4th of April I closed
it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door, but over
the wall by a ladder, that there might be no sign, in
the outside, of my habitation.
April 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up with
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me,
and let it down on the inside; this was a complete
enclosure to me, for within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from without, unless it
could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was finished, I
had almost had all my labour overthrown at once
and myself killed. The case was thus: As I was
busy in the inside of it behind my tent, just in the
entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with
a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for on a
sudden I found the earth come crumbling down from
the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill,
over my head, and two of the posts I had set up in
the cave cracked in a frightful manner: I was heartily
scared, but thought nothing of what was really the
cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was
falling in, as some of it had done before; and for fear
I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder,
and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over
my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I ex-
pected might roll down upon me. I was no sooner
stepped down upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw
it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood
on shook three times at about eight minutes' distance,
with three such shocks, as would have overturned the
strongest building that could be supposed to have
stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of
a rock, which stood about half a mile from me, next
the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise as I never
heard in all my life: I perceived also the very sea
was [put into violent motion by it; and I believe the
shocks were stronger under the water than on the
island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had, that
I was like one dead or stupefied; and the motion of
the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was
tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock
awaked me, as it were, and rousing me from the
stupefied condition I was in, filled me with horror,
and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling
upon my tent and all my household goods, and bury-
ing all at once; and thus sunk my very soul within
me a second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more
for some time, I began to take courage; and yet I
had not heart enough to get over my wall again,
for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon
the ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not
knowing what to do. All this while I had not the
least serious religious thought, nothing but the
common "Lord, have mercy upon me 1" and when it
was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and
grow cloudy, as if it would rain; soon after that the
103
wind rose by little and little, so that in less than
half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane: the
sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and
froth, the shore was covered with the breach of the
water, the trees were torn up by the roots, and a
terrible storm it was; and this held about three
hours, and then began to abate, and in two hours
more it was stark calm, and began to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected, when on a sudden it came
into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into
my cave again: with this thought my spirits began
to revive, and the rain also helping to persuade me,
I went in and sat down in my tent; but the rain
was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten
down with it; and I was forced to go into my cave,
though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it
should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz.,
to cut a hole through my new fortification like a
sink, to let water go out, which would else have
drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave
some time, and found still no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed;
and now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted
it very much, I went to my little store, and took a
small cup of rum, which, however, I did then, and
always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no
more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great part
of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad;
but my mind being more composed, I began to
think of what I had best do, concluding that if the
island was subject to these earthquakes, there would
be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider
of building me some little hut in an open place,
which I might surround with a wall as I had done
here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts
or men: but concluded, if I stayed where I was, I
should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my
tent from the place where it stood, which was just
under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which,
if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon
my tent. And I spent the two next days, being the
19th and 2Oth of April, in contriving where and how
to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me
that I never slept in quiet, and yet the apprehen-
sion of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost
equal to it; but still, when I looked about, and saw
how everything was put in order, how pleasantly
concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made
me very loath to remove.
In the meantime, it occurred to me that it would
require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and
that I must be contented to run the venture where I
was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had
secured it so as to remove to it. So, with this re-
solution, I composed myself for a time, and resolved
that I would go to work with all speed, to build me
a wall with piles and cables,'&c, in a circle as be-
fore; and set my tent up in it when it was finished,
but that I would venture to stay where I was till
it was finished, and fit to remove to. This was the
2 1 St.
April 22. The next morning I began to consider
of means to put this resolve in execution, but I was
at a great loss about my tools. I had three large
axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the
hatchets for traffic with the Indians), but with much
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were
all full of notches and dull; and though I had a
grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools
too: this cost me as much thought as a statesman
would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or
a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length
I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my
foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty.
Note—I had never seen any such thing in England,
or at least not to take notice how it was done, though
since I have observed it very common there; besides
that, my grindstone was very large and heavy. This
machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to
perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in
grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grind-
stone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, now I took a survey of it, and re-
duced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made
my heart very heavy.
CHAPTER VI.
OBSERVE THE SHIP DRIVEN FURTHER AGROUND BY THE
LATE STORM PROCURE A VAST QUANTITY OF
NECESSARIES FROM THE WRECK—CATCH A LARGE
TURTLE / FALL ILL OF A FEVER AND AGUE— TERRIBLE DREAM, AND SERIOUS REFLECTIONS THEREUPON FIND A BIBLE IN ONE OF THE SEAMEN'S CHESTS THROWN ASHORE, THE READING
WHEREOF GIVES ME GREAT COMFORT. >
May i. In the morning, looking towards the sea-
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the
shore bigger than ordinary; and it looked like a cask.
When I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two
or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were
driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie
higher out of the water than it used to do. I exa-
mined the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon
found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken
water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone;
however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present,
and went on upon the sands as near as I could to the
wreck of the ship, to look for more.
When I came down to the ship I found it strangely
removed; the forecastle, which lay before buried in
sand, was heaved up at least six foot; and the stern,
which was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest
by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging
her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side,
and the sand was thrown so high on that side next
107
her stern, that whereas there was a great place of
water before, so that I could not come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I
was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded
it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this
violence the ship was more broken open than for-
merly, so many things came daily on shore which the
sea had loosened, and which the winds and water
rolled by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design
of removing my habitation; and I busied myself
mightily, that day especially, in searching whether
I could make any way into the ship; but I found
nothing was to be expected of that kind, for that
all the inside of the ship was choked up with
sand; however, as I had learnt not to despair of
anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces
that I could of the ship, concluding that every-
thing I could get from her would be of some use
or other to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of
a beam through, which I thought held some of the
upper part or quarter-deck together, and when I
had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well
as I could from the side which lay highest; but the
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that
time.
May 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish
that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when
just going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I
had made me along line of some rope-yarn, but I had
no hooks, yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much
as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun, and
ate them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir planks off from
the decks, which I tied together, and made swim on
shore when the tide of flood came on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron work;
worked very hard, and came home very much tired,
and had thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to work, but found the weight of the
wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut,
that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose,
and the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could
see into it, but almost full of water and sand.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite
clear of water or sand; I wrenched open two planks,
and brought them on shore also with the tide: I left
the iron crow in the wreck for next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt several
casks, and loosened them with the crow, but could
not break them up: I felt also the roll of English
lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to re-
move.
May 10, II, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber, and
boards, or plank, and two or three hundred weight
of iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could
not cut a piece of the roll of lead, by placing the edge
109
of one hatchet, and driving it with the other; but as
it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could
not make any blow to drive the hatchet.
May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the force of the
water; but I stayed so long in the woods to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going
to the wreck that day.
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown
on shore at a great distance, near two miles off me,
but resolved to see what they were, and found it
was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to
bring away.
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on the
wreck, and, with hard labour, I loosened some things
so much with the crow, that the first flowing tide
several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's
chests; but the wind blowing from the shore, no-
thing came to land that day but pieces of timber,
and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it,
but the salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of
June, except the time necessary to get food, which
I always appointed, during this part of my employ-
ment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be
ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time I
had gotten timber, and plank, and iron work enough
to have built a good boat, if I had known how; and
also I got at several times, and in several pieces,
near one hundred-weight of the sheet-lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a
large tortoise, or turtle: this was the first I had seen,
which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any
defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day, as I found after-
wards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle; I found
in her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I
tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats
and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.
June 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within.
I thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which I knew was not usual in
that latitude.
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
had been cold.
June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in my
head, and feverish.
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with
the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick,
and no help. Prayed to God, for the first time since
the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or
why; my thoughts being all confused.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful
apprehensions of sickness.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering,
and then a violent headache.
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after
it.
June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak; however,
I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty, got it
111
home, and broiled some of it, and ate; I would fain
have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no
pot.
June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay
a-bed all day, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready
to perish for thirst, but so weak I had not strength
to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink.
Prayed to God again, but was light headed; and
when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not
what to say; only I lay, and cried, "Lord, look upon
me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!" I
suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours,
till the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake
till far in the night; when I waked, I found myself
much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty;
however, as I had no water in my whole habitation,
I was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep
again. In this second sleep I had this terrible
dream.
I thought that I was sitting on the ground on the
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend
from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire,
and light upon the ground. He was all over as
bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to
look towards him; his countenance was most inex-
pressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe;
when he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I
thought the earth trembled, just as it had done
before in the earthquake, and all the air looked to
my apprehension as if it had been filled with flashes
of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
I
moved forward towards me, with a long spear, or
weapon, in his hand to kill me; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible
to express the terror of it; all that I can say I un-
derstood was this:—" Seeing all these things have
not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;"
at which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that
was in his hand to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will ex-
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors
of my soul at this terrible vision; I mean that even
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those hor-
rors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind, when I
awaked and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge. What I had
received by the good instruction of my father was
then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight
years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant con-
versation with nothing but such as were, like myself,
wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not
remember that I had, in all that time, one thought
that so much as tended either to looking upwards
towards God, or inwards towards a reflection upon
my own ways. But a certain stupidity of soul, with-
out desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely
overwhelmed me, and I was all that the most har-
dened, unthinking, wicked creature among our com-
mon sailors can be supposed to be, not having the
least sense, either of the fear of God in danger, or of
thankfulness to God in deliverances.
In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when I shall
add, that through all the variety of miseries that
had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as
one thought of it being the hand of God, or that it
was a just punishment for my sin; my rebellious
behaviour against my father, or my present sins,
which were great, or so much as a punishment for
the general course of my wicked life. When I was
on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of
Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what
would become of me, or one wish to God to direct
me whither I should go, or to keep me from the
danger which apparently surrounded me, as well
from voracious creatures as cruel savages; but I
was merely thoughtless of a God, or a Providence;
acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature,
and by the dictates of common sense only, and in-
deed hardly that.
When I was delivered, and taken up at sea by the
Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not
the least thankfulness in my thoughts. When again
I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drown-
ing on this island, I was as far from remorse, or
looking on it as a judgment; I only said to myself
often that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be
always miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found
all my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was
surprised with a kind of ecstacy, and some transports
of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might
have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where
it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may
VOL. I. H
say, being glad I was alive, without the least reflecJ"
tion upon the distinguishing goodness of the Hand
which had preserved me, and had singled me out to
be preserved, when all the rest were destroyed; or
an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful
to me: even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after they have got safe on
shore from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the
next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it
is over; and all the rest of my life was like it.
Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration,
made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on
this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind,
out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption,
as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and that I
should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense
of my affliction wore off, and I began to be very
easy, applied myself to the works proper for my
preservation and supply, and was far enough from
being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment from
Heaven, or as the hand of God against me: these
were thoughts which very seldom entered into my
head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my
journal, had at first some little influence upon me,
and began to affect me with seriousness, as long as I
thought it had something miraculous in it; but as
soon as ever that part of thought was removed, all
the impression, which was raised from it, wore off
also, as I have noted already.
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately
directing to the invisible Power, which alone directs
such things; yet no sooner was the first fright over,
but the impression it had made went off also. I had
no more sense of God, or His judgments, much less
of the present affliction of my circumstances being
from His hand, than if I had been in the most pros-
perous condition of life.
But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely
view of the miseries of death came to place itself
before me; when my spirits began to sink under
the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was
exhausted with the violence of the fever, conscience,
that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began
to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had
so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked
the justice of God to lay me under uncommon
strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a
manner.
These reflections oppressed me, from the second
or third day of my distemper; and in the violence,
as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of
my conscience, extorted some words from me, like
praying to God, though I cannot say they were either
a prayer attended with desires, or with hopes; it
was rather the voice of mere fright and distress;
my thoughts were confused, the convictions great
upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such a
miserable condition raised vapours into my head
with the mere apprehensions; and in these hurries
of my soul, I knew not what my tongue might
express: but it was rather exclamation, such as
"Lord! what a miserable creature am I! If I should
be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help, and
what will become of me!" Then the tears burst
out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good
while.
In this interval the good advice of my father came
to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I
mentioned in the beginning of this story; viz., that
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me; and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect
upon having neglected his counsel, when there might
be none to assist in my recovery. "Now," said I
aloud, "my dear father's words are come to pass;
God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to
help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a posture, or station
of life, wherein I might have been happy and easy;
but I would neither see it myself, nor learn to know
the blessing of it from my parents. I left them to
mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn
under the consequences of it. I refused their help
and assistance, who would have lifted me into the
world, and would have made everything easy to me,
and now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great
for even nature itself to support, and no assistance,
no help, no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out,
"Lord, be my help; for I am in great distress!"
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But I return to my
journal.
June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the
sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got
up; and though the fright and terror of my dream
was very great,'yet I considered that the fit of the
ague would return again the next day, and now was
my time to get something to refresh and support
"7
myself, when I should be ill: and the first thing I
did, I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and
set it upon my table, in reach of my bed; and to take
off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I put
about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed
them together; then I got me a piece of the goat's
flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very
little. I walked about, but was very weak, and withal
very sad and heavy-hearted, under a sense of my
miserable condition, dreading the return of my dis-
temper the next day. At night, I made my supper
of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the
ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell; and this was
the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing
to, even, as I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found my-
self so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for
I never went out without that); so I went but a little
way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and
smooth. As I sat here some such thoughts as these
occurred to me:—
What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen so
much? Whence is it produced? And what am I,
and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human
and brutal; whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who
is that?
Then it followed most naturally:—It is God that
has made it all. Well, but then, it came on strangely,
if God has made all these things, He guides and go-
verns them all, and all things that concern them; for
the Being that could make all things, must certainly
have power to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of
His works, either without His knowledge or appoint-
ment.
And if nothing happens without His knowledge,
He knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful con-
dition; and if nothing happens without His appoint-
ment, He has appointed all this to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs
be that God had appointed all this to befall me;
that I was brought to this miserable circumstance
by His direction, He having the sole power, not of
me only, but of everything that happened in the
world. Immediately it followed,
Why has God done this to me? What have I
done to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that in-
quiry, as if I had blasphemed; and methought it
spoke to me, like a voice:—" Wretch! dost thou ask
what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful
misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not
done? Ask why it is that thou wert not long ago
destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yar-
mouth Roads? killed in the fight, when the ship was
taken by the Sallee man-of-war? devoured by the
wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or drowned HERE
when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost thou
ask, What have I done?"
I was struck with these reflections, as one aston-
ished, and had not a word to say, no, not to answer
119
to myself; but rose up pensive and sad, walked back
to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had
been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly dis-
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep, so I sat
down in my chair, and lighted my lamp; for it began
to be dark. Now, as the apprehensions of the return
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred
to my thought that the Brazilians take no physic
but their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I
had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests,
which was quite cured, and some also that was green,
and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt; for in this
chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I
opened the chest, and found what I looked for, viz.,
the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay
there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I
mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had not
found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into;
I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the
tobacco with me to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as
to my distemper, or whether it was good for it or
no; but I tried several experiments with it, as if I
was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first
took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth,
which indeed at first almost stupefied my brain, the
tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not
been much used to it; then I took some and steeped
it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take
a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt
some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close
over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, aswell for the heat, as the virtue of it, and I held
almost to suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the
Bible, and began to read; but my head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at
least at that time; only, having opened the book
casually, the first words that occurred to me were
these—"Call on Me, in the day of trouble, and I
will deliver; and thou shalt glorify Me."
The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading them, though not so much as they did after-
wards; for, as for being delivered, the word had no
sound, as I may say, to me. The thing was so re-
mote, so impossible, in my apprehension of things,
that I began to say, as the children of Israel did
when they were promised flesh to eat, "Can God
spread a table in the wilderness?" So I began to
say, Can God Himself deliver me from this place?
And as it was not for many years that any hope ap-
peared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts.
But, however, the words made a very great impres-
sion upon me, and I mused upon them very often.
It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said,
dozed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep, so
that I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I
should want anything in the night, and went to
bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never
had done in all my life, I kneeled down, and prayed
to God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called
upon Him in the day of trouble, He would deliver
me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was
over, I drank the rum, in which I had steeped the
tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco,
that indeed I could scarce get it down. Immediately
upon this, I went to bed, and I found presently it
flew up into my head violently; but I fell into a
sound sleep, and waked no more, till, by the sun, it
must necessarily be near three o'clock in the after-
noon the next day; nay, to this hour, I am partly of
the opinion that I slept all the next day and night,
and till almost three the day after; for otherwise I
know not how I should lose a day out of my reckon-
ing, in the days of the week, as it appeared, some
years after, I had done: for if I had lost it by cross-
ing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more
than a day; but in my account it was lost, and I
never knew which way.
Be that, however, one way or other; when I
awaked, I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and
my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up, I
was stronger than I was the day before, and my
stomach better; for I was hungry; and, in short, I
had no fit the next day, but continued much altered
for the better: this was the 29th.
The 3Oth was my well day of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far; I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a
brand goose, and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them: so I ate some more of
the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This even-
ing I renewed the medicine which I had supposed
did me good the day before, viz., the tobacco
steeped in rum; only I did not take so much as
before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke; however, I was not so well the
next day, which was the 1st of July, as I hoped I
should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold
fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dozed myself with it at first, and doubled the
quantity which I drank.
July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, "I
will deliver thee;" and the impossibility of my de-
liverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever
expecting it: but as I was discouraging myself with
such thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored
so much upon my deliverance from the main afflic-
tion, that I disregarded the deliverance I had re-
ceived; and I was, as it were, made to ask myself
such questions as these, viz., Have I not been de-
livered, and wonderfully too, from sickness? from
the most distressing condition that could be, and
that was so frightful to me? and what notice had I
taken of it? had I done my part? God had de-
livered me, but I had not glorified Him: that is to say,
I had not owned and been thankful for that as a
deliverance; and how could I expect greater de-
liverance?
This touched my heart very much, and immedi-
ately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud
for my recovery from my sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read awhile
every morning and every night, not tying myself to
123
the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
should engage me. It was not long after I set seri-
ously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my
past life. The impression of my dream revived;
and the words, " All these things have not brought
thee to repentance," ran seriously in my thoughts. I
was earnestly begging of God to give me repentance,
when it happened providentially the very day, that
reading the Scripture, I came to these words: "He
is exalted a Prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance,
and to give remission." I threw down the book, and
with my heart as well as my hand lifted up to heaven,
in a kind of ecstacy of joy, I cried out aloud, "Jesus,
Thou Son of David! Jesus, Thou exalted Prince and
Saviour, give me repentance!"
This was the first time that I could say, in the
true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life;
for now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and
with a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the
encouragement of the Word of God; and from this
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God
would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, " Call on Me, and I will deliver thee," in a
different sense from what I had ever done before;
for then I had no notion of anything being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the cap-
tivity I was in: for though I was indeed at large in
the place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me,
and that in the worst sense of the word; but now I
learnt to take it in another sense. Now I looked
back upon my past life with such horror, and my
sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought
nothing of God but deliverance from the load of
guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my
solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much as
pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was all
of no consideration in comparison of this; and I
added this part here, to hint to whoever shall read
it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things,
they will find deliverance from sin a much greater
blessing than deliverance from affliction.
But leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not less
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier
to my mind; and my thoughts being directed by a
constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God,
to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of
comfort within, which till now I knew nothing of:
also as my health and strength returned, I bestirred
myself to furnish myself with everything that I wanted,
and make my way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the I4th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my gun in my hand,
a little and a little at a time, as a man that was gather-
ing up his strength after a fit of sickness; for it is
hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what
weakness I was reduced. The application which I
made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what
had never cured an ague before; neither can I re-
commend it to any one to practise by this experiment;
and though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather con-
tributed to weaken me; for I had frequent convulsions
in my nerves and limbs for some time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that being
125
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious
thing to my health that could be, especially in those
rains which came attended with storms and hurri-
canes of wind; for as the rain which came in a dry
season was always most accompanied with such
storms, so I found this rain was much more dangerous
than the rain which fell in September and October.
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten
months; all possibility of deliverance from this con-
dition seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I
firmly believed that no human shape had ever set
foot upon that place. Having now secured my habi-
tation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the
island, and to see what other productions I might
find, which yet I knew nothing of.
CHAPTER VII.
/ BEGIN TO TAKE A SURVEY OF MY ISLAND—DISCOVER
PLENTY OF TOBACCO, GRAPES, LEMONSr AND SUGAR-
CANES, WILD, BUT NO HUMAN INHABITANTS—RESOLVE TO LAY UP A STORE OF THESE ARTICLES, TO FURNISH
ME AGAINST THE WET SEASON—MY CAT, WHICH I
SUPPOSED LOST, RETURNS WITH KITTENS / REGU-
LATE MY DIET, AND SHUT MYSELF UP FOR THE WET
SEASON—SOW MY GRAIN, WHICH COMES TO NOTHING; BUT I DISCOVER, AND REMEDY MY ERROR TAKE
ACCOUNT OF THE COURSE OF THE WEATHER.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the
creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on
shore. I found, after I came about two miles up,
that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it
was no more than a little brook of running water,
and very fresh and good; but this being the dry
season, there was hardly any water in some parts of
it, at least not enough to run into any stream, so as it
could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant
savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grass; and on the rising parts of them, next
to the higher grounds, where the water, as it might
be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal
of tobacco, green and growing to a great and very
strong stalk: there were divers others plants which
I had no notion of, or understanding about; and
might perhaps have virtues of their own, which I
could not find out.
I searched for the cassave root, which the Indians
in all that climate make their bread of, but I could
find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not
then understand them: I saw several sugar-canes,
but wild, and for want of cultivation, imperfect. I
contented myself with these discoveries for this
time, and came back musing with myself what
course I might take to know the virtue and good-
ness of any of the fruits or plants which I should
discover, but could bring it to no conclusion; for,
in short, I had made so little observation while I
was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants
of the field, at least, very little that might serve me
to any purpose now in my distress.
The next day, the i6th, I went up the same way
again; and after going something farther than I had
127
done the day before, I found the brook and the savan-
nas began to cease, and the country became more
woody than before. In this part I found different
fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the
ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the
trees; the vines had spread indeed over the trees,
and the clusters of grapes were just now in their
prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising
discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I
was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of
them, remembering, that when I was ashore in Bar-
bary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Eng-
lishmen who were slaves there, by throwing them
into fluxes and fevers: but I found an excellent use
for these grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in
the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are
kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they
were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat, when
no grapes might be had.
I spent all that evening there, and went not back
to my habitation; which, by the way, was the first
night, as I might say, I had lain from home. In the
night I took my first contrivance, and got up into a
tree, where I slept well, and the next morning pro-
ceeded upon my discovery, travelling near four miles,
as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping
still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and
north side of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west;
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of
the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is,
due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green,
so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure,
or flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted
garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts), to think- that this was all my own, that I was king and lord of
all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of pos-
session; and if I could convey it, I might have it in
inheritance, as completely as any lord of a manor in
England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees,
orange and lemon, and citron trees, but all wild,
and few bearing any fruit; at least, not then: how-
ever, the green limes that I gathered were not
only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I
mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made
it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.
I found now I had business enough to gather and
carry home; and resolved to lay up a store, as well
of grapes, as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for
the wet season, which I knew was approaching.
In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, and a lesser heap in another
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in
another place; and taking a few of each with me, I
travelled homeward, and resolved to come again,
and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to
carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this jour-
ney, I came home (so I must now call my tent, and
my cave); but before I got thither, the grapes were
spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and the weight of
the juice, having broken them, and bruised them,
they were good for little or nothing; as to the limes,
they were good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the igth, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest.
But I was surprised when, coming to my heap of
grapes which were so rich and fine when I gathered
them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces,
and dragged about, some here, some there, and
abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded
there were some wild creatures thereabouts, which
had done this; but what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them
up on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack,
but that one way they would be destroyed, and the
other way they would be crushed with their own
weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large
quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the
out branches of the trees, that they might cure
and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well
stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contem-
plated, with great pleasure, on the fruitfulness of
that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation,
the security from storms on that side of the water,
and the wood; and concluded that I had pitched
upon a place to fix my abode, which was by far the
worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began
to consider of removing my habitation, and to look
out for a place equally safe as where I now was
situated, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part
of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was
VOL. I. I
exceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness
of the place tempting me; but when I came to a
nearer view of it, and to consider that I was now
by the sea-side, where it was at least possible that
something might happen to my advantage, and that
the same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring
some other unhappy wretches to the same place;
and though it was scarce probable that any such
thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself
among the hills and woods, in the centre of the
island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to render
such an affair not only improbable, but impossible;
and that therefore I ought not by any means to
remove.
However, I was so enamoured with this place,
that I spent much of my time there for the whole
remaining part of the month of July; and though,
upon second thoughts, I resolved as above, not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and
surrounded it at a distance, with a strong fence,
being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well
staked, and filled between with brushwood; and
here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three
nights together, always going over it with a ladder,
as before; so that I fancied now I had my country-
house, and my sea-coast house; and this work took
me up the beginning of August.
I had but newly finished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my first habitation; for though I
had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of
a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a
131
cave behind me, to retreat into when the rains were
extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The
3rd of August I found the grapes I had hung up
were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good
raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down
from the trees, and it was very happy that I did so;
for the rains which followed would have spoiled them,
and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for
I had above two hundred large bunches of them.
No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried
most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain;
and from thence, which was the 14th of August, it
rained more or less every day, till the middle of
October, and sometimes so violently that I could
not stir out of my cave for several days.
In this season I was much surprised with the in-
crease of my family: I had been concerned for the
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or,
as I thought, had been dead; and I heard no more
tale or tidings of her, till to my astonishment she
came home about the end of August, with three
kittens. This was the more strange to me, because
though I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with
my gun, yet I thought it was a quite different kind
from our European cats; yet the young cats were
the same kind of house breed like the old one; and
both my cats being females, I thought it very
strange: but from these three cats, I afterwards
came to be so pestered with cats, that I was forced
to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive
them from my house as much as possible.
132
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
From the I4th of August to the 26th, incessant
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very care-
ful not to be much wet. In this confinement I began
to be straitened for food; but venturing out twice, I
one day killed a goat: and the last day, which was
the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a
treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I ate
a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled
(for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil
or stew anything); and two or three of the turtle's
eggs for supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the rain,
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my
cave; and by degrees worked it on towards one
side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made
a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or
wall; and so I came in and out this way. But I was
not perfectly easy at lying so open; for as I had
managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure,
whereas now I thought I lay exposed; and yet I
could not perceive that there was any living thing to
fear, the biggest creature that I had seen upon the
island being a goat.
September the 10th. I was now come to the un-
happy anniversary of my landing: I cast up the
notches on my post, and found I had been on shore
three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious ex-
ercise, prostrating myself to the ground with the
most serious humiliation, confessing myself to God,
acknowledging His righteous judgment upon me, and
praying to Him to have mercy on me, through Jesus
133
Christ; and having not tasted the least refreshment
for twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun,
I then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and
went to bed, finishing the day as I began it.
I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for
as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind,
I had after some time omitted to distinguish the
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for
the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what
any of the days were; but now, having cast up the
days as above, I found I had been there a year; so I
divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh
day for a Sabbath; though I found at the end of my
account I had lost a day or two of my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so
I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to
write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a daily memorandum of other
things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them
so as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought
all my experience before I had it; and this I am
going to relate, was one of the most discouraging
experiments that I made at all. I have mentioned
that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice which
I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought,
of themselves, and believe there were about thirty
stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now
I thought it a proper time to sow it after the rains,
the sun being in its southern position going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well as
I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it into
two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing,
it casually occurred to my thought, that I would not
sow it all at first, because I did not know when was
the proper time for it; so I sowed about two-thirds
of the seeds, leaving about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did
so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time came
to anything; for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had
no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up
at all, till the wet season had come again, and then
it grew as if it had been newly sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy months
of March and April to water it, sprung up very
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; but having
part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all
that I had yet, I had but a small quantity at last,
my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck
of each kind. ',
But by this experience I was made master of my
business, and knew exactly when the proper season
was to sow; and that I might expect two seed-times,
and two harvests, every year.
While this corn was growing, I made a little dis-
covery, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the rains were over, and the weather began to
settle, which was about the month of November, I
made a visit up the country to my bower, where
135
though I had not been some months, yet I found all
things just as I left them. The circle or double
hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire,
but the stakes which I had cut off of some trees that
grew thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown with
long branches, as much as a willow tree usually
shoots the first year after lopping its head. I could
not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to
see the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and
led them up to grow as much alike as I could; and
it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grew
into in three years; so that though the hedge made
a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet
the trees, for such I might now call them, soon
covered it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient to
lodge under all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,
and make me a hedge like this in a semicircle round
my wall, I mean that of my first dwelling, which I
did; and placing the trees, or stakes, in a double
row, at above eight yards' distance from my first
fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine
cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a
defence also, as I shall observe in its order.
I found now, that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter,
as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry
seasons, which were generally thus —

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter
as the winds happened to blow; but this was the
general observation I made. After I had found, by
experience, the ill consequence of being abroad in the
rain, I took care to furnish myself with provision
beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out;
and I sat within doors as much as possible during the
wet months.
In this time I found much employment (and very
suitable also to the time), for I found great occasion
of many things which I had no way to furnish myself
with, but by hard labour and constant application;
particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a
basket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpose
proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when
I was a boy I used to take great delight in standing
at a basket-maker's in the town where my father
lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and
137
being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and
a great observer of the manner how they worked
those things, and sometimes lent a hand, I had by
this means so full knowledge of the methods of it,
that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it
came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from
whence I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be
as tough as the sallows and willows and osiers in
England; and I resolved to try.
Accordingly the next day I went to my country-
house, as I called it; and cutting some of the smaller
twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire; whereupon I came the next time pre-
pared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I
soon found, for there was a great plenty of them:
these I set up to dry within my circle or hedges; and
when they were fit for use, I carried them to my
cave; and here, during the next season, I employed
myself in making (as well as I could) a great many
baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up
anything, as I had occasion; and though I did not
finish them very handsomely, yet I made them suffi-
ciently serviceable for my purpose; and thus after-
wards I took care never to be without them: and as
my wicker-ware decayed I made more; especially I
made strong deep baskets to place my corn in, instead
of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity
of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if
possible, how to supply two wants. I had no vessels
to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets,
which were almost full of rum, and some glass
bottles, some of the common size, and others which
were case-bottles square, for the holding of waters,
spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil
anything in, except a great kettle which I saved
out of the ship, and which was too big for such uses
as I desired it for, viz., to make broth, and stew a bit
of meat by itself. The second thing I would fain
have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible
for me to make one; however, I found a contrivance
for that too at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows of
stakes of piles, and in this wicker-work, all the sum-
mer, or dry season; when another business took me up
more time than it could be imagined I could spare.

SEA-FOWL—CATCH A YOUNG KID WHICH I TAME—
RETURN TO MY OLD HABITATION—GREAT PLAGUE
WITH MY HARVEST.
I MENTIONED before that I had a great mind to see
the whole island, and that I had travelled up the
brook, and so on to where I built my bower, and
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite across to the sea-shore on that side. So, tak-
ing my gun and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger
quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two
139
biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my
pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When
I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as
above, I came within view of the sea, to the west;
and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land,
whether an island or continent I could not tell; but
it lay very high, extending from the west, to the
W.S.W. at a very great distance; by my guess it
could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might
be, otherwise than that I knew it must be part of
America; and as I concluded by all my observa-
tions, must be near the Spanish dominions, and
perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where if I
should have landed, I had been in a worse condition
than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the
dispositions of Providence, which I began now to
own, and to believe ordered everything for the best;
I say, I quieted my mind with this, and left afflicting
myself with fruitless wishes of being there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con-
sidered that if this land was the Spanish coast, I
should certainly, one time or other, see some vessels
pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then it
was the savage coast between the Spanish country
and Brazil, which were indeed the worst of savages;
for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and fail not to
murder and devour all the human bodies that fall
into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island where I
now was much pleasanter than mine, the open or
savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass,
and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of
parrots, and fain would I have caught one, if possible,
to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to
me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young
parrot; for I knocked it down with a stick, and
having recovered it, I brought it home, but it was
some years before I could make him speak. How-
ever, at last I taught him to call me by my name
very familiarly: but the accident that followed,
though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its
place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I
found in the low grounds hares, as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all the
other kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy
myself to eat them, though I killed several: but I
had no need to be venturous; for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too; especi-
ally these three sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and turtle
or tortoise; which added to my grapes, Leadenhall-
market could not have furnished a better table than
I, in proportion to the company; and though my
case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause
for thankfulness, that I was not driven to any ex-
tremities for food; but rather plenty, even to
dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so
many turns and returns, to see what discoveries I
could make, that I came weary enough to the place
where I resolved to sit down for all night; and
then either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded
myself with a row of stakes set upright in the
141
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as
no wild creature could come at me without waking
me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was sur-
prised to see that I had taken up my lot on the
worst side of the island; for here indeed the shore
was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on
the other side, I had found but three in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls
of many kinds, some of which I had not seen before,
and many of them very good meat; but such as
I knew not the names of except those called pen-
guins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot: and therefore
had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which
I could better feed on; and though there were many
goats here more than on the other side of the island,
yet it was with much more difficulty that I could
come near them; the country being flat and even,
and they saw me much sooner than when I was on
the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but yet I had not the least inclina-
tion to remove; for as I was fixed in my habitation,
it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while
I was here to be, as it were, upon a journey, and
from home: however, I travelled along the shore
of the sea towards the east, I suppose, about twelve
miles; and then setting up a great pole upon the
shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again; and the next journey I took should be on
the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round, till I came to my post again: of which
in its place.
I took another way to come back than that I went,
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much
in my view, that I could not miss finding my first
dwelling by viewing the country: but I found myself
mistaken; for, being come about two or three miles, I
found myself descended into a very large valley; but
so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with
woods, that I could not see which was my way by any
direction but that of the sun; nor even then, unless I
knew very well the position of the sun at that time of
the day.
It happened, to my further misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days while I
was in this valley; and not being able to see the sun,
I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last
was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for my post,
and come back the same way I went; and then by
easy journeys I turned homeward, the weather being
exceeding hot; and my gun, ammunition, hatchet,
and other things, very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running in to take hold of it,
caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I had a
great mind to bring it home, if I could: for I had
often been musing whether it might not be possible
to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame
goats, which might supply me when my powder and
shot should be spent.
I made a collar for this little creature, and with a
string which I made of some rope-yarn, which I always
carried about me, I led him along, though with some

difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there I en-
closed him, and left him, for I was very impatient to
be at home, from whence I had been absent above a
month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my ham-
mock-bed: this little wandering journey, without a
settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me,
that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a
perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it
rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I
resolved I would never go a great way from it again,
while it should be my lot to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale my-
self after my long journey; during which, most of the
time was taken up in the weightyaffair of making acage
for my Poll, who began now to be a mere domestic,
and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I
began to think of the poor kid which I had pent in
within my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch
it home, and give it some food; accordingly I went,
and found it where I left it; for indeed it could not
get out, but was almost starved for want of food. I
went and cut boughs of trees and branches of such
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and having
fed it, I tied it as I did before to lead it away; but it
was so tame with being hungry, that I had no need
to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog; and as
I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so
gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me
afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was
now come, and I kept the 30th of September in the
same solemn manner as before, being the anniver-
sary of my landing on the island, having now been
there two years, and no more prospect of being
delivered than the first day I came there. I spent
the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledg-
ments of the many wonderful mercies which my
solitary condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miserable.
I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God had
been pleased to discover to me even that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary con-
dition than I should have been in a liberty of society,
and in all the pleasures of the world: that He could
fully make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary
state, and the want of human society, by His presence,
and the communication of His grace to my soul, sup-
porting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend
upon His providence here, and hope for His eternal
presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how
much more happy the life I now led was, with all
its miserable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed,
abominable life I led all the past part of my days;
and now, having changed both my sorrows and my
joys, my very desires altered, my affections changed
their gust, and my delights were perfectly new from
what they were at first coming, or indeed for the
two years past.
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul
at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me to
think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I
was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up with
the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an unin-
habited wilderness, without redemption. In the
midst of the greatest composures of my mind, this
would break out upon me like a storm, and made
me wring my hands, and weep like a child. Some-
times it would take me in the middle of my work,
and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and
look upon the ground for an hour or two together,
and this was still worse to me; for if I could burst
out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go
off; and the grief having exhausted itself, would
abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts; I daily read the Word of God, and ap-
plied all the comforts of it to my present state.
One morning being very sad, I opened the Bible
upon these words, "I will never, never leave thee,
nor forsake thee!" Immediately it occurred that
these words were to me; why else should they be
directed in such a manner, just at the moment
when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of God and man?"Well, then," said I,
"if God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence
can it be, or what matters it though the world should
all forsake me; seeing, on the other hand, if I had
all the world, and should lose the favour and bless-
ing of God, there would be no comparison in the
loss?"
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was pro-
VOL. I. K
bable I should have ever been in any other particular
state in the world; and with this thought I was
going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this
place.
I know not what it was, but something shocked
my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak
the words. "How canst thou be such a hypocrite,"
said I, even audibly, "to pretend to be thankful for
a condition, which, however thou mayest endeavour
to be contented with, thou wouldest rather pray
heartily to be delivered from?" So I stopped there;
but though I could not say I thanked God for being
there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for open-
ing my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to
see the former condition of my life, and to mourn
for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the
Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed
God for directing my friend in England, without any
order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and
for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the
wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my
third year; and though I have not given the reader
the trouble of so particular an account of my works
this year as at the first, yet in general it may be
observed that I was very seldom idle; having regu-
larly divided my time according to the several daily
employments that were before me; such as, first, my
duty to God, and reading the Scriptures, which I
constantly set apart some time for thrice every day;
secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food,
which generally took me up three hours every morn-
ing when it did not rain ; thirdly, the ordering, curing,
147
preserving, and cooking what I had killed or catched
for my supply; these took up great part of the day:
also, it is to be considered that in the middle of the
day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of
the heat was too great to stir out; so that about four
hours in the evening was all the time I could be sup-
posed to work in ; with this exception, that sometimes
I changed my hours of hunting and working, and
went to work in the morning, and abroad with my
gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may
be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work;
the many hours, which, for want of tools, want of
help, and want of skill, everything that I did took
up out of my time: for example, I was full two-and-
forty days making me a board for a long shelf, which I
wanted in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their
tools and saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of
the same tree in half a day.
My case was this: it was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my board was to be a
broad one. The tree I was three days a cutting down,
and two more a cutting off the boughs, and reducing
it to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible
hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into
chips, till it began to be light enough to move; then I
turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat, as
a board, from end to end: then, turning that side
downward, cut the other side till I brought the plank
to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both
sides. Any one may judge the labour of my hands
in such a piece of work; but labour and patience
carried me through that and many other things: I
only observe this in particular, to show the reason
why so much of my time went away with so little
work, viz., that what might be a little to be done with
help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a pro-
digious time, to do alone, and by hand.
But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour,
I went through many things, and indeed everything
that my circumstances made necessary for me to do,
as will appear by what follows.
I was now in the months of November and De-
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost one
whole crop by sowing in the dry season; but now my
crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found
I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of
several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep
from it; as first, the goats, and wild creatures which
I called hares, which, tasting the sweetness of the
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up,
and ate it so close that it could get no time to shoot
up into stalks.
This I saw no remedy for but by making an en-
closure about it with a hedge, which I did with a
great deal of toil; and the more, because it required
a great deal of speed; the creatures daily spoiling
my corn. However, as my arable land was but
small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced
in about three weeks' time, and shooting some of the
creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it
in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate,
where he would stand and bark all night long; so
149
in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the
corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen
apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn
was in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin
me now, when it was in the ear; for, going along by
the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop
surrounded with fowls of I know not how many
sorts, which stood as it were watching till I should
be gone. I immediately let fly among them (for I
always had my gun with me). I had no sooner shot,
but there arose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had
not seen at all, from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw that in
a few days they would devour all my hopes; that I
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop
at all; and what to do I could not tell: however, I
resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I
should watch it night and day. In the first place,
I went among it to see what damage was already
done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it;
but that, as it was yet too green for them, the loss
was not so great, but the remainder was like to be a
good crop, if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I was
gone away, and the event proved it to be so; for,
as I walked off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out
of their sight, but they dropped down one by one into
the corn again. I was so provoked that I could not
have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that
every grain that they ate now was, as it might be
said, a peck loaf to me in the consequence; but
coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed
three of them. This was what I wished for; so I
took them up, and served them as we serve notorious
thieves in England, viz., hanged them in chains for a
terror to others. It is impossible to imagine almost
that this should have such an effect as it had; for the
fowls would not only not come at the corn, but in
short they forsook all that part of the island, and I
could never see a bird near the place as long as my
scarecrows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my corn.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as
well as I could out of one of the broadswords, or
cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the
ship. However, as my crop was but small, I had no
great difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it
my way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried
it away in a great basket which I had made, and so
rubbed it out with my hands: and at the end of all
my harvesting, I found that out of my half-peck of
seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two
bushels and a half of barley, that is to say by my
guess, for I had no measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me;
and I foresaw that in time it would please God to
supply me with bread: and yet here I was perplexed
again; for I neither knew how to grind or make
meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part
it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it;
and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake
it. These things being added to my desire of having
a good quantity for store, and to secure a constant
supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but
to preserve it all for seed against the next season,
and in the meantime to employ all my study and
hours of working, to accomplish this great work of
providing myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly said that I now worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I believe
few people have thought much upon; viz., the strange
multitude of little things necessary in the providing,
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this
one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature,
found this to be my daily discouragement, and was
made more and more sensible of it every hour, even
after I got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as
I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a
surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by
making a wooden spade, as I observed before; but
this did my work but in a wooden manner; and
though it cost me a great many days to make it,
yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner
but made my work the harder, and made it be per-
formed much worse.
However, this I bore with too, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the badness
of the performance. When the corn was sowed, I
had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself,
and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to
scratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than
rake or harrow it.
When it was growing, or grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure
it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it home, thresh,
part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted
a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in; and
all these things I did without, as shall be observed;
and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and
advantage to me too. But all this, as I said, made
everything laborious and tedious to me, but that there
was no help for: neither was my time so much loss
to me, because I had divided it; a certain part of it
was every day appointed to these works; and as I
resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a
greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to
apply myself wholly, by labour and invention, to fur-
nish myself with utensils proper for the performing
all the operations necessary for making the corn,
when I had it, fit for my use.
But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now
seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before
I did this, I had a week's work at least to make me a
spade, which, when it was done, was a very sorry one
indeed, and very heavy, and required double labour
to work with it; however I went through that, and
sowed my seeds in two large flat pieces of ground, as
near my house as I could find them to my mind, and
fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of
which were all cut off that wood which I had set
before, which I knew would grow; so that in one
year's time I knew I should have a quick or living
hedge, that would want but little repair. This work
was not so little as to take me up less than three
months; because great part of that time was in the
wet season, when I could not go abroad.
Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following
occasion, always observing, that all the while I was
at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot,
and teaching him to speak; and I quickly learnt him
to know his own name; at last, to speak it out pretty
loud, POLL; which was the first word I ever heard
spoken in the island by any mouth but my own.
This therefore was not my work, but an assistant to
my work; for now, as I said, I had a great employ-
ment upon my hands, as follows: viz., I had long
studied, by some means or other, to make myself
some earthen vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely,
but knew not where to come at them: however, con-
sidering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but
if I could find out any such clay, I might botch up
some such pot as might, being dried by the sun, be
hard enough and strong enough to bear handling, and
to hold anything that was dry, and required to be
kept so; and as this was necessary in preparing corn,
meal, &c., which was the thing I was upon, I resolved
to make some as large as I could, and fit only to
stand like jars to hold what should be put into them.

DESCRIPTION OF MY MODE OF BAKING—BEGIN TO MAKE A BOAT—AFTER IT IS FINISHED, AM UNABLE TO GET IT DOWN TO THE WATER—SERIOUS RE-
FLECTIONS—MY INK AND BISCUIT EXHA USTED, AND

DRESS OF SKINS.
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to
raise this paste, what odd misshapen ugly things I
made, how many of them fell in, and how many fell
out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own
weight; how many cracked by the overviolent heat
of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many
fell to pieces with only removing, as well before as
after they were dried; and, in a word, how after
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to
temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not
make above two large earthen ugly things, I cannot
call them jars, in about two months' labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set them
down again in two great wicker-baskets, which I had
made on purpose for them, that they might not break;
and as between the pot and the basket there was a
little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and
barley straw; and these two pots being to stand
always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and
perhaps the meal when the corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and anything my hand turned
to; and the heat of the sun baked them strangely
hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and
bear the fire, which none of these could do. It hap-
pened after some time, making a pretty large fire for
cooking my meat, when I went to put it out, after I
had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of
my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a
stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised
to see it, and said to myself, that certainly they
might be made to burn whole if they would burn
broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so as
to make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of
a kiln such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but
I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots,
in a pile one upon another, and placed my firewood
all round it, with a great heap of embers under them:
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed that they did not crack
at all: when I saw them clear red, I let them stand
in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run;
for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted
by the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradu-
ally, till the pots began to abate of the red colour;
and watching them all night that I might not let the
fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very
pood, I will not say handsome pipkins, and two other
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired; and
one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the
sand.
After this experiment I need not say that I wanted
no sort of earthenware for my use; but I must needs
say, as to the shapes of them, they were very indiffe-
rent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of
making them, but as the children make dirt-pies, or
as a woman would make pies that never learnt to
raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly
patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one
upon the fire again with some water in it, to boil me
some meat, which I did admirably well; and with a
piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though
I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients
requisite to make it so good as I would have had
it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to
stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art
with one pair of hands. To supply this want, I was
at a great loss; for of all trades in the world I was
as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for any
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it
with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone
big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar,
157
and could find none at all except what was in the
solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut
out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hard-
ness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling
stone, which would neither bear the weight of a
heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without filling
it with sand; so after a great deal of time lost in
searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to
look out a great block of hard wood, which I found
indeed much easier; and, getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then with the
help of fire and infinite labour, made a hollow place
in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes.
After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of
the wood called the iron-wood, and this I prepared
and laid by against I had my next crop of corn, when
I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my
corn or meal to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve or scarce, to dress my meal, and part it from the bran and the
husk, without which I did not see it possible I could
have any bread. This was a most difficult thing,
so much as but to think on; for to be sure I had
nothing like the necessary things to make it with;
I mean fine thin canvass, or stuff, to scarce the meal
through. And here I was at a full stop for many
months; nor did I really know what to do: linen I
had none left but what was mere rags; I had goat's
hair, but neither knew I how to weave or spin it;
and had I known how, here were no tools to work
it with. All the remedy that I found for this was,
that at last I did remember I had among the sea-
men's clothes, which were saved out of the ship,
some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with some
pieces of these I made three small sieves, but proper
enough for the work; and thus I made shift for
some years; how I did afterwards, I shall show in
its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be con-
sidered, and how I should make bread when I came
to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast: as to that
part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not
concern myself much about it. But for an oven, I
was indeed in great pain. At length I found out an
experiment for that also, which was this: I made
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep; that
is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above
nine inches deep; these I burnt in the fire, as I had
done the others, and laid them by; and when I
wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth,
which I had paved with some square tiles of my own
making and burning also; but I should not call
them square.
When the firewood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon
this hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I let
them lie, till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping
away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves,
and whelming down the earthen pot upon them,
drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to
keep in, and add to the heat: and thus, as well as
in the best oven in the world, I baked my barley-
loaves, and became in a little time a mere pastry-
cook into the bargain; for I made myself several
cakes of the rice, and puddings; indeed I made no
pies, neither had I anything to put into them, sup-
posing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or
goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things
took me up most part of the third year of my abode
here; for it is to be observed, that in the intervals of
these things I had my new harvest and husbandry
to manage: for I reaped my corn in its season, and
carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in
the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub
it out; for I had no floor to thresh it on, or instru-
ment to thresh it with.
And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, I
really wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted
a place to lay it up in; for the increase of the corn
now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley
about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or
more; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to use
it freely, for my bread had been quite gone a great
while; also I resolved to see what quantity would
be sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow but
once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could consume
in a year: so I resolved to sow just the same quantity
every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a
quantity would fully provide me with bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing you may be
sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect
of land which I had seen from the other side of the
island; and I was not without secret wishes that I
was on shore there, fancying that seeing the mainland
and an inhabited country, I might find some way or
other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last
find some means of escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I
might have reason to think far worse than the lions
and tigers of Africa: that if I once came into their
power, I should run a hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten;
for I had heard that the people of the Carribbean
coasts were cannibals, or men-eaters; and I knew by
the latitude that I could not be far off from that
shore; that suppose they were not cannibals, yet
they might kill me, as many Europeans who had
fallen into their hands had been served, even when
they had been ten or twenty together; much more I
that was but one, and could make little or no defence.
All these things, I say, which I ought to have con-
sidered well of, and I did cast up in my thoughts
afterwards, yet took none of my apprehensions at
first; and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts
of getting over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat
with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but
this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and
look on our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was
blown up upon the shore a great way in the storm,
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where
she did at first, but not quite; and was turned by the
force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom up-
wards, against the high ridge of a beachy rough sand,
but no water about her as before.
161
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have
launched her into the water, the boat would have
done well enough, and I might have gone back into
the Brazils with her easy enough; but I might have
easily foreseen that I could no more turn her, and
set her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove
the island. However, I went to the wood, and cut
levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, re-
solving to try what I could do; suggesting to myself,
that if I could but turn her down, I might easily
repair the damage she had received, and she would
be a very good boat, and I might go to sea in her
very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it;
at last, finding it impossible to heave it up with my
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand to
undermine it; and so to make it fall down, setting
pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the
fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it
up again, or to get under it, much less to move it
forwards towards the water; so I was forced to give
it over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the
boat, my desire to venture over for the main increased,
rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed
impossible.
This at length set me upon thinking whether it
was not possible to make myself a canoe or periagua,
such as the natives of those climates make, even
without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz.,
of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought
possible, but easy; and pleased myself extremely
VOL. L L
with my thoughts of making it, and with my having
much more convenience for it than any of the negroes
or Indians; but not at all considering the particular
inconveniences which I lay under more than the
Indians did, viz., want of hands to move it into the
water when it was made; a difficulty much harder
for me to surmount than all the consequences of want
of tools could be to them; for what was it to me,
that when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I
might with great trouble cut it down, if after I might
be able with my tools to hew and dub the outside
into a proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out
the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of
it, if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I
found it, and was not able to launch it into the
water?
One would have thought I could not have had
the least reflection upon my mind of my circum-
stances, while I was making this boat, but I should
have immediately thought how I should get it into
the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon my
voyage over the sea in it, that I never once con-
sidered how I should get it off the land; and it was
really in its own nature more easy for me to guide
it over forty-five miles of sea, than about forty-five
fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the
water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a
fool that ever man did, who had any of his senses
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake
it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
came often into my head; but I put a stop to my
163
own inquiries into it by this foolish answer, which
I gave myself; "Let me first make it, I'll warrant
I'll find some way or other to get it along when it is
done."
This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I
went, and felled a cedar tree: I question much
whether Solomon ever had such a one for the
building the temple at Jerusalem. It was five feet
ten inches diameter at the lower part next the stump,
and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of
twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for awhile,
and then parted into branches. It was not without
infinite labour that I felled this tree; I was twenty
days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was
fourteen more getting the branches and limbs, and the
vast spreading head of it, cut off: which I hacked and
hewed through with my axe and hatchet, with in-
expressible labour; after this it cost me a month to
shape it, and dub it to a proportion, and to something
like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as
it ought to do. It cost me near three months more to
clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an
exact boat of it: this I did indeed without fire, by mere
mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till
I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and
big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and
consequently big enough to have carried me and all
my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it: the boat was really much
bigger than I ever saw a canoe or periagua, that
was made of one tree, in my life; many a weary
stroke it had cost, you may be sure, for there re-
mained nothing but to get it into the water; and
had I gotten it into the water, I made no question
but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and
the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was
undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed
me, though they cost infinite labour too; it lay
about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up
hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface
of the earth, and so make a declivity; this I began,
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but who
grudge pains that have their deliverance in view?
but when this was worked through, and this difficulty
managed, it was still much at one; for I could no
more stir the canoe than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up
to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe
down to the water: well I began this work, and
when I began to enter into it, and calculated how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff to
be thrown out, I found, that by the number of hands
I had, being none but my own, it must have been
ten or twelve years before I should have gone through
with it; for the shore lay high, so that at the upper
end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so
at length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this
attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the
same devotion, and with as much comfort as ever
before; for, by a constant study, and serious appli-
cation of the Word of God, and by the assistance of
His grace, I gained a different knowledge from what
I had before; I entertained different notions of
things; I looked now upon the world as a thing
remote, which I had nothing to do with, no expecta-
tion from, and indeed no desires about: in a word,
I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever
like to have; so I thought it looked as we may per-
haps look upon it hereafter; viz., as a place I had
lived in, but was come out of it; and well I might
say, as father Abraham to Dives, "Between me and
thee there is a great gulf fixed."
In the first place, I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here: I had neither the lust
of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life;
I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was now
capable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor,
or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor
over the whole country which I had possession of;
there was no rival; I had no competitor, none to
dispute sovereignty or command with me; I might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use
for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough
for my occasion: I had tortoises or turtles enough;
but now and then one was as much as I could put to
any use; I had timber enough to have built a fleet
of ships; I had grapes enough to have made wine,
or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet
when they had been built.
But all I could make use of, was all that was
valuable: I had enough to eat, and to supply my
wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed
more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or
the vermin; if I sowed more corn than I could eat,
it must be spoiled. The trees that I cut down were
lying to rot on the ground, I could make no more
use of them than for fuel; and that I had no occa-
sion for, but to dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the
good things of this world are no further good to us,
than as they are for our use: and that whatever we
may heap up indeed to give to others, we enjoy
as much as we can use, and no more. The most
covetous griping miser in the world would have been
cured of the vice of covetousness, if he had been
in my case; for I possessed infinitely more than I
knew what to do with. I had no room for desire,
except it was of things which I had not, and they
were but trifles, though indeed of great use to me.
I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well
gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling: alas!
there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no
manner of business for it; and I often thought with
myself, that I would have given a handful of it for a
gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my
corn; nay, I would have given it all for sixpenny
worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England,
or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of
ink: as it was I had not the least advantage by it,
167
or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer,
and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave, in
the wet season; and if I had had the drawer full of
diamonds, it had been the same case; and they had
been of no manner of value to me, because of no
use.
I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier
to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently
sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and admired
the hand of God's providence, which had thus spread
my table in the wilderness; I learnt to look more
upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon
the dark side; and to consider what I enjoyed, rather
than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes
such secret comforts, that I cannot express them;
and which I take notice of here, to put those dis-
contented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy
comfortably what God hath given them, because
they see and covet something that He has not given
them: all our discontents about what we want, ap-
peared to me to spring from the want of thankfulness
for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall
into such distress as mine was; and this was, to
compare my presentcondition with what I at first
expected it should be; nay, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good providence of God
had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up
near to the shore, where I not only could come at
her, but could bring what I got out of her to the
shore for my relief and comfort; without which I
had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence, or
gunpowder and shot for getting my food.
I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in
representing to myself, in the most lively colours,
how I must have acted, if I had got nothing out of
the ship; how I could not have so much as got any
food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it was
long before I found any of them, I must have
perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not
perished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed a
goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no way to
flay or open them, or part the flesh from the skin
and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it
with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a
beast.
These reflections made me very sensible of the
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful for
my present condition, with all its hardships and mis-
fortunes: and this part also I cannot but recommend
to the reflection of those who are apt in their misery
to say, Is any affliction like mine? Let them con-
sider how much worse the cases of some people are,
and what their case might have been, if Providence
had thought fit.
I had another reflection which assisted me also to
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was compar-
ing my present condition with what I had deserved,
and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of
Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly
destitute of the knowledge and fear of God; I had
been well instructed by father and mother; neither
had they been wanting to me in their early endea-
vours to infuse a religious awe of God into my mind,
169
a sense of my duty, and of what the nature and end
of my being required of me. But, alas! falling early
into the seafaring life, which of all the lives is the
most destitute of the fear of God, though His terrors
are always before them; I say, falling early into the
seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that
little sense of religion which I had entertained, was
laughed out of me by my messmates; by a hardened
despising of dangers, and the views of death, which
grew habitual to me; by my long absence from all
manner of opportunities to converse with anything
but what was like myself, or to hear anything of
what was good, or tended towards it.
So void was I of everything that was good, or of
the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in
the greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my escape
from Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese
master of the ship, my being planted so well in Brazil,
my receiving the cargo from England, and the like, I
never once had the words, Thank God, so much as
on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest
distress had I so much thought as to pray to Him;
nor so much as to say, Lord, have mercy upon me!
no, not to mention the name of God, unless it was to
swear by, and blaspheme it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account
of my wicked and hardened life past; and when I
looked about me, and considered what particular
providences had attended me, since my coming into
this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with
me; had not only punished me less than my iniquity
deserved, but had so plentifully provided for me;
this gave me great hopes that my repentance was
accepted, and that God had yet mercies in store for
me.
With these reflections I worked my mind up, not
only to resignation to the will of God in the present
disposition of my circumstances, but even to a sincere
thankfulness of my condition; and that I, who was
yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had
not the due punishment of my sins; that I en-
joyed so many mercies, which I had no reason to
have expected in that place, that I ought never
more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and
to give daily thanks for that daily bread which
nothing but a cloud of wonders could have brought;
that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a
miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by
ravens; nay, by a long series of miracles; and that
I could hardly have named a place in the uninhabited
part of the world, where I could have been cast more
to my advantage: a place, where as I had no society,
which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no
ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers to threaten
my life; no venomous creatures or poisonous, which
I might have fed on to my hurt; no savages to
murder and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way,
so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted
nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able to
make my sense of God's goodness to me, and care
over me in this condition, be my daily consolation;
and after I made a just improvement of these things,
I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things
171
which I brought on shore for my help, were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with
water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce
left any appearance of black upon the paper: as long
as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the days
of the month on which any remarkable thing hap-
pened to me; and first, by casting up times past
I remembered that there was a strange concurrence
of days, in the various providences which befell me,
and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined
to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have
had reason to have looked upon with a great deal
of curiosity.
First, I had observed, that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran
away to Hull in order to go to sea, the same day
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and
made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of the
wreck of the ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day
of the year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee
in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz., the
2Oth of September, the same day I had my life so
miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I
was cast on shore in this island; so that my wicked
life, and solitary life, both began on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that
of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought out
of the ship. This I had husbanded to the last degree,
allowing myself but one cake of bread a day, for
above a year: and yet I was quite without bread
for a year before I got any corn of my own; and
great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at
all, the getting it being, as has been already observed,
next to miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to
linen, I had none a good while, except some che-
quered shirts which I found in the chests of the other
seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because
many times I could bear no other clothes on but a
shirt; and it was a very great help to me, that I had
among all the men's clothes of the ship almost three
dozen of shirts. There were also several thick watch-
coats of the seamen, which were left behind, but they
were too hot to wear; and though it is true that the
weather was so violent hot that there was no need
of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked: no, though
I had been inclined to it, which I was not; nor could
I abide the thought of it, though I was all alone.
One reason why I could not go quite naked was,
I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
quite naked as with some clothes on; nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a
shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whist-
ling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without
it; no more could I ever bring myself to go out in
the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat; the heat
of the sun beating with such violence as it does in
that place, would give me the headache presently, by
darting so directly on my head, without a cap or hat
on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on
my hat, it would presently go away.
Upon these views I began to consider about put-
173
ting the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into
some order: I had worn out all the waistcoats I had,
and my business was now to try if I could not make
jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by
me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set
to work a-tailoring, or rather indeed a-botching; for
I made most piteous work of it. However, I made
shift to make two or three waistcoats, which I hoped
would serve me a great while; as for breeches or
drawers, I made but very sorry shift indeed till
afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the
creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and
I had hung them up stretched out with sticks in the
sun; by which means some of them were so dry and
hard, that they were fit for little; but others, it seems,
were very useful. The first thing I made of these
was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the
outside to shoot off the rain: and this I performed
so well, that after this I made a suit of clothes wholly
of those skins; that is to say, a waistcoat and breeches
open at the knees, and both loose; for they were
rather wanted to keep me cool than to keep me
warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they
were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter,
I was a worse tailor; however, they were such as I
made a very good shift with; and when I was abroad,
if it happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and
cap being outmost, I was kept very dry.
After this, I spent a deal of time and pains to
make me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want
of one, and had a great mind to make one: I had
seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very
useful in the great heats which are there; and I felt
the heats every jot as great here, and greater too,
being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged
to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me,
as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of
pains at it, and was a great while before I could
make anything likely to hold; nay, after I thought
I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I
made one to my mind, but at last I made one that
answered indifferently well. The main difficulty I
found was to make it to let down: I could make it
to spread; but if it did not let down too, and draw in,
it would not be portable for me any way, but just
over my head, which would not do. However, at
last, as I said, I made one to answer; I covered it
with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the
rain like a penthouse, and kept off the sun so effec-
tually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the
weather, with greater advantage than I could before
in the coolest; and when I had no need of it, I could
close it and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed by resigning to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal ef His
providence: this made my life better than sociable;
for, when I began to regret the want of conversation,
I would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutu-
ally with my own thoughts, and as I hope I may
say, with even my Maker, by ejaculations and
petitions, was not better than the utmost enjoyment
of human society in the world?
I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any
extraordinary thing happened to me; but I lived
175
on in the same course, in the same posture and place,
just as before. The chief thing I was employed in,
besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I always
kept up just enough to have a sufficient stock of the
year's provisions beforehand; I say, besides this
yearly labour, and my daily labour of going out with
my gun, I had one labour to make me a canoe, which
at last I finished: so that by digging a canal to it,
six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the
creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, that was
so vastly big, as I made it without considering before-
hand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to launch
it; so, never being able to bring it to the water, or
bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where
it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser next
time. Indeed, the next time, though I could not get
a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could
not get the water to it, at any less distance than, as I
have said, of near half a mile; yet as I saw it was
practicable at last, I never gave it over; and though
I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged
my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea
at last.
CHAPTER X.
1 SUCCEED IN GETTING A CANOE AFLOAT, AND SET OUT ON
A VOYAGE IN THE SIXTH YEAR OF MY REIGN, OR CAP-
TIVITY—BLOWN OUT TO SEA—REACH THE SHORE WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY—FALL ASLEEP, AND AM AWAKENED BY A VOICE CALLING MY NAME—DEVISE VARIOUS SCHEMES TO TAME GOATS, AND AT LAST
SUCCEED.
HOWEVER, though my little periagua was finished,
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the
design which I had in view, when I made the first;
I mean of venturing over to the Terra Firma, where
it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as I
had a boat, my next design was to make a tour
round the island : for, as I had been on the other
side, in one place, crossing, as I have already de-
scribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that journey made me very eager to see the other
parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I thought
of nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do everything
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail to it out of some
of the pieces of the ship's sails, which lay in store, and
of which I had a great store by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
I found she would sail very well. Then I made little
177
lockers and boxes at each end of my boat, to put
provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, &c., into, to
be kept dry either from rain, or the spray of the sea;
and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside of
the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to
hang down over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern,
like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the
heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus I
every now and then took a little voyage upon the
sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little
creek; but at last, being eager to view the circum-
ference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my
tour, and accordingly I victualled my ship for the
voyage; putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes
I should rather call them) of barley-bread; an
earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I ate a great
deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder
with shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats,
of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved
out of the seamen's chests; these I took, one to lie
upon, and the other to cover me in the night.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I
set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer
than I expected; for though the island itself was
not very large, yet when I came to the east side of
it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two
leagues into the sea, some above water, some under
it; and beyond this a shoal of sand, lying dry half
a league more: so that I was obliged to go a great
way out to sea to double that point.
When I first discovered them, I was going to give
VOL. L M
over my enterprise, and come back again, not know-
ing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and,
above all, doubting how I should get back again; so
I came to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of
an anchor, with a peace of broken grappling which
I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and
went on shore, climbing up a hill, which seemed to
overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of
it; and resolved to venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood,
I perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious
current, which ran to the east, even came close to
the point; and I took the more notice of it, because
I saw there might be some danger, that when I came
into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength
of it, and not be able to make the island again.
And indeed, had I not gotten first upon this hill,
I believe it would have been so; for there was the
same current on the other side of the island, only
that it set off at a farther distance; and I saw there
was a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing
to do but to get out of the first current, and I should
presently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; because the wind
blowing pretty fresh (at E.S.E., and that being just
contrary to the said current), made a great breach
of the sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for
me to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor
to go too far off because of the stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over-night, the sea was calm, and I ventured:
but I am a warning-piece again to all rash and igno-
179
rant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point,
when I was not my boat's length from the shore, but
I found myself in a great depth of water, and a cur-
rent like a sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along
with it with such violence, that all I could do could
not keep her so much as on the edge of it: but I
found it hurried me farther and farther out from the
eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no
wind stirring to help me, and all that I could do with
my paddles signified nothing; and now I began to
give myself over for lost; for, as the current was on
both sides the island, I knew in a few leagues'
distance they must join again, and then I was
irrecoverably gone: nor did I see any possibility of
avoiding it; so that I had no prospect before me
but of perishing; not by the sea, for that was calm
enough, but of starving for hunger. I had indeed
found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I
could lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I
had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of
my earthen pots; but what was all this to being
driven into the vast ocean, where to be sure, there
was no shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand
leagues at least?
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence
of God to make the most miserable condition that
mankind could be in, worse. Now I looked back
upon my desolate solitary island as the most pleasant
place in the world, and all the happiness my heart
could wish for was to be there again: I stretched out
my hands to it with eager wishes; "Oh happy desert!"
said I, " I shall never see thee more! Oh miserable
creature!" said I," whither am I going?" Then I re-
proached myself with my unthankful temper, and
how I had repined at my solitary condition; and
now what would I give to be on shore there again?
Thus we never see the true state of our condition
till it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor know
how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it.
It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I
was now in, being driven from my beloved island (for
so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean,
almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever
recovering it again: however, I worked hard, till
indeed my strength was almost exhausted; and kept
my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards
the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as
possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun passed
the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind
in my face, springing up from the S.S.E. This
cheered my heart a little, and especially, when in about
half an hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale.
By this time I was gotten at a frightful distance
from the island; and, had the least cloud or hazy
weather intervened, I had been undone another way
too; for I had no compass on board, and should
never have known how to have steered towards the
island, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the
weather continuing clear I applied myself to get up
my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away
to the north as much as possible, to get out of the
current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw even by the clearness
of the water some alteration of the current was near;
for where the current was so strong, the water was
foul: but perceiving the water clear, I found the
current abate, and presently I found to the east, at
about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some
rocks: these rocks I found caused the current to part
again; and as the main stress of it ran away more
southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the
other returned by the repulse of the rock, and made
a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-
west with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves just going to murder them,'or who have
been in such-like extremities, may guess what my
present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my
boat into the stream of this eddy; and the wind also
freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running
cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or
eddy under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way
back again directly towards the island, but about
two leagues more towards the northward than the
current lay, which carried me away at first; so that
when I came near the island, I found myself open
to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other
end of the island, opposite to that which I went out
from.
When I had made something more than a league
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found
it was spent, and served me no farther. However,
I found, that being between the two great currents,
viz., that on the south side which had hurried me
away, and that on the north which lay about two
leagues on the other side; I say, between these two,
in the west of the island, I found the water at least
still, and running no way; and having still a breeze
of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for
the island, though not making such fresh way as I
did before.
About four o'clock in the evening, being then
within about a league of the island, I found the point
of the rocks which occasioned this distance stretch-
ing out as is described before, to the southward, and
casting off the current more southwardly, had of
course made another eddy to the north; and this I
found very strong, not directly setting the way my
course lay, which was due west, but almost full north.
However, having a fresh gale, I stretched across this
eddy slanting north-west, and in about an hour came
within about a mile of the shore, where, it being
smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave
God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and
refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had
espied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep,
being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew
too much the cause, to think of attempting it by the
way I went out; and what might be at the other
side (I mean the west side), I knew not, nor had I
any mind to run any more ventures; so I only re-
solved in the morning to make my way westward
along the shore, and to see if there was no creek
where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to
have her again if I wanted her. In about three
miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to
a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet, or brook,
where I found a convenient harbour for my boat,
and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock
made on purpose for her; here I put in, and having
stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to look
about me, and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place
where I had been before when I travelled on foot to
that shore; so, taking nothing out of my boat but
my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot,
I began my march: the way was comfortable enough
after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached
my old bower in the evening, where I found every-
thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in
good order, being, as I said before, my country-
house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the
shade to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and
fell asleep; but judge if you can, you that read my
story, what a surprise I must be in, when I was
awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by my
name several times, " Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe,
poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe?
Where are you? Where have you been?"
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of
the day, and walking the latter part, that I did not
awake thoroughly; and dozing between sleeping and
waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to
me; but as the voice continued to repeat Robin
Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to awake more
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and
started up in the utmost consternation: but no
sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Pol sitting
on the top of the hedge, and immediately knew that
this was he that spoke to me; for just in such be-
moaning language I had used to talk to him, and
teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that
he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to
my face, and cry, "Poor Robin Crusoe, where are
you? Where have you been? How came you here?"
and such things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot,
and that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a
good while before I could compose myself. First, I
was amazed how the creature got thither, and then
how he should just keep about the place, and nowhere
else: but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody
but honest Pol, I got it over; and holding out my
hand, and calling him by his name, Pol, the sociable
creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he
used to do, and continued talking to me, Poor Robin
Crusoe, and, how did I come here? and, where had I
been? just as if he had been overjoyed to see me
again; and so I carried him home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some
time, and had enough to do for many days to sit still
and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I would
have been very glad to have had my boat again on
my side of the island, but I knew not how it was
practicable to get it about: as to the east side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart
would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to
think of it: and to the other side of the island, I did
not know how it might be there; but supposing the
current ran with the same force against the shore
at the east, as it passed by it on the other, I might
run the same risk of being driven down the stream,
and carried by the island, as I had been before of
being carried away from it. So with these thoughts
I contented myself to be without any boat, though it
had been the product of so many months' labour to
make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained near
a year, lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may
well suppose; and my thoughts being very much
composed as to my condition, and fully comforted
in resigning myself to the dispositions of Providence,
I thought I lived really very happily in all things,
except that of society.
I improved myself in-this time in all the mechanic
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying
myself to; and I believe could, upon occasion, have
made a very good carpenter, especially considering
how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection
in my earthenware, and contrived well enough to
make them with a wheel, which I found infinitely
easier and better; because I made things round and
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for anything I found
out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe;
and though it was a very ugly clumsy thing when it
was done, and only burnt red like other earthenware,
yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the
smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; for I
had been always used to smoke, and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards when
I searched the ship again, I could not come at any
pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention showed me, though not very handsome, yet
convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching
things home in. For example, if I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress
it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket:
and the like by a turtle; I could cut it up, take out
the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh, which was
enough for me, and bring them home in a basket,
and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep baskets
were my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept it in
great baskets instead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated consider-
ably ; and this was a want which it was impossible for
me to supply, and I began seriously to consider what
I must do when I should have no more powder; that
is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I had, as
I observed, in the third year of my being here, kept
a young kid, and bred her tame; I was in hopes of
getting a he-kid, but I could not by any means bring
it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I could
never find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last
of mere age.
187
But being now in the eleventh year of my residence,
and, as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I
set myself to study some art to trap and snare the
goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them
alive; and particularly I wanted a she-goat great
with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them,
and believe they were more than once taken in them;
but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and
always found them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I had
observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits
I placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them; and several times I put ears of
barley, and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I
could easily perceive, that the goats had gone in, and
eaten up the corn, that I could see the mark of their
feet; at length, I set three traps in one night, and
going the next morning, I found them all standing,
and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very dis-
couraging; however, I altered my trap; and, not to
trouble you with particulars, going one morning to
see my traps, I found in one of them a large old he-
goat; and, in one of the other three kids, a male and
two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him;
he was so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him;
that is to say, to go about to bring him away alive,
which was what I wanted. I could have killed him,
but that was not my business, nor would it answer
my end; so I e'en let him out, and he ran away as if
he had been frightened out of his wits; but I did not
then know what I afterwards learnt, that hunger would
tame a lion: if I had let him stay there three or four
days without food, and then have carried him some
water to drink, and then a little corn, he would have
been as tame as one of the kids; for they are mighty
sagacious tractable creatures, where they are well
used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no
better at that time: then I went to the three kids;
and, taking them one by one, I tied them with strings
together; and with some difficulty brought them all
home.
It was a good while before they would feed; but
throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame: and now I found, that
if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh,
when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some
up tame was my only way, when perhaps I might
have them about my house like a flock of sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I must
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would
always run wild when they grew up; and the only
way for this was to have some enclosed piece of
ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to
keep them up so effectually, that those within might
not break out, or those without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of
hands; yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity
of doing it, my first piece of work was to find out a
proper piece of ground; viz., where there was likely
to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to
drink, and cover to keep them from the sun. Those who understand such enclosures, will think
189
I had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a
place very proper for all these, being a plain open
piece of meadow-land or savannah (as our people
call it in the western colonies), which had two or
three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end
was very woody; I say they will smile at my fore-
cast, when I shall tell them I began my enclosing
of this piece of ground in such a manner that my
hedge or pale must have been at least two miles
about: nor was the madness of it so great as to the
compass; for if it was ten miles about, I was like to
have time enough to do it in; but I did not consider,
that my goats would be as wild in so much compass,
as if they had had the whole island; and I should
have so much room to chase them in, that I should
never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to
me; so I presently stopped short, and for the first
beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of about one
hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as
many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as
my flock increased, I could add more ground to my
enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done it, I
tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and
used them to feed as near me as possible, to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and
feed them out of my hand;, so that after my enclo-
sure was finished, and I let them loose, they would
follow me up and down, bleating after me for a
handful of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and a
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all;
and in two years more I had three-and-forty, besides
several that I took and killed for my food; and after
that I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed
them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take
them as I wanted them; and gates out of one piece
of ground into another.
But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing
which indeed in my beginning I did not so much as
think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,
was really an agreeable surprise; for now I set up
my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk
in a day. And as nature, who gives supplies of food
to every creature, dictates even naturally how to
make use of it; so I, that never milked a cow, much
less a goat, or saw butter or cheese made, very
readily and handily, though after a great many essays
and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese
at last, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat His
creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can
He sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us
cause to praise Him for dungeons and prisons! What
a table was here spread for me in a wilderness, where
I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!
It would have made a stoic smile to have seen
me and my little family sit down to dinner: there
191
was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole
island; I had the lives of all my subjects at absolute
command; I could hang, draw, give life and liberty
and take it away, and no rebels among all my sub-
jects.
Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone,
attended by my servants! Pol, as if he had been my
favourite, as the only person permitted to talk to me;
my dog, which was now grown very old and crazy,
and found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat
always at my right hand; and two cats, one on one
side the table, and one on the other, expecting now
and then a bit from my hand as a mark of special
favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at first; for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my habitation by my own
hands; but one of them having multiplied by I know
not what kind of creature, these were two which I
preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild into the
woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at
last; for they would often come into my house, and
plunder me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot
them, and did kill a great many: at length they left
me. With this attendance, and in this plentiful
manner, I lived; neither could I be said to want
anything but society, and of that, in some time
after this, I was like to have too much.
CHAPTER XI.
DESCRIPTION OF MY FIGURE—ALSO OF MY DWELLING AND ENCLOSURES DREADFUL ALARM ON SEEING THE
PRINT OF A MAN'S FOOT ON THE SHORE REFLECTIONS
TAKE EVERY POSSIBLE MEASURE OF PRECAUTION.
I WAS something impatient, as I had observed, to
have the use of my boat, though very loath to run
any more hazard; and therefore sometimes I sat
contriving ways to get her about the island, and at
other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my
mind to go down to the point of the island, where,
as I have said in my last ramble, I went up the hill
to see how the shore lay, and how the current set,
that I might see what I had to do. This inclination
increased upon me every day, and at length I resolved
to travel thither by land, and following the edge of
the shore, I did so: but had any one in England
been to meet such a man as I was, it must either
have frighted them, or raised a great deal of laughter;
and as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I
could not but smile at the notion of my travelling
through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such
a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure as
follows:
I had a great high shapeless cap made of goat's
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to
keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain off from
running into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in
these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the
clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts
coming down to about the middle of my thighs; and
a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same: the
breeches were made of a skin of an old he-goat,
whose hair hung down such a length on either side
that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my
legs. Stockings and shoes I had none; but I had
made me a pair of something, I scarce knew what to
call them, like buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace
on either side like spatterdashes; but of a most
barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my
clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the same, instead
of buckles; and in a kind of a frog on either side of
this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little
saw and a hatchet; one on one side, one on the
other: I had another belt, not so broad, and fastened
in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder;
and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two
pouches, both made of goat's skin too; in one of
which hung my powder, in the other my shot: at my
back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun,
and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin
umbrella; but which, after all, was the most neces-
sary thing I had about me, next to my gun. As for
my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-
like as one might expect from a man not at all care-
ful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the
equinox. My beard I had once suffered to grow till
it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had
VOL. I. N
both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty
short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I saw
at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear such, though
the Turks did: of these mustachios, or whiskers, I
will not say they were long enough to hang my hat
upon them; but they were of length and shape mon-
strous enough, and such as in England would have
passed for frightful.
But all this is by the by: for as to my figure, I
had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner
of consequence; so I say no more to that part. In
this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was
out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-
shore, directly to the place where I first brought my
boat to an anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and
having no boat now to take care of, I went over the
land a nearer way, to the same height that I was
upon before; when looking forward to the point of
the rock which lay out, and which I was to double
with my boat, as I said above, I was surprised to
see the sea all smooth and quiet; no rippling, no
motion, no current, any more there than in other
places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and re-
solved to spend some time in the observing of it, to
see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occa-
sioned it: but I was presently convinced how it was;
viz., that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and
joining with the current of waters from some great
river on the shore, must be the occasion of this
current, and that according as the wind blew more
forcible from the west, or from the north, this current
came near, or went farther from the shore; for, wait-
ing thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock
again, and then, the tide of ebb being made, I plainly
saw the current again as before, only that it ran
farther off, being near half a league from the shore;
whereas, in my case, it set close upon the shore, and
hurried me in my canoe along with it, which at
another time it would not have done.
This observation convinced me that I had nothing
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of
the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about
the island again: but when I began to think of put-
ting it in practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits
at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that
I could not think of it again with any patience; but
on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which
was more safe, though more laborious; and this was
that I would build, or rather make me another peria-
gua, or canoe; and so have one for one side of the
island, and one for the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under
the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this
time I had enlarged into several apartments or caves,
one within another. One of these, which was the
driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my
wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond where my
wall joined to the rock, was all filled up with large
earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and
with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would
hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my
stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the
ear cut off short from the straw, and the other rubbed
out with my hands.
As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and spread so very much,
that there was not the least appearance, to any one's
view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two
pieces of corn-ground; which I kept duly cultivated
and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest
in its season: and whenever I had occasion for more
corn, I had more land adjoining, as fit as that.
Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there also; for first, I had
my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair;
that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled it in, con-
stantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder stand-
ing always in the inside; I kept the trees, which at
first were no more than stakes, but were now grown
very firm and tall,—I kept them always so cut, that
they might spread and grow thick and wild, and
make the more agreeable shade, which they did
effectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had
my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail
spread over poles set up for that purpose, and which
never wanted any repair or renewing; and under
this I had made me a squab or couch, with the skins
of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft
things, and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged
to our sea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great
watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had
197
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up
my country habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my
cattle, that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose
this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
lest the goats should break through, that I never left
off till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of
the edge so full of small stakes, and so near to one
another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and
there was scarce room to put a hand through be-
tween them, which afterwards, when those stakes
grew, as they all did in the next rainy season, made
the enclosure strong, like a wall; indeed, stronger
than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever
appeared necessary for my comfortable support; for
I considered the keeping up a breed of tame crea-
tures thus at my hand, would be a living magazine of
flesh, milk, butter, and cheese, for me, as long as I
lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and
that keeping them in my reach depended entirely
upon my perfecting my enclosures, to such a degree
that I might be sure of keeping them together;
which by this method indeed I so effectually secured,
that when these little stakes began to grow, I had
planted them so very thick, I was forced to pull
some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter store of
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable
only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and re-
freshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half-way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my
boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my way
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and
I kept all things about or belonging to her in very
good order: sometimes I went out in her to divert
myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go,
nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the
shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out of
my knowledge again by the currents, or winds, or any
other accident. But now I come to a new scene of
my life.
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very
plain to be seen in the sand: I stood like one thunder-
struck, or as if I had seen an apparition; I listened,
I looked round me, I could hear nothing, nor see
anything; I went up to a rising ground to look
farther; I went up the shore and down the shore,
but it was all one, I could see no other impression
but that one; I went to it again to see if there were
any more, and to observe if it might not be my
fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was
exactly the very print of a foot, toes, heel, and every
part of a foot; how it came thither I knew not, nor
could in the least imagine. But after innumerable
fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused
and out of myself, I came home to my fortification,
not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but
199
terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at
every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and
tree, and fancing every stump at a distance to be a
man; nor is it possible to describe how many various
shapes an affrighted imagination represented things
to me in; how many wild ideas were formed every
moment in my fancy, and what strange unaccount-
able whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued;
whether I went over by the ladder, as first con-
trived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I
called a door, I cannot remember; for never frighted
hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror
of mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night; the farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my appre-
hensions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so em-
barrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to
myself, even though I was now a great way off it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil; and
reason joined in with me upon this supposition. For
how should any other thing in human shape come
into the place? Where was the vessel that brought
them? What marks were there of any other foot-
steps? And how was it possible a man should come
there? But then to think that Satan should take
human shape upon him in such a place, where there
could be no manner of occasion for it but to leave
the print of his foot behind him, and that even for
no purpose too (for he could not be sure I should
see it), this was an amazement the other way: I
considered that the devil might have found out
abundance of other ways to have terrified me than
this of the single print of a foot; that, as I lived
quite on the other side of the island, he would never
have been so simple to leave a mark in a place where
it was ten thousand to one whether I should ever see
it or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of
the sea upon a high wind would have defaced entirely.
All this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and
with all notions we usually entertain of the subtlety
of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue
me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil.
And I presently concluded that it must be some more
dangerous creature; viz., that it must be some of the
savages of the mainland over against me, who had
wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either driven
by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made the
island, and had been on shore, but were gone away
again to sea, being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed
in this desolate island as I would have been to have
had them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my
mind, I was very thankful in my thought, that I
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,
or that they did not see my boat, by which they
would have concluded that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther
for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagina-
tion about their having found my boat, and that
there were people here; and that if so, I should
201
certainly have them come again in greater numbers
and devour me; that if it should happen so that
they should not find me, yet they would find my
enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away all my
flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for
mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all
that former confidence in God, which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of His
goodness, now vanished; as if He, that had fed me
by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by His power
the provision which He had made for me by His
goodness. I reproached myself with my uneasiness,
that I would not sow any more corn one year, than
would just serve me till the next season, as if no
accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying
the crop that was upon the ground. And this I
thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the
future to have two or three years corn beforehand,
so that, whatever might come, I might not perish
for want of bread.
How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the
life of man! And by what secret differing springs
are the affections hurried about, as differing circum-
stances present! To-day we love what to-morrow
we hate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun;
to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear; nay, even
tremble at the apprehensions of. This was exem-
plified in me at this time in the most lively manner
imaginable; for I, whose only affliction was, that I
seemed banished from human society, that I was
alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off
from mankind, and condemned to what I call a silent
life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not
worthy to be numbered among the living, or to ap-
pear among the rest of His creatures; that to have
seen one of my own species would have seemed to
me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest
blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme
blessing of salvation, could bestow; I say, that I
should now tremble at the very apprehensions of
seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground
at but the shadow, or silent appearance, of a man's
having set his foot on the island.
Such is the uneven state of human life; and it
afforded me a great many curious speculations after-
wards, when I had a little recovered my first sur-
prise: I considered that this was the station of life
the infinitely wise and good providence of God had
determined for me; that, as I could not foresee
what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this,
so I was not to dispute His sovereignty, who, as I
was His creature, had an undoubted right by crea-
tion to govern and dispose of me absolutely as He
thought fit; and who, as I was a creature who had
offended him, had likewise a judicial right to con-
demn me to what punishment He thought fit; and
that it was my part to submit to bear His indigna-
tion because I had sinned against Him.
I then reflected that God, who was not only
righteous but omnipotent, as He had thought fit
thus to punish and afflict me, so He was able to de-
liver me; that if He did not think fit to do it, it was
my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely
and entirely to His will; and, on the other hand, it
was my duty also to hope in Him, pray to Him, and
203
quietly to attend the dictates and directions of His
daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days,
nay, I may say, weeks and months; and one parti-
cular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I
cannot omit: viz., one morning early, lying in my
bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from
the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed
me very much; upon which those words of the
Scripture came into my thoughts, " Call upon me in
the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me."
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and
encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance.
When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and
opening it to read, the first words that presented to
me were, " Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer,
and He shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on
the Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort
this gave me; and in return, I thankfully laid down
the book and was no more sad, at least, not on that
occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehen-
sions, and reflections, it came into my thoughts one
day that all this might be a mere chimera of my
own, and that this foot might be the print of my own
foot, when I came on shore from my boat. This
cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade
myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else
but my own foot; and why might not I come that
way from the boat, as well as I was going that way
to the boat? Again, I considered also, that I could
by no means tell for certain where I had trod, and
where I had not; and that if at last this was only
the print of my own foot, I had played the part of
those fools who strive to make stories of spectres and
apparitions, and then are themselves frighted at them
more than anybody else.
Now I began to take courage and to peep abroad
again; for I had not stirred out of my castle for
three days and nights, so that I began to starve for
provision; for I had little or nothing within doors
but some barley-cakes and water. Then I knew that
my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually
was my evening diversion: and the poor creatures
were in great pain and inconvenience for want of
it; and indeed it almost spoiled some of them, and
almost dried up their milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief that
this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet
(and so I might be truly said to start at my own
shadow), I began to go abroad again, and went to
my country-house to milk my flock; but to see with
what fear I went forward, how often I looked be-
hind me, how I was ready every now and then to
lay down my basket and run for my life; it would
have made any one have thought I was haunted
with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately
most terribly frighted; and so indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a little
bolder, and to think there was really nothing in it
but my own imagination; but I could not persuade
myself fully of this, till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure
it by my own, and see if there was any similitude
or fitness, that I might be assured it was my own
foot. But when I came to the place first, it appeared
evident to me that when I laid up my boat I could
not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts.
Secondly, when I came to measure the mark with
my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a
great deal. Both these things filled my head with
new imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to
the highest degree; so that I shook with cold, like
one in an ague, and I went home again filled with
the belief that some man or men had been on shore
there; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, and
I might be surprised before I was aware; and what
course to take for my security I knew not.
Oh what ridiculous resolutions men take when
possessed with fear! It deprives them of the use of
those means which reason offers for their relief. The
first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down
my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the island in prospect of the same, or
the like booty; then to the simple thing of digging
up my two corn-fields, that they might not find such
a grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the
island; then to demolish my bower and tent, that
they might not see any vestiges of my habitation,
and be prompted to look farther, in order to find out
the persons inhabiting.
These were the subjects of the first night's cogita-
tion, after I was come home again, while the appre-
hensions which had so overrun my mind were fresh
upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above.
Thus, fear of danger is ten thousand times more
terrifying than danger itself when apparent to the
eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater by
much than the evil which we are anxious about:
but, which was worse than all this, I had not that
relief in this trouble from the resignation I used to
practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought,
like Saul, who complained not only that the Philis-
tines were upon him, but that God had forsaken
him; for I did not now take due ways to compose
my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and rest-
ing upon His providence, as I had done before, for
my defence and deliverance; which if I had done,
I had, at least, been more cheerfully supported under
this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it
with more resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking
all night; but in the morning I fell asleep, and
having, by the amusement of my mind, been, as it
were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very
soundly, and awaked much better composed than I
had ever been before. And now I began to think
sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with myself,
I concluded, that this island, which was so exceeding
pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the mainland
than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned
as I might imagine: that although there were no
stated inhabitants who lived on the spot; yet that
there might sometimes come boats off from the shore,
who either with design, or perhaps never but when
they were driven by cross winds, might come to this
place.
That I had lived here fifteen years now, and had
207
not met with the least shadow or figure of any people
before; and that if at any time they should be driven
here, it was probable they went away again as soon
as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit
to fix there upon any occasion, to this time.
That the most I could suggest any danger from,
was from any such casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against
their wills; so they made no stay here, but went
off again with all possible speed, seldom staying one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of
the tides and daylight back again; and that there-
fore I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe
retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon
the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my
cave so large, as to bring a door through again,
which door, as I said, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely con-
sidering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a
second fortification, in the manner of a semicircle,
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted
a double row of trees about twelve years before, of
which I made mention: these trees having been
planted so thick before, there wanted but a few piles
to be driven between them, that they should be
thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon
finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and everything I could think of to make it strong;
having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might
put my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened
my wall to about ten feet thick, continually bringing
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the
wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven
holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I
took notice that I got seven on shore out of the ship;
these, I say, I planted like my cannon, and fitted
them into frames that held them like a carriage, that
so I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes'
time. This wall I was many a weary month in
finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it
was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground without
my wall, for a great way every way, as full with stakes
or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt
to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch that I be-
lieve I might set in near twenty thousand of them,
leaving a pretty large space between them and my
wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and
they might have no shelter from the young trees, if
they attempted to approach my outer wall.
Thus in two years' time I had a thick grove; and
in five or six years' time I had a wood before my
dwelling, grown so monstrous thick and strong, that
it was indeed perfectly impassible; and no man of
what kind soever would ever imagine that there was
anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As for
the way I proposed myself to go in and out (for I left
no avenue), it was by setting two ladders; one to a
part of the rock which was low, and then broke in,
and left room to place another ladder upon that; so
when the two ladders were taken down, no man
living could come down to me without mischiefing
209
himself; and if they had come down, they were still
on the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence
could suggest for my own preservation; and it will
be seen at length that they were not altogether
without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at
that time more than my mere fear suggested.
While this was doing, I was not altogether careless
of my other affairs; for I had a great concern upon
me for my little herd of goats; they were not only
a present supply to me upon every occasion, and
began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of
powder and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my
hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose
the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse
up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
think but of two ways to preserve them: one was to
find another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and
the other was to enclose two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and as much concealed
as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young goats in each place; so that if any disaster
happened to the flock in general, I might be able to
raise them again with little trouble and time: and
this, though it would require a great deal of time
and labour, I thought was the most rational design.
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon
one which was as private indeed as my heart could
wish; for it was a little damp piece of ground in
the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as VOL. I. O
is observed, I almost lost myself once before, en-
deavouring to come back that way from the eastern
part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of
land near three acres, so surrounded with woods
that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least
it did not want near so much labour to make it so,
as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard
at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground, and in less than a month's time I had so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first
they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it. So without any further delay, I re-
moved ten she-goats and two he-goats to this piece;
and when there, I continued to perfect the fence,
till I had made it as secure as the other, which,
however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up
more time by a great deal.
CHAPTER XII.
/ OBSERVE A CANOE OUT AT SEA—FIND ON THE SHORE THE REMNANT OF A FEAST OF CANNIBALS—HORROR
OF MIND THEREON—DOUBLE ARM MYSELF—TERRIBLY
ALARMED BY A GOAT—DISCOVER A SINGULAR CAVE,
OR GROTTO, OF WHICH I FORM MY MAGAZINE—MY
FEARS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SAVAGES BEGIN TO SUB-
SIDE.
ALL this labour I was at the expense of, purely from
my apprehensions on the account of the print of a
man's foot which I had seen; for as yet I never saw any
human creature come near the island, and I had now
lived two years under these uneasinesses, which in-
deed made my life much less comfortable than it was
before; as may well be imagined, by any who know
what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of
man; and this I must observe with grief too, that the
discomposure of my mind had too great impressions
also upon the religious part of my thoughts; for the
dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages
and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom
found myself in a due temper for application to my
Maker; at least, not with the sedate calmness and
resignation of soul which I was wont to do. I rather
prayed to God as under great affliction and pressure
of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation
every night of being murdered and devoured before
the morning; and I must testify from my experience,
that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affec-
tion is much more the proper frame for prayer than
that of terror and discomposure; and that under the
dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit
for a comforting performance of the duty of praying
to God, than he is for repentance on a sick bed; for
these discomposures affect the mind as the others do
the body; and the discomposure of the mind must
necessarily be as great a disability as that of the
body, and much greater; praying to God being
properly an act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of
my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place to make such
another deposit; when wandering more to the west
point of the island than I had ever done yet, and
looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the
sea at a great distance; I had found a perspective
glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I
saved out of our ship; but I had it not about me,
and this was so remote, that I could not tell what to
make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were
not able to look any longer: whether it was a boat
or not, I do not know: but as I descended from the
hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only
I resolved to go no more without a perspective glass
in my pocket.
When I was come down the hill to the end of the
island, where indeed I had never been before, I was
presently convinced that the seeing the print of a
man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island
as I imagined; and, but that it was a special provi-
dence that I was cast upon the side of the island
where the savages never came, I should easily have
known that nothing was more frequent than for the
canoes from the main, when they happened to be a
little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of
the island for harbour; likewise, as they often met,
and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken
any prisoners, would bring them over to this shore,
where, according to their dreadful customs, being all
cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which
hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I
said above, being the S.W. point of the island, I was
perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible
for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing
the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human bodies; and particularly I observed
213
a place where there had been a fire made, and a
circle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit, where it is
supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their
inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-
creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself
from it, for a long while; all my apprehensions were
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of
human nature; which, though I had heard of often,
yet I never had so near a view of before: in short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of
fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from
my stomach, and having vomited with uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to
stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the hill
again with all the speed I could, and walked on to-
wards my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the island,
I stood still awhile as amazed; and then recovering
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my
soul, and with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God
thanks that had cast my first lot in a part of the
world where I was distinguished from such dreadful
creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given
me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to
give thanks for than to complain of; and this above
all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the
hope of His blessing, which was a felicity more than
sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before;
for I observed that these wretches never came to this
island in search of what they could get; perhaps not
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here,
and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered
woody part of it without finding anything to their
purpose. I knew I had been here now almost
eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of
a human creature there before; and might be here
eighteen more as entirely concealed as I was now, if
I did not discover myself to them, which I had no
manner of occasion to do, it being my only business
to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless
I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to
make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and
eating one another up, that I continued pensive and
sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost
two years after this : when I say my own circle, I
mean by it my three plantations, viz., my castle, my
country-seat, which I called my bower, and my en-
closure in the woods; nor did I look after this for
any other use than as an enclosure for my goats; for
the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish
wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing
them as of seeing the devil himself; nor did I so
much as go to look after my boat in all this time,
but began rather to think of making me another; for
I could not think of ever making any more attempts
to bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I
should meet with some of those creatures at sea, in
which, if I had happened to have fallen into their
hands, I knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these people,
began to wear off my uneasiness about them; and I
began to live just in the same composed manner as
before; only with this difference, that I used more
caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing
my gun, lest any of them on the island should happen
to hear it; and it was therefore a very good provi-
dence to me, that I had furnished myself with a tame
breed of goats, that I had no need to hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch
any more of them after this, it was by traps and
snares, as I had done before; so that for two years
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off,
though I never went out without it; and, which was
more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I
always carried them out with me, or at least two of
them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt: I likewise
furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out
of the ship, and made me a belt to put it in also; so
that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at
when I went abroad, if you add to the former descrip-
tion of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a
great broadsword, hanging at my side in a belt, but
without a scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some
time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be re-
duced to my former calm sedate way of living. All
these things tended to show me more and more how
far my condition was from being miserable, compared
to some others; nay, to many other particulars of
life, which it might have pleased God to have made
my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repin-
ing there would be among mankind, at any condition
of life, if people would rather compare their condi-
tion with those that are worse, in order to be thank-
ful, than be always comparing them with those which
are better, to assist their murmurings and complain-
ings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own
preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention
for my own conveniences, and I had dropped a good
design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon;
and that was, to try if I could not make some of my
barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some
beer: this was really a whimsical thought, and I
reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I
presently saw there would be the want of several
things necessary to the making my beer, that would
be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to
preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have
observed already, I could never compass; no, though
I spent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in
attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place,
I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it
217
work, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet,
had not all these things intervened, I mean the frights
and terrors I was in about the savages, I had under- ,taken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I
seldom gave anything over without accomplishing it,
when I once had it in my head enough to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way; for
night and day I could think of nothing, but how I
might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim
they should bring hither to destroy. It would take
up a larger volume than this whole work is intended
to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or
rather brooded upon in my thoughts, for the destroy-
ing these creatures, or at least frightening them, so
as to prevent their coming hither any more; but all
was abortive; nothing could be possible to take
effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself; and
what could one man do among them, when perhaps
there might be twenty or thirty of them together,
with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which
they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with
my gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the
place where they made their fire, and put in five or
six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled
their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up
all that was near it; but as, in the first place, I should
be very loath to waste so much powder upon them,
my store being now within the quantity of a barrel,
so neither could I be sure of its going off at any
certain time, when it might surprise them; and, at
best, that it would do little more than just blow the
fire about their ears, and fright them, but not suffi-
cient to make them forsake the place; so I laid it
aside, and then proposed, that I would place myself
in ambush in some convenient place, with my three
guns all double loaded, and in the middle of their
bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be
sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every
shoot; and then falling in upon them with my three
pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if
there were twenty, I should kill them all: this fancy
pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so
full of it that I often dreamed of it; and sometimes
that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.
I went so far with it in my indignation, that I
employed myself several days to find out proper
places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to
watch for them; and I went frequently to the place
itself, which was now grown more familiar to me;
and especially while my mind was thus filled with
thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty
or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it; but
the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of
the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abated
my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the side of the
hill, where I was satisfied I might securely wait till
I saw any of the boats coming, and might then, even
before they would be ready to come on shore, con-
vey myself unseen into thickets of trees, in one of
which there was a hollow large enough to conceal
me entirely; and where I might sit, and observe all
their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their
heads, when they were so close together, as that it
219
would be next to impossible that I should miss my
shoot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of
them at the first shoot.
In this place then I resolved to fix my design;
and accordingly I prepared two muskets and my
ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded
with a brace of slugs each and four or five smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets, and the
fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-
shot of the largest size; I also loaded my pistols
with about four bullets each: and in this posture,
well provided with ammunition for a second and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and in my imagination put it in practice, I continu-
ally made my tour every morning up to the top of
the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it,
about three miles or more, to see if I could observe
any boats upon the sea coming near the island, or
standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this
hard duty, after I had for two or three months con-
stantly kept my watch, but came always back with-
out any discovery, there having not in all that time
been the least appearance, not only on or near the
shore, but not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes
or glasses could reach every way.
As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to
look out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my
design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while in
a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as
the killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an
offence, which I had not at all entered into a discus-
sion of in my thoughts, any further than my passions
were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the
unnatural custom of the people of that country, who,
it seems, had been suffered by Providence, in His
wise disposition of the world, to have no other guide
than that of their own abominable and vitiated
passions; and consequently were left, and perhaps
had been for some ages, to act such horrid things,
and receive such dreadful customs as nothing but
nature, entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actuated
by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them
into; but now, when, as I have said, I began to be
weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made
so long, and so far, every morning in vain; so my
opinion of the action itself began to alter, and I
began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider
what it was I was going to engage in; what autho-
rity or call I had to pretend to be judge and execu-
tioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven
had thought fit for so many ages to suffer, unpunished,
to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of
His judgments upon one another; also, how far these
people were offenders against me, and what right I
had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which
they shed promiscuously one upon another. I de-
bated this very often with myself thus: How do I
know what God himself judges in this particular
case? It is certain these people do not commit this
as a crime; it is not against their own consciences
reproving, or their light reproaching, them. They do
not know it to be an offence, and then commit it
in defiance of Divine justice, as we do in almost all
the sins we commit. They think it no more a crime
to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill
an ox, nor to eat human flesh, than we do to eat
mutton.
When I had considered this a little, it followed
necessarily, that I was certainly in the wrong in it:
that these people were not murderers in the sense
that I had before condemned them in my thoughts,
any more than those Christians were murderers, who
often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or
more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter,
though they threw down their arms and submitted.
In the next place it occurred to me, that albeit the
usage they gave one another was thus brutish and
inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me: these
people had done me no injury: that if they attempted
me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate preserva-
tion to fall upon them, something might be said for
it; but that I was yet out of their power, and they
had really no knowledge of me, and consequently no
design upon me; and therefore it could not be just
for me to fall upon them: that this would justify the
conduct of the Spaniards, in all their barbarities prac-
tised in America, where they destroyed millions of
these people, who, however they were idolators and
barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous
rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards,
very innocent people; and that the rooting them out
of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhor-
rence and detestation, even by the Spaniards them-
selves, at this time; and by all other Christian nations
of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural
piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man;
and such, as for which the very name of a Spaniard
is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people
of humanity, or of Christian compassion: as if the
kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the
product of a race of men who were without principles
of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the
miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of a
generous temper in the mind.
These considerations really put me to a pause, and
to a kind of a full stop; and I began by little and
little to be off of my design, and to conclude I had
taken a wrong measure in my resolutions to attack
the savages; that it was not my business to meddle
with them, unless they first attacked me, and this it
was my business, if possible, to prevent; but that, if
I were discovered and attacked, then I knew my
duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely
to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to
kill every one that not only should be on shore at
that time, but that should ever come on shore after-
wards, if but one of them escaped to tell their country-
people what had happened, they would come over
again by thousands to revenge the death of their
fellows; and I should only bring upon myself a
certain destruction, which at present I had no manner
of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in
principles nor in policy, I ought one way or other
to concern myself in this affair: that my business
was, by all possible means, to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to
223
guess by, that there were any living creatures upon
the island, I mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was
convinced now many ways that I was perfectly out
of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody schemes
for the destruction of innocent creatures, I mean
innocent as to me; as to the crimes they were guilty
of towards one another, I had nothing to do with
them; they were national punishments to make a
just retribution for national offences; and to bring
public judgments upon those who offend in a public
manner, by such ways as best please God.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me, than that I had not
been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much
reason to believe would have been no less a sin than
that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I
gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that
had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness; be-
seeching Him to grant me the protection of His
Providence, that I might not fall into the hands of
barbarians; or that I might not lay my hands upon
them, unless I had a more clear call from Heaven
to do it, in defence of my own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year
after this: and so far was I from desiring an occasion
for falling upon these wretches, that in all that time
I never once went up the hill to see whether there
were any of them in sight, or to know whether any
of them had been on shore there, or not; that I
might not be tempted to renew any of my con-
trivances against them, or be provoked by any ad-
vantage which might present itself to fall upon
them; only this I did, I went and removed my boat,
which I had on the other side of the island, and
carried it down to the east end of the whole island,
where I ran it into a little cove which I found under
some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of
the currents, the savages durst not, at least would
not, come with their boats upon any account what-
soever.
With my boat I carried away everything that I
had left there belonging to her, though not necessary
for the bare going thither; viz., a mast and sail,
which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor,
but indeed, which could not be called either anchor
or grappling; however, it was the best I could make
of its kind. All these I removed, that there might
not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any
appearance of any boat, or of any habitation upon
the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired
than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than
upon my constant employment, viz., to milk my she-
goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which,
as it was quite on the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger; for certain it is, that these
savage people, who sometimes haunted this island,
never came with any thoughts of finding anything
here, and consequently never wandered off from the
coast; and I doubt not but they might have been
several times on shore, after my apprehensions of
them had made me cautious, as well as before; and
indeed I looked back with some horror upon the
thoughts of what my condition would have been, if
I had chopped upon them, and been discovered
225
before that, when naked and unarmed, except with
one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot.
I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the
island, to see what I could get: what a surprise
should I have been in, if, when I discovered the print
of a man's foot, I had instead of that seen fifteen or
twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and,
by the swiftness of their running, no possibility of
my escaping them!
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul
within me, and distressed my mind so much, that I
could not soon recover it; to think what I might
have done, and how I not only should not have been
able to resist them, but even should not have had
presence of mind enough to do what I should have
done; much less what now, after so much considera-
tion and preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed,
after serious thinking of these things, I would be very
melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great
while; but I resolved it at last all into thankfulness
to that Providence which had delivered me from so
many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those
mischiefs, which I could no way have been the agent
in delivering myself from; because I |had not the
least notion of any such thing depending, or the least
supposition of its being possible.
This renewed a contemplation, which often had
come to my thoughts in former time, when first I
began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in
the dangers we run through in this life; how wonder-
fully we are delivered when we know nothing of it;
how, when we are in a quandary (as we call it), a
VOL. L P
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or that
way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we
intended to go another way; nay, when sense, our
own inclination, and perhaps business, has called to
go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the
mind, from we know not what springs, and by we
know not what power, shall overrule us to go this
way; and it shall afterwards appear, that had we
gone that way which we would have gone, and even
to our imagination ought to have gone, we should
have been ruined and lost. Upon these, and many
like reflections, I afterwards made it a certain rule
with me, that whenever I found those secret hints, or
pressings of my mind, to doing or not doing anything
that presented, or to going this way or that way, I
never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I
knew no other reason for it, than that such a pressure,
or such a hint, hung upon my mind: I could give
many examples of the success of this conduct in the
course of my life; but more especially in the latter
part of my inhabiting this unhappy island; besides
many occasions which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of if I had seen with the same eyes
then that I saw with now: but it is never too late
to be wise; and I cannot but advise all considering
men, whose lives are attended with such extraordinary
incidents as mine, or even though not so extra-
ordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of
Providence, let them come from what invisible in-
telligence they will; that I shall not discuss, and
perhaps cannot account for: but certainly they are a
proof of the converse of spirits, and the secret com-
munication between those embodied, and those un-
227
embodied; and such a proof as can never be with-
stood: of which I shall have occasion to give some
very remarkable instances in the remainder of my
solitary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it
strange, if I confess that these anxieties, these con-
stant dangers I lived in, and the concern that was now
upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the
contrivances that I had laid for my future accommo-
dations and conveniences. I had the care of my
safety more now upon my hands than that of my
food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of
wood now, for fear the noise I should make should
be heard; much less would I fire a gun, for the same
reason; and, above all, I was very uneasy at making
any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great
distance in the day, should betray me; and for this
reason I removed that part of my business which
required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in the wood; where, after I
had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable conso-
lation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in
a vast way, and where, I daresay, no savage, had he
been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to ven-
ture in, nor indeed would any man else, but one who,
like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where, by mere accident (I would say,
if I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe all
such things now to Providence), I was cutting down
some thick branches of trees to make charcoal; and
before I go on, I must observe the reason of my
making this charcoal, which was thus:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habita-
tion, as I said before; and yet I could not live there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so
I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen
done in England under turf, till it became chark, or
dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved
the coal to carry home, and perform the other
services which fire was wanting for at home, without
danger or smoke.
But this by the by. While I was cutting down
some wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick
branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there was a
kind of hollow place: I was curious to look into it,
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I
found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for
me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with
me; but I must confess to you, I made more haste
out than I did in; when looking further into the
place, which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad
shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man
I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim
light from the cave's mouth shining directly in and
making the reflection.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself,
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone, and
that I durst to believe there was nothing in this cave
that was more frightful than myself: upon this,
plucking up my courage, I took up a large firebrand,
and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my
hand: I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost
as much frightened as I was before; for I heard a
229
very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain; and
it was followed by a broken noise, as if of words half-
expressed, and then a deep sigh again: I stepped
back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise,
that it put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had a
hat on my head, I will not answer for it that my hair
might not have lifted it off. But still plucking up
my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging my-
self a little, with considering that the power and
presence of God was everywhere, and was able to
protect me; upon this I stepped forward again, and
by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little
over my head, I saw lying on the ground a most
monstrous frightful old he-goat, just making his will,
as we say gasping for life, and dying indeed of mere
old age.
I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out,
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise
himself; and I thought with myself, he might even
lie there; for if he had frightened me so, he would
certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them
should be so hardy as to come in there, while he had
any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began
to look round me, when I found the cave was but
very small; that is to say, it might be about twelve
feet over, but in no manner of shape, either round or
square, no hands having ever been employed in
making it but those of mere nature: I observed also,
that there was a place at the further side of it that
went in further, but so low, that it required me to
creep upon my hands and knees to get into it, and
whither it went I knew not; so having no candle, I
gave it over for some time, but resolved to come again
the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-
box, which I had made of the lock of one of the
muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with
six large candles of my own making, for I made very
good candles now of goat's tallow; and going into
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours,
as I have said, almost ten yards; which by the way,
I thought was a venture bold enough, considering
that I knew not how far it might go, or what was
beyond it. When I was got through the strait, I
found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the
island, I daresay, as it was, to look round the sides
and roof of this vault or cave. The walls reflected a
hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles;
what it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any
other precious stones, or gold, which I rather sup-
posed it to be, I knew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had
a sort of small loose gravel upon it; so that there was
no nauseous creature to be seen; neither was there
any damp or wet on the sides of the roof: the only
difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as it
was a place of security, and such a retreat as I
wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I
was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved,
without any delay, to bring some of those things
which I was most anxious about to this place; parti-
cularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of
powder, and all my spare arms; viz., two fowling-
pieces (for I had three in all), and three muskets (for
of them I had eight in all); so I kept at my castle
only five, which stood ready mounted, like pieces of
cannon, on my utmost fence, and were ready also to
take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I
was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I
took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and
I found that the water had penetrated about three
or four inches into the powder on every side, which,
caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside
like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the
cask; and this was an agreeable discovery to me at
that time; so I carried all away thither, never keep-
ing above two or three pounds of powder with me in
my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind; I also
carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants,
which were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks,
where none could come at them; for I persuaded
myself while I was here, if five hundred savages were
to hunt me, they could never find me out; or if they
did, they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave the next day after I made this
discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a great
hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with
earth, than to drag him out: so I interred him there
to prevent offence to my nose.

WHICH I DISCERN TO BE SPANISH PROCURE A GREAT
VARIETY OF ARTICLES FROM THE VESSEL.
I WAS now in my twenty-third year of residence in
this island, and was so naturalised to the place, and
to the manner of living, that could I have but en-
joyed the certainty that no savages would come to
the place to disturb me, I could have been content
to have capitulated for spending the rest of my time
there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me
down and died, like the old goat, in the cave: I had
also arrived to some little diversions and amusements,
which made the time pass more pleasantly with me
a great deal than it did before; as, first, I had
taught my Pol, as I noted before, to speak: and he
did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and
plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived
with me no less than six-and-twenty years: how
long he might live afterwards I knew not; though
I know they have a notion in the Brazils, that they
live a hundred years; perhaps some of my Pols may
be alive there still, calling after poor Robin Crusoe
to this day; I wish no Englishman the ill luck to
come there and hear them; but if he did, he would
233
certainly believe it was the devil. My dog was a
very pleasant and loving companion to me for no
less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of
mere old age; as for my cats, they multiplied, as I
have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to
shoot several of them at first, to keep them from
devouring me and all I had; but at length, when
the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and
after some time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no provision with me, they
all ran wild into the woods, except two or three
favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young,
when they had any, I always drowned, and these
were part of my family: besides these, I always kept
two or three household kids about me, which I taught
to feed out of my hand; and I had also more parrots
which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin
Crusoe, but none like my first; nor, indeed, did I take
the pains with any of them that I had done with him:
I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose names I
know not, which I caught upon the shore, and cut
their wings; and the little stakes which I had planted
before my castle wall, being now grown up to a good
thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low
trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to
me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well
contented with the life I led, if it might but have
been secured from the dread of savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it might not be
amiss for all people who shall meet with my story,
to make this just observation from it, viz., How
frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil, which
in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we
are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is often-
234
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
times the very means or door of our deliverance, by
which alone we can be raised again from the afflic-
tion we are fallen into. I could give many examples
of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but
in nothing was it more particularly remarkable, than
in the circumstances of my last years of solitary
residence in this island.
It was now the month of December, as I said
above, in my twenty-third year; and this being the
southern solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was
the particular time of my harvest, and required my
being pretty much abroad in the fields; when going
out pretty early in the morning, even before it was
thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a
light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from
me of about two miles towards the end of the island,
where I had observed some savages had been, as
before; but not on the other side; but, to my great
affliction, it was on my side of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no more
peace within, from the apprehensions I had, that if
these savages, in rambling over the island, should
find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works
and improvements, they would immediately con-
clude that there were people in the place, and would
then never give over till they found me out. In this
extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled
up the ladder after me, having made all things with-
out look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in
a posture of defence; I loaded all my cannon, as I
called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were
235
mounted upon my new fortification, and all my
pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last
gasp; not forgetting seriously to recommend myself
to the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God
to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians; and
in this posture I continued about two hours, but
began to be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad,
for I had no spies to send out.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting
in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I
observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after
me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of
the hill; and pulling out my perspective glass, which
I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my
belly on the ground, and began to look for the place.
I presently found there were no less than nine naked
savages sitting round a small fire they had made;
not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the
weather being extreme hot; but, as I supposed, to
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh
which they had brought with them, whether alive
or dead I could not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore; and as it was then tide of
ebb, they seemed to me to wait the return of the
flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine
what confusion this sight put me into, especially
seeing them come on my side the island, and so near
me too; but when I observed their coming must be
always with the current of the ebb, I began after-
wards to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied
that I might go abroad with safety all the time of
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
tide of flood, if they were not on shore before; and
having made this observation, I went abroad about
my harvest work with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take boat,
and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away: I should
have observed, that for an hour and more before
they went off, they went to dancing, and I could
easily discern their postures and gestures by my
glasses: I could only perceive, by my nicest obser-
vation, that they were stark naked, and had not the
least covering upon them; but whether they were
men or women, that I could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a
scabbard; and with all the speed I was able to make,
I went away to the hill, where I had discovered the
first appearance of all. As soon as I got thither,
which was not less than two hours (for I could not
go apace, being so loaded with arms as I was), I per-
ceived there had been three canoes more of savages
on that place; and looking out further, I saw they
were all at sea together, making over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me, especially, when
going down to the shore, I could see the marks of
horror which the dismal work they had been about
had left behind it, viz., the blood, the bones, and part
of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured by
those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so
filled with indignation at the sight, that I began now
to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
there, let them be who, or how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they
23?
thus made to this island were not very frequent; for
it was above fifteen months before any more of them
came on shore there again; that is to say, I never
saw them, or any footsteps or signals of them, in all
that time; for as to the rainy seasons then they are
sure not to come abroad, at least not so far; yet all
this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the
constant apprehensions I was in of their coming
upon me by surprise; from whence I observe, that
the expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffer-
ing, especially if there is no room to shake off that
expectation, or those apprehensions.
During all this time I was in the murdering humour;
and took up most of my hours, which should have
been better employed, in contriving how to circum-
vent and fall upon them the very next time I should
see them; especially if they should be divided, as
they were the last time, into two parties; nor did I
consider at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten
or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or month,
to kill another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till
I should be at length no less a murderer than they
were in being men-eaters, and perhaps much more so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or
other fall into the hands of those merciless creatures;
if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not with-
out looking round me with the greatest care and cau-
tion imaginable; and now I found to my great comfort,
how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock
or herd of goats; for I durst not, upon any account,
fire my gun, especially near that side of the island
where they usually came, lest I should alarm the
savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was
sure to have them come back again, with perhaps
two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days,
and then I knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months more
before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then
I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is
true, they might have been there once or twice, but
either they made no stay, or, at least, I did not hear
them; but in the month of May, as near as I could
calculate, and in my four and twentieth year, I had
a very strange encounter with them, of which in its
place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen
or sixteen months' interval, was very great; I slept
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often
started out of my sleep in the night; in the day
great troubles overwhelmed my mind: in the night I
dreamed often of killing the savages, and the reasons
why I might justify the doing of it. But to waive all
this for awhile, it was in the middle of May, on the
sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden
calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon the
post still; I say, it was on the sixteenth of May,
that it blew a great storm of wind all day, with a
great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul
night was after it: I know not what was the particular
occasion of it; but as I was reading in the Bible, and
taken up with serious thoughts about my present
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as
I thought, fired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different
nature from any I had met with before; for the
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of an-
other kind: I started up in the greatest haste imagin-
239
able; and in a trice clapped up my ladder to the
middle place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and
mounting it the second time got to the top of the
hill; that very moment a flash of fire bade me listen
for a second gun, which accordingly in about half a
minute I heard, and by the sound knew that it was
from that part of the sea where I was driven out with
the current in my boat.
I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and fired these guns for
signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had this
presence of mind at that minute as to think, that
though I could not help them, it may be they might
help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I
could get at hand, and making a good handsome pile,
I set it on fire upon the hill; the wood was dry, and
blazed freely, and though the wind blew very hard,
yet it burnt fairly out, so that I was certain, if there
was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it,
and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire
blazed up, I heard another gun, and after that several
others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all
night long, till day broke; and when it was broad
day, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a
great distance at sea, full east of the island, whether
a sail, or a hull, I could not distinguish, no, not with
my glasses, the distance was so great, and the wea-
ther still something hazy also: at least it was so out
at sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently con-
cluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being eager,
you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in
my hand, and ran towards the south-east side of the
island, to the rocks, where I had been formerly
carried away with the current, and getting up there,
the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I
could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of
a ship cast away in the night upon those concealed
rocks, which I found when I was out in my boat;
and which rocks, as they checked the violence of
the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or
eddy, were the occasion of my recovering then from
the most desperate hopeless condition that ever I
had been in all my life.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E.
and E.N.E. Had they seen the island, as I must
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
thought, have endeavoured to have saved themselves
on shore by the help of their boat; but the firing of
their guns for help, especially when they saw, as I
imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts:
first, I imagined that, upon seeing my light, they
might have put themselves into their boat, and have
endeavoured to make the shore; but that the sea
going very high, they might have been cast away;
other times I imagined, that they might have lost
their boat before, as might be the case many ways;
as particularly, by the breaking of the sea upon their
ship, which many times obliges men to stave, or
take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw
it overboard with their own hands; other times I
imagined they had some other ship or ships in
241
company, who, upon the signals of distress they
had made, had taken them up, and carried them
off; other whiles I fancied they were all gone off
to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the
current that I had been formerly in, were carried out
into the great ocean, where there was nothing but
misery and perishing, and that perhaps they might
by this time think of starving, and of being in a
condition to eat one another.
All these were but conjectures at best; so, in the
condition I was in, I could do no more than look
upon the misery of the poor men, and pity them;
which had still this good effect on my side, that it
gave me more and more cause to give thanks to
God, who had so happily and comfortably provided
for me in my desolate condition; and that of two
ships' companies, who were now cast away upon this
part of the world, not one life should be spared but
mine. I learnt here again to observe, that it is very
rare that the providence of God casts us into any
condition of life so low, or any misery so great, but
we may see something or other to be thankful for,
and may see others in worse circumstances than our
own.
Such certainly was the case with these men, of
whom I could not so much as see room to suppose
any of them were saved; nothing could make it
rational, so much as to wish or expect that they
did not all perish there, except the possibility only
of their being taken up by another ship in company:
and this was but mere possibility indeed; for I
saw not the least signal or appearance of any such
thing.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words,
VOL. I. Q
what a strange longing, or hankering of desire, I
felt in my soul upon this sight; breaking out some-
times thus: "Oh, that there had been but one or two,
nay, but one soul saved out of the ship, to have
escaped to me, that I might but have had one com-
panion, one fellow-creature to have spoken to me,
and to have conversed with!" In all the time of
my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a
desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so
deep a regret at the want of it.
There are some secret moving springs in the affec-
tions which, when they are set a going by some
object in view, or be it some object though not in
view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power
of imagination, that motion carries out the soul by
its impetuosity to such violent eager embracings of
the object, that the absence of it is insupportable.
Such were these earnest wishings, " That but one
man had been saved! Oh, that it had been but one!"
I believe I repeated the words," Oh, that it had been
but one!" a thousand times; and my desires were
so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press
the palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft
thing in my hand, it would have crushed it involun-
tarily; and my teeth in my head would strike to-
gether, and set against one another so strong, that
for some time I could not part them again.
Let the naturalist explain these things, and the
reason and manner of them; all I can say of them
is, to describe the fact, which was ever surprising to
me when I found it, though I knew not from what
it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect of
ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my
243
mind, realising the comfort which the conversation
of one of my fellow-Christians would have been to
me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine,
or both, forbade it; for till the last year of my being
on this island, I never knew whether any were saved
out of that ship, or no; and had only the affliction
some days after to see the corpse of a drowned boy
come on shore, at the end of the island which was
next the shipwreck: he had on no clothes but a sea-
man's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers,
and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so
much as to guess what nation he was of: he had
nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a
tobacco-pipe; the last was to me of ten times more
value than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to ven-
ture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but
I might find something on board that might be use-
ful to me; but that did not altogether press me so
much, as the possibility that there might be yet
some living creature on board, whose life I might
not only save, but might, by saving that life, com-
fort my own to the last degree; and this thought
clung so to my heart, that I could not be quiet night
nor day, but I must venture out in my boat on board
this wreck; and committing the rest to God's pro-
vidence, I thought the impression was so strong
upon my mind that it could not be resisted, that it
must come from some invisible direction, and that I
should be wanting to myself if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared everything for my voy-
age, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for fresh
water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I
had still a great deal of that left), a basket full of
raisins; and thus loading myself with everything
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water
out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo
in her, and then went home again for more: my
second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the um-
brella to set up over my head for shade, another
large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen of
my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before,
with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese; all which
with great labour and sweat I brought to my boat;
and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore,
I came at last to the utmost point of the island, on
that side, viz., N.E. And now I was to launch out
into the ocean, and either to venture, or not to ven-
ture; I looked on the rapid currents which ran con-
stantly on both sides of the island, at a distance, and
which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance
of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart
began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven
into either of those currents, I should be carried a
vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach or
sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat
was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise,
I should be inevitably lost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I
began to give over my enterprise ; and having hauled
my boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped
out, and sat me down upon a little spot of rising
ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and
desire, about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I
could perceive that the tide was turned, and the
245
flood came on, upon which my going was for so
many hours impracticable; upon this it presently
occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest
piece of ground I could find, and observe, if I could,
how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the
flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven
another way home with the same rapidness of the
currents. This thought was no sooner in my head,
but I cast my eye upon a little hill which sufficiently
overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I
had a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide,
and which way I was to guide myself in my return:
here I found, that as the current of the ebb set out
close by the south point of the island, so the current
of the flood set in close by the shore of the north
side; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to
the north of the island in my return, and I should
do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the
next morning to set out with the first of the tide;
and reposing myself for that night in the canoe,
under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched
out. I made first a little out to sea full north, till
I began to feel the benefit of the current, which set
eastward, and which carried me at a great rate, and
yet did not so hurry me as the southern side current
had done before, and so as to take from me all govern-
ment of the boat; but having a strong steerage with
my paddle, I went, I say, at a great rate, directly
for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up
to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which
by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her mainmast and foremast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short
off, but her boltsprit was sound, and the head and bow
appeared firm. When I came close to her, a dog
appeared upon her, which seeing me coming, yelped
and cried, and as soon as I called him jumped into
the sea to come to me; and I took him into the
boat, but found him almost dead for hunger and
thirst; I gave him a cake of my bread, and he ate
like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fort-
night in the snow: I then gave the poor creature
some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him,
he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board. The first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one
another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that
when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea
broke so high, and so continually over her, that the
men were not able to bear it, and were strangled
with the constant rushing in of the water, as much as
if they had been under water. Besides the dog, there
was nothing left in the ship that had life, nor any
goods that I could see, but what were spoiled by the
water: there were some casks of liquor, whether wine
or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold,
and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see;
but they were too big to meddle with; I saw several
chests which I believed belonged to some of the sea-
men, and I got two of them into the boat without
examining what was in them.
247
Had the'stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore-
part been broken off, I am persuaded I might have
made a good voyage; for by what I found in these
two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a
great deal of wealth on board; and if I may guess by
the course she steered, she must have been bound
from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in
the south part of America, beyond the Brazils, to the
Havanna, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to
Spain: she had, no doubt, a great treasure in her,
but of no use at that time to anybody: and what
became of the rest of the people I then knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat with much difficulty. There were several mus-
kets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about
four pounds of powder in it: as for the muskets, I
had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took
the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs,
which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-
iron; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came away,
the tide beginning to make home again; and the
same evening, about an hour within night, I reached
the island again, weary and fatigued to the last
degree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning
I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new
cave, not to carry it home to my castle. After re-
freshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and
began to examine the particulars; the cask of liquor
I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had
at the Brazils; and, in a word, not at all good; but
when I came to open the chests, I found several
things which I wanted: for example, I found in one
a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and
filled with cordial waters, fine, and very good;
the bottles held about three pints each, and were
tipped with silver: I found two pots of very good suc-
cades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that
the salt water had not hurt them; and two more of
the same, which the water had spoiled; I found some
very good shirts, which were very welcome to me,
and about a dozen and a half of white linen hand-
kerchiefs and coloured neckcloths; the former were
also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to
wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I
came to the till in the chest, I found there three
great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven
hundred pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped
up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small
bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all
weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it,
but of little value; but by the circumstances, it must
have belonged to the gunner's mate, as there was
no powder in it, but about two pounds of glazed
powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose, for
charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon
the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was
of much use to me; for, as to the money, I had no
manner of occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt
under my feet; and I would have given it all for
three or four pair of English shoes and stockings,
which were things I greatly wanted, but had not had
on my feet now for many years ; I had, indeed, got two
pair of shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two
drowned men whom I saw in the wreck; and I found
249
two pair more in one of the chests, which were very
welcome to me; but they were not like our English
shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we
call pumps than shoes. I found in the seaman's
chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no
gold: I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than
the other, which seemed to belong to some officer.
Well, however, I lugged the money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which
I brought from our own ship; but it was great pity,
as I said, that the other part of the ship had not
come to my share, for I am satisfied I might have
loaded my canoe several times over with money,
which, if I had ever escaped to England, would have
lain here safe enough till I might have come again
and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and
secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or
paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where
I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my
old habitation, where I found everything safe and
quiet; so I began to repose myself, live after my old
fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for
a while I lived easy enough; only that I was more
vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and
did not go abroad so much; and if at any time I did
stir with any freedom, it was always to the east part
of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the
savages never came, and where I could go without
so many precautions, and such a load of arms and
ammunition as I always carried with me, if I went
the other way.
CHAPTER XIV.
REFLECTIONS—AN EXTRAORDINARY DREAM—DISCOVER FIVE CANOES OF SAVAGES ON SHORE—OBSERVE FROM MY STATION TWO MISERABLE WRETCHES DRAGGED OUT OF THEIR BOATS TO BE DEVOURED ONE OF THEM MAKES HIS ESCAPE, AND RUNS DIRECTLY
TOWARDS ME, PURSUED BY TWO OTHERS / TAKE
MEASURES SO AS TO DESTROY HIS PURSUERS AND
SAVE HIS LIFE—CHRISTEN HIM BY THE NAME OF
FRIDAY, AND HE BECOMES A FAITHFUL AND EXCEL-
LENT SERVANT.
I LIVED in this condition near two years more; but
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it
was born to make my body miserable, was all these
two years filled with projects and designs, how, if
it were possible, I might get away from this island;
for sometimes I was for making another voyage to
the wreck, though my reason told me, that there was
nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage;
sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes another;
and I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went
from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound
anywhere, I knew not whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento
to those who are touched with that general plague of
mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of
their miseries flow: I mean, that of not being satisfied
with the station wherein God and nature hath placed
them; for, not to look back upon my primitive con-
dition, and the excellent advice of my father, the
opposition to which was, as I may call it, my original
sin, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind have
been the means of my coming into this miserable
condition; for had that Providence which so happily
had seated me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me
with confined desires, and could I have been con-
tented to have gone on gradually, I might have been
by this time, I mean in the time of my being on this
island, one of the most considerable planters in the
Brazils; nay, I am persuaded that by the improve-
ments I had made in that little time I lived there,
and the increase I should probably have made if I
had stayed, I might have been worth a hundred
thousand moidores; and what business had I to
leave a settled fortune, well-stocked plantation, im-
proving and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea,
to fetch negroes, when patience and time would have
so increased our stock at home, that we could have
bought them at our own doors from those whose
business it was to fetch them? And though it had
cost us something more, yet the difference of that
price was by no means worth saving at so great a
hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads,
so reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the
exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought experi-
ence of time; and so it was with me now; and yet,
so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper,
that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but
was continually poring upon the means and possi-
bility of my escape from this place; and that I may,
with the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the
remaining part of my story, it may not be improper
to give some account of my first conceptions on the
subject of this foolish scheme for my escape; and
how, and upon what foundation, I acted.
I am now to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate
laid up, and secure under water as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before: I had more
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all
the richer; for I had no more use for it than the
Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came
thither.
It was one of the nights in the rainy season in
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first setting
foot in this island of solitariness, I was lying in my
bed or hammock, awake, and very well in health,
had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, no,
nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but
could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to
sleep; no, not a wink all night long otherwise than
as follows:
It is as impossible as needless to set down the
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through
that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in
this night's time; I ran over the whole history of my
life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it,
to my coming to this island; and also of that part of
my life since I came to this island; in my reflections
upon the state of my case since I came on shore on
this island, I was comparing the happy posture of
my affairs, in the first years of my habitation here,
to that course of anxiety, fear, and care, which I lived
in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the
sand; not that I did not believe the savages had
frequented the island even all the while, and might
have been several hundreds of them at times on the
shore there; but as I had never known it, and was
incapable of-any apprehensions about it, my satisfac-
253
tion was perfect, though my danger was the same;
and I was as happy in not knowing my danger, as if
I had never really been exposed to it: this furnished
my thoughts with many very profitable reflections,
and particularly this one: How infinitely good that
Providence is, which has settled in its government of
mankind such narrow bounds to his sight and know-
ledge of things; and though he walks in the midst of
so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if
discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink
his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the
events of things hid from his eyes, and knowing
nothing of the dangers which surround him.
After these thoughts had for some time entertained
me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real danger
I had been in for so many years in this very island;
and how I had walked about in the greatest security,
and with all possible tranquillity, even perhaps when
nothing but a brow of a hill, a great tree, or the
casual approach of night, had been between me and
the worst kind of destruction, viz., that of falling into
the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have
seized on me with the same view as I did on a goat
or turtle, and have thought it no more a crime to
kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a
curlew. I should unjustly slander myself, if I should
say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Pre-
server, to whose singular protection I acknowledged,
with great humility, that all these unknown deliver-
ances were due, and without which I should inevitably
have fallen into their merciless hands.
When these thoughts were over, my head was for
some time taken up in considering the nature of these
wretched creatures, I mean, the savages; and how it
came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of
all things should give up any of His creatures to such
inhumanity, nay, to something so much below even
brutality itself, as to devour its own kind: but as
this ended in some (at that time fruitless) specula-
tions, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the
world these wretches lived in; how far off the coast
was from whence they came; what they ventured so
far from home for; what kind of boats they had; and
why I might not order myself, and my business, so
that I might be as able to go over thither, as they
were to come to me?
I never so much as troubled myself to consider
what I should do with myself when I came thither;
what should become of me if I fell into the hands of
the savages; or how I should escape from them, if
they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it was
possible for me to reach the coast, and not be at-
tacked by some or other of them, without any pos-
sibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall
into their hands, what I should do for provision, or
whither I should bend my course: none of these
thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but
my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my
passing over in my boat to the mainland. I looked
back upon my present condition as the most miser-
able that could possibly be; that I was not able to
throw myself into anything but death that could be
called worse; that if I reached the shore of the
main, I might, perhaps, meet with relief; or I might
coast along, as I did on the shore of Africa, till I
came to some inhabited country, and where I might
find some relief; and after all, perhaps I might fall
in with some Christian ship that might take me in;
and if the worst came to the worst, I could but die,
which would put an end to all these miseries at once.
Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind,
an impatient temper, made as it were desperate by
the long continuance of my troubles, and the dis-
appointments I had met in the wreck I had been on
board of, and where I had been so near the obtaining
of what I had so earnestly longed for, viz., somebody
to speak to, and to learn some knowledge from, of
the place where I was, and of the probable means of
my deliverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by
these thoughts. All my calm of mind in my resig-
nation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the
dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended;
and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts
to anything but the project of a voyage to the main;
which came upon me with such force, and such an
impetuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts for two
hours or more, with such violence that it set my
very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as
high as if I had been in a fever, merely with the
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it; nature,
as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the
very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep: one
would have thought I should have dreamed of it;
but I did not, nor of anything relating to it; but I
dreamed that as I was going out in the morning,
as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two
canoes and eleven savages coming to land, and that
they brought with them another savage, whom they
were going to kill, in order to eat him; when on a
sudden, the savage that they were going to kill
jumped away, and ran for his life: then I thought in
my sleep, that he came running into my little thick
grove, before my fortification, to hide himself; and
that I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the
others sought him that way, showed myself to him,
and, smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he
kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist
him; upon which I showed my ladder, made him go
up it, and carried him into my cave, and he became my
servant; and that as soon as I had got this man, I
said to myself, "Now I may certainly venture to the
mainland; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and
will tell me what to do, and whither to go for pro-
visions, and whither not to go for fear of being de-
voured; what places to venture into, and what to
escape." I waked with this thought, and was under
such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect
of my escape in my dream, that the disappointments
which I felt upon coming to myself, and finding it
was no more than a dream, were equally extravagant
the other way, and threw me into a very great dejec-
tion of spirits.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was, if possible, to get a savage in my possession;
and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should
bring hither to kill; but these thoughts still were
attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible
to effect this, without attacking a whole caravan of
them, and killing them all; and this was not only a
very desperate attempt, and might miscarry; but,
on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the law-
fulness of it to me, and my heart trembled at the
thought of shedding so much blood, though it was
257
for my deliverance: I need not repeat the arguments
which occurred to me against this, they being the
same mentioned before: but though I had other
reasons to offer now, viz., that those men were ene-
mies to my life, and would devour me, if they could;
that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree,
to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was
acting in my own defence, as much as if they were
actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though
these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shed-
ding human blood for my deliverance were very
terrible to me, and such as I could by no means
reconcile myself to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with
myself, and after great perplexities about it (for all
these arguments, one way and another, struggled in
my head a long time), the eager prevailing desire of
deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and I
resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into
my hands, cost what it would: the next thing then
was to contrive how to do it; and this indeed was
very difficult to resolve on: but as I could pitch
upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put
myself upon the watch to see them when they came
on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such
measures as the opportunity should present, let it be
what it would.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set my-
self upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed
so often till I was heartily tired of it; for it was
above a year and a half that I waited, and for a
great part of that time went out to the west end and
south-west corner of the island, almost every day,
to see for canoes, but none appeared. This was
VOL. I. R
very discouraging, and began to trouble me much;
though I can't say that it did in this case, as it had
done some time before that, viz., wear off the edge
of my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed
to be delayed, the more eager I was for it; in a
word, I was not at first more careful to shun the sight
of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, than
I was now eager to be upon them.
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay,
two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make
them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should
direct them, and to prevent their being able, at any
time, to do me any hurt. It was a great while that
I pleased myself with this affair, but nothing still
presented; all my fancies and schemes came to no-
thing, for no savages came near me for a great while. About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and by long musing, had as it were
resolved them all into nothing, for want of an occa-
sion to put them in execution, I was surprised one
morning early, with seeing no less than five canoes
all on shore together, on my side the island, and the
people who belonged to them all landed, and out of
my sight: the number of them broke all my mea-
sures; for seeing so many, and knowing that they
always came four, or six, or sometimes more, in a
boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to
take any measures to attack twenty or thirty men
single-handed; so I lay still in my castle, perplexed
and discomforted; however, I put myself into all the
same postures for an attack that I had formerly pro-
vided, and was just ready for action, if anything had
presented. Having waited a good while, listening to
hear if they made any noise; at length being very
impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and clambered up to the top of the hill by my two
stages, as usual, standing so, however, that my head
did not appear above the hill, so that they could not
perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the
help of my perspective glass, that they were no less
than thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled,
and that they had had meat dressed; how they
cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they
were all dancing in I know not how many barbarous
gestures and figures, their own way, round the fire.
When I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by
my perspective, two miserable wretches dragged
from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by,
and were now brought out for the slaughter: I per-
ceived one of them immediately fall, being knocked
down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for
that was their way; and two or three others were
at work immediately, cutting him open for their
cookery, while the other victim was left standing by
himself, till they should be ready for him. In that
very moment this poor wretch seeing himself a little at
liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he
started away from them, and ran with incredible swift-
ness along the sands, directly towards me; I mean to-
wards that part of the coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge)
when I perceived him to run my way: and especially
when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole
body; and now I expected that part of my dream
was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take
shelter in my grove; but I could not depend, by any
means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz., that the
other savages would not pursue him thither, and find
him there. However, I kept my station, and my spirits
began to recover, when I found that there were not
above three men that followed him ; and still more was
I encouraged when I found that he outstripped them
exceedingly in running, and gained ground of them;
so that if he could but hold it for half an hour, I saw
easily he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the first part of my story,
when I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this
I knew he must necessarily swim over, or the poor
wretch would be taken there: but when the savage
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though
the tide was then up; but plunging in, swam through
in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran
on with exceeding strength and swiftness. When the
three pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of
them could swim, but the third could not, and that
he, standing on the other side looked at the others, but
went no further; and soon after went softly back again,
which, as it happened, was very well for him in the
main.
I observed that the two who swam were yet more
than twice as long swimming over the creek as
the fellow was that fled from them. It came now
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresis-
tibly, that now was my time to get a servant, and
perhaps a companion, or assistant, and that I was
called plainly by Providence to save this poor crea-
ture's life. I immediately got down the ladders
with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns,
for they were both at the foot of the ladder, as I
observed above; and getting up again with the same
haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the
261
sea; and having a very short cut, and all down-hill,
clapped myself in the way between the pursuers and
the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who,
looking back, was at first perhaps as much frighted
at me as at them; but I beckoned with my hand to
him to come back; and in the meantime I slowly
advanced towards the two that followed; then rush-
ing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down
with the stock of my piece; I was loath to fire, be-
cause I would not have the rest hear, though at that
distance it would not have been easily heard: and
being out of sight of the smoke too, they would not
have easily known what to make of it. Having
knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued
him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I
advanced apace towards him: but as I came nearer,
I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and
was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then neces-
sitated to shoot at him first; which I did, and killed
him at the first shot. The poor savage who fled,
but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies
fallen, and killed (as he thought), yet was so frighted
with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood
stock-still, and neither came forward nor went back-
ward, though he seemed rather inclined to fly still
than to come on. I hallooed again to him, and
made signs to come forward, which he easily under-
stood, and came a little way, then stopped again,
and then a little further, and stopped again; and I
could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if
he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to
be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned him
again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of
encouragement that I could think of; and he came
nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve
steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his
life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and
beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length
he came close to me, and then he kneeled down
again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon
the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot
upon his head. This, it seems, was in token of
swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up,
and made much of him, and encouraged him all I
could. But there was more work to do yet; for I
perceived the savage, whom I knocked down, was
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to
come to himself; so I pointed to him, and showed
him the savage, that he was not dead: upon this he
spoke some words to me; and though I could not
understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant
to hear, for they were the first sound of a man's
voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for above
five-and-twenty years. But there was no time for
such reflections now: the savage, who was knocked
down, recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the
ground; and I perceived that my savage began to
be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my
other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him;
upon this my savage, for so I call him now, made a
motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side; so I did: he no sooner
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow
cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Ger-
many could have done it sooner or better, which I
thought very strange for one who, I had reason to
believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except
their own wooden swords; however, it seems, as I

263
learnt afterwards, they make their wooden swords so
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they
will cut off heads even with them, nay, and arms,
and that at one blow too. When he had done this,
he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and with abundance of
gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down,
with the head of the savage that he had killed, just
before me.
But that which astonished him most was, to
know how I had killed the other Indian so far off;
so pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him
go to him; so I bade him go, as well as I could.
When he came to him, he stood like one amazed,
looking at him; turned him first on one side, then
on t'other; looked at the wound the bullet had
made, which it seems was just in his breast, where
it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood
had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was
quite dead. Then he took up his bow and arrows,
and came back; so I turned to go away, and beckoned
him to follow me, making signs to him that more
might come after him.
Upon this he signed to me, that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by the
rest, if they followed; and so I made signs again to
him to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant he
had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big
enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him
into it, and covered him, and did so also by the
other; I believe he had buried them both in a quar-
ter of an hour: then calling him away, I carried him,
not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the
further part of the island; so I did not let my dream-
come to pass in that part, viz., that he came into my
grove for shelter.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was
indeed in great distress for, by his running; and
having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go
lie down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had
laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon
it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so
the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well
made, with straight long limbs, not too large, tall,
and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not
a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have some-
thing very manly in his face, and yet he had all the
sweetness and softness of an European in his coun-
tenance too, especially when he smiled; his hair was
long and black, not curled like wool; his forehead
very high and large, and a great vivacity and spark-
ling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin
was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet not of
an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and
Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of
a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it
something very agreeable, though not very easy to
describe. His face was round and plump, his nose
small, but not flat like the negro's, a very good
mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well set, and
white as ivory. After he had slumbered, rather
than slept, about half an hour, he waked again, and
comes out of the cave to me, for I had been milking
my goats, which I had in the enclosure just by; when
he spied me, he came running to me, laying himself
265
down again upon the ground, with all the possible
signs of a humble thankful disposition, making many
antic gestures to show it. At last he lays his head
flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my
other foot upon his head, as he had done before;
and after this, made all the signs to me of subjection,
servitude, and submission imaginable, to let me know
how much he would serve me as long as he lived. I
understood him in many things, and let him know I
was very well pleased with him. In a little time I
began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to
me; and first, I made him know his name should be
Friday, which was the day I saved his life; and I
called him so for the memory of the time; I likewise
taught him to say Master, and then let him know
that was to be my name; I likewise taught him to
say Yes and No, and to know the meaning of them.
I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and let him
see me drink it before him, and sop my bread in it;
and I gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which
he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was
very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me, and
let him know I would give him some clothes; at
which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked.
As we went by the place where he had buried the
two men, he pointed out exactly the spot, and showed
me the marks that he had made to find them again,
making signs to me that we should dig them up
again, and eat them: at this I appeared very angry,
expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would
vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my
hand to him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great submission. I then led him up to the top
of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone, and pull-
ing out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place
where they had been, but no appearance of them or
their canoes; so that it was plain that they were
gone, and left their two comrades behind them, with-
out any search after them.
But I was not content with this discovery; but
having now more courage, and consequently more
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at
his back, which I found he could use very dexter-
ously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two
for myself, and away we marched to the place where
these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to
get some fuller intelligence of them. When I came
to the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins,
and my heart sunk within me at the horror of the
spectacle; indeed it was a dreadful sight, at least it
was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it: the
place was covered with human bones, the ground
dyed with the blood, great pieces of flesh left here
and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and,
in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast that
they had been making there, after a victory over
their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and
the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abund-
ance of other parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his
signs, made me understand that they brought over
four prisoners to feast upon ; that three of them were
eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the
fourth; that there had been a great battle between
them and their next king, whose subjects, it seems,
he had been one of; and that they had taken a great
267
number of prisoners, all which were carried to several
places by those that had taken them in the fight, in
order to feast upon them, as was done here by these
wretches upon those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones,
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them together
on a heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn
them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hanker-
ing stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a
cannibal in his nature; but I discovered so much
abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least
appearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for I
had, by some means, let him know that I would kill
him if he offered it.
When he had done this, we came back to our
castle, and there I fell to work for my man Friday;
and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I men-
tioned, and which I found in the wreck; and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well; then I
made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my skill
would allow, and I was now grown a tolerable good
tailor; and I gave him a cap, which I had made of a
hare skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough,
and thus he was dressed, for the present, tolerably
well, and mighty well was he pleased to see himself
almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he
went awkwardly in these things at first; wearing the
drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of
the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of
his arms; but a little easing them, where he com-
plained they hurt him, and using himself to them, at
length he took to them very well.
The next day after I came home to my hutch with
him, I began to consider where I should lodge him;
and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly
easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the
vacant place between my two fortifications, in the
inside of the last, and in the outside of the first: and
as there was a door or entrance there into my cave,
I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it
of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within
the entrance; and causing the door to open on the
inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my
ladders too; so that Friday could no way come at
me in the inside of my innermost wall, without mak-
ing so much noise in getting over, that it must needs
awaken me; for my first wall had now a complete
roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and
leaning up to the side of the hill, which was again
laid across with small sticks instead of laths, and then
thatched over a great thickness with the rice straw,
which was strong like reeds; and at the hole or place
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had
placed a kind of trap-door, which if it had been
attempted on the outside, would not have opened at
all, but would have fallen down, and made a great
noise; and as to weapons, I took them all into my
side every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution; for never
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant, than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or
designs; perfectly obliging and engaging; his very
affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a
father; and I daresay, he would have sacrificed his
life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatso-
ever: the many testimonies he gave me of this put
it out of doubt; and soon convinced me that I
269
needed to use no precautions as to my safety on his
account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that however it had pleased God
in His providence, and in the government of the works
of His hands, to take from so great a part of the
world of His creatures, the best uses to which their
faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted;
yet that He has bestowed upon them the same
powers, the same reason, the same affections, the
same sentiments of kindness and obligation, the
same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same
sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the
capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that
He has given to us; and that when He pleases to
offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as
ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right
uses for which they were bestowed, than we are.
And this made me very melancholy sometimes, in
reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how
mean a use we make of all these, even though we
have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of
instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge
of His Word, added to our understanding; and why
it has pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge
from so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge
by this poor savage, would make a much better use
of it than we did.
From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade
the sovereignty of Providence; and as it were,
arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of
things, that should hide that light from some, and
reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from
both: but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts
with this conclusion: first, that we do not know by
what light and law these should be condemned; but
that as God was necessarily, and by the nature of His
being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be,
that if these creatures were all sentenced to absence
from Himself, it was on account of sinning against
that light, which as the Scripture says, was a law to
themselves, and by such rules as their consciences
would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation
was not discovered to us: and, secondly, that still,
as we are all clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel
could say to Him, "Why hast Thou formed me
thus?"
But to return to my new companion: I was greatly
delighted with him, and made it my business to teach
him everything that was proper to make him useful,
handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak,
and understand me when I spake: and he was the
aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly was so
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when
he could but understand me, or make me understand
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him.
And now my life began to be so easy, that I began
to say to myself, that could I but have been safe from
more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove
from the place where I lived.

CHAPTER XV.
/ AM AT GKEAT PAINS TO INSTRUCT FRIDAY RESPECTING
MY ABHORRENCE OF THE CANNIBAL PRACTICES OF THE
SAVAGESHE IS AMAZED AT THE EFFECTS OF THE GUN, AND CONSIDERS IT AN INTELLIGENT BEING— BEGINS TO TALK ENGLISH TOLERABLY—A DIALOGUE
—/ INSTRUCT HIM IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF RELIGION,
AND FIND HIM VERY APT—HE DESCRIBES TO ME
SOME WHITE MEN WHO HAD COME TO HIS COUNTRY
AND STILL LIVED THERE.
AFTER I had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought, that in order to bring Friday off
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of
a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other
flesh; so I took him out with me one morning to the
woods: I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of
my own flock, and bring it home and dress it; but as I
was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of
Friday: "Hold," said I, "stand still;" and made
signs to him not to stir. Immediately I presented
my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor
creature, who had at a distance indeed seen me kill
the savage his enemy, but did not know, or could
imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised,
trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed, that I
thought he would have sunk down: he did not see
the kid I had shot at, or perceive I had killed it,
but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not
wounded; and, as I found, presently thought I was
resolved to kill him: for he came and kneeled down
to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many
things I did not understand; but I could easily see
that his meaning was to pray me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would
do him no harm; and taking him up by the hand,
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which
he did; and while he was wondering and looking
to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again, and by and by I saw a great fowl, like a
hawk, sit upon a tree within shot, so, to let Friday
understand a little what I would do, I called him to
me again, pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a
parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say,
pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the
ground under the parrot, to let him see I would
make him fall, I made him understand that I would
shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and
bid him look, and immediately he saw the parrot
fall: he stood like one frightened again, notwithstand-
ing all that I had said to him; and I found he was
the more amazed, because he did not see me put
anything into the gun: but thought there must be
some wonderful fund of death and destruction in
that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything
near or far off; for the astonishment this created in
him was such, as could not wear off for a long time;
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have
worshipped me and my gun: as for the gun itself, he
would not so much as touch it for several days after;
but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
swered him, when he was by himself; which, as I
afterwards learnt of him, was to desire it not to kill
him.
Well: after his astonishment was a little over at
273
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I
had shot, which he did, but stayed some time; for
the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a good
way off from the place where she fell; however, he
found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and
as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun before,
I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and
not let him see me do it, that I might be ready for
any other mark that might present: but nothing more
offered at that time; so I brought home the kid, and
the same evening took the skin off, and cut it out as
well as I could, and having a pot for that purpose, I
boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some
very good broth: after I had begun to eat some, I
gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it,
and liked it very well; but that which was strangest
to him was, to see me eat salt with it. He made a
sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and
putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to
nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing
his mouth with fresh water after it. On the other
hand, I took some meat in my mouth without salt,
and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt,
as fast as he had done at the salt; but it would not
do, he would never care for salt with meat, or in his
broth; at least, not for a great while, and then but a
very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth,
I was resolved to feast him the next day with roast-
ing a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it be-
fore the fire in a string, as I had seen many people
do in England, setting two poles up, one on each
side of a fire, and one cross on the top, and tying
the string to the cross stick, letting the meat run VOL. I. S
continually: this Friday admired very much; but
when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many
ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could
not but understand him; and at last he told me he
would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was
very glad to hear.
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as
I observed before; and he soon understood how to do
it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the
meaning of it was: and that it was to make bread
of; for after that I let him see me make my bread,
and bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able
to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it
myself.
I began now to consider, that, having two mouths
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of
land, and began the fence in the same manner as
before, in which Friday not only worked very will-
ingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully; and
I told him what it was for, that it was for corn to
make more bread, because he was now with me, and
that I might have enough for him and myself too:
he appeared very sensible of that part, and let me
know, that he thought I had much more labour upon
me on his account, than I had for myself, and that
he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him
what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and
understand the names of almost everything I had
occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send
275
him to,and talk a great deal to me; so that, in short,
I began now to have some use for my tongue again,
which indeed I had very little occasion for before;
that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure
of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the
fellow himself; his simple unfeigned honesty ap-
peared to me more and more every day, and I began
really to love the creature; and on his side, I believe,
he loved me more than it was possible for him ever
to love anything before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again; and having
learnt him English so well, that he could answer
me almost any questions, I asked him, whether the
nation that he belonged to never conquered in bat-
tle? At which he smiled and said, "Yes, yes, we
always fight the better;" that is, he meant, always
get the better in fight; and so we began the follow-
ing discourse: "You always fight the better!" said I,
"how came you to be taken prisoner then, Friday?"
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Master. How beat? if your nation beat them, how
came you to be taken?
Friday. They more than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me;
my nation over-beat them in the yonder place, where
me no was; there my nation take one, two great
thousand.
Master. But why did not your nation recover you
from the hands of your enemies then?
Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that
time.
Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away, and eat them as these do?
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Master. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
else place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here [points to the N.W. side
of the island, which, it seems, was their side].
By this, I understood that my man Friday had
formerly been among the savages, who used to come
on shore on the further part of the island, on the
said man-eating occasions that he was now brought
for; and some time after, when I took the courage
to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly
mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told
me, he was there once when they ate up twenty
men, two women, and one child: he could not tell
twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying
so many stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell
them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces what
follows; that after I had had this discourse with him,
I asked him, how far it was from our island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost;
he told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost;
but that after a little way out to sea, there was a
current, and a wind always one way in the morning,
the other in the afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the sets of
the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I afterwards
understood it was occasioned by the great draught
and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque; in the
mouth of which river, as I thought afterwards, our
island lay; and that this land which I perceived to
the W. and N.W. was the great island Trinidad, on
the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the
inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were
near: he told me all he knew with the greatest open-
ness imaginable. I asked him the names of the
several nations of his sort of people, but could get
no other name than Caribs; from whence I easily
understood, that these were the Caribbees, which our
maps place on that part of America which reaches
from the mouth of the river Oroonoque to Guinea,
and onwards to St. Martha. He told me, that up a
great way beyond the moon; that was, beyond the
setting of the moon, which must be west from their
country, there dwelt white-bearded men, like me, and
pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned
before; and that they had killed much mans, that
was his word: by which I understood he meant the
Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been
spread over the whole countries, and were remem-
bered by all the nations from father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men;
he told me, Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe; I
could not understand what he meant by two canoe,
till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant
that it must be in a large great boat as big as two
canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish
with me very well; and from this time I entertained
some hopes, that one time or other I might find an
opportunity to make my escape from this place, and
that this poor savage might be a means to help me
to do it.
During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and
understand me, I was not wanting to lay a founda-
tion of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly
I asked him one time, Who made him? The poor
creature did not understand me at all, but thought I
had asked who was his father: but I took it by
another handle, and asked him, Who made the sea,
the ground he walked on, and the hills and woods?
He told me it was one old Benamuckee, that lived
beyond all: he could describe nothing of this great
person, but that he was very old; much older, he
said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or the
stars. I asked him then, if this old person had
made all things, why did not all things worship him?
He looked very grave, and, with a perfect look of
innocence, said, All things said O! to him. I asked
him if the people who die in his country, went away
anywhere? He said, Yes, they all went to Bena-
muckee. Then I asked him, whether those they ate
up went thither too? he said, Yes.
From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the
great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up
towards heaven; that He governs the world by the
same power and providence by which He made it;
that He was omnipotent, could do everything for us,
give everything to us, take everything from us: and
thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened
with great attention, and received with pleasure the
notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and
279
the manner of making our prayers to God, and His
being able to hear us, even into heaven: he told me
one day, that if our God could hear us up beyond
the sun, he must needs be a greater God than their
Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet
could not hear, till they went up to the great moun-
tains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him
if ever he went thitherto speak to him? He said,
No, they never went that were young men; none
went thither but the old men; whom he called their
Oowookakee: that is, as I made him explain it to me,
their religious, or clergy; and that they went to say
O! (so he called saying prayers), and then came
back, and told them what Benamuckee said. By
this I observed, that there is priestcraft even amongst
the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world; and
the policy of making a secret of religion, in order to
preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy,
is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
among all religions in the world, even among the
most brutish and barbarous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday; and told him that the pretence of their old
men going up to the mountains to say O! to their
god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing
word from thence what he said, was much more so;
that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any
one there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then I
entered into a long discourse with him about the
devil, the original of him, his rebellion against God,
his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting him-
self up in the dark parts of the world to be
worshipped instead of God, and as God, and the
many stratagems he made use of, to delude mankind
to their ruin; how he had a secret access to our
passions and to our affections, to adapt his snares so
to our inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own
tempters, and to run upon our own destruction by
our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the
being of a God; nature assisted all my arguments
to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First
Cause, and over-ruling governing Power, a secret
directing Providence, and of the equity and justice
of paying homage to Him that made us, and the
like: but there appeared nothing of all this in the
notion of an evil spirit, of his original, his being, his
nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do evil,
and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor crea-
ture puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question
merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew
what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal
to him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His
dreadful aversion to sin, His being a consuming fire
to the workers of iniquity; how, as He had made us
all, He could destroy us and all the world in a
moment; and he listened with great seriousness to
me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of
Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the
world, and the like: "Well," says Friday, "but you
say God is so strong, so great, is He not much strong,
much might as the devil?"—"Yes, yes," said I,
"Friday, God is stronger than the devil, God is above
the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him
281
under our feet, and enable us to resist his tempta-
tions, and quench his fiery darts." "But," says he
again," if God much strong, much might, as the devil,
why God not kill the devil, so make him no more
wicked?"
I was strangely surprised at his question; and,
after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was
but a young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a
casuist, or a solver of difficulties: and at first, I could
not tell what to say; so I pretended not to hear him,
and asked him what he said? but he was too earnest
for an answer to forget his question, so that he re-
peated it in the very same broken words, as above.
By this time I had recovered myself a little, and I
said, " God will at last punish him severely; he is re-
served for the judgment, and is to be cast into the
bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This
did not satisfy Friday; but he returns upon me, re-
peating my words, "Reserve at last! me no under-
stand: but why not kill the devil now, not kill great
ago ?"—" You may as well ask me," said I, "why God
does not kill you and me, when we do wicked things
here that offend Him: we are preserved to repent and
be pardoned." He muses awhile at this; "Well,
well," says he, mighty affectionately, "that well; so
you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God
pardon all." Here I was run down again by him to
the last degree, and it was a testimony to me, how
the mere notions of nature, though they will guide
reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, and
of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of
God, as the consequence of our nature; yet nothing
but divine revelation can form the knowledge of
Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for us;
of a Mediator; of a new covenant; and of an Inter-
cessor at the footstool of God's throne; I say, nothing
but a revelation from Heaven can form these in the
soul; and that therefore the Gospel of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and
the Spirit of God, promised for the guide and
sanctifier of His people, are the absolutely necessary
instructors of the souls of men in the saving know-
ledge of God, and the means of salvation.
I therefore diverted the present discourse between
me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some
sudden occasion of going out; then sending him for
something a great way off, I seriously prayed to God,
that He would enable me to instruct savingly this
poor savage, assisting, by His Spirit, the heart of the
poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the
knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to Him-
self, and would guide me to speak so to him from
the Word of God, as his conscience might be con-
vinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When
he came again to me, I entered into a long discourse
with him upon the subject of the redemption of man
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of
the Gospel preached from Heaven, viz., of the repent-
ance towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord
Jesus: I then explained to him, as well as I could,
why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the
nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham, and how,
for that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the
redemption; that He came only to the lost sheep of
the house of Israel, and the like.
I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge,
in all the methods I took for this poor creature's in-
struction; and must acknowledge, what I believe all
283
that act upon the same principle will find, that in
laying things open to him, I really informed and
instructed myself in many things that either I did
not know, or had not fully considered before; but
which occurred naturally to my mind, upon my search-
ing into them for the information of this poor savage;
and I had more affection in my inquiry after things
upon this occasion, than ever I felt before; so that
whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me
or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever he
came to me: my grief sat lighter upon me, my habi-
tation grew comfortable to me beyond measure; and
when I reflected, that in this solitary life, which I had
been confined to, I had not only been moved myself
to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand that
brought me thither, but was now to be made an in-
strument, under Providence, to save the life, and for
aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and bring
him to the true knowledge of religion, and of the
Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus,
to know whom is life eternal; I say, when I reflected
upon all these things, a secret joy ran through every
part of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I
was brought to this place, which I had often thought
the most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly
have befallen me.
In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder
of my time; and the conversation which employed
the hours between Friday and me was such as made
the three years which we lived there together perfectly
and completely happy, if any such thing as complete
happiness can be found in a sublunary state. The
savage was now a good Christian, a much better than
I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for
it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted re-
stored penitents: we had here the Word of God to
read, and no further off from His Spirit to instruct
than if we had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scripture,
and to let him know as well as I could the meaning
of what I read; and he again, by his serious inquiries
and questions, made me, as I said before, a much
better scholar in the Scripture knowledge than I
should ever have been by my own private reading.
Another thing I cannot refrain from observing here
also from experience, in this retired part of my life;
viz., how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is,
that the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of
salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in
the Word of God, so easy to be received and under-
stood, that as the bare reading the Scripture made
me capable of understanding enough of my duty to
carry me directly on to the great work of sincere
repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour
for life and salvation, to a stated reformation of prac-
tice, and obedience to all God's commands, and this
without any teacher or instructor (I mean, human);
so the plain instruction sufficiently served to the en-
lightening this savage creature, and bringing him to
be such a Christian, as I have known few equal to
him in my life.
As to the disputes, wranglings, strife, and conten-
tion, which has happened in the world about religion,
whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of Church-
government, they were all perfectly useless to us, as
for aught I can yet see, they have been to all the rest
in the world: we had the sure guide to heaven, viz.,
the Word of God; and we had, blessed be God,
comfortable views of the Spirit of God, teaching and
instructing us by His Word, leading us into all truth,
and making us both willing and obedient to the
instruction of His Word; and I cannot see the least
use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed
points in religion, which have made such confusions
in the world, would have been to us, if we could have
obtained it. But I must go on with the historical
part of things, and take every part in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almost all I
said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken
English, to me, I acquainted him with my own story,
or at least so much of it as related to my coming
into the place, how I had lived there, and how long;
I let him into the mystery (for such it was to him)
of gunpowder and bullets, and taught him how to
shoot; I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully
delighted with; and I made him a belt with a frog
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers
in; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him
a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in
some cases, but much more useful upon many oc-
casions.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts
of the world. I gave him an account of the wreck
which I had been on board of, and showed him,
as near as I could, the place where she lay; but
she was all beaten in pieces long before, and quite
gone.
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost
when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my
whole strength then, but was now fallen almost all to
pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing
a great while, and said nothing; I asked him what it
was he studied upon? At last, says he, "Me see
such boat like come to place at my nation."
I did not understand him a good while; but at
last, when I had examined further into it, I under-
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived; that
is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of
weather. I presently imagined that some European
ship must have been cast away upon their coast, and
the boat might get loose, and drive ashore; but was
so dull, that I never once thought of men making
escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they
might come; so I only inquired after a description of
the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him, when he added,
with some warmth, "We save the white mans from
drown." Then I presently asked him, if there were
any white mans, as he called them, in the boat?
"Yes," he said, "the boat full of white mans." I
asked him, how many? he told upon his fingers
seventeen. I asked him then, what became of them?
he told me, "They live, they dwell at my nation."
This put new thoughts into my head again; for
I presently imagined, that these might be the men
belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight of
my island, as I now call it; and who, after the ship
was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably
lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were
landed upon that wild shore among the savages.
287
Upon this I inquired of him more critically, what
was become of them? He assured me they lived still
there, that they had been there about four years,
that the savages left them alone, and gave them
victuals to live. I asked him how it came to pass
they did not kill them, and eat them? He said,
"No, they make brother with them:" that is, as I
understood him, a truce: and then he added, "They
eat no mans but when make the war fight:" that is
to say, they never eat any men, but such as come
to fight with them, and are taken in battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the
island, from whence, as I have said, I had in a clear
day discovered the main or continent of America;
Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very
earnestly towards the mainland, and in a kind of
surprise falls a-jumping and dancing, and calls out
to me, for I was at some distance from him: I asked
him what was the matter?"O joy!" says he, "O
glad! there see my country, there my nation!"
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he
had a mind to be in his own country again; and
this observation of mine put a great many thoughts
into me; which made me at first not so easy about
my new man Friday as I was before; and I made no
doubt but that if Friday could get back to his own
nation again, he would not only forget all his religion,
but all his obligations to me; and would be forward
enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and
come back, perhaps, with a hundred or two of them,
and make a feast upon me, at which he might be as
merry as he used to be with those of his enemies,
when they were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very
much, for which I was very sorry afterwards: how-
ever, as my jealousy increased, and held me some
weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so
familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
certainly in the wrong too, the honest grateful
creature having no thought about it, but what con-
sisted of the best principles, both as a religious
Christian and as a grateful friend, as appeared after-
wards to my full satisfaction.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure
I was every day pumping him, to see if he would
discover any of the new thoughts which I suspected
were in him; but I found everything he said was so
honest and so innocent, that I could find nothing to
nourish my suspicion; and in spite of all my uneasi-
ness, he made me at last entirely his own again; nor
did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy; and
therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con-
tinent, I called to him, and said, "Friday, do not you
wish yourself in your own country, your own nation?"
—" Yes," he said," I be much O glad to be at my own
nation." — "What would you do there?" said I:
"would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh again,
and be a savage as you were before?" He looked
full of concern, and shaking his head, said, "No, no,
Friday tell them to live good, tell them to pray God,
tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk, no eat
man again."—"Why, then," said I to him, "they will
kill you." He looked grave at that, and then said,
289
"No, they no kill me, they willing love learn:" he
meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He
added, they learned much of the bearded mans that
came in the boat. Then I asked him if he would go
back to them? He smiled at that, and told me he
could not swim so far. I told him I would make a
canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would
go with him. "I go," said I, "why, they would eat
me if I come there."—" No, no," says he, "me make
them no eat you, me make they much love you : " he
meant he would tell them how I had killed his
enemies and saved his life, and so he would make
them love me. Then he told me, as well as he could,
how kind they were to seventeen white men, or
bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore
in distress.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture
over and see if I could possibly join with these
bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards
or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we
might find some method to escape from thence,
being upon the continent and a good company
together, better than I could from an island forty
miles off the shore, and alone without help. So,
after some days, I took Friday to work again, by
way of discourse; and I told him I would give him
a boat to go back to his own nation; and accordingly
I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island; and having cleared it of water
(for I always kept it sunk in the water), I brought it
out, showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at manag-
ing it, would make it go almost as swift and fast
again as I could; so when he was in I said to him,
VOL. I. T
"Well now, Friday, shall we go to your nation?"
He looked very dull at my saying so, which, it seems,
was because he thought the boat too small to go so
fc>o far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next
day I went to the place where the first boat lay
which I had made, but which I could not get into
the water; he said that was big enough; but then
as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or
three and twenty years there, the sun had split and
dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told
me such a boat would do very well, and would carry
"much enough vittle, drink, bread :" that was his way
of talking.
CHAPTER XVI.
/ determine to go over to the continent—friday
and i construct a boat equal to carry twenty

friday and i fire upon the wretches, and

killed and wounded discover a poor indian
bound in one of the canoes, who turns out to

UPON the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon
my design of going over with him to the continent,
that I told him we would go and make one as big as
that, and he should go home in it. He answered
not one word, but looked very grave and sad. I
asked him what was the matter with him? He
291
asked me again thus, "Why you angry mad with
Friday? what me done?" I asked him what he
meant? I told him I was not angry with him at all:
"No angry! no angry!" says he, repeating the
words several times, "why send Friday home away
to my nation ?"—" Why," said I, "Friday, did you
not say you wished you were there ?"—" Yes, yes,"
says he, "wish be both there; no wish Friday there,
no master there." In a word, he would not think
of going there without me. "I go there, Friday!"
said I; "what should I do there?" He turned very
quick upon me at this; "You do great deal much
good," says he; "you teach wild mans be good,
sober, tame mans; you tell them know God, pray
God, and live new life."—"Alas, Friday," said I,
"thou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an
ignorant man myself."—"Yes, yes," says he, "you
teachee me good, you teachee them good."—"No,
no, Friday," said I, "you shall go without me; leave
me here to live by myself, as I did before." He
looked confused again at that word, and running
to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he
takes it up hastily, and gives it to me. "What must
I do with this?" said I to him. "You take kill
Friday," says he. "What must I kill you for?" said
I again. He returns very quick, "What you send
Friday away for? take kill Friday, no send Friday
away." This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears
stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered
the utmost affection in him to me, that I told him
then, and often after, that I would never send him
away from me, if he was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a
settled affection to me, and that nothing should part
him from me, so I found all the foundation of his
desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent
affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing
them good; a thing which, as I had no notion of
myself, so I had not the least thought, or intention,
or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a
strong inclination to my attempting an escape, as
above, founded on the supposition gathered from the
discourse; viz., that there were seventeen bearded
men there; and therefore, without any delay, I went
to work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper
to fell, and make a large periagua or canoe, to
undertake the voyage; there were trees enough in
the island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas
and canoes only, but even of good large vessels; but
the main thing I looked at, was to get one so near
the water, that we might launch it when it was made,
to avoid the mistake I committed at first.
At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found
he knew much better than I what kind of wood was
fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood
to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very
like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour
and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or
cavity of this tree out, to make it into a boat; but
I showed how rather to cut it out with tools, which
after I showed him how to use, he did very handily;
and in about a month's hard labour we finished it
and made it very handsome, especially when, with
our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we
cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of
a boat; after this, however, it cost us near a fort-
night's time to get her along, as it were inch by
293
inch, upon great rollers, into the water; but when
she was in, she would have carried twenty men with
ease.
When she was in the water, and though she was
so big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity, and
how swift, my man Friday could manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along; so I asked him if he
would, and if we might, venture over in her?"Yes,"
he said, "he venture over in her very well, though
great blow wind." However, I had a further design
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a
mast and sail, and to fit her with an anchor and
cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get;
so I pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and which there was a great
plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to work to
cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape
and order it: but as to the sail, that was my par-
ticular care; I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces
of old sails enough; but as I had had them now
twenty-six years by me, and had not been very care-
ful to preserve them, not imagining that I should
ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt
but they were all rotten; and indeed most of them
were so; however I found two pieces which appeared
pretty good, and with these I went to work, and
with a great deal of pains, and awkward tedious
stitching (you may be sure) for want of needles, I at
length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what
we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the
top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with,
and such as I best knew how to manage; because it
was such a one as I used in the boat in which I made
my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part
of my story.
I was near two months performing this last
work, viz., rigging and fitting my mast and sails,
for I finished them very complete, making a small
stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if we should
turn to windward; and which was more than all, I
fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to steer with; and
though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I
knew the usefulness, and even necessity of such a
thing, I applied myself with so much pains to do it,
that at last I brought it to pass, though, considering
the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I
think it cost me almost as much labour as making the
boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat; for though he knew very well how to paddle
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail
and a rudder, and was the more amazed when he
saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the
rudder, and how the sail gibed, and filled this way or
that way, as the course we sailed changed; I say,
when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and
amazed; however, with a little use, I made all these
things familiar to him, and he became an expert
sailor, except that as to the compass I could make
him understand very little of that; on the other
hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and
seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was
the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were
always to be seen by night, and the shore by day,
except in the rainy seasons; and then nobody cared
to stir abroad, either by land or sea.
295
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the three
last years that I had this creature with me, ought
rather to be left out of the account, my habitation
being quite of another kind than in all the rest of
my time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here
with the same thankfulness to God for His mercies
as at first; and if I had such cause of acknowledg-
ment at first, I had much more so now, having such
additional testimonies of the care of Providence over
me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually
and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible im-
pression upon my thoughts, that my deliverance was
at hand, and that I should not be another year in
this place. However, I went on with my husbandry,
digging, planting, and fencing, as usual; I gathered
and cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing,
as before.
The rainy season was in the meantime upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times;
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we
could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I
said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the
ship; and hauling her up to the shore at high-water
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just
big enough for her to float in; and then, when the
tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end
of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as
to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain off,
we laid a great many boughs of trees so thick, that
she was as well thatched as a house; and thus we
waited for the months of November and December,
in which I designed to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the
thought of my design returned with the fair weather,
I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the first
thing I did was to lay up a certain quantity of pro-
visions, being the store for the voyage; and intended,
in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon
something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and
bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find
a turtle or tortoise; a thing which we generally got
once a week, for the sake of the eggs, as well as the
flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came
running back, and flew over my outward wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps
he set his feet on; and before I had time to speak to
him, he cried out to me, "O master! O master! O
sorrow! O bad!"—"What's the matter, Friday!"
said I. "O yonder there," says he, "one, two, three,
canoe! one, two, three!" By this way of speaking,
I concluded there were six; but on inquiry I found
there were but three. "Well, Friday," said I, "do
not be frighted;" so I heartened him up as well as I
could. However, I saw the poor fellow most terribly
scared; for nothing ran in his head but that they
were come to look for him, and would cut him in
pieces, and eat him; the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him; I comforted
him as well as I could, and told him I was in as
much danger as he, and that they would eat me as
well as him. "But," said I, "Friday, we must re-
solve to fight them: can you fight, Friday ?"—" Me
shoot," says he, "but there come many great num-
ber."—"No matter for that," said I again; "our guns
will fright them that we do not kill." So I asked
him whither, if I resolved to defend him, he would

defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bade him?
He said, "Me die, when you bid die, master;" so I
went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave
him; for I had been so good a husband of my rum,
that I had a great deal left. When he had drank it,
I made him take the two fowling-pieces which we
always carried, and load them with large swan-shot
as big as small pistol-bullets; then I took four mus-
kets, and loaded them with two slugs and five small
bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a
brace of bullets each: I hung my great sword, as
usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared myself, I took my
perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the
hill, to see what I could discover; and I found
quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-
twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes;
and that their whole business seemed to be the
triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies;
a barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more than, as
I had observed, was usual with them.
I observed also that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to the
sea; this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand
these wretches came about, so filled me with indig-
nation, that I came down again to Friday, and told
him I was resolved to go down to them and kill
them all; and asked him if he would stand by me.
He was now gotten over his fright, and his spirits
being a little raised with the dram I had given him,
he was very cheerful; and told me, as before, he
would die when I bid die.
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the
arms, which I had charged, as before, between us;
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and
three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol,
and the other three myself; and in this posture we
marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more
powder and bullet; and as to orders, I charged him to
keep close behind me, and not to stir, shoot, or do
anything till I bid him; and in the meantime, not to
speak a word. In this posture I fetched a compass
to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the
creek as to get into the wood; so that I might come
within shot of them before I could be discovered,
which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former
thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolution;
I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their
number; for as they were naked, unarmed wretches,
it is certain I was superior to them; nay, though I
had been alone; but it occurred to my thoughts,
what call, what occasion, much less what necessity,
I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack
people who had neither done nor intended me any
wrong, who, as to me, were innocent, and whose
barbarous customs were their own disaster, being
in them a token indeed of God's having left them,
with the other nations of that part of the world, to
such stupidity and to such inhuman courses; but
did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of
their actions, much less an executioner of His justice;
that whenever He thought fit, He would take the
cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance
punish them for national crimes; but that in the
299
meantime it was none of my business; that it was
true, Friday might justify it, because he was a de-
clared enemy, and in a state of war with those very
particular people, and it was lawful for him to attack
them; but I could not say the same with respect to
me. These things were so warmly pressed upon my
thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I
would only go place myself near them, that I might
observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act
then as God should direct; but that unless some-
thing offered that was more a call to me than yet
I knew of, I would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood, and with
all possible wariness and silence (Friday following
close at my heels) I marched till I came to the
skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to
them; only that one corner of the wood lay between
me and them: here I called softly to Friday, and
showing him a great tree, which was just at the
corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and
bring me word if he could see there plainly what
they were doing: he did so, and came immediately
back to me, and told me they might be plainly
viewed there; that they were all about the fire, eating
the flesh of one of their prisoners; and that another
lay bound upon the sand, a little from them, whom
he said they would kill next, and which fired the
very soul within me. He told me it was not one of
their nation, but one of the bearded men whom he
had told me of, who came to their country in the
boat. I was filled with horror at the very naming
the white-bearded man, and going to the tree, I saw
plainly by my glass, a white man, who lay upon the
beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied
with flags, or things like rushes; and that he was a
European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the place
where I was, which by going a little way about, I
saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I
should be within half-shot of them; so I withheld
my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the
highest degree; and going back about twenty paces,
I got behind some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to the other tree, and then I came to a
little rising ground, which gave me a full view of
them at the distance of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of
the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all close
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps
limb by limb, to their fire; and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to
Friday; "Now, Friday," said I, "do as I bid thee."
Friday said he would. "Then, Friday," said I, "do
exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing." So I set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon
the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with
the other musket I took my aim at the savages,
bidding him do the like. Then asking him if he was
ready, he said "Yes."—"Then fire at them," said I;
and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them and
wounded three more; and on my side, I killed one,
and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in
a dreadful consternation; and all of them, who were
not hurt, jumped up upon their feet immediately,
301
but did not know which way to run, or which way to
look; for they knew not from whence their destruc-
tion came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me,
that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I did;
so as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down
the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday
did the like; he sees me cock and present; he did
the same again. "Are you ready, Friday?" said I.
"Yes," says he. "Let fly,then," said I, "in the name
of God;" and with that I fired again among the
amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our
pieces were now loaden with what I called swan-
shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only two
drop; but so many were wounded, that they ran
about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all
bloody, and miserably wounded most of them;
whereof three more fell quickly after, though not
quite dead.
"Now, Friday," said I, laying down the discharged
pieces and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden, "follow me," said I; which he did with
a deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of
the wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at
my foot: as soon as I perceived they saw me, I
shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so
too; and running as fast as I could, which by the
way was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I
was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who
was, as I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between
the place where they sat and the sea; the two
butchers who were just going to work with him,
had left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and
fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest
made the same way: I turned to Friday, and bade
him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood
me immediately, and running about forty yards to
be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had
killed them all; for I saw them all fall in a heap
into the boat; though I saw two of them up again
quickly; however, he killed two of them, and
wounded the third, so that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat, as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out
my knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor vic-
tim; and loosing his hands and feet I lifted him up,
and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he
was? he answered in Latin, Christianus; but was
so weak and faint, that he could scarce stand, or
speak; I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave
it him, making signs that he should drink, which
he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he
ate; then I asked him what countryman he was?
and he said Espagnole; and being a little recovered,
let me know, by all the signs he could possibly make,
how much he was in my debt for his deliverance.
"Seignior," said I, with as much Spanish as I could
make up, "we will talk afterwards, but we must
fight now; if you have any strength left, take this
pistol and sword, and lay about you :" he took them
very thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in
his hands, but as if they had put new vigour into
him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and
had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for
the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so
the poor creatures were so much frighted with the
noise of our pieces, that they fell down for mere
amazement and fear, and had no more power to at-
303
tempt their own escape, than their flesh had to resist
our shot; and that was the case of those five that
Friday shot in the boat; for as three of them fell
with the hurt they received, so the other two fell
with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing-,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I
called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which
lay there, that had been discharged, which he did
with great swiftness; and then giving him my mus-
ket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and
bade them come to me when they wanted. While I
was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the
savages, who made at him with one of their great
wooden swords, the same weapon that was to have
killed him before, if I had not prevented it: the
Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as could be
imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian a
good while, and had cut him two great wounds on his
head; but the savage, being a stout lusty fellow,
closing in with him, had thrown him down (being
faint), and was wringing my sword out of his hand,
when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quit-
ting his sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot
the savage through the body, and killed him upon
the spot, before I, who was running to help, could
come near him.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand, but his
hatchet; and with that he despatched those three
who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him
one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued
two of the savages, and wounded them both; but as
he was not able to run, they both got from him into
the woods, where Friday pursued them, and killed
one of them; but the other was too nimble for him;
and though he was wounded, yet he plunged into the
sea, and swam with all his might off to those who
were left in the canoe; which three in the canoe, with
one wounded, who we know not whether he died or
no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-
twenty. The account of the rest is as follows:
3 Killed at our shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto, of those first wounded.
I Killed by ditto in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropped here and there of
their wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase
of them.
4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded if
not dead.
21 in all.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get
out of gun-shot; and though Friday made two or
three shots at them, I did not find that he hit any of
them; Friday would fain have had me take one of
their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was
very anxious about their escape; lest, carrying the
news home to their people, they should come back,
perhaps with two or three hundred of their canoes,
3°5
and devour us by mere multitudes; so I consented
to pursue them by sea; and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in and bade Friday follow me;
but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find
another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand
and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter,
and almost dead with fear, not knowing what the
matter was; for he had not been able to look up
over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard, neck
and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had
really little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not stand or speak,
but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems still,
that he was only unbound in order to be killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out
my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram,
which, with the news of his being delivered, revived
him, and he sat up in the boat; but when Friday
came to hear him speak, and looked in his face, it
would have moved any one to tears, to have seen
how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him,
cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung,
then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face
and head, and then sung and jumped about again
like a distracted creature. It was a good while
before I could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the matter; but when he came a little to
himself, he told me that it was his father.
It was not easy for me to express how it moved
me, to see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked
in this poor savage, at the sight of his father, and of
VOL. I. U
his being delivered from death; nor indeed can I
describe half the extravagances of his affection after
this; for he went into the boat and out of the boat
a great many times: when he went in to him, he
would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his
father's head close to his bosom, half an hour together
to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles,
which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I per-
ceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of
my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great
deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe
with the other savages, who were now gotten almost
out of sight; and it was happy for us that we did
not; for it blew so hard within two hours after, and
before they could be gotten a quarter of their way,
and continued blowing so hard all night, and that
from the north-west, which was against them, that
I could not suppose their boat could live, or that
they ever reached to their own coast.
But to return to Friday: he was so busy about his
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him
off for some time; but after I thought he could leave
him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping
and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme.
Then I asked him if he had given his father any
bread? He shook his head, and said, "None: ugly
dog eat all up self." So I gave him a cake of bread
out of a little pouch I carried on purpose; I also
gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste
it, but carried it to his father: I had in my pocket
also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave
him a handful of them for his father. He had no
307
sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him
come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been
bewitched. He ran at such a rate (for he was the
swiftest fellow of his feet that ever I saw)—I say he
ran at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it
were, in an instant; and though I called and hallooed
too after him, it was all one; away he went and in
a quarter of an hour I saw him come back again,
though not so fast as he went; and as he came
nearer, I found his pace was slacker, because he had
something in his hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his
father some fresh water; and that he had got two
more cakes, or loaves of bread. The bread he gave
me, but the water he carried to his father; however,
as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it:
this water revived his father more than all the rum
or spirits I had given him; for he was just fainting
with thirst.
When his father had drank, I called him, to know
if there was any water left. He said "Yes;" and I
bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in
as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of
the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard too,
who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself
upon a green place, under the shade of a tree, and
whose limbs were also very stiff and very much
swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with:
when I saw that upon Friday's coming to him with
the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread,
and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a
handful of raisins: he looked up in my face with all
the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could
appear in any countenance; but was so weak, not-
withstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight,
that he could not stand upon his feet; he tried to do
it two or three times, but was really not able, his
ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I
bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his
ankles, and bathe them with rum as he had done his
father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature every two
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here,
turned his head about, to see if his father was in the
same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at
last he found he was not to be seen; at which he
started up, and without speaking a word, flew with
that swiftness to him that one could scarce perceive
his feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he
came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease
his limbs; so Friday came back to me presently, and
I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him
up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he
should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take
care of him: but Friday, a lusty young fellow, took
the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried him
away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the
side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the in-
side of it, and then lifted them quite in, and set him
close to his father, and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too; so he brought them both safe into our
creek; and leaving them in the boat, runs away to
fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to
him, and asked him whither he went? He told me
".Go fetch more boat;" so away he went, like the
309
wind; for sure never man or horse ran like him, and
he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon
as I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and
then went to help our new guests out of the boat,
which he did; but they were neither of them able to
walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my thought,
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of
handbarrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car-
ried them up both together upon it between us;
but when we got them to the outside of our wall or
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before;
for it was impossible to get them over; and I was
resolved not to break it down: so I set to work
again; and Friday and I, in about two hours'time,
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails,
and above that with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and between that
and the grove of young wood which I had planted,
and here we made two beds of such things as I had,
viz., of good rice straw, with blankets laid upon it to
lie on, and another to cover them on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought myself
very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked:
first of all, the whole country was my own mere pro-
perty, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion;
2ndly, my people were perfectly subjected. I was
absolute lord and lawgiver. They all owed their
lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives,
if there had been occasion for it, for me; it was
remarkable too, I had but three subjects, and they
were of three different religions. My man Friday
was a Protestant, his father a Pagan and a cannibal,
and the Spaniard was a Papist; however, I allowed
liberty of conscience throughout my dominions, but
this by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter and a place to rest
them upon, I began to think of making some pro-
vision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered
Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a
goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed; then I
cut off the hind quarter, and chopping it into small
pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing,
and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of
flesh and broth, having put some barley and rice also
into the broth; and as I cooked it without doors (for
I made no fire within my inner wall), so I carried it all
into the new tent; and having set a table there for
them, I sat down and ate my dinner also with them,
and as well as I could, cheered them and encouraged
them, Friday being my interpreter, especially to his
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the Spa-
niard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
our muskets and other fire-arms, which, for want of
time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the
next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun,
and would presently be offensive; and I also or-
dered him to bury the horrid remains of their
barbarous feast, which I knew were pretty much,
and which I could not think of doing myself; nay,
I could not bear to see them, if I went that way:
all which he punctually performed, and defaced the
3"
very appearance of the savages being there; so that
when I went again, I could scarce know where it was,
otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing
to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation
with my two new subjects; and first I set Friday to
inquire of his father what he thought of the escape of
the savages in that canoe? and whether he might
expect a return of them with a power too great
for us to resist? His first opinion was, that the
savages in the boat never could live out the storm
which blew that night they went off, but must of
necessity be drowned or driven south to those other
shores, where they were as sure to be devoured, as
they were to be drowned if they were cast away; but
as to what they would do if they came safe on shore,
he said he knew not; but it was his opinion, that
they were so dreadfully frighted with the manner of
being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he be-
lieved they would tell their people they were all
killed by thunder and lightning, and not by the
hand of man; and that the two which appeared (viz.,
Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits or furies
come down to destroy them, and not men with
weapons. This, he said, he knew, because he heard
them all cry out so in their language to one another;
for it was impossible for them to conceive that a
man should dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill
at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was
done now. And this old savage was in the right;
for as I understood since by other hands, the savages
of that part never attempted to go over to the island
afterwards. They were so terrified with the accounts
given by these four men (for it seems they did escape
the sea), that they believed whoever went to that
enchanted island would be destroyed with fire from
the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was
under continual apprehensions for a good while, and
kept always upon my guard, I and all my army; for
as there were now four of us, I would have ventured
upon a hundred of them fairly in the open field at
any time.
In a little time, however, no more canoes appear-
ing, the fear of their coming wore off; and I began
to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the
main into consideration, being likewise assured by
Friday's father that I might depend upon good
usage from their nation on his account if I would
go-

BUT my thoughts were a little suspended, when I
had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when
I understood that there were sixteen more of his
313
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast
away, and made their escape to that side, lived there
at peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore
put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life: I asked
him all the particulars of their voyage; and found
they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la
Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave their
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and
to bring back what European goods they could meet
with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on
board, whom they took out of another wreck; that
five of their own men were drowned when first the
ship was lost; and that these escaped through infinite
dangers and hazards, and arrived almost starved on
the cannibal coast, where they expected to have been
devoured every moment.
He told me they had some arms with them; but
they were perfectly useless; for that they had neither
powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled
all their powder, but a little which they used
at their first landing to provide themselves some
food.
I asked him what he thought would become of
them there; and if they had formed no design of
making any escape? He said, they had many con-
sultations about it; but that having neither vessel,
nor tools to build one, nor provisions'of any kind, their
counsels always ended in tears and despair.
I asked him how he thought they would receive
a proposal from me, which might tend towards an
escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put
my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no
inherent virtue in the nature of man; nor did men
always square their dealings by the obligations they
had received, so much as they did by the advantages
they expected; I told him, it would be very hard
that I should be the instrument of their deliverance,
and that they should afterwards make me their
prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was
certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or
what accident soever, brought him thither; and that
I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and be
devoured alive, than fall into the merciless claws of
the priests, and be carried into the inquisition. I
added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were
all here, we might, with so many hands, build a bark
large enough to carry us all away either to the
Brazils southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast
northward; but that if in requital they should, when
I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by
force among their own people, I might be ill used
for my kindness to them, and make my case worse
than it was before.
He answered with a great deal of candour and
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable, and
that they were so sensible of it, that he believed they
would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly
that should contribute to their deliverance; and that,
if I pleased, he would go to them with the old man,
and discourse with them about it, and return again,
and bring me their answer; that he would make con-
ditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they
would be absolutely under my leading, as their com-
mander and captain; and that they should swear
upon the holy Sacraments and Gospel, to be true to
me, and go to such Christian country as I should
agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly
and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed
safely in such country as I intended; and that he
would bring a contract from them under their hands
for that purpose.
Then he told me, he would first swear to me him-
self, that he would never stir from me as long as he
lived, till I gave him order; and that he would take
my side to the last drop of blood, if there should
happen the least breach of faith among his country-
men.
He told me they were all of them very civil, honest
men, and they were under the greatest distress im-
aginable, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any
food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages;
out of all hopes of ever returning to their own
country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake
their relief, they would live and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to
relieve them if possible, and to send the old savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat; but when
he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so
much prudence in it on one hand, and so much sin-
cerity on the other hand, that I could not but be
very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off
the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a
year. The case was this:
He had been with us now about a month; during
which time I had let him see in what manner I had
provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my
support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn
and rice I had laid up, which, as it was more than
sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least
without good husbandry, for my family, now it was
increased to number four; but much less would it
be sufficient if his countrymen who were, as he
said, fourteen still alive, should come over; and
least of all would it be sufficient to victual our ves-
sel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of
the Christian colonies of America. So he told me,
he thought it would be more advisable to let him
and the other two dig and cultivate some more land,
as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that we
should wait another harvest, that we might have a
supply of corn for his countrymen when they should
come; for want might be a temptation to them to dis-
agree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise
than out of one difficulty into another: "You know,"
says he," the children of Israel, though they rejoiced at
first at their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled
even against God Himself, that delivered them, when
they came to want bread in the wilderness."
His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with
his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fide-
lity. So we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as
the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted;
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it
was seed-time, we had gotten as much land cured
and trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of
barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in
short, all the seed we had to spare; nor indeed did
we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food
for the six months that we had to expect our crop,
that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our
seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it
is six months in the ground in that country.
Having now society enough, and our number
being sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages,
if they had come, unless their number had been very
great, we went freely all over the island, wherever we
found occasion; and as here we had our escape or de-
liverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least
for me, to have the means of it out of mine; to this
purpose, I marked out several trees, which I thought
fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to
cutting them down; and then I caused the Spaniard,
to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to
oversee and direct their work; I showed them with
what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into
single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till
they had made about a dozen large planks of good
oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and
from two inches to four inches thick: what prodigious
labour it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time I contrived to increase my little
flock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard to go out
one day, and myself with Friday the next day, for
we took our turns: and by this means we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock: but, above all, the season
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a
prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that
I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins
of the sun are cured, we should have filled sixty or
eighty barrels; and these with our bread, was a
great part of our food, and very good living too, I
assure you; for it is an exceeding nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order;
it was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in
the island, but, however, it was enough to answer
our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley, we
brought in and threshed out above two hundred and
twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the rice,
which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been
on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for
a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled
our ship, to have carried us to any part of the world,
that is to say, of America. When we had thus
housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell
to work to make more wicker-work; viz., great
baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was
very handy and dexterous at this part, and often
blamed me, that I did not make some things for
defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of
it. And now having a full supply of food for all the
guests expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main, to sec what he could do with those
he left behind him there: I gave him a strict charge
in writing not to bring any man with him, who would
not first swear, in the presence of himself and of the
old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with,
or attack the person he should find in the island,
who was so kind to send for them, in order to their
deliverance; but that they would stand by and
defend him against all such attempts; and wherever
they went, would be entirely under, and subjected
to his command; and that this should be put in
writing and signed with their hands: how we were
to have this done, when I knew they had neither
pen nor ink, that indeed was a question which we
never asked.
319
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the
old savage (the father of Friday), went away in one
of the canoes, which they might be said to come in,
or rather were brought in, when they came as pri-
soners to be devoured by the savages.
I gave each of them a musket with a firelock
on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball,
charging them to be very good husbands of both,
and not to use either of them but upon urgent occa-
sions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first measures
used by me in view of my deliverance for now
twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them
provisions of bread, and of dried grapes sufficient for
themselves for many days, and sufficient for their
countrymen for about eight days time; and wishing
them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing with
them about a signal they should hang out at their
return, by which I should know them again, when
they came back, at a distance, before they came on
shore.
They went away with a fair gale on the day that
the moon was at the full; by my account in the
month of October; but as for the exact reckoning of
days, after I had once lost it, I could never recover it
again; nor had I kept even the number of years so
punctually, as to be sure that I was right, though, as
it proved when I afterwards examined my account, I
found I had kept a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened,
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in
history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning,
when my man Friday came running in to me, and
called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they
are come."
I jumped up, and regardless of danger, I went out
as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my
little grove, which (by the way) was by this time
grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of
danger, I went without my arms, which was not my
custom to do; but I was surprised, when, turning my
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a
league and a halfs distance, standing in for the shore,
with a shoulder of mutton sail, as they call it, and the
wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in. Also I
observed presently, that they did not come from that
side which the shore lay on, but from the southern-
most end of the island. Upon this I called Friday
in, and bid him lie close, for these were not the people
we looked for, and that we did not know yet whether
they were friends or enemies.
In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspec-
tive-glass, to see what I could make of them; and
having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the
top of the hill, as I used to do when I was appre-
hensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer
without being discovered.
I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye
plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about
two leagues and a half's distance from me, S.S.E.
but not above a league and a half from the shore.
By my observation it appeared plainly to be an Eng-
lish ship, and the boat appeared to be an English
long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one whom I had reason
to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and
321
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep
upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me
to consider what business an English ship could have
in that part of the world; since it was not the way to
or from any part of the world where the English had
any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to
drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they
were English really, it was most probable that they
were here upon no good design; and that I had
better continue as I was, than fall into the hands of
thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of
danger which sometimes are given him when he may
think there is no possibility of its being real. That
such hints and notices are given us, I believe few
that have made any observation of things can deny •
that they are certain discoveries of an invisible world,
and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if
the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of
danger, why should we not suppose they are from
some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior
and subordinate, is not the question), and that they
are given for our good?
The present question abundantly confirms me in
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been
made cautious by this secret admonition, come from
whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and
in a far worse condition than before, as you will see
presently.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at for the convenience of
VOL. L X
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
landing; however, as they did not come quite far
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I
formerly landed my rafts, but run their boat on
shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me,
which was very happy for me; for otherwise they
would have landed just, as I may say, at my door,
and would have soon beaten me out of my castle,
and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on shore I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one
or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove
so. There were in all eleven men, whereof three
of them I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them were
jumped on shore, they took those three out of the
boat as prisoners; one of the three I could perceive
using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, af-
fliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance;
the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands
sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, but not
to such a degree as the first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew
not what the meaning of it should be; Friday called
out to me in English, as well as he could, "O
master! you see English mans eat prisoners as well
as savage mans."—" Why," said I, "Friday, do you
think they are going to eat them then?"—"Yes,"
says Friday, "they will eat them." "No, no," said
I, "Friday; I am afraid they will murder them in-
deed; but you may be sure they will not eat them."
All this while I had no thought of what the mat-
ter really was, but stood trembling with the horror
of the sight, expecting every moment when the three
prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of
the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass (as
the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one of the
poor men; and I expected to see him fall every
moment, at which all the blood in my body seemed
to run chill in my veins.
I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the
savage that was gone with him; or that I had any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of them,
that I might have rescued the three men; for I saw
no fire-arms they had among them; but it fell out to
my mind another way.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of the
three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the
fellows ran scattering about the land, as if they
wanted to see the country. I observed, also, that
the three other men had liberty to go where they
pleased; but they sat down all three upon the
ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair.
This put me in mind of the first time when I
came on shore, and began to look about me; how I
gave myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round
me, what dreadful apprehensions I had, and how I
lodged in the tree all night for fear of being devoured
by wild beasts.
As I knew nothing that night of the supply I
was to receive by the providential driving of the ship
nearer the land, by the storms and tides, by which
I have since been so long nourished and supported:
so these three poor desolate men knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they were,
how near it was to them, and how effectually and
really they were in a condition of safety, at the same
time they thought themselves lost, and their case
desperate.
So little do we see before us in the world, and
so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon
the great Maker of the world, that He does not
leave His creatures so absolutely destitute, but that
in the worst circumstances they have always some-
thing to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even
brought to their deliverance by the means by which
they seem to be brought to their destruction.
It was just at the top of high water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
parleying with the prisoners they brought, and
partly while they rambled about to see what kind
of place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed consider-
ably away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast
aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the rest who
were straggling about, upon which they all soon
came to the boat; but it was past all their strength
to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the
shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost
like a quicksand.
In this condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps
the least of all mankind given to forethought, they
gave it over, and away they strolled about the country
again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another
(calling them off from the boat), "Why, let her alone,
Jack, can't ye? she'll float next tide." By which I
was fully confirmed in the main inquiry, of what
countrymen they were. -.
«
All this while I kept myself close, not once daring
to stir out of my castle, any further than to my
place of observation, near the top of the hill; and
very glad I was to think how well it was fortified.
I knew it was no less than ten hours before the
boat could be on float again, and by that time it
would be dark, and I might be more at liberty to
see their motions, and to hear their discourse, if
they had any.
In the meantime I fitted myself up for a battle,
as before, though with more caution, knowing I had
to do with another kind of enemy than I had at
first; I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an
excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself
with arms: I took myself two fowling-pieces, and
I gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed,
was very fierce; I had my formidable goatskin
coat on, with the great cap I mentioned, a naked
sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each
shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have
made any attempt till it was dark; but about two
o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that in
short they were all gone straggling into the woods,
and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep. The
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their con-
dition to get any sleep, were however set down under
the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a
mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any
of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immediately
I marched in the figure above, my man Friday at a
good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms
as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like
figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to
them in Spanish, "What are ye, gentlemen?"
They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure that I made: they made no answer at all, but
I thought I perceived them just going to fly from me,
when I spoke to them in English : "Gentlemen," said
I, "do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may have
a friend near you, when you did not expect it." "He
must be sent directly from Heaven, then," said one of
them very gravely to me, pulling off his hat at the
same time, "for our condition is past the help of man."
"All help is from Heaven, sir," said I: "but can you
put a stranger in the way how to help you? for you
seem to me to be in some great distress. I saw you
when you landed; and when you seemed to make
application to the brutes that came with you, I saw
one of them lift up his sword to kill you."
The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned,
"Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real man, or
an angel ?"—" Be in no fear about that, sir," said I:
"if God had sent an angel to relieve you, He would
have come better clothed, and armed after another
manner than you see me in; pray lay aside your
fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to
assist you; you see I have one servant only; we have
arms and ammunition; tell us freely can we serve
you? What is your case?"
"Our case," said he, "sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are so near; but in short, sir, I
327
was commander of that ship; my men having muti-
nied against me, they have been hardly prevailed on
not to murder me, and at last have set me on shore
in this desolate place, with these two men with me,
one my mate, the other a passenger, where we ex-
pected to perish, believing the place to be unin-
habited, and know not yet what to think of it."
"Where are those brutes, your enemies ?" said I;
"do you know where they are gone ?"—" There they
are, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; "my
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard
you speak; if they have, they will certainly murder
us all."
"Have they any fire-arms?" said I: he answered,
"They had only two pieces, and one which they
left in the boat."—"Well, then," said I, "leave the
rest to me; I see they are all asleep; it is an easy
thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take
them prisoners?" He told me there were two des-
perate villains among them, that it was scarce safe
to show any mercy to; but if they were secured, he
believed all the rest would return to their duty: I
asked him which they were? He told me, he could
not at that distance describe them; but he would
obey my orders in anything I would direct. "Well,"
said I, "let us retreat out of their view or hearing,
lest they awake, and we will resolve further;" so
they willingly went back with me, till the woods
covered us from them.
"Look you, sir," said I, "if I venture upon your
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions
with me?" He anticipated my proposals, by telling
me, that both he and his ship, if recovered, should
be wholly directed and commanded by me in every-
thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he would
live and die with me in what part of the world
soever I would send him; and the other two men
said the same.
"Well," said I, "my conditions are but two: 1.
That while you stay on this island with me, you
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I
put arms into your hands, you will upon all occasions
give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or
mine, upon this island, and in the meantime to be
governed by my orders.
"2. That if the ship is or may be recovered, you
will carry me and my man to England, passage
free."
He gave me all the assurance that the invention
and faith of a man could devise, that he would
comply with these most reasonable demands; and
besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all occasions as long as he lived.
"Well, then," said I, "here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you
think is proper to be done." He showed all the
testimony of his gratitude that he was able; but
offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him,
I thought it was hard venturing anything, but the
best method I could think of was, to fire upon them
at once, as they lay; and if any were not killed at
the first volley, and offered to submit, we might
save them, and so put it wholly upon God's provi-
dence to direct the shot.
He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all
the mutiny in the ship; and if they escaped, we
329
should be undone still; for they would go on
board, and bring the whole ship's company, and
destroy us all. "Well then," said I, "necessity legi-
timates my advice; for it is the only way to save
our lives."
However, seeing him still cautious of shedding
blood, I told him, they should go themselves, and
manage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on
their feet. I asked him if either of them were the
men who he had said were the heads of the mutiny?
He said, No. "Well then," said I, "you may let
them escape, and Providence seems to have wakened
them on purpose to save themselves. Now," said I,
"if the rest escape you, it is your fault."
Animated with this, he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and his
two comrades with him, with each man a piece in
his hand: the two men who were with him, going
first, made some noise, at which one of the seamen,
who was awake, turned about, and seeing them
coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too late
then: for the moment he cried out, they fired; I
mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving his
own piece: they had so well aimed their shot at
the men they knew, that one of them was killed
on the spot, and the other very much wounded;
but not being dead, he started up to his feet, and
called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain
stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for
help; he should call upon God to forgive his villany;
and with that word knocked him down with the
stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more:
there were three more in the company, and one of
them was also slightly wounded. By this time I
was come; and when they saw their danger, and
that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy.
The captain told them he would spare their lives, if
they would give him any assurance of their abhor-
rence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and
would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the
ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica,
from whence they came. They gave him all the
protestations of their sincerity that could be desired,
and he was willing to believe them, and spare their
lives which I was not against; only I obliged him
to keep them bound hand and foot while they were
upon the island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure
her, and bring away the oars and sail, which they
did; and by and by, three straggling men, that
were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came
back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their
captain who before was their prisoner, now their
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and
so our victory was complete.
It now remained that the captain and I should
inquire into one another's circumstances: I began
first, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and in-
deed as my story is a whole collection of wonders,
it affected him deeply; but when he reflected from
thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been
preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears
331
ran down his face, and he could not speak a word
more.
After this communication was at an end, I carried
him and his two men into my apartments, leading
them in just where I came out, viz., at the top of the
house; where I refreshed them with such provisions
as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I
had made during my long, long inhabiting that
place.
All I showed them, all I said to them, was per-
fectly amazing; but, above all, the captain admired
my fortification: and how perfectly I had concealed
my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having now
been planted near twenty years, and the trees grow-
ing much faster than in England, was become a
little wood, and so thick, that it was unpassable in
any part of it, but at that one side where I had re-
served my little winding passage into it: this I told
him was my castle, and my residence; but that I
had a seat in the country, as most princes have,
whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would
show him that too another time; but at present our
business was to consider how to recover the ship.
He agreed with me as to that; but told me he was
perfectly at a loss what measure to take; for that
there were still six-and-twenty hands on board, who
having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which
they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would
be hardened in it now by desperation; and would
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced, they
should be brought to the gallows as soon as they
came to England, or to any of the English colonies;
and that therefore there would be no attacking them
with so small a number as we were.
'THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it was a very rational conclusion, and that
therefore something was to be resolved on very speed-
ily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare
for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us,
and destroying us. Upon this, it presently occurred
to me, that in a little while the ship's crew, wondering
what was become of their comrades and of the boat,
would certainly come on shore in their other boat to
see for them; and that then perhaps they might come
armed, and be too strong for us; this he allowed was
rational.
Upon this I told him the first thing we had to do
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so
that they might not carry her off; and taking every-
thing out of her, leaving her so far useless as not to
be fit to swim; accordingly we went on board, took
the arms which were left on board out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of
brandy and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a
horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece
of canvas; the sugar was five or six pounds; all
which was very welcome to me, especially the
brandy and sugar, of which I had none left for many
years.
When we had carried all these things on shore
(the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were
carried before as above), we knocked a great hole in
her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to
master us, yet they could not carry off the boat.
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts that we
could be capable to recover the ship; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again to carry
333
us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our
friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still
in my thoughts.
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE SHIP MAKES SIGNALS FOR HER BOAT—ON RECEIVING
NO ANSWER, SHE SENDS ANOTHER BOAT ON SHORE
METHODS BY WHICH WE SECURE THIS BOAT'S CREW,
AND RECOVER THE SHIP.
WHILE we were thus preparing our designs, and had
first by main strength heaved the boat up upon the
beach, so high that the tide would not float her off at
high water mark; and, besides, had broken a hole in
her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were
sat down musing what we should do; we heard the
ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her
ancient, as a signal for the boat to come on board;
but no boat stirred; and they fired several times,
making other signals for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw
them (by the help of our glasses) hoist another boat
out, and row towards the shore; and we found, as
they approached, that there were no less than ten
men in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore,
we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain
sight of the men, even of their faces; because the
tide having set them a little to the east of the other
boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the
same place where the other had landed, and where
the boat lay.
By this means, I say, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the persons and characters of
all the men in the boat; of whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows who he was sure were
led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over-
powered and frighted: but that for the boatswain,
who, it seems, was the chief officer among them, and
all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the
ship's crew; and were, no doubt, made desperate in
their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he
was, that they would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our
circumstances were past the operations of fear; that
seeing almost every condition that could be was
better than that we were supposed to be in, we ought
to expect that the consequence, whether death or
life, would be sure to be a deliverance: I asked him,
what he thought of the circumstances of my life, and
whether a deliverance were not worth venturing
for?"And where, sir," said I, "is your belief of
my being preserved here on purpose to save your life,
which elevated you a little while ago? For my part,"
said I, "there seems to be one thing amiss in all the
prospect of it."—"What's that?" says he. "Why,"
said I, "'tis that as you say, there are three or four
honest fellows among them, which should be spared;
had they been all of the'wicked part of the crew, I
should have thought God's providence had singled
them out to deliver them into your hands: for,
depend upon it, every man of them that comes
ashore are our own, and shall die or live as they
behave to us."
335
As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so
we set vigorously to our business. We had, upon
the first appearance of the boat's coming from the
ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and had
indeed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured
than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the
three (delivered men) to my cave, where they were
remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods,
if they could have delivered themselves: here they
left them bound, but gave them provisions, and
promised them, if they continued there quietly, to
give them their liberty in a day or two; but that if
they attempted their escape, they should be put to
death without mercy. They promised faithfully to
bear their confinement with patience, and were very
thankful that they had such good usage as to have
provisions and a light left them; for Friday gave
them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their
comfort; and they did not know but that he stood
sentinel over them at the entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage > two of them
were kept pinioned indeed, because the captain was
not free to trust them; but the other two were taken
into my service upon their captain's recommendation,
and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die
with us; so, with them and the three honest men,
we were seven men well armed; and I made no
doubt we should be able to deal well enough with
the ten that were a-coming, considering that the
captain had said, there were three or four honest
men among them also.
As soon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and
came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them,
which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would
rather have left the boat at an anchor, some distance
from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her;
and so we should not be able to seize the boat.
Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran
all to the other boat; and it was easy to see they
were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as
above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her
bottom.
After they had mused a while upon this, they set
up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions
hear; but all was to no purpose: then they came all
close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms,
which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the
woods ring; but it was all one: those in the cave
we were sure could not hear; and those in our keep-
ing, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give
no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go
all on board again to their ship, and let them know
there that the men were all murdered and the long
boat staved; accordingly, they immediately launched
the boat again, and got all of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the ship again and set sail, giving their comrades up
for lost, and so he should still lose the ship which he
was in hopes we should have recovered; but he was
quickly as much frighted the other way.
337
They had not been long put off with the boat, but
we perceived them all coming on shore again; but
with this new measure in their conduct, which it
seems they consulted together upon; viz., to leave
three men in the boat, and the rest to go on shore,
and go up into the country to look for their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us; for now
we were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if
we let the boat escape, because they would then row
away to the ship; and then the rest of them would
be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our recovering
the ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present. The seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained in
the boat put her off to a good distance from the
shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them; so
that it was impossible for us to come at them in the
boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay; and we could see them
plainly, though they could not perceive us; we
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them;
or that they would have gone further off, that we
might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the hill,
where they could see a great way in the valley and
woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hal-
looed till they were weary; and not caring, it seems,
to venture far from the shore, nor far from one
VOL. I. Y
another, they sat down together under a tree, to con-
sider of it; had they thought fit to have gone to
sleep there, as the other party of them had done,
they had done the job for us; but they were too full
of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep,
though they could not tell what the danger was they
had to fear neither.
The captain made a very just proposal to me
upon this consultation of theirs; viz., that perhaps
they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to
make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally
upon them, just at the juncture when their pieces
were all discharged, and they would certainly yield,
and we should have them without bloodshed. I
liked the proposal, provided it was done while we
were near enough to come up to them, before they
could load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen, and we lay still a
long time very irresolute what course to take; at
length I told them there would be nothing to be
done in my opinion till night; and then if they did
not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way
to get between them and the shore, and so might
use some stratagem with them in the boat, to get
them on shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneasy; when,
after long consultations, we saw them start all up,
and march down towards the sea: it seems they had
such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger
of the place, that they resolved to go on board the
ship again, give their companions over for lost, and
so go on with their intended voyage with the
ship.
339
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined it to be as it really was; that they had
given over their search, and were for going back
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of
it; but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch
them back again, and which answered my end to a
tittle.
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go
over the little creek westward, towards the place
where the savages came on shore when Friday was
rescued; and as soon as they came to a little rising
ground at about half a mile distance, I bade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they found
the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they
heard the seamen answer them, they should return
it again, and then, keeping out of sight, take a
round, always answering when the others hallooed,
to draw them as far into the island, and among the
woods, as possible, and then wheel about again to
me, by such ways as I directed.
They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard
them, and answering, run along the shore westward,
towards the voice they heard, when they were pre-
sently stopped by the creek, where the water being
up, they could not get over, and calling for the boat
to come up, and set them over, as indeed I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed
that the boat being gone up a good way into the creek,
and as it were in a harbour within the land, they
took one of the three men out of her to go along with
them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened
her to the stump of a little tree on the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their busi-
ness, I took the rest with me, and crossing the creek
out of their sight, we surprised the two men before
they were aware, one of them lying on shore, and
the other being in the boat; the fellow on shore was
between sleeping and waking, and going to start up,
the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him and
knocked him down, and then called out to him in
the boat to yield, or he was a dead man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him,
and his comrade knocked down; besides, this was,
it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in
the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to
join very sincerely with us.
In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business with the rest, that
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one hill to another, and from one wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, but left them
where they were very sure they could not reach back
to the boat before it was dark; and indeed they were
heartily tired themselves also by the time they came
back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make
sure work with them.
It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came
quite up, calling to those behind to come along; and
could also hear them answer, and complain how
341
lame and tired they were, and not being able to come
any faster, which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is
impossible to express their confusion, when they
found the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide
ebbed out, and their two men gone; we could hear
them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were gotten into
an enchanted island; that either there were inha-
bitants in it, and they should all be murdered; or
else there were devils or spirits in it, and they should
be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two com-
rades by their names a great many times, but no
answer: after some time, we could see them, by the
little light there was, run about wringing their hands,
like men in despair; and that sometimes they would
go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then
come ashore, and walk about again, and so the same
thing over again.
My men would fain have had me given them leave
to fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was
willing to take them at some advantage, so to spare
them, and kill as few of them as I could; and espe-
cially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our
men, knowing the other men were very well armed:
I resolved to wait to see if they did not separate;
and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my
ambuscade nearer; and ordered Friday and the
captain to creep upon their hands and feet as close
to the ground as they could, that they might not be
discovered, and get as near them as they could
possibly, before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, till the
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the
mutiny, and had now shown himself the most de-
jected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking
towards them with two more of the crew; the cap-
tain was so eager, at having the principal rogue so
much in his power, that he could hardly have patience
to let him come so near as to be sure of him; for
they only heard his tongue before: but when they
came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on
their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next
man was shot in the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after; and
the third run for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men;
viz., myself generalissimo; Friday my lieutenant-
general; the captain and his two men, and the three
prisoners of war, whom he had trusted with arms.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the
man they had left in the boat, who was now one of
us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them
to terms; which fell out just as we desired; for in-
deed it was easy to think, as their condition then
was, they would be very willing to capitulate; so he
calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them, "Tom
Smith, Tom Smith." Tom Smith answered immedi-
ately, "Who's that? Robinson?" For it seems
he knew his voice. The other answered, "Ay, ay;
for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms,
and yield, or you are all dead men this moment."
"Who must we yield to? where are they?" says
343
Smith again. "Here they are," says he; "here is
our captain and fifty men with him, have been hunt-
ing you this two hours; the boatswain is killed,
Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if
you do not yield, you are all lost."
"Will they give us quarter, then," says Tom
Smith, "and we will yield?" "I'll go and ask, if
you promise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked
the captain, and the captain himself then calls out,
"You, Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down
your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have
your lives, all but Will Atkins."
Upon this Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake,
captain, give me quarter: what have I done? they
have all been as bad as I" (which by the way was
not true, either; for it seems this Will Atkins was the
first man that laid hold of the captain when they
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying
his hands, and giving him injurious language); how-
ever, the captain told him he must lay down his
arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy,
by which he meant me; for they all called me
governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had
parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them
all; and then my great army of fifty men, which
particularly with those three, were in all but eight came up and seized upon them all, and upon their
boat, only that I kept myself and one more out of
sight, for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he
had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with
them upon the villany of their practices with him,
and at length, upon the further wickedness of their
design; and how certainly it must bring them to
misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives: as for that, he told them they were
none of his prisoners, but the commander's of the island; that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren uninhabited island; but it had pleased
God so to direct them, that the island was inhabited,
and that the governor was an Englishman; that he
might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he
had given them all quarter, he supposed he would send
them to England, to be dealt with there as justice
required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded
by the governor to advise to prepare for death; for
that he would be hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had
its desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees to beg
the captain to intercede with the governor for his
life; and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake,
that they might not be sent to England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver-
ance was come, and that it would be a most easy
thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting
possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from
them, that they might not see what kind of a governor
they had, and called the captain to me: when I
called, as at a good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, "Cap-
tain, the commander calls for you," and presently the
captain replied, "Tell his excellency I am just a-
coming." This more perfectly amused them; and
345
they all believed that the commander was just by
with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonder-
fully well, and resolved to put it in execution the
next morning.
But in order to execute it with more art, and to
be secure of success, I told him we must divide the
prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins, and
two more of the worst of them, and send them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay: this was
committed to Friday, and the two men who came on
shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison;
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition.
The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it,
of which I have given a full description; and as it
was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was
secure enough, considering they were upon their
behaviour.
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to
try them, and tell me, whether he thought they might
be trusted or no to go on board, and surprise the
ship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of
the condition they were brought to; and that though
the governor had given them quarter for their lives,
as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to
England, they would all be hanged in chains, to be
sure; but that if they would join in such an attempt
as to recover the ship, he would have the governor's
engagement for their pardon. Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell _down on their knees to the captain, and pro-
mised, with the deepest imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that
they should owe their lives to him and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own
him for a father to them as long as they lived.
"Well," says the captain, " I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to consent to it." So he brought me an
account of the temper he found them in; and that
he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told
him he should go back again, and choose out five of
them, and tell them that they should see that they
did not want men; but he would take out those five
to be his assistants, and that the governor would
keep the other two, and the three that were sent
prisoners to the castle (my cave), as hostages for
the fidelity of those five; and that, if they proved
unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should
be hanged in chains alive upon the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest; however, they had no way
left them but to accept it; and it was now the busi-
ness of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to
persuade the other five to do their duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the ex-
pedition: 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger.
2. Then the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom,
having their characters from the captain, I had given
their liberty, and trusted them with arms. 3. The
other two whom I kept till now in my bower pinioned,
but, upon the captain's motion, had now released.
347
4. These five released at last; so that they were
twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the
cave for hostages.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture
with these hands on board the ship: for, as for me,
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper
for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it
was employment enough for us to keep them asunder,
and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep
them fast; but Friday went twice a day to them,
to supply them with necessaries; and I made the
other two carry provisions to a certain distance
where Friday was to take it.
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was
with the captain, who told them, I was the person
the governor had ordered to look after them, and
that it was the governor's pleasure that they should
not stir anywhere but by my direction; that if they
did, they should be fetched into the castle, and be
laid in irons; so that as we never suffered them to
see me as governor, so I now appeared as another
person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the
castle, and the like upon all occasions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him, but
to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and
man them: he made his passenger captain of one,
with four other men; and himself, and his mate, and
five more, went in the other: and they contrived
their business very well; for they came up to the
ship about midnight. As soon as they came within
call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and
tell them he had brought off the men and the boat,
but that it was a long time before they had found
them, and the like; holding them in a chat, till they
came to the ship's side; when the captain and the
mate, entering first with their arms, immediately
knocked down the second mate and carpenter with
the butt end of their muskets; being very faithfully
seconded by their men, they secured all the rest that
were upon the main and quarter decks, and began
to fasten the hatches to keep them down who were
below: when the other boat, and their men, entering
at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of the ship,
and the scuttle which went down into the cook-room,
making three men they found there prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break
into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay,
and having taken the alarm, was gotten up, and with
two men and a boy had gotten fire-arms in their
hands; and when the mate with a crow split open
the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket-
ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of
the men, but killed nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and with his
pistol shot the new captain through the head, the
bullets entering at his mouth, and came out again
behind one of his ears; so that he never spoke a
word; upon which the rest yielded, and the ship
was taken effectually without any more lives being
lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal
agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his success;
which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, hav-
349
ing sat watching upon the shore for it till near two of
the clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to
me, I slept very sound, till I was something surprised
with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I
heard a man call me by the name of Governor, Gover-
nor! and presently I knew the captain's voice; when
climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and
pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms:
"My dear friend and deliverer," says he, "there's
your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all
that belong to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and
there she rode within a little more than half a mile of
the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon
as they were masters of her; and the weather being
fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little creek; and the tide being up, the
captain had brought the pinnace in near the place
where I first landed my rafts, and so landed just at
my door.
I was, at first, ready to sink down with the sur-
prise: for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At
first, for some time, I was not able to answer one
word; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast
by him, or I should have fallen to the ground.
He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled
a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of
cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me:
after I drank it I sat down upon the ground, and
though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a word to him.
All this while the poor man was in as great an
ecstacy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was;
and he said a thousand kind tender things to me, to
compose and bring me to myself: but such was the
flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into
confusion; at last it broke into tears, and in a little
while after I recovered my speech.
Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my
deliverer; and we rejoiced together: I told him, I
looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed
to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these
were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Pro-
vidence governing the world, and an evidence, that
the eyes of an infinite Power could search into the
remotest corner of the world, and send help to the
miserable whenever He pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to
Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless Him,
who had not only in a miraculous manner provided
for one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate
condition, but from whom every deliverance must
always be acknowledged to proceed?
When we had talked awhile, the captain told me
he had brought me some little refreshments, such as
the ship afforded, and such as the wretches who had
been so long his masters had not plundered him of.
Upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bids his
men bring the things ashore that were for the gover-
nor; and indeed it was a present, as if I had been
one, not that I was to be carried along with them,
but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still,
and they were to go without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of
excellent cordial waters; six large bottles of Madeira
wine, the bottles held two quarts apiece; two pounds
of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the
ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of
pease, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit.
He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour,
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and
abundance of other things: but besides these, and
what was a thousand times more useful to me, he
brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neck-
clothes, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat,
and one pair of stockings, and a very good suit of
clothes of his own, which had been worn but very
little. In a word, he clothed me from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any
one may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but
never was anything in the world of that kind so
unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me
to wear such clothes at their first putting on.
After these ceremonies passed, and after all his
good things were brought into my little apartment,
we began to consult what was to be done with the
prisoners we had; for it was worth considering
whether we might venture to take them away with
us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to
be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and
the captain said, he knew they were such rogues, that
there was no obliging them; and if he did carry them
away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be
delivered over to justice at the first English colony
he could come at; and I found that the captain him-
self was very anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that, if he desired it, I durst
undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
it their own request that he should leave them upon
the island: "I should be very glad of that," says the
captain, "with all my heart."
"Well," said I, " I will send for them, and talk with
them for you :" so I caused Friday and the two host-
ages, for they were now discharged, their comrades
having performed their promise; I say, I caused
them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men,
pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them
there till I came.
After some time, I came thither dressed in my
new habit, and now I was called governor again.
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused
the men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full account of their villainous behaviour
to the captain, and how they had run away with the
ship, and were preparing to commit further robberies;
but that Providence had ensnared them in their own
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which
they had digged for others.
I let them know, that by my direction the ship
had been seized, that she lay now in the road, and
they might see, by and by, that their new captain
had received the reward of his villany; for that they
might see him hanging at the yard-arm: that as to
them, I wanted to know what they had to say, why
I should not execute them as pirates taken in the
fact, as by my commission they could not doubt I
had authority to do.
One of them answered in the name of the rest,
that they had nothing to say but this, that when they
were taken, the captain promised them their lives,
and they humbly implored my mercy: but I told
them I knew not what mercy to show them; for, as
353
for myself, I had resolved to quit the island with all
my men, and had taken passage with the captain to
go for England: and as for the captain, he could
not carry them to England, other than as prisoners
in irons to be tried for mutiny and running away
with the ship; the consequence of which, they must
needs know, would be the gallows; so that I could
not tell which was best for them, unless they had a
mind to take their fate in the island; if they desired
that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it: I
had some inclination to give them their lives, if they
thought they could shift on shore. They seemed
very thankful for it; said they would much rather
venture to stay there, than to be carried to England
to be hanged; so I left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some diffi-
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there; upon
this I seemed to be a little angry with the captain,
and told him, that they were my prisoners, not his;
and that seeing I had offered them so much favour,
I would be as good as my word; and that if he did
not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at
liberty as I found them; and if he did not like that,
he might take them again if he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire
into the woods, to the place whence they came, and
I would leave them some firearms, some ammuni-
tion, and some directions how they should live very
well, if they thought fit.
Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship,
but told the captain, that I would stay that night to
prepare my things; and desired him to go on board
in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and
VOL. I. Z
send the boat on shore the next day for me: ordering
him in the meantime to cause the new captain who
was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these
men might see him.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up
to me to my apartment, and entered seriously into
discourse with them of their circumstances: I told
them I thought they had made a right choice; that
if the captain carried them away, they would certainly
be hanged: I showed them their captain hanging at
the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had
nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to
stay, I then told them I would let them into the
story of my living there, and put them into the way
of making it easy to them: accordingly I gave them
the whole history of the place, and of my coming to
it; showed them my fortifications, the way I made
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and,
in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy.
I told them the story of the sixteen Spaniards that
were to be expected; for whom I left a letter, and
made them promise to treat them in common with
themselves.
I left them my firearms; viz., five muskets, three
fowling-pieces, and three swords: I had about a
barrel of powder left; for after the first year or two
I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a
description of the way I managed the goats, and
directions to milk and fatten them, to make both
butter and cheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own
story; and I told them I would prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder
355
more, and some garden-seed, which I told them I
would have been very glad of; also I gave them
the bag of peas which the captain had brought me
to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase
them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day
and went on board the ship; we prepared imme-
diately to sail, but did not weigh that night: the
next morning early two of the five men came
swimming to the ship's side, and, making a most
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to
be taken into the ship for God's sake, for they
should be murdered: and begged the captain to
take them on board though he hanged them imme-
diately.
Upon this the captain pretended to have no power
without me; but after some difficulty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on
board, and were some time after soundly whipped
and pickled; after which they proved very honest
and quiet fellows.
Some time after this I went with the boat on
shore, the tide being up, with the things promised
to the men, to which the captain, at my intercession,
caused their chests and clothes to be added, which
they took, and were very thankful for: I also en-
couraged them, by telling them, that if it lay in my
way to send a vessel to take them in, I would not
forget them.
CHAPTER XIX.
/ TAKE LEAVE OF THE ISLAND, AND, AFTER A LONG
VOYAGE ARRIVE IN ENGLAND—GO DOWN INTO YORK-
SHIRE, AND FIND THE GREATER PART OF MY FAMILY
DEADRESOLVE TO GO TO LISBON FOR INFORMATION RESPECTING MY PLANTA TION AT THE BRAZILS—MEET
AN OLD FRIEND THERE, BY WHOSE MEANS I BECOME
RICHSET OUT FOR ENGLAND OVER LAND MUCH ANNOYED BY WOLVES ON THE ROAD.
WHEN I took leave of this island I carried on board
for relics the great goat-skin cap I had made, my
umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I forgot not
to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had
lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty,
or tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver till it
had been a little rubbed and handled; and also the
money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.
And thus I left the island the nineteenth of De-
cember, as I found by the ship's account, in the year
1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years,
two months and nineteen days: being delivered from
the second captivity the same day of the month that
I first made my escape in the barcolongo from
among the Moors of Salee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687,
having been thirty and five years absent.
When I came to England, I was a perfect stranger
to all the world, as if I had never been known there:
my benefactor and faithful steward, whom I had left in
trust with my money, was alive, but had had great
misfortunes in the world, was become a widow the
357
second time, and very low in the world: I made her
easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in grati-
tude to her former care and faithfulness to me, I
relieved her as my little stock would afford, which
at that time would indeed allow me to do but little
for her; but I assured her I would never forget her
former kindness to me; nor did I forget her when I
had sufficient to help her; as shall be observed in its
place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother, and all the family
extinct; except that I found two sisters, and two of
the children of one of my brothers: and as I had
been long ago given over for dead, there had been
no provision made for me; so that, in a word, I
found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that little
money I had would not do much for me as to set-
tling in the world.
I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I
did not expect; and this was, that the master of the
ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by the
same means saved the ship and cargo, having given
a very handsome account to the owners of the man-
ner how I had saved the lives of the men and the
ship, they invited me to meet them and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a
very handsome compliment upon that subject, and
a present of almost two hundred pounds sterling.
But after making several reflections upon the cir-
cumstances of my life, and how little way this would
go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to go
to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some
information of the state of my plantation in the
Brazils, and what was become of my partner, who, I
had reason to suppose, had some years now given
me over for dead.
With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where
I arrived in April following; my man Friday ac-
companying me very honestly in all these ram-
blings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all
occasions.
When I came to Lisbon I found out by inquiry,
and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the
captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea, off
the shore of Africa: he was now grown old, and
had left off the sea, having put his son, who was far
from a young man, into his ship: and who still used
the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me,
and, indeed, I hardly knew him; but I soon brought
myself to his remembrance when I told him who I
was.
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
plantation and my partner: the old man told me
he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years;
but that he could assure me, that when he came
away my partner was living; but the trustees,
whom I had joined with him to take cognisance
of my part, were both dead; that, however, he be-
lieved that I would have a very good account of
the improvement of the plantation; for, that upon
the general belief of my being cast away and
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of
the produce of my part of the plantation, to the
procurator fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case
I never came to claim it, one-third to the king, and
two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be
359
expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the
conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but
that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the
inheritance, it would be restored; only that the im-
provement, or annual production, being distributed
to charitable uses, could not be restored; but he as-
sured me that the steward of the king's revenue
(from lands), and the provedore, or steward of the
monastery, had taken great care all along, that the
incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every
year a faithful account of the produce, of which they
received duly my moiety.
I asked him if he knew to what height of im-
provement he had brought the plantation; and
whether he thought it might be worth looking
after; or whether, on my going thither, I should
meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just
right in the moiety.
He told me he could not tell exactly to what de-
gree the plantation was improved; but this he knew,
that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon
the enjoying but one-half of it; and that, to the
best of his remembrance, he had heard, that the
king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted
away to some other monastery, or religious house,
amounted to above two hundred moidores a year;
that, as to my being restored to a quiet possession
of it, there was no question to be made of that, my
partner being alive to witness my title, and my name
being also enrolled in the register of the country.
Also, he told me, that the survivors of my two trus-
tees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy,
and he believed I would not only have their assistance
for putting me in possession, but would find a very
considerable sum of money in their hands for my ac-
count, being the produce of the farm, while their fathers
held the trust, and before it was given up, as above,
which, as he remembered, was about twelve years.
I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at
this account, and inquired of the old captain, how
it came to pass, that the trustees should thus dis-
pose of my effects, when he knew that I had made
my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain,
my universal heir, &c.
He told me that was true; but that, as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as exe-
cutor until some certain account should come of my
death; and that, besides, he was not willing to inter-
meddle with a thing so remote; that it was true he
had registered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead
or alive, he would have acted by procuration, and
taken possession of the ingenio (so they called the
sugar-house), and had given his son, who was now at
the Brazils, order to do it.
"But," says the old man, "I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so ac-
ceptable to you as the rest; and that is, that believ-
ing you were lost, and all the world believing so also,
your partner and trustees did offer to account to
me, in your name, for six or eight of the first years
of profit, which I received; but there being at that
time," says he, "great disbursements for increasing
the works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it
did not amount to near so much as afterwards it pro-
duced; however," says the old man, "I shall give
you a true account of what I have received in all,
and how I have disposed of it."
After a few days further conference with this an-
cient friend, he brought me an account of the six
first years' income of my plantation, signed by my
partner and the merchants' trustees, being always
delivered in goods; viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the
consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by this
account that every year the income considerably in-
creased: but, as above, the disbursement being large,
the sum at first was small: however, the old man let
me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and
seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of
sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were
lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked coming
home to Lisbon about eleven years after my leaving
the place.
The good man then began to complain of his mis-
fortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use
of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a
share in a new ship; "However, my old friend," says
he, "you shall not want a supply in your necessity;
and as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully
satisfied."
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me
two hundred Portugal moidores in gold; and giving
me the writings of his title to the ship which his son
was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was a quarter
part owner, and his son another, he puts them both
in my hands for security of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kind-
ness of the poor man to be able to bear this; and
remembering what he had done for me, how he had
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used
me on all occasions, and particularly how sincere a
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weep-
ing at what he said to me; therefore first I asked him
if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much
money at that time, and if it would not straiten him?
He told me he could not say but it might straiten him
a little; but, however, it was my money, and I might
want it more than he.
Everything the good man said was full of affection,
and I could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke.
In short, I took one hundred of the moidores, and
called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for
them; then I returned him the rest, and told him,
if ever I had possession of the plantation, I would
return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards
did; and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his
son's ship, I would not take it by any means; but
that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest
enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to re-
ceive what he gave me reason to expect, I would
never have a penny more from him.
When this was past, the old man began to ask
me if he should put me in a method to make my
claim to my plantation. I told him, I thought to
go over to it myself. He said, I might do so if I
pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways
enough to secure my right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the profits to my use; and as there were
ships in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go away
to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public
register, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that
I was alive, and that I was the same person who
took up the land for the planting the said plantation
at first.
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a
363
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with a
letter of his writing to a merchant of his acquaint-
ance at the place; and then proposed my staying
with him till an account came of the return.
Never anything was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants, on whose
account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed.
First, there was the account current of the pro-
duce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal
captain, being for six years; the balance appeared
to be 1174 moidores in my favour.
Secondly, there was the account of four years
more while they kept the effects in their hands,
before the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found,
which they call civil death; and the balance of this,
the value of the plantation increasing, amounted to
29,169 crusadoes, which made 3241 moidores.
Thirdly, there was the prior of the Augustines'
account who had received the profits for above four-
teen years; but not being able to account for what
was disposed to the hospital, very honestly declared
he had 872 moidores not distributed, which he ac-
knowledged to my account. As to the king's part,
that refunded nothing.
There was also a letter of my partner's congratu-
lating me very affectionately upon my being alive;
giving me an account how the estate was improved,
and what it produced a year, with a particular of the
number of squares or acres that it contained; how
planted, how many slaves there were upon it; and,
making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told
me he had said so many Ave Marias to thank the
Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very
passionately to come over and take possession of my
own, and in the meantime to give him orders to
whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not come
myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his
friendship and that of his family; and sent me as
a present seven fine leopard skins, which he had, it
seems, received from Africa by some other ship
which he had sent thither; and who, it seems, had
made a better voyage than I. He sent me also five
chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces
of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores.
By the same fleet my merchant-trustees shipped
me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and
the rest of the whole account in gold.
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end
of Job was better than the beginning. It is impos-
sible to express the flutterings of my very heart,
when I looked over these letters, and especially
when I found all my wealth about me; for as the
Brazil ships came all in fleets, the same ships which
brought my letters brought my goods; and the
effects were safe in the Tagus before the letter
came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale and
grew sick; and had not the old man run and
fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise
of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the
spot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so
some hours, till a physician being sent for, and
something of the real cause of my illness being
365
known, he ordered me to be let blood, after which
I had relief and grew well; but I verily believe, if
it had not been eased by the vent given in that
manner to the spirits, I should have died.
I was now master, all on a sudden, of about fifty
thousand pounds sterling in money, and had an
estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of
above a thousand pounds a-year, as sure as an estate
of lands in England; and, in a word, I was in a con-
dition which I scarce knew how to understand, or
how to compose myself for the enjoyment of.
The first thing I did was to recompense my ori-
ginal benefactor, my good old captain, who had been
first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in
the beginning, and honest to me at the end. I
showed him all that was sent me; I told him, that,
next to the providence of Heaven, which disposes
all things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay
on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred-
fold. So I first returned to him the hundred moi-
dores I had received of him; then I sent for a notary,
and caused him to draw up a general release or dis-
charge for the four hundred and seventy moidores,
which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the
fullest and firmest manner possible; after which I
caused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him
to be my receiver of the annual profits of my plan-
tation, and appointing my partner to account to him,
and make the returns by the usual fleets to him in
my name; and a clause in the end, being a grant of
one hundred moidores a-year to him during his life,
out of the effects; and fifty moidores a-year to his
son after him, for his life. And thus I requited my
old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my
course next, and what to do with the estate that
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, indeed,
I had more care upon my head now than I had in my
silent state of life in the island, where I wanted
nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what
I wanted: whereas I had now a great charge upon
me, and my business was how to secure it: I had
never a cave to hide my money in, or a place where
it might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy
and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it.
On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom
to trust with it; my old patron, the captain, indeed,
was honest, and that was the only refuge I had.
In the next place, my interest in the Brazils
seemed to summon me thither; but now I could
not tell how to think of going thither till I had set-
tled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands
behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the
widow, who, I knew, was honest, and would be just
to me; but then she was in years, and but poor, and,
for aught I knew, might be in debt; so that, in a
word, I had no way but to go back to England
myself, and take my effects with me.
It was some months, however, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to satisfaction, who had been my
former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor
widow, whose husband had been my first benefac-
tor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful
steward and instructor; so the first thing I did, I got
a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent
in London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find
her out, and carry her in money a hundred pounds
367
from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in
her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have
a further supply. At the same time I sent my two
sisters in the country, each of them a hundred
pounds, they being, though not in want, yet not in
very good circumstances; one having been married,
and left a widow; and the other having a husband
not so kind to her as he should be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances, I
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst com-
mit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to
the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils,
and have settled myself there, for I was, as it were,
naturalised to the place; but I had some little
scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly
drew me back, of which I shall say more presently.
However, it was not religion that kept me from
going thither for the present; and as I had made
no scruple of being openly of the religion of the
country all the while I was among them, so neither
did I yet; only that now and then having of late
thought more of it than formerly, when I began to
think of living and dying among them, I began
to regret my having professed myself a papist,
and thought it might not be the best religion to
die in.
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to the Brazils, but that
really I did not know with whom to leave my effects
behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England
with them, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should
make some acquaintance, or find some relations
that would be faithful to me; and accordingly I
prepared to go for England with all my wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going home, I
first (the Brazil fleet being just going away) resolved
to give answers suitable to the just and faithful ac-
count of things I had from thence; and first to the
prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks
for his just dealings, and the offer of the eight hun-
dred and seventy-two moidores, which was undis-
posed of, which I desired might be given, five
hundred to the monastery, and three hundred and
seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct,
desiring the good Padre's prayers for me, and the
like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees,
with all the acknowledgment that so much justice
and honesty called for; as for sending them any pre-
sent, they were far above having any occasion of it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his
industry in the improving the plantation, and his
integrity in increasing the stock of the works; giving
him instructions for his future government of my
part according to the powers I had left with my old
patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever
became due to me, till he should hear from me more
particularly: assuring him that it was my intention
not only to come to him, but to settle myself there
for the remainder of my life. To this I added a very
handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife
and two daughters, for such the captain's son in-
formed me he had; with two pieces of fine English
broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five
pieces of black bays, and some Flanders lace of a
good value.
369
Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my
next difficulty was, which way to go to England.
I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet
I had a strange aversion to go to England by sea
at that time; and though I could give no reason for
it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that
though I had once shipped my baggage in order to
go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but two
or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons. But let no man
slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in
cases of such moment. Two of the ships which I
had singled out to go in, I mean more particularly
singled out than any other, that is to say, so as in
one of them to put my things on board, and in the
other to have agreed with the captain; I say, two
of these ships miscarried, viz., one was taken by the
Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start,
near Torbay, and all the people drowned except
three; so that, in either of those vessels, I had been
made miserable, and in which most, it was hard to
say.
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my
old pilot, to whom I communicated everything,
pressed me earnestly not to go to sea; but either
to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay
of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an
easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to
Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all
the way by land through France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going
by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I
VOL. L 2 A
resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I
was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was
by much the pleasanter way; and to make it more
so, my old captain brought an English gentleman,
the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to
travel with me; after which we picked up two who
were English, and merchants also, and two young
Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only:
so that we were in all six of us, and five servants,
the two merchants and the two Portuguese content-
ing themselves with one servant between two, to save
the charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor
to travel with me as a servant, besides my man Fri-
day, who was too much a stranger to be capable of
supplying the place of a servant upon the road.
In this manner I set out from Lisbon: and our
company being all very well mounted and armed,
we made a little troop, whereof they did me the
honour to call me captain, as well because I was
the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and
indeed was the original of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my sea
journals, so shall I trouble you with none of my
land journals. But some adventures that happened
to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not
omit. When we came to Madrid, we being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time
to see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth
observing; but it being the latter part of the summer,
we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about
the middle of October. But when we came to the
edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns
on the way, with an account that so much snow was
fallen on the French side of the mountains, that
several travellers were obliged to come back to
Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an extreme
hazard, to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it
so indeed; and to me, that had been always used
to a hot climate, and indeed to countries where we
could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insuf-
ferable; nor, indeed, was it more painful than it was
surprising: to come but ten days before out of Old
Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but
very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the
Pyrenean mountains, so very keen, so severely cold,
as to be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and
perishing of our fingers and toes, was very strange.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold
weather, which he had never seen or felt before in
his life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence, and so
long, that the people said, winter was come before its
time; and the roads, which were difficult before,
were now quite impassable: in a word, the snow lay
in some places too thick for us to travel; and being
not hard frozen, as is the case in northern coun-
tries, there was no going without being in danger of
being buried alive every step. We stayed no less
than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the
winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being
better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe
that had been known in many years) I proposed
that we should all go away to Fontarabia, and there
take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little
voyage.
But while we were considering this there came in
four French gentlemen, who having been stopped on
the French side of the passes, as we were on the
Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing the
country near the head of Languedoc, had brought
them over the mountains by such ways, that they
were not much incommoded with the snow; and
where they met with snow in any quantity, they
said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and
their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard
from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently
to protect us from wild beasts: for he said, upon
these great snows it was frequent for some wolves
to show themselves at the foot of the mountains,
being made ravenous for want of food, the ground
being covered with snow. We told him we were
well enough prepared for such creatures as they
were, if he would insure us from a kind of two-
legged wolves, which we were told we were in most
danger from, especially on the French side of the
mountains.
He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in
the way that we were to go: so we readily agreed to
follow him; as did also twelve other gentlemen, with
their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as
I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with
our guide, on the fifteenth of November; and indeed I
was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with us, on the same road that
we came from Madrid, above twenty miles; when
373
having passed two rivers, and come into the plain
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be
seen; but on a sudden, turning to the left, he ap-
proached the mountains another way; and though
it is true the hills and the precipices looked dread-
fully, yet he made so many tours, such meanders,
and led us by such winding ways, we insensibly
passed the height of the mountains, without being
much encumbered with the snow; and all on a sud-
den he showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of
Languedoc and Gascoigne, all green and flourishing;
though indeed they were at a great distance, and we
had some rough way to pass yet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
it snowed one whole day and a night, so fast, that
we could not travel; but he bid us be easy, we should
soon be past it all; we found, indeed, that we began
to descend every day, and to come more north than
before; and so, depending upon our guide, we went
on.
It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being something before us, and not just in
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after
them a bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to a
thick wood. Two of the wolves flew upon the guide,
and had he been half a mile before us, he had been
devoured indeed, before we could have helped him:
one of them fastened upon his horse, and the other
attacked the man with that violence, that he had not
time, or not presence of mind enough, to draw his
pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily.
My man Friday being next to me, I bid him ride up,
and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday
came in sight of the man, he hallooed as loud as the
other, "O master! 0 master!" But, like a bold
fellow, rode directly up to the man, and with his
pistol shot the wolf that attacked him, in the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my
man Friday; for he, having been used to that kind
of creature in his country, had no fear upon him, but
went close up to him, and shot him as above; where-
as any of us would have fired at a further distance,
and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endan-
gered shooting the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than I, and indeed it alarmed all our company, when,
with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on both
sides the dismallest howlings of wolves, and the noise
redoubled by the echo of the mountains, that it was
to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of
them; and perhaps indeed there was not such a few,
as that we had no cause of apprehensions.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other
that had fastened upon the horse left him imme-
diately, and fled, having happily fastened upon his
head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his
teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt: the
man, indeed, was most hurt; for the raging creature
had bit him twice, once on the arm, and the other
time a little above his knee; and he was just as it
were tumbling down by the disorder of the horse,
when Friday came up and shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as
the way (which was very difficult) would give us
leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we
375
saw plainly what had been the case, and how Friday
had disengaged the poor guide; though we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was he had
killed.
CHAPTER XX.
STRANGE BATTLE BETWIXT FRIDAY AND A BEAR—TERRIBLE ENGAGEMENT WITH A WHOLE ARMY OF
WOLVESARRIVE IN ENGLAND SAFELY, AND SETTLE MY AFFAIRS THERE—/ MARRY, AND HAVE A FAMILY.
BUT never was a fight managed so hardily, and in
such a surprising manner, as that which followed
between Friday and the bear, which gave us all
(though at first we were surprised and afraid for
him) the greatest diversion imaginable. As the
bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gal-
lop as the wolf does, which is swift and light; so he
has two particular qualities, which generally are the
rule of his actions: first, as to men, who are not his
proper prey; I say not his proper prey, because
though I can't say what excessive hunger might do,
which was now their case, the ground being all
covered with snow; yet as to men, he does not
usually attempt them, unless they first attack him;
on the contrary, if you meet him in the woods, if you
don't meddle with him, he won't meddle with you:
yet then you must take care to be very civil to him,
and give him the road; for he is a very nice gentle-
man, he won't go a step out of the way for a prince;
nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look
another way, and keep going on; for sometimes, if
you stop and stand still, and look steadfastly at him,
he takes it for an affront; and if you throw or toss
anything at him, and it hits him, though it were but
a bit of stick as big as your finger, he takes it for an
affront; and sets all other business aside to pursue
his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in point of
honour, and this is his first quality; the next is,
that if he be once affronted, he will never leave you,
night or day, till he has his revenge, but follow at a
good round rate till he overtakes you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his horse; for the man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the last more than the first;
when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of
the wood, and a very monstrous one it was, the
biggest by far that ever I saw: we were all a little
surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fel-
low's countenance. "O! O! O!" says Friday three
times, pointing to him, "O master! you give me te
leave, me shakee te hand with him, me makee you
good laugh."
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased: "You
fool you," said I, "he will eat you up."—" Eatee me
up! eatee me up!" says Friday twice over again;
"me eatee him up; me make you good laugh; you
all stay here, me show you good laugh." So down
he sits and gets his boots off in a moment, and put
on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they
wear), and which he had in his pocket, and gives my
other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to
377
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near,
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him:
"Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, "me speekee wit
you." We followed at a distance; for now being
come down to the Gascoigne side of the mountains,
we were entered a vast great forest, where the coun-
try was plain and pretty open, though many trees
in it scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear,
come up with him quickly, and takes up a great
stone and throws at him, and hit him just on the
head; but did him no more harm than if he had
thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday's
end; for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did
it purely to make the bear follow him, and show us
some laugh, as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the stone and saw him, he
turns about and comes after him, taking devilish long
strides, and shuffling along at a strange rate, so as he
would put a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs
Friday, and takes his course, as if he ran towards us
for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the
bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at
him heartily for bringing the bear back upon us,
when he was going about his own business another
way; and especially I was angry that he had turned
the bear upon us, and then run away; and I called
out, "You dog," said I, "is this your making us
laugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we
may shoot the creature." He hears me and cries out,
"No shoot, no shoot, stand still, you get much laugh;"
and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's
one, he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and
seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he beck-
oned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he gets
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground at about five or six yards from the bottom of
the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at
a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at the
gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles
into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous
heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of
my man, and could not for my life see anything to
laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we
all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small of a large limb of the tree, and the
bear got about half-way to him. As soon as the bear
got out to that part where the limb of the tree was
weaker, "Ha," says he to us, "now you see me
teachee the bear dance;" so he falls a-jumping, and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter,
but stood still, and began to look behind him, to see
how he should get back; then indeed we did laugh
heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a
great deal: when he sees him stand still, he calls out
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could
speak English, "What, you come no further? Pray
you come further." So he left jumping and shaking
the bough: and the bear, just as if he understood
what he said, did come a little further; then he fell
a-jumping again, and the bear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on
the head, and called to Friday to stand still, and we
would shoot the bear; but he cried out earnestly,
"O pray! O pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then;"
he would have said by and by. However to shorten
379
the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood
so ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but
still could not imagine what the fellow would do; for
first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear
off; and we found the bear was too cunning for
that too; for he would not get out far enough to be
thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad
claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what
would be the end of it, and where the jest would be
at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would
not be persuaded to come any further, "Well, well,"
said Friday, "you no come further, me go, me go;
you no come to me, me come to you ;" and upon this
he goes out to the smallest end of the bough, where
it would bend with his weight, and gently lets himself
down by it sliding down the bough, till he came near
enough to jump down on his feet; and away he ran
to his gun, takes it up, and stands still.
"Well," said I to him, "Friday, what will you do
now? Why don't you shoot him?"—"No shoot,"
says Friday, "no yet; me shoot now me no kill;
me stay, give you one more laugh;" and indeed so
he did, as you will see presently: for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough
where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every step, and coming backward till
he got into the body of the tree; then with the
same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree,
grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at
a time very leisurely. At this juncture, and just
before he could set his hind feet upon the ground,
Friday stepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece into his ear, and shot him as dead as a
stone.
Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our
looks, he falls a-laughing himself very loud. "So
we kill bear in my country," says Friday. "So you
kill them?" said I; "why, you have no guns."—
"No," says he, "no guns, but shoot great much
long arrow."
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us; but
we were still in a wild place and our guide very
much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the
howling of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed
except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa,
of which I have said something already, I never
heard anything that filled me with so much horror.
These things, and the approach of night, called
us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon-
strous creature off, which was worth saving; but we
had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us;
so we left him, and went forward on our journey.
The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains;
and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards,
were come down into the forest and plain country,
pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done
a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they
surprised the country-people, killed a great many of
their sheep and horses, and some people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which
our guide told us, if there were any more wolves in
the country, we should find them there; and this
was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every
38l
side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which we
were to pass to get through the wood, and then we
should come to the village where we were to lodge.
It was within half an hour of sunset when we en-
tered the first wood; and a little after sunset, when
we came into the plain. We met with nothing in
the first wood, except that in a little plain within
the wood, which was not above two furlongs over,
we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed
one after another, as if they had been in chase of
some prey, and had it in view: they took no notice
of us, and were gone and out of sight in a few
moments.
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a
ready posture, for he believed there were more
wolves a-coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and entered
the plain: as soon as we came into the plain, we
had occasion enough to look about us. The first
object we met with was a dead horse, that is to say,
a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at
least a dozen of them at work; we could not say
eating of him, but picking of his bones rather; for
they had eaten up all the flesh before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast,
neither did they take much notice of us; Friday
would have let fly at them, but I would not suffer
him by any means; for I found we were like to have
more business upon our hands than we were aware of.
We were not half gone over the plain, but we began
to hear the wolves howl in the woods on our left in
a frightful manner; and presently after we saw about
a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a
body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an
army drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce
knew in what manner to receive them; but found to
draw ourselves in a close line was the only way; so
we formed in a moment; but, that we might not have
too much interval, I ordered that only every other
man should fire; and that the others, who had not
fired, should stand ready to give them a second vol-
ley immediately, if they continued to advance upon
us; and that then those who had fired at first, should
not pretend to load their fusils again, but stand
ready, with every one a pistol, for we were all armed
with a fusil and a pair of pistols each man; so we
were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half of
us at a time; however, at present we had no neces-
sity; for upon firing the first volley, the enemy made
a full stop, being terrified, as well with the noise as
with the fire; four of them being shot in the head,
dropped; several others were wounded, and went
bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I found
they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; where-
upon, remembering that I had been told, that the
fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man,
I caused all our company to halloo as loud as we
could, and I found the notion not altogether mis-
taken: for upon our shout, they began to retire, and
turn about; then I ordered a second volley to be
fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop, and
away they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again,
and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but
we had but little more than loaded our fusils, and
383
put ourselves into a readiness, when we heard a ter-
rible noise in the same wood on our left; only that
it was further onward the same way we were to go.
The night was coming on, and the night began to
be dusky, which made it the worse on our side; but,
the noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it
was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures;
and on a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of
wolves on our left, one behind us, and one on our
front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them;
however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our
way forward as fast as we could make our horses go,
which, the way being very rough, was only a good
large trot; and in this manner we only came in view
of the entrance of the wood through which we were
to pass, at the further side of the plain; but we were
greatly surprised when, coming near the lane, or
pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing
just at the entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we
heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that way, out
rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him,
flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves
after him full speed: indeed the horse had the heels
of them; but as we supposed that he could not
hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would
get up with him at last; and no question but they
did.
Here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up
to the entrance where the horse came out, we found
the carcass of another horse, and of two men de-
voured by these ravenous creatures, and of one the
man was no doubt the same whom we heard fire a
gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as
to the man, his head and the upper part of his body
were eaten up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew not what
course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon,
for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of
prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred
of them. It happened very much to our advantage,
that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way
from it, there lay some large timber trees, which had
been cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay
there for carriage; I drew my little troop in among
these trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind
one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and,
keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to
stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our
horses in the centre.
We did so, and it was well we did; for never was
a more furious charge than the creatures made upon
us in this place; they came on us with a growling
kind of a noise, and mounted the piece of timber
(which, as I said, was our breastwork), as if they
were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of
theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their
seeing our horses behind us, which was the prey
they aimed at. I ordered our men to fire as before,
every man; and they took their aim so sure, that
indeed they killed several of the wolves at the first
volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual
firing, for they came on like devils, those behind
pushing on those before.
When we had fired our second volley of fusils, we
thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would
have gone off; but it was but a moment, for others
came forward again; so we fired our volleys of
pistols; and I believe in these four firings we killed
seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as
many; yet they came on again.
I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily; so
I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was
better employed; for, with the greatest dexterity
imaginable, he charged my fusil and his own while
we were engaged; but, as I said, I called my other
man; and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him
lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it
be a large train; he did so, and had but time to get
away when the wolves came up to it, and some were
got up upon it; when I, snapping an uncharged
pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; and those
that were upon the timber were scorched with it, and
six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped in among
us, with the force and fright of the fire: we despatched
these in an instant, and the rest were so frighted
with the light, which the night, for now it was very
near dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a
little.
Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired
off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout:
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied im-
mediately upon near twenty lame ones, which'we
found struggling on the ground, and fell a-cutting
them with our swords, which answered our expecta-
tion; for the crying and howling they made were
better understood by their fellows; so that they fled
and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore of
them; and had it been daylight we had killed
many more. The field of battle being thus cleared,
we made forward again; for we had still near a
VOL. I. 2 B
league to go. We heard the ravenous creatures
howl and yell in the woods, as we went, several
times; and sometimes we fancied we saw some of
them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not
certain; so in about an hour more we came to the
town, where we were to lodge, which we found in a
terrible fright, and all in arms; for it seems that,
the night before, the wolves and some bears had
broken into that village and put them in a terrible
fright; and they were obliged to keep guard night
and day, but especially in the night, to preserve
their cattle, and indeed their people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two wounds,
that he could go no farther; so we were obliged to
take a new guide there, and go to Toulouse, where
we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country,
and no snow, no wolves, or anything like them; but
when we told our story at Toulouse, they told us it
was nothing but what was ordinary in the great
forest at the foot of the mountains, especially when
the snow lay on the ground; but they inquired
much what kind of a guide we had gotten, that would
venture to bring us that way in such a severe season;
and told us, it was much to be wondered we were not
all devoured. When we told them how we placed
ourselves, and the horses in the middle, they blamed
us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we
had been all destroyed ; for it was the sight of the horses
that made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey;
and that at other times they are really afraid of a
gun; but they being excessive hungry, and raging
on that account, the eagerness to come at the horses
had made them senseless of danger; and that if we
387
had not by the continued fire, and at last by the
stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it
had been great odds but that we had been torn to
pieces; whereas, had we been content to have sat
still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would
not have taken the horses so much for their own,
when men were on their backs, as otherwise; and
withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood all
together, and left our horses, they would have been
so eager to have devoured them, that we might have
come off safe, especially having our firearms in our
hands, and being so many in number.
For my part I was never so sensible of danger in
my life; for seeing above three hundred devils come
roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having
nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself
over for lost; and as it was, I believe I shall never
care to cross those mountains again; I think I would
much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I
were sure to meet with a storm once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in
my passage through France; nothing but what other
travellers have given an account of with much more
advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse to
Paris, and without any considerable stay came to
Calais, and landed safe at Dover the fourteenth of
January, after having had a severe cold season to
travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and
had in a little time all my new-discovered estate safe
about me; the bills of exchange, which I brought
with me, having been very currently paid.
My principal guide and privy counsellor was my
good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money
I had sent her, thought no pains too much or care
too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so
entirely with everything, that I was perfectly easy as
to the security of my effects; and indeed I was very
happy from my beginning, and now to the end, in
the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my effects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so
to the Brazils. But now another scruple came in
the way, and that was religion; for as I had enter-
tained some doubts about the Roman religion, even
while I was abroad, especially in my state of solitude,
so I knew there was no going to the Brazils for me,
much less going to settle there, unless I resolved to
embrace the Roman Catholic religion, without any
reserve; except, on the other hand, I resolved to be
a sacrifice to my principles, be a martyr for religion,
and die in the Inquisition: so I resolved to stay at
home, and, if I could find means for it, to dispose of
my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,
who in return gave me notice, that he could easily
dispose of it there; but that if I thought fit to give
him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants,
the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils,
who must fully understand the value of it, who lived
just upon the spot, and who I knew to be very rich,
so that he believed they would be fond of buying
it; he did not doubt, but I should make four or five
thousand pieces of eight the more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it
to them, and he did so; and in about eight months
more, the ship being then returned, he sent me an
account that they had accepted the offer, and had
389
remitted 33,000 pieces of eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to
my old man, who sent me the bills of exchange for
32,880 pieces of eight for the estate; reserving the
payment of a hundred moidores a-year to him (the
old man) during his life, and fifty moidores after-
wards to his son for his life, which I had promised
them; and which the plantation was to make good
as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first
part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of Provi-
dence's chequer-work, and of a variety which the world
will seldom be able to show the like of: beginning
foolishly, but closing much more happily than any
part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this state of com-
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards, and so indeed I had been, if other circum-
stances had concurred: but I was inured to a
wandering life, had no family, nor many relations;
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaint-
ance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils,
yet I could not keep that country out of my head,
and had a great mind to be upon the wing again;
especially I could not resist the strong inclination I
had to see my island, and to know if the poor
Spaniards were in being there; and how the rogues
I left there had used them.
My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded me
from it, and so far prevailed with me, that almost
for seven years she prevented my running abroad;
during which time I took my two nephews, the
children of one of my brothers, into my care: the
eldest having something of his own, I bred up as a
gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some ad-
dition to his estate, after my decease; the other I
put out to a captain of a ship: and after five years,
finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young
fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to
sea: and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as
old as I was, to further adventures myself.
In the meantime I in part settled myself here:
for, first of all, I married, and that not either to my
disadvantage or dissatisfaction; and had three chil-
dren, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying,
and my nephew coming home with good success from
a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and
his importunity, prevailed and engaged me to go in
his ship as a private trader to the East-Indies: this
was in the year 1694.
In this voyage I visited my new colony in the
island, saw my successors the Spaniards, had the
whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left
there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards;
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, sepa-
rated; how at last the Spaniards were obliged to use
violence with them, how they were subjected to the
Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them;—
a history, if it were entered into, as full of variety
and wonderful accidents, as my own part, particu-
larly also as to their battles with the Caribbeans,
who landed several times upon the island, and as to
the improvement they made upon the island itself,
and how five of them made an attempt upon the
mainland, and brought away eleven men and five
women prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found
about twenty young children on the island.
39'
Here I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies
of all necessary things, and particularly of arms,
powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which
I brought from England with me, viz., a carpenter
and a smith.
Besides this, I shared the island into parts with
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole,
but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed
on; and having settled all things with them, and
engaged them not to leave the place, I left them
there.
From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence
I sent a bark, which I bought there, with more people
to the island, and in it, beside other supplies, I sent
seven women, being such as I found proper for
service, or for wives to such as would take them; as
to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them
some women from England with a good cargo of
necessaries, if they would apply themselves to plant-
ing; which I afterwards performed. And the fellows
proved very honest and diligent after they were
mastered, and had their properties set apart for them.
I sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three of
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some
hogs, which, when I came again, were considerably
increased.
But all these things, with an account how three
hundred Caribbees came and invaded them, and
ruined their plantations, and how they fought with
that whole number twice, and were at first defeated,
and three of them killed; but at last a storm destroy-
ing their enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed
almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the
possession of their plantation, and still lived upon
the island.
All these things, with some very surprising in-
cidents in some new adventures of my own, for ten
years more, I may, perhaps, give a further account
of hereafter.

DANIEL DE FOE.
PERHAPS there exists no work, either of instruction
or entertainment, in the English language, which
has been more generally read and more universally
admired than the " Life and Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe." It is difficult to say in what the charm
consists by which persons of all classes and deno-
minations are thus fascinated; yet the majority of
readers will recollect it as amongst the first works
which awakened and interested their youthful atten-
tion; and feel, even in advanced life, and in the
maturity of their understanding, that there are still
associated with Robinson Crusoe the sentiments
peculiar to that period, when all is new, all glitter-
ing in prospect, and when those visions are most
bright, which the experience of after-life tends only
to darken and destroy.
This work was first published in April 1719; its
reception, as may be supposed, was universal. It
is a singular circumstance that the Author (the
subject of our present Memoir), after a life spent in
political turmoil, danger, and imprisonment, should
have occupied himself, in its decline, in the produc-
tion of a work like the present; unless it may be
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
supposed that his wearied heart turned with disgust
from society and its institutions, and found solace in
picturing the happiness of a state such as he has
assigned to his hero. Be this as it may, society is
for ever indebted to the memory of De Foe for his
production of a work, in which the ways of Provi-
dence are simply and pleasingly vindicated, and a
lasting and useful moral is conveyed through the
. ,channel of an interesting and delightful story.
DANIEL DE FOE was born in London in the year
^6>/ * 1663- His father was James Foe, of the parish of
St. Giles', butcher. Much curious speculation, with
which we shall not trouble our readers, has arisen
from the circumstance of Daniel's having, in his
own instance, prefixed the De to the family name.
We are inclined to adopt the opinion of that critical
inquirer, who supposes that Daniel did so, being
ashamed of the lowness of his origin. His family,
as well as himself, were Dissenters; but it does not
appear that his tenets were so strict as his sect re-
quired; for he complains, in the Preface to his More
Reformation, "that some Dissenters had reproached
him as if he had said, that the gallows and the gal-
leys ought to be the penalty of going to the conven-
ticle; forgetting that I must design to have my father,
my wife, six innocent children, and myself, put into
the same condition."
De Foe's education was rather circumscribed, which
is the more to be lamented, as, in so many instances,
he has exhibited proofs of rare natural genius. He
was sent by his father, at twelve years old, to the
Newington Green Dissenting Academy, then kept by
Mr. Morton, where he remained about four years;
and this appears to have been all the education he
ever received. When he was remanded from school,
it would seem that his genius not lying towards the
marrow-bone and cleaver, his father had put him to
some other trade; of what nature we are unable to
learn, De Foe himself being very reserved on the sub-
ject. When charged by Tutchin * with having his
breeding as an apprentice to a hosier, he asserts (May
1705), "that he never was a hosier,f or an apprentice,
but admits that he had been a trader."
This, however, had occupied but a short period of
his youth; for in 1685, when he was in his twenty-
second year, he took up arms in the cause of the
Duke of Monmouth. On the destruction of Mon-
mouth's party Daniel had the good fortune to escape
unpunished amidst the herd of greater delinquents;
but, in his latter years, when the avowal was no
longer dangerous, he boasts himself much of his
exploits, in His Appeal to Honour and Justice, being
a true Account of his Conduct in Public Affairs.
Two years afterwards (1688) De Foe was admitted
a liveryman of London. As he had been through-
out a steady advocate for the Revolution, he had
now the satisfaction of witnessing that great event.
Oldmixon says (Works, vol. ii. p. 276), that at a
feast, given by the Lord Mayor of London to King
William on the 29th October 1689, De Foe appeared
gallantly mounted and richly accoutred amongst
the troopers commanded by Lord Peterborough,
* Tutchin, the publisher of the Observator, and a steady opponent
of De Foe's both in politics and literature.
t Perhaps the salvo he laid to his conscience for this apparently
false assertion was, that though he dealt in hose, he did not make
them.
who attended the king and queen from Whitehall
to the Mansion House. All Daniel's horsemanship,
however, united to the steady devotion of his pen to
the cause of William, were unable to procure him
the notice of that cold-charactered monarch; and
our author was fain to content himself (as his adver-
sary Tutchin asserts) with the humble occupation
of a hosier in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill;—wisely
considering that if the court could do without
political tracts, the people could not do without
stockings.
With the ill fortune, however, attendant upon those
men of genius, who cultivate their superior powers to
the neglect of that common sense which is requisite
to carry a man creditably through this everyday
world, De Foe's affairs declined from bad to worse;
he spent those hours, which he ought to have de-
voted to his shop, in a society for the cultivation of
polite learning, and he was under the necessity of
absconding from his creditors in 1692. One of those
creditors, who had less consideration for polite learn-
ing, and more irritability than the rest, took out a
commission of bankruptcy against him; but, fortu-
nately for our author, this was superseded on the
petition of those to whom he was most indebted, and
a composition was accepted. This composition he
punctually paid by efforts of unwearied diligence;
and some of the creditors, whose claims had been
thus satisfied, falling into distress themselves, he
waited upon them and paid their debts in full. He
was next engaged in carrying on tile-works on the
banks of the Thames, near Tilbury; but with little
success; for it was sarcastically said of him, that he
XV
did not, "like the Egyptians, require bricks without
straw, but, like the Jews, required bricks without
paying his labourers." United to his tile-making,
our author, stimulated by an active mind and em-
barrassed circumstances, devised many other schemes,
or, as he called them, projects. He wrote many
sheets about the English coin; he projected banks
for every county, and factories for goods; he ex-
hibited a proposal (very feelingly no doubt) for a
commission of inquiry into bankrupts' estates; he
contrived a pension-office for the relief of the poor,
and finished by publishing a long essay upon pro-
jects themselves.
About this period (1695), our author's indefa-
tigable endeavours procured him some notice from
the Court, and he was appointed accountant to the
commissioners for managing the duties on glass.
Here also his usual ill luck attended him; he was
thrown out of his situation by the suppression of the
tax in 1699.
But the time at length arrived when the sun of
royal favour was to shine out upon our author's pro-
spects. About the end of 1699 there was published
what De Foe calls, "a horrid pamphlet, in very ill
verse, written by one Tutchin, and called The Fo-
reigners: in which the author fell personally upon
the king, then upon the Dutch nation, and after
having reproached His Majesty with crimes that his
worst enemies could not think of without horror,
he sums up all in the odious name of Foreigner.
This filled me with rage against the book, and gave
birth to a trifle, which I never could hope should
have met with so general an acceptation."
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
The trifle which De Foe here alludes to, was his
True Born Englishman; a poetical satire on the
Foreigners, and a defence of King William and the
Dutch; of which the sale was great without example,
and our author's reward proportionate. He was even
admitted to the honour of a personal interview with
the king, and became with more ardour than ever
a professed partizan of the Court.
His first publication afterwards was, The Origi-
nal Power of the Collective Body of the People of
England Examined and Asserted; next, An Argu-
ment to prove that a Standing Army, with Consent
of Parliament, was not Inconsistent with a free Go-
vernment; but as we do not mean to follow De Foe
through the career of his politics, and intend only
to notice such as, in their consequences, materially
affected his personal situation and affairs, we shall
pass to the death of his sovereign and patron, which
took place 8th March 1702.*
The accession of Anne having restored the line of
Stuart, to whom the politics and conduct of De Foe
had been peculiarly obnoxious, our author was shortly
reduced, as before, to live on the produce of his wits;
and it is perhaps lucky for the world that there is so
much truth in the universal outcry against the neglect
of living authors; for there seems a certain laziness
concomitant with genius, which can only be incited
to action by the pressure of necessity. Had William

the fifty-second year of his age.
xvii
lived, probably the world would never have been delighted with the Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.
Whether De Foe found politics the most vendible produce of the press, or, like Macbeth, felt himself
Stept in so far, that should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er,—
we are yet to learn; but he ventured to reprint
his Shortest Way with the Dissenters; and to pub-
lish several other treatises, which were considered
libellous by the Commons: and on the 25th of
February 1702-3, a complaint being made in the
House of a book entitled, The Shortest Way with
the Dissenters; and the folios 11-18 and 26 being
read, "Resolved, that this book, being full of false
and scandalous reflections on this Parliament, and
tending to promote sedition, be burnt by the hands
of the common hangman, in New Palace Yard."
Our unfortunate author's political sins were now
all mustered in array against him, and a tremendous
catalogue they made. He had been the favourite
and panegyrist of William; he had fought for Mon-
mouth, and opposed James; he had vindicated the
Revolution, and defended the rights of the people;
he had bantered, insulted, and offended the whole
Tory leaders of the Commons; and, after all, he
could not be quiet, but must republish his most
offensive productions.
Thus overpowered, De Foe was obliged to secrete
himself; and we are indebted to a very disagreeable
circumstance for the following accurate description
of his person. A proclamation was issued by the
Secretaries of State, in January 1703, in the following
terms:— VOL. I. c
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
"St. James's, Jan. 10, 1702-3.
"Whereas Daniel De Foe, alias De Fooe, is charged with
writing a scandalous and seditious pamphlet, entitled, 'The
Shortest Way with the Dissenters:' he is a middle-sized,
spare man, about forty years old, of a brown complexion,
and dark-brown coloured hair, but wears a wig; a hooked
nose, a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole near his
mouth; was born in London, and for many years was a
hose-factor in Freeman's Yard in Cornhill, and now is
owner of the brick and pantile works near Tilbury Fort, in
Essex: whoever shall discover the said Daniel De Foe to
one of her Majesty's principal secretaries of state, or any of
her Majesty's justices of peace, so as he may be apprehended,
shall have a reward of ^50, which her Majesty has ordered
immediately to be paid upon such discovery."
He was shortly after caught, fined, pilloried, and
imprisoned. "Thus," says he, "was I a second
time ruined; for by this affair I lost above ^3500 sterling."
While he was confined in Newgate, he occupied
his time in correcting for the press a collection of
his own writings, which was published in the course
of the year; and he even amused himself by writ-
ing an Ode to the Pillory; of which he had so
lately been made the unwilling acquaintance. But
the chief object to which he directed his mind, was
the projection of The Review. The publication of
this periodical work commenced in 410, on the 19th
February 1704, and continued at the rate of two
numbers a week, till March 1705, when an additional
weekly number was published, and it was continued
every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, till May
1713, forming in the whole nine thick volumes. De
Foe was the sole writer. This work treats of foreign
and domestic intelligence, politics, and trade; but as
xix
our author foresaw that it was not likely to become
popular unless amusing, he discusses various other
topics, under the head of a Scandal Club; Love,
Marriage, Poetry, Language, and the prevailing
tastes and habits of the times. Neither did these
occupations find sufficient employment for his active
mind. While he was still in Newgate (1704), he
published The Storm; or a collection of the most
remarkable casualties which happened in the tem-
pest, 26th November 1703. Nor was this work a
dry detail of disasters only, De Foe having taken
the occasion, with his usual felicity, to inculcate
the truths of religion, and the superintendency of
Providence.*
About the end of 1704, when, as our author tells
us, he lay ruined and friendless in Newgate, without
* The following account of this tremendous visitation is extracted
from the records of the period :—
"November 26.—About midnight began the most terrible storm
that had been known in England, the wind W.S.W. attended with
flashes of lightning. It uncovered the roofs of many houses and
churches, blew down the spires of several steeples and chimneys, tore
whole groves of trees up by the roots. The leads of some churches
were rolled up like scrolls of parchment, and several vessels, boats and
barges, were sunk in the river Thames; but the royal navy sustained
the greatest damage, being just returned from the Straits: four third-
rates, one second-rate, four fourth-rates, and many others of less force
were cast away upon the coast of England, and above fifteen hundred
seamen lost, besides those that were cast away in merchant ships. The
loss that London alone sustained was computed at one million sterling,
and the city of Bristol lost to the amount of two hundred thousand
pounds. Among the persons who were drowned was Rear-Admiral
Beaumont.
"Upon this calamity the Commons addressed her Majesty, that she
would give directions for rebuilding and repairing the royal navy; and
that she would make some provision for the families of those seamen
that perished in the storm; with which her Majesty complied."
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
hopes of deliverance, Sir Robert Harley, then Se-
cretary of State, of whom De Foe had no previous
personal knowledge, sent a verbal message to him,
desiring to know "what he could do for him." Our
author, no doubt, made a suitable reply; in conse-
quence of which, Sir Robert took an opportunity to
represent to the queen his present misery and un-
merited sufferings. Anne, however, did not imme-
diately consent to his liberation, but she inquired
into the circumstances of his family, and sent, by
Lord Godolphin, a considerable sum to his wife.
She afterwards, through the same medium, conveyed
a sum to himself, equal to the payment of his fine
and discharge, and thus bound him eternally to her
interest. He was liberated from Newgate the end
of 1704, and retired immediately to his family at
St. Edmund's-Bury. He was not allowed, however,
to enjoy the quiet he courted. Booksellers, news-
writers, and wits, circulated everywhere reports that
he had fled from justice, and deserted his security.
He despised their spite, and resumed his labours;
the first fruits of which were a Hymn to Victory, and
a Double Welcome to the Duke of Marlborough; the
subjects for both of which were furnished by the
glorious achievements of that general.
Our author now continued his Review, and his
political pamphleteering, for several years; in the
course of which he was subjected to much disquiet,
and frequently to danger; but the consciousness of
his situation as an English freeholder, and a livery-
man of London, united to a considerable degree of
resolution and personal courage, enabled him to en-
counter and overcome the machinations of his ene-
xxi
mies. It will scarcely be believed at this time of
day, that, on a journey which his affairs led him to
take to the western parts of England, a project was
formed to kidnap and send him as a soldier to the
army; that the western justices, in the ardour of
their party zeal, determined to apprehend him as a
vagabond; and that suits were commenced against
him in his absence for fictitious debts: yet all these
circumstances De Foe has asserted in his Review;
and we have not learnt that any attempt was ever
made to controvert the truth of his statements.
About this time (1706) a situation occurred, for
which our author's abilities were peculiarly fitted.
The cabinet of Queen Anne was in want of a person
of general commercial knowledge, ready talents, and
insinuating manners, to go to Scotland for the pur-
pose of promoting the great measure of the Union.
Lord Godolphin determined to employ De Foe: he
accordingly carried him to the queen, by whom our
author was graciously received, and in a few days
he was sent to Edinburgh. The particular nature
of his instructions has never been made public; but
on his arrival at Edinburgh, in October 1706, De
Foe was recognised as a character almost diplomatic.
We must refer our readers to his History of the
Union for the various and interesting particulars of
this mission; the detail of which, here, would occupy
an extent beyond the limits of our biography,
De Foe appears to have been no great favourite
in Scotland, although, while there he published Cale-
donia, a poem in honour of the nation. He mentions
many hairbreadth escapes which, by "his own pru-
dence, and God's providence," he effected; and it is
not wonderful that where almost the whole nation
was decidedly averse to the Union, a character like
De Foe, sent thither to promote it by all means,
direct or indirect, should be regarded with dislike,
and even exposed to danger. The Act for the Union
was passed by the Scotch Parliament in January, and
De Foe returned to London in February 1707. It
is believed that his services were rewarded by a
pension from Queen Anne.
During the troublous period at the conclusion of
the war by the treaty of Utrecht, De Foe, wiser by
experience, lived quietly at Newington, publishing
his Review. He encountered, however, in the ful-
filment of this task, much contentious opposition and
obloquy, which he manfully resisted and retorted:
but, after the political changes, by which his first
patron Sir Robert Harley, and next Lord Godolphin,
were turned out of power, his pecuniary allowance
from the Treasury seems to have ceased, and he
was compelled, as before, to launch out as a general
writer for the supply of his necessities. The political
agitation of the times dictated his subjects; but,
unfortunately for De Foe, both Tories and Jacobites
in those days were such plain matter-of-fact men,
that his raillery was misunderstood, and he was
arrested, and committed to his old habitation, for
several squibs, which were obviously ironical.
The writings on which he was indicted, were two;
What if the Pretender should come? and, What if
the Queen should die ?" Nothing," says De Foe,
"could be more plain than that the titles of these
are amusements, in order to get the books into the
hands of those who had been deluded by the Jaco-
xxiii
bites." His explanation would not suffice; he was
tried and found guilty, fined in £800, and committed to
Newgate. He was now compelled to drop the publi-
cation of his Review; and it is singular, that he did
so while confined in Newgate, the very place in which
its idea had first entered his head nine years before.
After lying in jail a few months, he was liberated
by the queen's order in November 1713.
Although thus released, and the innocence of his
intentions admitted, if not established, nothing was
done for him: and the queen's death, which took
place shortly after (in July 1714), left him defence-
less to the attacks of his rancorous enemies. "No
sooner," says he, "was the queen dead, and the king,
as right required, proclaimed, but the rage of men
increased upon me to that degree that their threats
were such as I am unable to express; and though I
have written nothing since the queen's death, yet a
great many things are called by my name, and I
bear the answerer's insults." This was the darkest
period of our author's life. He had lost his appoint-
ment, whatever it was; he had been obliged to give
up his Review; everything he ventured to publish,
besides, was received with suspicion, and he was on
all hands overborne by faction, injury, and insult- His health declined fast under these unmerited suf-
ferings, but the vigour of his mind remained; and he
determined to assert the innocence of his conduct
and to clear his blemished fame. He accordingly
published, in 1715, "An Appeal to Honour and Jus-
tice, though it be of his worst Enemies, being a True
Account of his Conduct in Public Affairs" This
work contains a long account and defence of his
political conduct from the outset, and a most affect-
ing detail of his sufferings; but the subject had been
too much for him. When he reviewed what he had
done, and how he had been rewarded; how much he
had deserved, and how heavily he had suffered; the
ardent spirit of De Foe sunk before the picture, and
he was struck with apoplexy before he could finish
his work. It was published nevertheless by his
friends, and the profits of its sale seem to have been
the only source of his support. This was the ter-
minating period of our author's political career. He
recovered his health, but his mind had changed its
tone; and it was now that the history of Selkirk first
suggested to him the idea of Robinson Crusoe. It
has been thought by some to detract from the merit
of De Foe, that the idea was not originally his own:
but really the story of Selkirk, which had been pub-
lished a few years before, in Woodes Rogers'* "Voyage
Round the World," appears to have furnished our
author with so little beyond the bare idea of a man
living upon an uninhabited island, that it appears
quite immaterial whether he took his hint from that,
or from any other similar story, of which many were
then current. In order to enable our readers to
judge how very little De Foe has been assisted by
Selkirk's narrative, we have extracted the whole
from Woodes Rogers' Voyage.
* Woodes Rogers, who relieved Selkirk from his solitude, was at
that time commodore of a commercial expedition round the world,
which sailed February 1709, and returned to Britain, 1711. A pro-
ject for the re-settlement of the Bahama Islands having been submitted
to Mr. Addison (then Secretary of State) in 1717, the measure was
determined on, and Rogers was appointed to head the expedition.
He died, governor of those islands, in 1732.
XXV
THE REMARKABLE HISTORY OF ALEXANDER SELKIRK.
"On February ist, 1709, we came before the island of
Juan Fernandez, having had a good observation the day
before, and found our latitude to be 34 degrees 10 minutes
south. In the afternoon we hoisted out our pinnace; and
Captain Dover, with the boat's crew, went in her to go
ashore, though we could not be less than four leagues off.
As soon as the pinnace was gone I went on board the

at that distance from land. It was against my inclination:
but, to oblige Captain Dover, I let her go. As soon as it
was dark, we saw a light ashore. Our boat was then about
a league off the island, and bore away for the ships as soon
as she saw the lights. We put our lights aboard for the
boat, though some were of opinion, the lights we saw were
our boat's lights; but as night came on, it appeared too
large for that We fired our quarter-deck gun and several
muskets, showing lights in our mizen and fore-shrouds, that
our boat might find us whilst we were in the lee of the
island: about two in the morning our boat came on board,
having been two hours on board the 'Duchess,' that took
them up astern of us; we were glad they got well off, be-
cause it began to blow. We were all convinced the light
was on the shore, and designed to make our ships ready to
engage, believing them to be French ships at anchor, and
we must either fight them, or want water. All this stir
and apprehension arose, as we afterwards found, from one
poor naked man, who passed in our imagination, at present,
for a Spanish garrison, a body of Frenchmen, or a crew of
pirates. While we were under these apprehensions, we
stood on the back side of the island, in order to fall in with
the southerly wind, till we were past the island; and then
we came back to it again, and ran close aboard the land
that begins to make the north-east side.
"We still continued to reason upon this matter; and it
is in a manner incredible, what strange notions many of
our people entertained from the sight of the fire upon the
island. It served, however, to show people's tempers and
spirits; and we were able to give a tolerable guess how
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
our men would behave, in case there really were any
enemies upon the island The flaws came heavy off the
shore, and we were forced to reef our topsails when we
opened the middle bay, where we expected to have found
our enemy; but saw all clear, and no ships, nor in the
other bay next the north-east end. These two bays are
all that ships ride in, which recruit on this island; but
the middle bay is by much the best. We guessed there
had been ships there, but that they were gone on sight of
us. We sent our yawl ashore about noon, with Captain
Dover, Mr. Fry, and six men, all armed: meanwhile we
and the 'Duchess' kept turning to get in, and such heavy
flaws came off the land, that we were forced to let go our
topsail sheet, keeping all hands to stand by our sails, for
fear of the winds carrying them away: but when the flaws
were gone, we had little or no wind. These flaws proceeded
from the land, which is very high in the middle of the
island. Our boat did not return; we sent our pinnace
with the men armed, to see what was the occasion of the
yawl's stay; for we were afraid that the Spaniards had a
garrison there, and might have seized them. We put out
a signal for our boat, and the 'Duchess' showed a French
ensign. Immediately our pinnace returned from the shore,
and brought abundance of cray-fish, with a man clothed in
goats' skins, who looked wilder than the first owners of
them. He had been on the island four years and four
months, being left thereby Captain Stradling in the 'Cinque
Ports;' his name was Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman,
who had been master of the ' Cinque Ports,' a ship that came
here last with Captain Dampier, who told me that this was
the best man in her. I immediately agreed with him to be
a mate on board our ship: it was he that made the fire last
night when he saw our ships, which he judged to be English.
During his stay here he saw several ships pass by, but only
two came to anchor. As he went to view them, he found
them to be Spaniards, and retired from them, upon which
they shot at him: had they been French he would have
submitted; but chose to risk his dying alone on the island,
rather than fall into the hands of Spaniards in these parts;
because he apprehended they would murder him, or make
xxvii
a slave of him in the mines; for he feared they would spare
no stranger that might be capable of discovering the South
Seas.
"The Spaniards had landed before he knew what they
were; and they came so near him, that he had much ado
to escape; for they not only shot at him, but pursued him
to the woods, where he climbed to the top of a tree, at the
foot of which they made water, and killed several goats just
by, but went off again without discovering him. He told
us that he was born in Scotland, and was bred a sailor from
his youth. The reason of his being left here was a differ-
ence between him and his captain; which, together with
the ship's being leaky, made him willing rather to stay here,
than go along with him at first; but when he was at last
willing to go, the captain would not receive him. He had
been at the island before, to wood and water, when two of
the ship's company were left upon it for six months, till the
ship returned, being chased thence by two French South
Sea ships. He had with him his clothes and bedding, with
a firelock, some powder, bullets, and tobacco, a hatchet, a
knife, a kettle, a Bible, some practical pieces, and his mathe-
matical instruments and books. He diverted and pro-
vided for himself as well as he could; but for the first eight
months had much ado to bear up against melancholy, and
the terror of being left alone in such a desolate place. He
built two huts with pimento trees, covered them with long
grass, and lined them with the skins of goats, which he killed
with his gun as he wanted, so long as his powder lasted,
which was but a pound; and that being almost spent, he
got fire by rubbing two sticks of pimento wood together
upon his knee. In the lesser hut, at some distance from
the other, he dressed his victuals; and in the larger he
slept, and employed himself in reading, singing psalms, and
praying: so that he said, he was a better Christian while in
his solitude than ever he was before, or than, he was afraid,
he should ever be again.
"At first he never ate anything till hunger constrained him,
partly for grief, and partly for want of bread and salt: nor
did he go to bed till he could watch no longer; the pimento
wood, which burnt very clear, served him both for fire and
BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR
candle, and refreshed him with its fragrant smell. He
might have had fish enough, but would not eat them for
want of salt, because they occasioned a looseness, except
cray-fish, which are as large as our lobsters, and very good:
these he sometimes boiled, and at other times broiled, as
he did his goat's flesh, of which he made very good broth,
for they are not so rank as ours. He kept an account
of 500 that he killed while there, and caught as many
more, which he marked on the ear and let go. When his
powder failed, he took them by speed of foot; for his way
of living, continual exercise of walking and running, cleared
him of all gross humours; so that he ran with wonderful
swiftness through the woods, and up the rocks and hills,
as we perceived when we employed him to catch goats for
us: we had a bull-dog, which we sent with several of our
nimblest runners, to help him in catching goats; but he
distanced and tired both the dog and the men, caught the
goats, and brought them to us on his back.
"He told us that his agility in pursuing a goat had once
like to have cost him his life; he pursued it with so much
eagerness, that he catched hold of it on the brink of a
precipice, of which he was not aware, the bushes hiding
it from him; so that he fell with the goat down the pre-
cipice, a great height, and was so stunned and bruised with
the fall, that he narrowly escaped with his life; and when
he came to his senses, found the goat dead under him; he
lay there about twenty-four hours, and was scarce able to
crawl to his hut, which was about a mile distant, or to stir
abroad again in ten days.
"He came at last to relish his meat well enough without
salt or bread; and in the season had plenty of good tur-
nips, which had been sown there by Captain Dampier's
men, and have now overspread some acres of ground. He
had enough of good cabbage from the cabbage-trees, and
seasoned his meat with the fruit of the pimento-trees, which
is the same as Jamaica pepper, and smells deliciously. He
found also a black pepper, called Malageta, which was very
good to expel wind, and against griping in the guts.
"He soon wore out all his shoes and clothes by running
in the woods; and, at last, being forced to shift without
xxix
them, his feet became so hard, that he ran everywhere
without difficulty; and it was some time before he could
wear shoes after we found him; for, not being used to any
so long, his feet swelled when he came first to wear them
again.
"After he had conquered his melancholy, he diverted
himself sometimes with cutting his name on the trees, and
the time of his being left, and continuance there. He was
at first much pestered with cats and rats, that bred in great
numbers, from some of each species which had got ashore
from ships that put in there to wood and water. The rats
gnawed his feet and clothes whilst asleep, which obliged
him to cherish the cats with his goats' flesh, by which many
of them became so tame, that they would lie about him in
hundreds, and soon delivered him from the rats. He like-
wise tamed some kids; and, to divert himself, would, now
and then, sing and dance with them, and his cats: so that,
by the favour of Providence, and vigour of his youth, being
now but thirty years old, he came, at last, to conquer all
the inconveniences of his solitude, and to be very easy.
"When his clothes were worn out, he made himself a
coat and a cap of goat skins, which he stitched together with
little thongs of the same, that he cut with his knife. He
had no other needle but a nail; and when his knife was
worn to the back, he made others, as well as he could, of
some iron hoops that were left ashore, which he beat thin,
and ground upon stones. Having some linen-cloth by
him, he sewed him some shirts with a nail, and stitched
them with the worsted of his old stockings, which he pulled
out on purpose. He had his last shirt on when we found
him in the island
"At his first coming on board us, he had so much forgot
his language, for want of use, that we could scarce under-
stand him; for he seemed to speak his words by halves.
We offered him a dram; but he would not touch it, having
drank nothing but water since his being there; and it was
some time before he could relish our victuals. He could
give us an account of no other product of the island than
what we have mentioned, except some black plums, which
are very good, but hard to come at; the trees which bear
them growing on high mountains and rocks. Pimento
trees are plenty here; and we saw some sixty feet high,
and about two yards thick; and cotton trees higher, and
near four fathoms round in the stock. The climate is so
good that the trees and grass are verdant all the year
round. The winter lasts no longer than June and July,
and is not then severe, there being only a small frost and
a little hail; but sometimes great rains. The heat of the
summer is equally moderate; and there is not much thunder,
or tempestuous weather of any sort He saw no venomous
or savage creature on the island; nor any sort of beasts but
goats, the first of which had been put ashore here, on
purpose for a breed, by Juan Fernandez, a Spaniard, who
settled there with some families, till this continent of Chili
began to submit to the Spaniards; which, being more
profitable, tempted them to quit the island, capable, how-
ever, of maintaining a good number of people, and being
made so strong that they could not be easily dislodged from
thence."
We are indebted for the following additional par-
ticulars, respecting the life and fate of this singular
character, to the research of A. Gibson Hunter, Esq.
of Balskelly, in Scotland; who, we believe, is yet in
possession of his will, and some other curious relics.
Through this gentleman we learn that Selkirk was
born at Largo in Fife, in the year 1676, where he
possessed some trifling landed property. He went
mate with Captain Stradling, in the " Cinque Ports,"
on a trading voyage round the world in 1704. In the
course of which, a difference arising betwixt him and
his captain, the causes of which must now remain for
ever unexplained, Selkirk, with all the hardihood of
the seaman's character, desired to be landed on the
island of Fernandez. Here he remained in perfect
solitude, existing as he has described himself, until
discovered by Captain Rogers. Selkirk died on
board a king's ship, the " Weymouth," of which he was
mate, in 1723; leaving his effects, by will, to sundry
"loving female friends," with whom he had contracted
intimacies in the course of his peregrinations. His
chest, his gun, and his drinking cup, the last made of
a cocoanut shell, are, or were till lately, the property
of his descendants at Largo.
The sale of "Robinson Crusoe" was, as we have
already stated, rapid and extensive, and De Foe's
profits were commensurate. The work was attacked
on all sides by his ancient opponents, whose labours
have long since quietly descended with their authors
to merited oblivion; but our author, having the
public on his side, set them all at defiance; and the
same year he published a second volume with equal
success. Thus far
"With steady bark and flowing sail
He ran before the wind,"
but incited by the hope of further profit, and con-
ceiving the theme of Crusoe inexhaustible, he shortly
after published " Serious Reflections during the Life of
Robinson Crusoe, with his Visionof the Angelic World."
These Visions and Reflections were well received at
the time, although by no means so much in requisi-
tion now.
With the return of his good fortune, our author's
health was re-established, and the vigour of his mind
restored. He published, in 1720, "The Life and
Piracies of Captain Singleton;" and finding it safer, it
would seem, as well as more profitable, to amuse the
public than to reform them, he continued this course,
with little variation, for the remainder of his life.
His subsequent publications, to all of which a con-
siderable degree of popularity was attached, though
none of them equalled the reputation of "Robinson
Crusoe," were the "Dumb Philosopher," "History of
Duncan Campbell," "Remarkable Life of Colonel
Jack," " Fortunate Mistress," and " New Voyage round
the World."
We are now to take leave of our author, who died
in 1731, at the age of sixty-eight, in Cripplegate,
London, leaving a widow and large family in tolerable
circumstances.
It does not fall within our plan either to attempt a
critical analysis of " Robinson Crusoe," or a detailed
view of the character of Daniel De Foe; the one is
before our readers, and the other may be estimated
from his life. That De Foe was a man of powerful
intellect and lively imagination is obvious from his
works; that he was possessed of an ardent temper, a
resolute courage, and an unwearied spirit of enterprise,
is ascertained by the events of his changeful career:
and whatever may be thought of that rashness and
improvidence by which his progress in life was so
frequently impeded, there seems no reason to with-
hold from him the praise of integrity, sincerity, and
unvaried consistency. As the author of "Robinson
Crusoe," his fame promises to endure as long as the
language in which he wrote.

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
CHAPTER I.
MY BIRTH AND PARENTAGE—AT NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE I DETERMINE TO GO TO SEA—DISSUADED BY MY PARENTS ELOPE WITH A SCHOOLFELLOW. AND GO
ON BOARD SHIP A STORM ARISES, DURING WHICH
1 AM DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED SHIP FOUNDERSMYSELF AND CREW SAVED BY A BOAT FROM ANOTHER VESSEL, AND LANDED NEAR YARMOUTH
—MEET MY COMPANION'S FATHER THERE, WHO
ADVISES ME NEVER TO GO TO SEA MORE, BUT ALL
IN VAIN.
I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of
a good family, though not of that country, my father
being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull:
he got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off
his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he
had married my mother, whose relations were named
Robinson, a very good family in that country, and
from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but,
VOL. I. A
by the usual corruption of words in England, we are
now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our
name, Crusoe; and so my companions always called
me.
I had two elder brothers, one of which was a lieu-
tenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flan-
ders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel
Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk
against the Spaniards: what became of my second
brother I never knew, any more than my father or
mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred to
any trade, my head began to be filled very early with
rambling thoughts: my father, who was very ancient,
had given me a competent share of learning, as far
as house education and a country free-school gene-
rally goes, and designed me for the law; but I would
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my
inclination to this led me so strongly against the will,
nay, the commands of my father, and against all the
entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in
that propension of nature, tending directly to the life
of misery which was to befall me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was
my design. He called me one morning into his
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject:
he asked me what reasons, more than a mere wander-
ing inclination, I had for leaving my father's house
and my native country, where I might be well intro-
duced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune
by application and industry, with a life of ease and
pleasure: he told me it was men of desperate for-
tunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes
on the other, and who went abroad upon adventures,
to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in
undertakings of a nature out of the common road;
that these things were all either too far above me, or
too far below me; that mine was the middle state,
or what might be called the upper station of low life,
which he had found, by long experience, was the
best state in the world, the most suited to human
happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships,
the labour and sufferings, of the mechanic part of
mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury,
ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind.
He told me I might judge of the happiness of this
state, by this one thing, viz., that this was the state
of life which all other people envied; that kings have
frequently lamented the miserable consequences of
being born to great things, and wished they had
been placed in the middle of the two extremes,
between the mean and the great; that the wise man
gave his testimony to this, as the just standard of
true felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty
nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the middle
station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed
to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part
of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so
many distempers, and uneasinesses, either of body or
mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury,
and extravagances on one hand, or by hard labour,
want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet
on the other hand, bring distempers upon them-
selves by the natural consequences of their way of
living; that the middle station of life was calcu-
lated for all kind of virtues and all kind of enjoy-
ments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids
of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation,
quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions,
and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attend-
ing the middle station of life; that this way men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and com-
fortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of
the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery
for daily bread, or harassed with perplexed circum-
stances, which rob the soul of peace, and the body
of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or
the secret burning lust of ambition for great things;
but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without
the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning
by every day's experience to know it more sensibly. After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, or
to precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and
the station of life I was born in, seemed to have
provided against; that I was under no necessity of
seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and
endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life
which he had been just recommending to me; and
that if I was not very easy and happy in the world,
it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder
it; and that he should have nothing to answer for,
s
having thus discharged his duty in warning me
against measures which he knew would be to my
hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind
things for me if I would stay and settle at home as
he directed, so he would not have so much hand in
my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement
to go away; and, to close all, he told me I had my
elder brother for an example, to whom he had used
the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going
into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail,
his young desires prompting him to run into the
army, where he was killed; and though he said he
would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture
to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step God
would not bless me, and I would have leisure here-
after to reflect upon having neglected his counsel,
when there might be none to assist in my recovery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which
was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did
not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the
tears run down his face very plentifully, especially
when he spoke of my brother who was killed; and
that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke
off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full
he could say no more to me.
I was sincerely afflicted with this discourse, as
indeed who could be otherwise? and I resolved not
to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at
home according to my father's desire. But, alas! a
few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any
of my father's farther importunities, in a few weeks
after, I resolved to run quite away from him. How-
ever, I did not act so hastily neither, as the first heat
of my resolution prompted, but I took my mother at
a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than
ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so
entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should
never settle to anything with resolution enough to go
through with it, and my father had better give me his
consent than force me to go without it; that I was
now eighteen years old, which was too late to go
apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney; that
I was sure, if I did, I should never serve out my time,
but I should certainly run away from my master
before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father to let me go one voyage
abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I
would go no more, and I would promise, by a double
diligence, to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion: she told
me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to
my father upon any such subject; that he knew too
well what was my interest, to give his consent to any
such thing so much for my hurt; and that she won-
dered how I could think of any such thing after the
discourse I had had with my father, and such kind
and tender expressions as she knew my father had
used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself,
there was no help for me; but I might depend I
should never have their consent to it: that, for her
part, she would not have so much hand in my de-
struction; and I should never have it to say, that
my mother was willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my father,
yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the
discourse to him; and that my father, after showing
a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, " That
boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but
if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable
wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent
to it."
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the meantime I continued obsti-
nately deaf to all proposals of settling to business,
and frequently expostulating with my father and
mother about their being so positively determined
against what they knew my inclinations prompted
me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I went
casually, and without any purpose of making an
elopement that time; but, I say, being there, and
one of my companions being going by sea to London
in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with
them, with the common allurement of a seafaring
man, that it should cost me nothing for my passage,
I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor
so much as sent them word of it; but leaving them
to hear of it as they might, without asking God's
blessing or my father's, without any consideration of
circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour,
God knows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went
on board a ship bound for London. Never any
young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began
sooner, or continued longer, than mine: the ship
was no sooner got out of the Humber, but the wind
began to blow, and the sea to rise in a most frightful
manner; and as I had never been at sea before, I
was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in
mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what I
had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the
judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my
father's house, and abandoning my duty. All the
good counsel of my parents, my father's tears, and my
mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind;
and my conscience, which was not yet come to the
pitch of hardness to which it has been since, re-
proached me with the contempt of advice, and the
breach of my duty to God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea
went very high, though nothing like what I have
seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few
days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who
was but a young sailor, and had never known any-
thing of the matter. I expected every wave would
have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship
fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow
of the sea, we should never rise more. In this agony
of mind, I made many vows and resolutions, that if it
would please God to spare my life in this one voyage,
if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I
would go directly home to my father, and never set
it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take
his advice, and never run myself into such miseries
as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness
of his observations about the middle station of life,
how easy, how comfortable he had lived all his days,
and never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or
trouble on shore; and, in short, I resolved that I
would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my
father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time
9
after; but the next day the wind was abated, and
the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to
it. However, I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fine evening followed; the sun went down
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and
having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun
shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most
delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no
more sea-sick, but very cheerful; looking with won-
der upon the sea, that was so rough and terrible the
day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in
so little a time after: and now, lest my good resolu-
tions should continue, my companion, who had in-
deed enticed me away, comes to me. "Well, Bob,"
says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, "how do
you do after it? I warrant you were frighted, wer'n't
you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?"
"A capful d'ye call it?" said I"; "'twas a terrible
storm." "A storm, you fool you!" replies he; "do
you call that a storm? why, it was nothing at all;
give us but a good ship, and sea-room, and we think
nothing of such a squall of wind as that; but you're
but a fresh-water sailor, Bob; come, let us make a
bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that; d'ye see
what charming weather 'tis now?" To make short
this sad part of my story, we went the way of all
sailors; the punch was made, and I was made half
drunk with it; and in that one night's wickedness I
drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon
my past conduct, all my resolutions for the future.
In a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness
of surface and settled calmness by the abatement
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed
up by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my
former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows
and promises that I made in my distress. I found,
indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious
thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again
sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself
from them, as it were from a distemper; and applying
myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the
return of those fits (for so I called them); and I had,
in five or six days, got a complete victory over my
conscience, as any young fellow that resolved not to
be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have
another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such
cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse; for if I would not take this for a
deliverance, the next was to be such an one as the
worst and most hardened wretch among us would
confess both the danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to
an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing
contrary, viz., at south-west, for seven or eight days;
during which time a great many ships from New-
castle came into the same roads, as the common
harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for
the river.
We had not, however, rid here so long, but we
ii
should have tided it up the river, but that the wind
blew too fresh; and, after we had lain four or five
days, blew very hard. However, the roads being
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good,
and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were
unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of
danger; but spent the time in rest and mirth, after
the manner of the sea: but the eighth day, in the
morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at
work to strike our top-masts, and make everything
snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as
possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed,
and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas,
and we thought once or twice our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-
anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and
the cables veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and
now I began to see terror and amazement in the
faces even of the seamen themselves. The master,
though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship,
yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could
hear him, softly to himself, say several times, "Lord,
be merciful to us! we shall be all lost, we shall be all
undone," and the like. During these first hurries I
was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the
steerage, and cannot describe my temper. I could
ill resume the first penitence which I had so appa-
rently trampled upon, and hardened myself against:
I thought the bitterness of death had been past; and
that this would be nothing too, like the first. But
when the master himself came by me, as I said just
now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully
frighted: I got up out of my cabin, and looked out;
but such a dismal sight I never saw: the sea went
mountains high, and broke upon us every three or
four minutes: when I could look about, I could see
nothing but distress round us. Two ships that rid
near us, we found had cut their masts by the board,
being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a ship,
which rid about a mile ahead of us, was foundered.
Two more ships, being driven from their anchors,
were run out of the roads to sea, at all adventures,
and that with not a mast standing. The light ships
fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea;
but two or three of them drove, and came close by
us, running away with only their sprit-sail out, before
the wind.
Towards the evening, the mate and boatswain
begged the master of our ship to let them cut away
the foremast, which he was very unwilling to do:
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did
not, the ship would founder, he consented; and when
they had cut away the foremast, the mainmast stood
so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were
obliged to cut her away also, and make a clear deck.
Any one must judge what a condition I must be
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who
had been in such a fright before at but a little. But
if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had
about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror
of mind upon account of my former convictions, and
the having returned from them to the resolutions I
had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death
itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm,
put me into such a condition, that I can by no words
13
describe it. But the worst was not come yet; the
storm continued with such fury, that the seamen
themselves acknowledged they had never seen a
worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every now
and then cried out she would founder. It was my
advantage in one respect that I did not know what
they meant by founder, till I inquired. However,
the storm was so violent, that I saw, what is not
often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others
more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and
expecting every moment when the ship would go to
the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under
all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had
been down on purpose to see, cried out we had sprung
a leak; another said, there was four feet water in the
hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At
that very word, my heart, as I thought, died within
me; and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed
where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused
me, and told me, that I, that was able to do nothing
before, was as well able to pump as another; at which
I stirred up, and went to the pump, and worked very
heartily. While this was doing, the master seeing
some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm,
were obliged to slip and run away to the sea, and
would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal
of distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant,
was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke,
or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was
so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this
was a time when everybody had his own life to think
of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me;
but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrust-
ing me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had
been dead; and it was a great while before I came to
myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder;
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not possible she could swim till we might run
into a port, so the master continued firing guns for
help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead
of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with
the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was
impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to
lie near the ship side, till at last the men rowing very
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our
men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to
it, and then veered it out a great length, which they,
after much labour and hazard, took hold of, and we
hauled them close under our stern, and got all into
their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after
we were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own
ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull
her in towards shore as much as we could; and our
master promised them, that if the boat was staved
upon shore, he would make it good to their master:
so partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went
away to the northward, sloping towards the shore,
almost as far as Winterton Ness.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our ship, but we saw her sink: and then I
understood, for the first time, what was meant by a
ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I
had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me
she was sinking; for, from that moment they rather
put me into the boat, than that I might be said to go
in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly
with fright, partly with horror of mind, and the
thoughts of what was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see (when, our boat mounting the waves, we
were able to see the shore) a great many people
running along the shore to assist us when we should
come near; but we made but slow way towards the
shore, nor were we able to reach the shore till, being
past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off
to the westward towards Cromer, and so the land
broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we
got in, and, though not without much difficulty, got
all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to
Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used
with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of
the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by par-
ticular merchants and owners of ships, and had money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or
back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's para-
ble, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for,
hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in
Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had
any assurance that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy
that nothing could resist; and though I had several
times loud calls from my reason and my more com-
posed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to
do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I urge
that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries us on
to be the instruments of our own destruction, even
though it be before us, and that we push upon it with
our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such
decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it
was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed
me forward against the calm reasonings and per-
suasions of my most retired thoughts, and against
two such visible instructions as I had met with in
my first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before,
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days,
for we were separated in the town to several quar-
ters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his
tone was altered; and looking very melancholy, and
shaking his head, asked me how I did: and telling
his father who I was, and how I had come this
voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther abroad;
his father, turning to me with a grave and concerned
tone, "Young man," says he, "you ought never to
go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a
plain and visible token that you are not to be a sea-
faring man." "Why, sir," said I, "will you go to
sea no more?" "That is another case," said he;
"it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as
you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a
taste Heaven has given you of what you are to ex-
pect if you persist; perhaps all^this has befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish.''
'7
Pray," continues he, "what are you? and on what
account did you go to sea?" Upon that I told him
some of my story; at the end of which he burst out
with a strange kind of passion: "What had I done,"
says he, "that such an unhappy wretch should come
into my ship? I would not set my foot in the same
ship with thee again for a thousand pounds." This
indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits,
which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and
was farther than he could have authority to go.
However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me,
exhorted me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; told me, I might see a visible
hand of Heaven against me; "And, young man,"
said he, "depend upon it, if you do not go back,
wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but
disasters and disappointments, till your father's words
are fulfilled upon you."
We parted soon after; for I made him little an-
swer, and I saw him no more: which way he went,
I know not. As for me, having some money in my
pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there,
as well as on the road, had many struggles with
myself what course of life I should take, and whether
I should go home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best
motions that offered to my thoughts; and it imme-
diately occurred to me how I should be laughed
at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to
see, not my father and mother only, but even every-
body else; from whence I have since often observed,
how incongruous and irrational the common temper
of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason
VOL. I. B
which ought to guide them in such cases, viz., that
they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed
to repent; nor ashamed of the action for which they
ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of
the returning, which only can make them be esteemed
wise men.
In this state of life, however, I remained some
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance con-
tinued to going home; and as I stayed awhile, the
remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off;
and as that abated, the little motion I had in my
desires to a return wore off with it, till at last I quite
laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a
voyage.
That evil influence which carried me first away
from my father's house, that hurried me into the
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune;
and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to
the entreaties and even the command of my father;
I say, the same influence, whatever it was, presented
the most unfortunate of all enterprises to my view;
and I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of
Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage
to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune, that in all these ad-
ventures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet, at the same time, I had learnt
the duty and office of a foremastman; and in time
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant,
if not for a master. But as it was always my fate
19
to choose for the worst, so I did here; for, having
money in my pocket, and good clothes upon my
back, I would always go on board in the habit of a
gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the
ship, or learnt to do any.
CHAPTER II.
MAKE A TRADING VOYAGE TO GUINEA VERY SUCCESSFULLY —DEATH OF MY CAPTAIN—SAIL ANOTHER TRIP WITH HIS MATE THE VENGEANCE OF PROVIDENCE FOR
DISOBEDIENCE TO PARENTS NOW OVERTAKES ME
TAKEN BY A SALLEE ROVER, AND ALL SOLD AS
SLAVESMY MASTER FREQUENTLY SENDS ME A-FISH- ING, WHICH SUGGESTS AN IDEA OF ESCAPE MAKE MY ESCAPE IN AN OPEN BOAT, WITH A MORESCO SOY.
It was my lot, first of all, to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early: but it was not so with
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship
who had been on the coast of Guinea; and who hav-
ing had very good success there, was resolved to go
again; and who taking a fancy to my conversation,
which was not at all disagreeable at that time, hear-
ing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me,
if I would go the voyage with him I should be at no
expense; I should be his messmate and his com-
panion; and if I could carry anything with me, I
should have all the advantage of it that the trade
would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.
I embraced the offer; and entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest and
plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and
carried a small adventure with me, which, by the
disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I
increased very considerably; for I carried about £40
in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me
to buy. This £40 I had mustered together by the
assistance of some of my relations, whom I corres-
ponded with, and who, I believe, got my father, or at
least my mother, to contribute so much as that to my
first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain;
under whom also I got a competent knowledge of
the mathematics, and the rules of navigation; learned
how to keep an account of the ship's course, take an
observation, and, in short, to understand some things
that were needful to be understood by a sailor: for,
as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to
learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both
a sailor and a merchant: for I brought home five
pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London, at my return, almost
£300; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts
which have since so completed my ruin.
Yet, even in this voyage, I had my misfortunes
too; particularly that I was continually sick, being
thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive heat
of the climate; our principal trading being upon
21
the coast, from the lat. of 15 degrees N. even to the
Line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again; and
I embarked in the same vessel with one who was
his mate in the former voyage, and had now got the
command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage
that ever man made; for though I did not carry
quite ^100 of my new-gained wealth, so that I had
£200 left, and which I lodged with my friend's
widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into
terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the first
was this: viz., our ship, making her course towards
the Canary Islands, or rather between those islands
and the African shore, was surprised in the grey of
the morning, by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave
chase to us with all the sail she could make. We
crowded also as much canvas as our yards would
spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear; but
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would cer-
tainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared
to fight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rover
eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up
with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart
our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he
intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on
that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire,
and pouring in also his small shot, from near two
hundred men which he had on board. However,
we had not a man touched, all our men keeping
close. He prepared to attack us again, and we to
defend ourselves; but laying us on board the next
time upon our other quarter, he entered sixty men
upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and
hacking the decks and rigging. We plied them with
small shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like,
and cleared our deck of them twice. However, to
cut short this melancholy part of our story, our ship
being disabled, and three of our men killed and
eight wounded, we were obliged to yield; and were
carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to
the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended; nor was I carried up the coun-
try, to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover, as
his proper prize, and made his slave, being young
and nimble, and fit for his business. At this surpris-
ing change of my circumstances, from a merchant to
a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and
now I looked back upon my father's prophetic dis-
course to me, that I should be miserable, and have
none to relieve me; which I thought was now so
effectually brought to pass, that I could not be worse;
that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me,
and I was undone without redemption. But, alas!
this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through,
as will appear in the sequel of this story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would be some time or other his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man-of-war; and
that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope
=3
of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to sea,
he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and
do the common drudgery of slaves about his house;
and when he came home again from his cruise, he
ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and
what method I might take to effect it; but found no
way that had the least probability in it. Nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational; for
I had nobody to communicate it to that would
embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman there, but myself; so that
for two years, though I often pleased myself with
the imagination, yet I never had the least encourag-
ing prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd circumstance pre-
sented itself, which put the old thought of making
some attempt for my liberty again in my head: my
patron lying at home longer than usual, without
fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want
of money, he used constantly, once or twice a week,
sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take
the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing;
and as he always took me and a young Moresco with
him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and
I proved very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch,
that sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one
of his kinsmen, and the youth, the Moresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.
It happened one time, that going a-fishing with
him in a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though we were not half a league from the shore, we
lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither, or
which way, we laboured all day, and all the next
night; and when the morning came, we found we had
pulled off to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore;
and that we were at least two leagues from the land:
however, we got well in again, though with a great
deal of labour, and some danger; for the wind began
to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but, particularly,
we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved
to take more care of himself for the future; and
having lying by him the long-boat of our English
ship which he had taken, he resolved he would not
go a-fishing any more without a compass and some
provision; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who also was an English slave, to build a little state-
room, or cabin, in the middle of the longboat, like
that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to
steer, and haul home the main-sheet; and room be-
fore for a hand or two to stand and work the sails.
She sailed with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton
sail; and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin,
which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for
him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on,
with some small lockers to put in some bottles of
such liquor as he thought fit to drink; particularly
his bread, rice, and coffee.
We were frequently out with this boat a-fishing;
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened one day,
that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either
for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of
some distinction, and for whom he had provided
extraordinarily; and had therefore sent on board the
boat over night a larger store of provisions than
usual; and had ordered me to get ready three fusils
with powder and shot, which were on board his ship;
for that they designed some sport of fowling, as well
as fishing.
I got all things ready, as he had directed; and
waited the next morning with the boat washed clean,
her ancient and pendants out, and everything to
accommodate his guests; when by and by my patron
came on board alone, and told me his guests had put
off going, upon some business that fell out; and
ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go
out with the boat, and catch them some fish, for that
his friends were to sup at his house; he commanded
me too, that as soon as I had got some fish, I should
bring it home to his house; all which I prepared to
do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts: for now I found I was like
to have a little ship at my command; and my master
being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for
fishing business, but for a voyage; though I knew
not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I
would steer; for anywhere to get out of that place
was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our sub-
sistence on board; for I told him we must not pre-
sume to eat of our patron's bread; he said, that was
true: so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit
of their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the
boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles
stood, which, it was evident by the make, were taken
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
out of some English prize, and I conveyed them into
the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they had
been there before for our master: I conveyed also
a great lump of bees'-wax into the boat, which
weighed above half a hundred weight, with a parcel
of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer,
all which were of great use to us afterwards, espe-
cially the wax to make candles. Another trick I
tried upon him, which he innocently came into
also; his name was Ismael, whom they call Muly
or Moley; so I called to him: "Moley," said I, "our
patron's guns are on board the boat; can you not
get a little powder and shot? it may be we may kill
some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves,
for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."
—"Yes," says he, "I'll bring some;" and accord-
ingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held
about a pound and a half of powder, or rather more;
and another with shot, that had five or six pounds,
with some bullets, and put all into the boat; at
the same time I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one
of the large bottles in the case, which was almost
empty, pouring what was in it into another; and thus
furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of
the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance
of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice
of us: and we were not above a mile out of the port
before we hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish.
The wind blew from the north-north-east, which was
contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly,
I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain,
and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my
27
resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would
be gone from that horrid place where I was, and
leave the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time and catched nothing,
for when I had fish on my hook I would not pull
them up, that he might not see them, I said to the
Moor, " This will not do; our master will not be thus
served; we must stand farther off." He, thinking no
harm, agreed, and being in the head of the boat, set
the sails; and as I had the helm, I run the boat out
near a league farther, and then brought her to as if I
would fish; when, giving the boy the helm, I stepped
forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I
stooped for something behind him, I took him by
surprise with my arm under his twist, and tossed him
clear overboard into the sea; he rose immediately, for
he swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to
be taken in, told me he would go all over the world
with me. He swam so strong after the boat, that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being but
little wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and
fetching one of the fowling pieces, I presented it at
him, and told him, I had done him no hurt, and if he
would be quiet I would do him none: "But," said I,
"you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and the
sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore and
I will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat,
I'll shoot you through the head, for I am resolved to
have my liberty:" so he turned himself about, and
swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he
reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was
no venturing to trust him. When he was gone, I
turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said
to him, "Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll make
you a great man; but if you will not stroke your face
to be true to me," that is, swear by Mahomet and his
father's beard, "I must throw you into the sea too."
Theboy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that
I could not mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to
me, and go all over the world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me
gone towards the Straits' mouth, as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been supposed
to do; for who would have supposed we were sailed
on to the southward to the truly Barbarian coast
where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround
us with their canoes, and destroy us; where we could
never once go on shore, but we should be devoured
by savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human
kind?
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending my course a little toward the east,
that I might keep in with the shore; and having a
fair, fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I
made such sail, that I believe by the next day at
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the
land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of
Sallee; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts,
for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
29
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, or
come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till I
had sailed in that manner five days; and then the
wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also that
if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also
would now give over; so I ventured to make to the
coast, and come to an anchor in the mouth of a little
river, I knew not what, or where; neither what lati-
tude, what country, what nation, or what river: I
neither saw, nor desired to see, any people; the prin-
cipal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore
as soon as it was dark, and discover the country; but
as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that the poor
boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not
to go on shore till day. "Well, Xury," said I, "then
I won't; but it may be we may see men by day, who
will be as bad to us as those lions."—" Then we give
them the shoot gun," says Xury, laughing, "make
them run wey." Such English Xury spoke by
conversing among us slaves. However, I was glad
to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram
(out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him up.
After all, Xury's advice was good, and I took it; we
dropped our little anchor, and lay still all night; I
say still, for we slept none; for in two or three hours
we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to
call them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore,
and run into the water, wallowing and washing them-
selves for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and
they made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was
I too: but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming
towards our boat; we could not see him, but we
might hear him by his blowing, to be a monstrous,
huge, and furious beast; Xury said it was a lion,
and it might be so for aught I know. Poor Xury
cried to me to weigh the anchor, and row away.
"No," says I, "Xury, we can slip our cable with a
buoy to it, and go to sea; they cannot follow us far."
I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature
(whatever it was) within two oars' length, which
something surprised me; however I immediately
stepped to the cabin-door, and taking up my gun,
fired at him; upon which he immediately turned
about, and swam to the shore again.
But it was not possible to describe the horrible
noises and hideous cries and howlings, that were
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore, as higher
within the country, upon the noise or report of a
gun; a thing I have some reason to believe those
creatures had never heard before. This convinced
me that there was no going on shore for us in the
night upon that coast; and how to venture on shore
in the day, was another question too; for to have
fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been
as bad as to have fallen into the paws of lions and
tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the
danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on
shore somewhere or other for water, for we had not
31
a pint left in the boat; when or where to get to it
was the point: Xury said, if I would let him go on
shore with one of the jars, he would find if there
was any water, and bring some to me. I asked him
why he would go? why I should not go, and he stay
in the boat? The boy answered with so much affec-
tion, that made me love him ever after. Says he,
"If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey."
"Well, Xury," said I, "we will both go, and if the
wild mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat
neither of us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk-
bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of
bottles, which I mentioned before; and we hauled
the boat in as near the shore as we thought was
proper, and waded on shore; carrying nothing but
our arms, and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fear-
ing the coming of canoes with savages down the
river: but the boy, seeing a low piece about a mile
up the country, rambled to it; and by and by I saw
him come running towards me. I thought he was
pursued by some savage, or frighted with some wild
beast, and I run forward towards him to help him;
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something
hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature
that he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour,
and longer legs; however, we were very glad of it,
and it was very good meat; but the great joy that
poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found
good water, and seen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take
such pains for water, for a little higher up the creek
where we were, we found the water fresh when the
tide was out, which flows but a little way up; so we
filled our jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed,
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no foot-
steps of any human creature in that part of the
country.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I
knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and
the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off from
the coast. But I had no instruments to take an
observation to know what latitude we were in, and
did not exactly know, or at least not remember, what
latitude they were in, and knew not where to look
for them, or when to stand off to sea towards them;
otherwise I might now easily have found some of
these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood
along this coast till I came to that part where the
English traded, I should find some of their vessels
upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve
and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where I
now was must be that country, which, lying between
the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Ne-
groes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except by wild
beasts; the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone
farther south for fear of the Moors; and the Moors
not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its
barrenness; and indeed both forsaking it because of
the prodigious number of tigers, lions, leopards, and
other furious creatures which harbour there; so that
the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they
go like an army, two or three thousand men at a
time; and indeed for near a hundred miles together
upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste unin-
33
habited country by day, and heard nothing but
howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw
the Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the
mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a great
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but having tried twice, I was forced in again by con-
trary winds, the sea also going too high for my little
vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and
keep along the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water,
after we had left this place; and once in particular,
being early in the morning, we came to an anchor
under a little point of land which was pretty high;
and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him
than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells
me that we had best go farther off the shore; "For,"
says he, "look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the
side of that hillock fast asleep." I looked where he
pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it
was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the
shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that
hung as it were a little over him. "Xury," says I,
"you shall go on shore and kill him." Xury looked
frighted, and said, "Me kill! he eat me at one
mouth ;" one mouthful he meant: however, I said
no more to the boy, but bade him lie still, and I took
our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and
loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with
two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another
gun with two bullets; and the third, for we had
three pieces, I loaded with five smaller bullets. I
VOL. I. C
took the best aim I could with the first piece to have
shot him into the head, but he lay so with his leg
raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his
leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He started
up, growling at first, but finding his leg broke, fell
down again, and then got up upon three legs, and
gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I
was a little surprised that I had not hit him on the
head; however, I took up the second piece immedi-
ately, and though he began to move off, fired again,
and shot him into the head, and had the pleasure to
see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie
struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and
would have me let him go on shore; "Well, go,"
said I; so the boy jumped into the water, and taking
a little gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other
hand, and coming close to the creature, put the
muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him into
the head again, which despatched him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food;
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing
to us. However, Xury said he would have some of
him; so he comes on board, and asked me to give
him the hatchet. "For what, Xury?" said I. "Me
cut off his head," said he. However, Xury could
not cut off his head, but he cut off a foot, and
brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great
one.
I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin
of him might one way or other be of some value to
us; and I resolved to take off his skin, if I could. So
Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was
33
much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill
how to do it. Indeed, it took us both up the whole
day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and,
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effec-
tually dried it in two days time, and it afterwards
served me to lie upon.
CHAPTER III.
MAKE FOR THE SOUTHWARD IN HOPES OF MEETING WITH SOME EUROPEAN VESSEL SEE SAVAGES ALONG SHORESHOOT A LARGE LEOPARD—AM TAKEN UP BY A MERCHANTMAN—ARRIVE AT THE BRAZILS, AND BUY
A SETTLEMENT THERE CANNOT BE QUIET, BUT
SAIL ON A VOYAGE OF ADVENTURE TO GUINEA—SHIP STRIKES ON A SAND-BANK IN UNKNOWN LAND—ALL LOST BUT MYSELF, WHO AM DRIVEN ASHORE, HALF
DEAD.
AFTER this stop, we made on to the southward con-
tinually for ten or twelve days, living very sparing on
our provisions, which began to abate very much, and
going no oftener into the shore than we were obliged
to for fresh water: my design in this was, to make
the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, anywhere
about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to
meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I
knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for
the islands, or perish there among the negroes. I
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this Cape, or those islands; and,
in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some ship,
or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten
days longer, as I have said, I began to see that the
land was inhabited; and in two or three places, as
we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to
look at us; we could also perceive they were quite
black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to have
gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better
counsellor, and said to me, "No go, no go." How-
ever, I hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk
to them, and I found they run along the shore by me
a good way: I observed they had no weapons in
their hands, except one, who had a long slender stick,
which Xury said was a lance, and that they would
throw them a great way with good aim; so I kept at
a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I
could; and particularly made signs for something to
eat; they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they
would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the
top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up
into the country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh
and some corn, such as is the produce of their country;
but we neither knew what the one nor the other was;
however, we were willing to accept it, but how to
come at it was our next dispute, for I was not for
venturing on shore to them, and they were as much
afraid of us: but they took a safe way for us all, for
they brought it to the shore, and laid it down, and
37
went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on
board, and then came close to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity
offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully •
for while we were lying by the shore, came two
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took
it) with great fury from the mountains towards the
sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female, or
whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not
tell, any more than we could tell whether it was usual
or strange, but I believe it was the latter; because,
in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom
appear but in the night; and, in the second place, we
found the people terribly frighted, especially the
women. The man that had the lance, or dart, did
not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the
two creatures ran directly into the water, they did
not seem to offer to fall upon any of the negroes, but
plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about as
if they had come for their diversion. At last one of
them began to come nearer our boat than at first I
expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury
load both the others; as soon as he came fairly with-
in my reach I fired, and shot him directly into the
head; immediately he sunk down into the water, but
rose instantly, and plunged up and down as if he was
struggling for life; and so indeed he was: he imme-
diately made to the shore; but between the wound,
which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the
water, he died just before he reached the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
these poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my
gun; some of them were even ready to die for fear,
and fell down as dead with the very terror. But
when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to the
shore, they took heart, and came to the shore, and
began to search for the creature. I found him by
his blood staining the water, and by the help of a
rope, which I slung round him, and gave the negroes
to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that
it was a most curious leopard, spotted and fine to an
admirable degree, and the negroes held up their
hands with admiration to think what it was I had
killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran
up directly to the mountains from whence they came,
nor could I at that distance know what it was. I
found quickly the negroes were for eating the flesh
of this creature, so I was willing to have them take
it as a favour from me, which, when I made signs
to them that they might take him, they were very
thankful for. Immediately they fell to work with
him, and though they had no knife, yet with a shar-
pened piece of wood they took off his skin as readily,
and much more readily, than we could have done
with a knife. They offered me some of the flesh,
which I declined, making as if I would give it them,
but made signs for the skin, which they gave me
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of
their provision, which, though I did not understand,
yet I accepted; then I made signs to them for some
water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning
it bottom upward, to show that it was empty, and
that I wanted to have it filled. They called imme-
diately to some of their friends, and there came two
women, and brought a great vessel made of earth,
and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun; this they set
down for me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore
with my jars, and filled them all three. The women
were as stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as
it was, and water; and leaving my friendly negroes,
I made forward for about eleven days more, without
offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run
out a great length into the sea, at about the distance
of four or five leagues before me; and the sea being
very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point:
at length, doubling the point at about two leagues
from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side
to sea-ward; then I concluded, as it was most certain
indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those
the islands, called from thence Cape de Verd Islands.
However, they were at a great distance, and I could
not well tell what I had best to do; for if I should be
taken with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach one
nor the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped
into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the
helm, when on a sudden the boy cried out, "Master,
master, a ship with a sail!" and the foolish boy was
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when
I knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach.
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw not
only the ship, but what she was, viz., that it was a
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to
the coast of Guinea for negroes. But when I
observed the course she steered, I was soon con-
vinced they were bound some other way, and did
not design to come any nearer to the shore; upon
which I stretched out to sea as much as I could,
resolving to speak with them, if possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they
would be gone by before I could make any signal
to them: but, after I had crowded to the utmost,
and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the
help of their perspective-glasses, and that it was some
European boat, which, as they supposed, must belong
to some ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to
let me come up. I was encouraged with this; and
as I had my patron's ancient on board, I made a
waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and fired
a gun, both which they saw, for they told me they
saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun;
upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and
lay by for me, and in about three hours' time I came
up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French; but I understood none of
them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was
an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of
slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, as any one
would believe, that I was thus delivered, as I
41
esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost hope-
less condition as I was in, and immediately offered
all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return for
my deliverance; but he generously told me, he would
take nothing from me, but that all I had should be
delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils;
"for," says he, "I have saved your life on no other
terms than I would be glad to be saved myself; and
it may one time or other be my lot to be taken up
in the same condition; besides," said he, "when I
carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your
own country, if I should take from you what you
have, you will be starved there, and then I only
take away that life I have given. No, no, Seignor
Inglese," says he, "Mr. Englishman, I will carry you
thither in charity, and those things will help you to
buy your subsistence there, and your passage home
again."
As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered
the seamen, that none should offer to touch anything
I had: then he took everything into his own pos-
session, and gave me back an exact inventory of
them, that I might have them; even so much as my
three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the
ship's use, and asked me what I would have for it?
I told him, he had been so generous to me in every-
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of
the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which he
told me, he would give me a note of his hand to pay
me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
it came there, if any one offered to give more, he
would make it up: he offered me also sixty pieces of
eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loath to
take; not that I was not willing to let the captain
have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring
my own. However, when I let him know my reason,
he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium,
that he would give the boy an obligation to set him
free in ten years, if he turned Christian. Upon this,
and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let
the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints'
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I
was once more delivered from the most miserable
of all conditions of life; and what to do next with
myself, I was now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I
can never enough remember; he would take nothing
of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the
leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin which I
had in my boat, and caused everything I had in the
ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was
willing to sell he bought, such as the case of bottles,
two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees'
wax, for I had made candles of the rest; in a word,
I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight
of all my cargo; and with this stock I went on shore
in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended
to the house of a good honest man like himself, who
had an ingeino, as they call it; that is, a plantation
43
and a sugar-house; I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner of
their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how
well the planters lived, and how they grew rich
suddenly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle
there, I would turn planter among them; resolving,
in the meantime, to find out some way to get my
money, which I had left in London, remitted to me.
To this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of natural-
isation, I purchased as much land that was uncured
as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my
plantation and settlement, and such a one as might
be suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself
to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born
of English parents, whose name was Wells, and in
much such circumstances as I was. I call him neigh-
bour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and
we went on very sociable together. My stock was
but low, as well as his; and we rather planted for
food, than anything else, for about two years. How-
ever, we began to increase, and our land began to
come into order; so that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of
ground ready for planting canes in the year to come;
but we both wanted help; and now I found, more
than before, I had done wrong in parting with my
boy Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did
right, was no great wonder: I had no remedy but
to go on; I was gotten into an employment quite
remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life
I delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's
house, and broke through all his good advice; nay,
I was coming into the very middle station, or upper
degree of low life, which my father advised me to
before; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I
might as well have stayed at home, and never have
fatigued myself in the world as I had done; and I
used often to say to myself, I could have done this
as well in England among my friends, as have gone
five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and
savages in a wilderness, and at such distance, as never
to hear from any part of the world that had the least
knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbour; no work to
be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some
desolate island, that had nobody there but himself.
But how just has it been, and how should all men re-
flect that, when they compare their present conditions
with others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them
to make the exchange, and be convinced of their
former felicity by their experience; I say, how just
has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on
in an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who
had so often unjustly compared it with the life which
I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in all
probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich.
I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend, the
captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went back;
for the ship remained there, in providing his loading,
and preparing for his voyage, near three months; when,
45
telling him what little stock I had left behind me in
London, he gave me this friendly and sincere advice:
"Seignor Inglese," says he, for so he always called
me, " if you will give me letters, and a procuration
here in form to me, with orders to the person who
has your money in London, to send your effects to
Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such
goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you
the produce of them, God willing, at my return; but
since human affairs are all subject to changes and
disasters, I would have you give orders but for one
hundred pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your
stock, and let the hazard be run for the first; so that
if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way;
and if it miscarry, you may have the other half to
have recourse to for your supply."
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the
best course I could take; so I accordingly prepared
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain,
as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account
of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I
had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the human-
ity of his behaviour, and what condition I was now
in, with all other necessary directions for my supply;
and when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he
found means, by some of the English merchants there,
to send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story, to a merchant at London, who represented
it effectually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered
the money, but out of her own pocket, sent the
Portugal captain a very handsome present for his
humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in English goods, such as the captain had
writ for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and he
brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among
which, without my direction (for I was too young in
my business to think of them), he had taken care to
have all sort of tools, iron-work, and utensils neces-
sary for my plantation, and which were of great use
to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprised with joy of it; and my
good steward, the captain, had laid out the five
pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present
for himself, to purchase, and bring me over a servant
under bond for six years' service, and would not
accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco,
which I would have him accept, being of my own
produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize,
and things particularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means to sell them to a very great
advantage; so that I may say, I had more than four
times the value of my first cargo, and was now
infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the
advancement of my plantation; for the first thing I
did, I bought me a negro slave, and an European
servant also; I mean another besides that which the
captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with
47
me. I went on the next year with great success in
my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco
on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty
rolls, being each of above a hundred weight, were
well cured and laid by against the return of the fleet
from Lisbon. And now, increasing in business and
in wealth, my head began to be full of projects and
undertakings beyond my reach; such as are indeed
often the ruin of the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen
me, for which my father so earnestly recommended
a quiet retired life, and of which he had so sensibly
described the middle station of life to be full; but
other things attended me, and I was still to be the
wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly
to increase my fault, and double the reflections upon
myself, which in my future sorrows I should have
leisure to make; all these miscarriages were pro-
cured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my
foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing
that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views
of doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of
those prospects and those measures of life which
nature and providence concurred to present me with,
and to make my duty.
As I had done thus in my breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must
go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich
and thriving man in my new plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps
could be consistent with life and a state of health in
the world.
To come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars
of this part of my story; you may suppose, that
having now lived almost four years in the Brazils, and
beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my
plantation, I had not only learnt the language, but
had contracted acquaintance and friendship among
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants
at St. Salvadore, which was our port; and that in
my discourse among them, I had frequently given
them an account of my two voyages to the coast of
Guinea, the manner of trading with the negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the
coast, for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives, scissors,
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold-
dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c., but negroes
for the service of the Brazils in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only not far entered into, but,
as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal,
and engrossed in the public, so that few negroes
were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company with some mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of those things very earnestly, three of them came
to me the next morning, and told me they had been
musing very much upon what I had discoursed with
49
them of the last night, and they came to make a
secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me secrecy,
they told me, that they had a mind to fit out a
ship to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations
as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much
as servants; that as it was, a trade could not be
carried on, because they could not publicly sell the
negroes when they came home, so they desired to
make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore
privately, and divide them among their own planta-
tions; and, in a word, the question was, whether I
would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage
the trading part upon the coast of Guinea? and they
offered me, that I should have my equal share of the
negroes, without providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had
it been made to any one that had not had a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,
and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that
was thus entered and established, and had nothing
to do but go on as I had begun, for three or four
years more, and to have sent for the other hundred
pounds from England, and who in that time, and
with that little addition, could scarce have failed of
being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling,
and that increasing too; for me to think of such a
voyage, was the most preposterous thing that ever
man in such circumstances could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist the offer, than I could restrain
my first rambling designs, when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them
VOL. I. P
I would go with all my heart, if they would under-
take to look after my plantation in my absence, and
would dispose of it to such as I should direct if I
miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered
into writings or covenants to do so; and I made a
formal will, disposing of my plantation and effects,
in case of my death, making the captain of the ship,
that had saved my life as before, my universal heir,
but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had
directed in my will, one half of the produce being to
himself, and the other to be shipped to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve
my effects, and keep up my plantation; had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own
interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought
to have done, and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking,
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum-
stance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended
with all its common hazards; to say nothing of the
reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes to
myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason: and
accordingly the ship being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour again, the 1st of September 1659, being
the same day eight years that I went from my father
and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about one hundred and twenty ton
burden, carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides
the master, his boy, and myself; we had on board no
large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were
fit for our trade with the negroes, such as beads,
bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially little
looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the
like.
The same day I went on board we set sail, stand-
ing away to the northward upon our own coast, with
design to stretch over for the African coast; when
they came about 10 or 12 degrees of northern lati-
tude, which it seems was the manner of their course
in those days. We had very good weather, only
excessive hot, all the way upon our own coast, till
we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino, from
whence keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight of
land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle
Fernand de Noronha, holding our course north-east
by north, and leaving those isles on the east. In
this course we passed the line in about twelve days'
time, and were by our last observation in 7 degrees 22
minutes, northern latitude, when a violent tornado,
or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge:
it began from the south-east, came about to the north-
west, and then settled into the north-east; from
whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for
twelve days together we could do nothing but drive;
and scudding away before it, let it carry us whither
ever fate and the fury of the winds directed; and
during these twelve days, I need not say that I ex-
pected every day to be swallowed up, nor indeed did
any in the ship expect to save their lives.
In this distress we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and one
man and the boy washed overboard. About the
twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master
made an observation as well as he could, and found
that he was in about 11 degrees north latitude, but
that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference west
from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was
gotten upon the coast of Guinea, or the north part of
Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward that of the
river Oroonoque, commonly called the Great River,
and began to consult with me what course he should
take; for the ship was leaky, and very much dis-
abled, and he was going directly back to the coast
of Brazil.
I was positively against that, and looking over the
charts of the sea-coasts of America with him, we
concluded there was no inhabited country for us to
have recourse to, till we came within the circle of the
Caribbee islands; and therefore resolved to stand
away for Barbadoes, which, by keeping off at sea, to
avoid the indraft of the bay or gulf of Mexico, we
might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen
days' sail; whereas we could not possibly make our
voyage to the coast of Africa without some assist-
ance, both to our ship and to ourselves.
With this design we changed our course, and
steered away N.W. by W. in order to reach some of
our English islands, where I hoped for relief; but
our voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in
the latitude of 12 degrees 18 minutes a second storm
came upon us, which carried us away with the same
impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very
way of all human commerce, that, had all our lives
been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of
53
being devoured by savages than ever returning to our
own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men, early in the morning, cried out, Land!
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look
out in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a
moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke
over her in such a manner that we expected we should
all have perished immediately; and we were imme-
diately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us
from the very foam and spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one who has not been in the
like condition, to describe or conceive the consterna-
tion of men in such circumstances: we knew nothing
where we were, or upon what land it was we were
driven, whether an island or the main, whether inha-
bited or not inhabited; and as the rage of the wind
was still great, though rather less than at first, we
could not so much as hope to have the ship hold
many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the
winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately
about. In a word, we sat looking one upon another,
and expecting death every moment, and every man
acting accordingly, as preparing for another world;
for there was little or nothing more for us to do in
this: that which was our present comfort, and all the
comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expecta-
tion, the ship did not break yet, and that the master
said the wind began to abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand,
and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off,
we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had
nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well
as we could. We had a boat at our stern, just before
the storm; but she was first staved by dashing against
the ship's rudder, and in the next place she broke
away, and either sunk or was driven off to sea; so
there was no hope from her. We had another boat
on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a
doubtful thing; however, there was no room to de-
bate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces
every minute, and some told us she was actually
broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of
the boat, and with the help of the rest of the men,
they got her slung over the ship's side, and getting all
into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven
in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea; for
though the storm was abated considerably, yet the
sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and might
well be called den wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea
in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we
all saw plainly that the sea went so high that the
boat could not live, and that we should be inevitably
drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, if we
had, could we have done anything with it; so we
worked at the oar towards the land, though with
heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all
knew that, when the boat came nearer the shore, she
would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach
of the sea. However, we committed our souls to God
in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us
towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with
55
our own hands, pulling as well as we could towards
land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation
was, if we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the
mouth of some river, where, by great chance, we might
have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the land,
and perhaps made smooth water. But there was
nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer
and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful
than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly
bade us expect the coup degrace. In a word, it took
us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at once;
and separating us as well from the boat, as from
one another, gave us not time hardly to say, O God!
for we were all swallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the water; for though
I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself
from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave
having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way
on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but
half dead with the water I took in. I had so much
presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing
myself nearer the main land than I expected, I got
upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards
the land as fast as I could, before another wave
should return, and take me up again. But I soon
found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea
come after me as high as a great hill, and as furious
as an enemy, which I had no means or strength to
contend with; my business was to hold my breath,
and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so,
by swimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot
myself towards the shore, if possible; my greatest
concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry
me a great way towards the shore when it came on,
might not carry me back again with it when it gave
back towards the sea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me
at once twenty or thirty foot deep in its own body;
and I could feel myself carried with a mighty force
and swiftness towards the shore a very great way;
but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim
still forward with all my might. I was ready to
burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt my-
self rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found
my head and hands shoot out above the surface of
the water; and though it was not two seconds of
time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me
greatly, gave me breath, and new courage. I was
covered again with water a good while, but not so
long but I held it out; and finding the water had
spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to
recover breath, and till the water went from me,
and then took to my heels, and run with what
strength I had farther towards the shore. But
neither would this deliver me from the fury of the
sea, which came pouring in after me again; and
57
twice more I was lifted up by the waves, and carried
forward as before, the shore being very flat.
The last time of these two had well near been fatal
to me; for the sea having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or rather dashed me against a piece of
a rock, and that with such force, as it left me sense-
less, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance;
for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the
breath as it were quite out of my body; and had
it returned again immediately, I must have been
strangled in the water; but I recovered a little
before the return of the waves, and seeing I should
be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold
fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath,
if possible, till the wave went back. Now, as the
waves were not so high as at first, being near land, I
held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched
another run, which brought me so near the shore,
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did
not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the
next run I took I got to the main land, where, to
my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the
shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from
danger and quite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began
to look up and thank God that my life was saved in
a case wherein there was, some minutes before,
scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible
to express to the life what the ecstacies and trans-
ports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may
say, out of the very grave; and I do not wonder,
now, at that custom, viz., that when a malefactor,
who has the halter about his neck, is tied up, and
just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve
brought to him: I say, I do not wonder that they
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very
moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may
not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and
overwhelm him:
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe; re-
flecting upon all my comrades that were drowned,
and that there should not be one soul saved but
myself; for, as for them, I never saw them after-
wards, or any signs of them, except three of their
hats, one cap, and two shoes, that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could
hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord!
how was it possible I could get on shore!
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to
see what kind of place I was in, and what was next
to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate,
and that in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance:
for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any-
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither
did I see any prospect before me, but that of perish-
ing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts;
and that, which was particularly afflicting to me, was,
that I had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any
creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against
59
any other creature that might desire to kill me for
theirs: in a word, I had nothing about me but a
knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box;
this was all my provision, and this threw me into
terrible agonies of mind, that, for awhile, I ran about
like a madman. Night coming upon me I began,
with a heavy heart, to consider what would be my
lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country,
seeing at night they always come abroad for their
prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at
that time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like
a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I
resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day
what death I should die, for, as yet, I saw no pro-
spect of life. I walked about a furlong from the
shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink,
which I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and
put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger,
I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endea-
voured to place myself so as that if I should sleep I
might not fall; and having cut me a short stick, like
a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging,
and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast
asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few
could have done in my condition, and found myself
the most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on
such an occasion.
CHAPTER IV.
APPEARANCE OF THE WRECK AND COUNTRY NEXT DAY—
SWIM ON BOARD OF THE SHIP, AND, BY MEANS OF A
CONTRIVANCE, GET A QUANTITY OF STORES ON SHORE —SHOOT A BIRD, BUT IT TURNS OUT PERFECT CAR-
RION—MORALISE UPON MY SITUATION—THE SHIP BLOWN OFF LAND, AND TOTALLY LOST—SET OUT IN SEARCH OF A PROPER PLACE FOR A HABITATION SEE NUMBERS OF GOATS MELANCHOLY REFLECTIONS.
WHEN I waked it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage
and swell as before: but that which surprised me
most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night
from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of the
tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock
which I first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by the dashing me against it; this being within about
a mile from the shore where I was, and the ship
seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on
board, that at least I might save some necessary
things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I looked about me again, and the first thing I
found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the
sea had tossed her up upon the land, about two miles
on my right hand. I walked as far as I could upon
the shore to have got to her, but found a neck, or
inlet of water, between me and the boat, which was
about half a mile broad; so I came back for the pre-
sent, being more intent upon getting at the ship,
61
where I hoped to find something for my present
subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within
a quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I found a
fresh renewing of my grief: for I saw evidently, that
if we had kept on board, we had been all safe, that is
to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not
been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of
all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced
tears from my eyes again; but as there was little
relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the
ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was
hot to extremity, and took the water; but when I
came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to
know how to get on board; for as she lay aground,
and high out of the water, there was nothing within
my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice,
and the second time I spied a small piece of a rope,
which I wondered I did not see at first, hang down
by the fore-chains so low as that with great difficulty
I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope, got up
into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that
the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water
in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank
of hard sand, or rather earth, and her stern lay lifted
up upon the bank, and her head low almost to the
water: by this means all her quarter was free, and all
that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure
my first work was to search and to see what was
spoiled, and what was free : and first I found that all
the ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the
water; and being very well disposed to eat, I went
to the bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit,
and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no
time to lose. I also found some rum in the great
cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I
had indeed need enough of to spirit me for what was
before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to
furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was
not to be had; and this extremity roused my appli-
cation. We had several spare yards, and two or three
large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in
the ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and
flung as many of them overboard as I could manage
of their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they
might not drive away. When this was done I went
down to the ship's side, and, pulling them to me, I
tied four of them fast together at both ends as well
as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or
three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I
found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was
not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being
too light; so I went to work, and with the carpen-
ter's saw, I cut a spare topmast into three lengths,
and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour
and pains; but hope of furnishing myself with neces-
saries encouraged me to go beyond what I should
have been able to have done upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any rea-
sonable weight; my next care was what to load it
with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from
the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering
this; I first laid all the planks or boards upon it
63
that I could get, and having considered well what I
most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests,
which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered
them down upon my raft. The first of these I filled
with provisions, viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
five pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much
upon, and a little remainder of European corn, which
had been laid by for some fowls which we brought
to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. There had
been some barley and wheat together, but, to my
great disappointment, I found afterwards that the
rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I
found several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and in all
above five or six gallons of rack: these I stowed by
themselves, there being no need to put them into the
chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing
this, I found the tide began to flow, though very calm,
and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and
waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon the sand,
swim away; as for my breeches, which were only
linen, and open knee'd, I swam on board in them
and my stockings: however, this put me upon rum-
maging for clothes, of which I found enough, but
took no more than I wanted for present use, for I
had other things which my eye was more upon; as,
first, tools to work with on shore; and it was after
long searching that I found out the carpenter's chest,
which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much
more valuable than a ship-loading of gold would have
been at that time: I got it down to my raft, even
whole as it was, without losing time to look into it,
for I knew in general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the
great cabin, and two pistols: these I secured first,
with some powder-horns, and a small bag of shot,
and two old rusty swords. I knew there were three
barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them; but with much search
I found them, two of them dry and good, the third
had taken water; those two I got to my raft, with
the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well
freighted, and began to think how I should get to
shore with them, having neither sail, oar, or rudder,
and the least capful of wind would have overset all
my navigation.
I had three encouragements: 1. A smooth, calm
sea; 2. The tide rising and setting in to the shore;
3. What little wind there was blew me towards the
land: and thus, having found two or three broken
oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools
which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe,
and a hammer; and with this cargo I put to sea:
for a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well,
only that I found it drive a little distant from the
place where I had landed before; by which I per-
ceived that there was some indraft of the water,
and consequently I hoped to find some creek or river
there, which I might make use of as a port to get
to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before
me a little opening of the land, and I found a strong
current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as
well as I could to keep in the middle of the stream;
but here I had liked to have suffered a second ship-
6S
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broke my heart; for, knowing nothing of the coast,
my raft run aground at one end of it upon a shoal,
and not being aground at the other end, it wanted
but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards
that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water.
I did my utmost, by setting my back against the
chests, to keep them in their places, but could not
thrust off the raft with all my strength; neither durst
I stir from the posture I was in, but, holding up the
chests with all my might, stood in that manner near
half an hour, in which time the rising of the water
brought me a little more upon a level; and, a little
after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, and
I thrust her off with the oar I had, into the channel;
and then, driving up higher, I at length found myself
in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides,
and a strong current, or tide, running up. I looked
on both sides for a proper place to get on shore; for
I was not willing to be driven too high up the river,
hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and there-
fore resolved to place myself as near the coast as I
could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty,
I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that,
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her
directly in; but here I had liked to have dipped all
my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no
place to land, but where one end of the float, if it
run on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink
lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo
VOL. I. E
again: all that I could do, was to wait till the tide
was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like
an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the shore,
near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the
water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as
I found water enough, for my raft drew about a foot
of water, I thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground,
and there fastened or moored her, by sticking my
two broken oars into the ground; one on one side
near one end, and one on the other side near the other
end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and
left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek
a proper place for my habitation, and where to stow
my goods, to secure them from whatever might
happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on
the continent or on an island, whether inhabited or
not inhabited, whether in danger of wild beasts or
not. There was a hill, not above a mile from me,
which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed
to overtop some other hills which lay as in a ridge
from it northward: I took out one of the fowling-
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder;
and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the
top of that hill; where, after I had with great labour
and difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate to my
great affliction, viz., that I was in an island environed
every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except
some rocks which lay a great way off, and two small
islands less than this, which lay about three leagues
to the west.
I found also, that the island I was in was barren,
and as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited,
67
except by wild beasts, of which, however, I saw none;
yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their
kinds; neither, when I killed them, could I tell what
was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back,
I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree
on the side of a great wood—I believe it was the first
gun that had been fired there since the creation of
the world. I had no sooner fired, but, from all parts
of the wood, there arose an innumerable number of
fowls of many sorts, making a confused screaming,
and crying every one according to his usual note but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As
for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a
hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but had no
talons or claws more than common; its flesh was
carrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day; and what
to do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed
where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the
ground, not knowing but some wild beast might
devour me; though, as I afterwards found, there was
really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of a hut for that night's
lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to
supply myself, except that I had seen two or three
creatures like hares run out of the wood where I shot
the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship, which would be
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging
and sails, and such other things as might come to
land, and I resolved to make another voyage on
board the vessel, if possible; and as I knew that the
first storm that blew must necessarily break her all
in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, till
I got everything out of the ship that I could get.
Then I called a council (that is to say, in my
thoughts) whether I should take back the raft; but
this appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go as
before, when the tide was down, and I did so, only
that I stripped before I went from my hut, having
nothing on but a checked shirt and a pair of linen
trousers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared
a second raft; and having had experience of the
first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it
so hard, but yet I brought away several things very
useful to me; as first, in the carpenter's stores, I
found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a
great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and,
above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone:
all these I secured, together with several things be-
longing to the gunner, particularly two or three iron-
crows, and two barrels of musket-bullets, seven mus-
kets, and another fowling-piece, with some small
quantity of powder more; a large bag full of small
shot, and a great roll of sheet lead; but this last was
so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the
ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes
that I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, hammock,
and some bedding; and with this I loaded my
69
second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to
my very great comfort.
I was under some apprehensions, during my ab-
sence from the land, that at least my provisions
might be devoured on shore; but when I came back,
I found no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature,
like a wild cat, upon one of the chests, which, when
I came towards it, ran away a little distance, and
then stood still; she sat very composed and un-
concerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had
a mind to be acquainted with me; I presented my
gun at her, but as she did not understand it, she was
perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir
away; upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit,
though, by the way, I was not very free of it, for my
store was not great: however, I spared her a bit, I
say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and ate it, and
looked as pleased for more; but I thanked her, and
could spare no more; so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore, though I
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
casks, I went to work to make me a little tent, with
the sail and some poles which I cut for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought everything that I knew
would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled all
the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the
tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either
from man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of
the tent with some boards within, and an empty
chest set up on end without, and spreading one of
the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just
at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went
to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all
night, for I was very weary and heavy; as the night
before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard
all day, as well to fetch all those things from the
ship, as to get them on shore.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that
ever were laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was
not satisfied still; for while the ship sat upright in
that posture, I thought I ought to get everything
out of her that I could; so every day, at low water,
I went on board, and brought away something or
other; but particularly the third time I went, I
brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as
also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get,
with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the
sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder:
in a word, I brought away all the sails first and
last, only that I was fain to cut them in pieces,
and bring as much at a time as I could; for they
were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas
only.
But that which comforted me more still, was, that
at last of all, after I had made five or six such
voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more
to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling
with; I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead
of bread, and three large runlets of rum or spirits,
and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this
was surprising to me, because I had given over ex-
pecting any more provisions, except what was spoiled
by the water: I soon emptied the hogshead of that
bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in 'pieces
71
of the sails, which I cut out; and, in a word, I got
all this safe on shore also.
The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable and
fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and cutting
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I
got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the
iron-work I could get; and having cut down the
spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and everything
I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those
heavy goods, and came away; but my good luck
began now to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy
and so overladen, that after I had entered the little
cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods, not
being able to guide it so handily as I did the other,
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the
water. As for myself, it was no great harm, for I
was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great
part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected
would have been of great use to me: however, when
the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable
ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite
labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the water;
a work which fatigued me very much. After this,
I went every day on board, and brought away what
I could get.
I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had
been eleven times on board the ship; in which time
I had brought away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed capable to bring, though I believe
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have
brought away the whole ship, piece by piece: but,
preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found
the wind began to rise; however, at low water I
went on board, and though I thought I had rum-
maged the cabin so effectually, as that nothing more
could be found, yet I discovered a locker with
drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three
razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten
or a dozen of good knives and forks; in another I
found about thirty-six pounds value in money, some
European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight,
some gold, some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. "O
drug!" said I aloud, " what art thou good for? thou
art not worth to me, no, not the taking off of the
ground; one of those knives is worth all this heap;
I have no manner of use for thee; even remain where
thou art, and go to the bottom, as a creature whose
life is not worth saving." However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another
raft; but while I was preparing this, I found the sky
overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter
of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It
presently occurred to me that it was in vain to pre-
tend to make a raft with the wind off shore, and that
it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the
shore at all: accordingly, I let myself down into the
water, and swam across the channel which lay between
the ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty
enough, partly with the weight of things I had about
me, and partly the roughness of the water, for the
wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high
water, it blew a storm.

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I
lay with all my wealth about me very secure. It blew
very hard all that night, and in the morning, when I
looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen! I
was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this
satisfactory reflection, viz., that I had lost no time,
nor abated no diligence, to get everything out of her
that could be useful to me, and that indeed there was
little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I
had had more time.
I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or
of anything out of her, except what might drive on
shore from her wreck, as, indeed, divers pieces of her
afterwards did; but those things were of small use to
me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about
securing myself against either savages, if any should
appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the island; and
I had many thoughts of the method how to do this,
and what kind of dwelling to make; whether I should
make me a cave in the earth, or a hut upon the earth:
and, in short, I resolved upon both, the manner and
description of which it may not be improper to give
an account of.
I soon found the place I was in was not for my
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low
moorish ground near the sea, and I believed would
not be wholesome, and more particularly because
there was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to find
a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.
I consulted several things in my situation, which I
found would be proper for me: 1st, Health, and fresh
water I just now mentioned. 2dly, Shelter from
the heat of the sun. 3dly, Security from ravenous
creatures, whether man or beast. 4thly, A view
to the sea, that, if God sent any ship in sight, I
might not lose any advantage for my deliverance,
of which I was not willing to banish all my expec-
tation yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards
this little plain was steep as a house-side, so that
nothing could come down upon me from the top: on
the side of this rock there was a hollow place worn a
little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave, but
there was not really any cave or way into the rock at
all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was
not above an hundred yards broad, and about twice
as long, and lay like a green before my door, and
at the end of it descended irregularly every way
down into the low grounds by the sea-side. It was
on the north-north-west side of the hill, so that I was
sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a
west and by south sun, or thereabouts, which in those
countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle
before the hollow place, which took in about ten
yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and
twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning
and ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of
the ground about five foot and a half, and sharpened
75
at the top: the two rows did not stand above six
inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship, and laid them in rows one upon another,
within the circle between these two rows of stakes,
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside,
leaning against them, about two foot and a half
high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so
strong, that neither man nor beast could get into
it, or over it: this cost me a great deal of time
and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods,
bring them to the place, and drive them into the
earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not by
a door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top:
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me:
and so I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as
I thought from all the world, and consequently
slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could
not have done, though, as it appeared afterward,
there was no need of all this caution from the
enemies that I apprehended danger from.
Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores, of which you have the account above;
and I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me
from the rains, that in one part of the year are very
violent there, I made double, viz., one smaller tent
within, and one larger tent above it, and covered
the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed
which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged
to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and
everything that would spoil by the wet; and having
thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance,
which till now I had left open, and so passed and
repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way
into the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones
that I dug down, out through my tent, I laid them
up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, that
so it raised the ground within about a foot and a
half; and thus I made a cave just behind my tent,
which served me like a cellar to my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before
all these things were brought to perfection; and
therefore I must go back to some other things,
which took up some of my thoughts. At the same
time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for
the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that
a storm oPrain falling from a thick dark cloud,
a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that
a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of
it. I was not so much surprised with the lightning,
as I was with a thought which darted into my mind
as swift as the lightning itself: O my powder! my
very heart sunk within me, when I thought that
at one blast all my powder might be destroyed;
on which, not my defence only, but the providing
me food, as I thought, entirely depended: I was
nothing near so anxious about my own danger;
though had the powder took fire, I had never known
who had hurt me.
77
Such impression did this make upon me, that,
after the storm was over, I laid aside all my works,
my building, and fortifying, and applied myself to
make bags and boxes to separate the powder, and
to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope
that, whatever might come, it might not all take fire
at once, and to keep it so apart, that it should not
be possible to make one part fire another. I finished
this work in about a fortnight; and I think my
powder, which in all was about two hundred and
forty pounds weight, was divided in not less than a
hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been
wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that, so
I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I
called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down
in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come
to it, marking very carefully where I laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I
went out once at least every day with my gun, as
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any-
thing fit for food, and as near as I could to acquaint
myself with what the island produced. The first
time I went out, I presently discovered that there
were goats in the island, which was a great satis-
faction to me; but then it was attended with this
misfortune to me, viz., that they were so shy, so
subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most dif-
ficult thing in the world to come at them. But I
was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I
might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened;
for, after I had found their haunts a little, I laid
wait in this manner for them: I observed, if they
saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the
rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright;
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
whence I concluded, that, by the position of their
optics, their sight was so directed downward, that
they did not readily see objects that were above them:
so afterward I took this method; I always climbed
the rocks first to get above them, and then had fre-
quently a fair mark. The first shot I made among
these creatures I killed a she-goat, which had a
little kid by her which she gave suck to, which
grieved me heartily; but when the old one fell, the
kid stood stock still by her till I came and took her
up; and not only so, but when I carried the old
one with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed
me quite to my enclosure; upon which I laid down
the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and carried
it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame;
but it would not eat; so I was forced to kill it, and
eat it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a
great while, for I ate sparingly, and saved my pro-
visions (my bread especially) as much as possibly I
could.
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it ab-
solutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire
in, and fuel to burn; and what I did for that, as also
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I
made, I shall give a full account of in its place; but
I must first give some little account of myself, and
of my thoughts about living, which, it may well be
supposed, were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as
I was not cast away upon that island without being
79
driven, as is said, by a violent storm, quite out of
the course of our intended voyage, and a great way,
viz., some hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary
course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason
to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that, in
this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I
should end my life. The tears would run plentifully
down my face when I made these reflections; and
sometimes I would expostulate with myself, why
Providence should thus completely ruin His creatures,
and render them so absolutely miserable, so without
help abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could
hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me to
check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and par-
ticularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand
by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the subject
of my present condition, when reason, as it were,
expostulating with me the other way, thus: "Well,
you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but pray
remember, where are the rest of you? Did not you
come eleven of you into the boat? Where are the
ten? Why were they not saved, and you lost?
Why were you singled out? Is it better to be here
or there?" And then I pointed to the sea. All
evils are to be considered with the good that is in
them, and with what worse attended them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
furnished for my subsistence, and what would have
been my case if it had not happened, which was an
hundred thousand to one, that the ship floated from
the place where she first struck, and was driven so
near the shore, that I had time to get all these
things out of her. What would have been my case,
if I had been to have lived in the condition in which
I at first came on shore, without necessaries of life,
or necessaries to supply and procure them ?" par-
ticularly," said I (loud, though to myself), "what
should I have done without a gun, without ammuni-
tion, without any tools to make anything, or to work
with; without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner
of covering?" and that now I had all these to a
sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
myself in such a manner, as to live without my gun
when my ammunition was spent; so that I had a
tolerable view of subsisting, without any want, as
long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning,
how I should provide for the accidents that might
happen, and for the time that was to come, even not
only after my ammunition should be spent, but even
after my health or strength should decay.
I confess I had not entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean
my powder being blown up by lightning; and this
made the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it
lightened and thundered, as I observed just now.
And now, being about to enter into a melancholy
relation of a scene of silent life, such perhaps as was
never heard of in the world before, I shall take it
from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It
was, by my account, the 3Oth of September, when,
in the manner as above said, I first set foot upon
this horrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its
autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head;
for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the
latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north of the Line.
81
After I had been there about ten or twelve days it came into my thoughts, that I should lose my
reckoning of time for want of books and pen and
ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from
the working days; but, to prevent this, I cut it with
my knife upon a large post, in capital letters, and
making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore
where I first landed, viz., "I came on shore here on
the 30th of September 1659." Upon the sides of
this square post, I cut every day a notch with my
knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as
the rest, and every first day of the month as long
again as that long one; and thus I kept my calendar,
or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place, we are to observe, that among
the many things which I brought out of the ship in
the several voyages which, as above-mentioned, I
made to it, I got several things of less value, but
not all less useful to me, which I omitted setting
down before; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper,
several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and
carpenter's keeping, three or four compasses, some
mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts,
and books of navigation; all which I huddled to-
gether, whether I might want them or no. Also, I
found three very good Bibles, which came to me in
my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things; some Portuguese books also, and
among them two or three Popish prayer-books, and
several other books; all which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget that we had in the ship a dog
and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have
occasion to say something in its place; for I carried VOL. I. F
both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped
out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and
was a trusty servant to me many years; I wanted
nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company
that he could make up to me; I only wanted to have
him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I ob-
served before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I
husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall show,
that while my ink lasted I kept things very exact;
but after that was gone I could not, for I could not
make any ink by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all that I had amassed to-
gether; and of these, this of ink was one, as also
spade, pickaxe, and shovel, to dig or remove the
earth; needles, pins, and thread. As for linen, I
soon learnt to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded habita-
tion: the piles, or stakes, which were as heavy as I
could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre-
paring in the woods, and more by far in bringing
home; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting
and bringing home one of these posts, and a third day
in driving it into the ground; for which purpose I got
a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought
myself of one of the iron crows, which, however, though
I found it, yet it made driving those posts or piles
very laborious and tedious work.
But what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of anything I had to do, seeing I had
83
time enough to do it in? Nor had I any other em-
ployment, if that had been over, at least that I could
foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food,
which I did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstances I was reduced to, and I drew
up the state of my affairs in writing, not so much to
leave them to any that were to come after me (for
I was like to have but few heirs), as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflicting
my mind; and as my reason began now to master
my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well
as I could, and to set the good against the evil, that
I might have something to distinguish my case from
worse; and I stated it very impartially, like debtor
and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the
miseries I suffered, thus:
Evil.
I am cast upon a hor-
rible desolate island, void
of all hope of recovery.
I am singled out and
separated, as it were,
from all the world, to be
miserable.
I am divided from
mankind, a solitaire, one
banished from human
society.
Good.
But I am alive, and not
drowned, as all my ship's
company was.
But I am singled out
too from all the ship's
crew to be spared from
death; and He that mira-
culously saved me from
death, can deliver me
from this condition.
But I am not starved
and perishing on a bar-
ren place, affording no
sustenance.
I have not clothes to
cover me.
I am without any de-
fence, or means to resist
any violence of man or
beast.
I have no soul to speak
to, or relieve me.
But I am in a hot cli-
mate, where, if I had
clothes, I could hardly
wear them.
But I am cast on an
island, where I see no
wild beasts to hurt me,
as I saw on the coast of
Africa: and what if I
had been shipwrecked
there?
But God wonderfully
sent the ship in near
enough to the shore, that
I have gotten out so
many necessary things as
will either supply my
wants, or enable me to
supply myself even as
long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony,
that there was scarce any condition in the world so
miserable, but there was something negative or some-
thing positive to be thankful for in it; and let this
stand as a direction from the experience of the most
miserable of all conditions in this world, that we may
always find in it something to comfort ourselves from,
and to set in the description of good and evil, on the
credit side of the account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my
condition, and given over looking out to sea, to see
if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over these things,
I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of
living, and to make things as easy to me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which was
a tent, under the side of a rock, surrounded with a
strong pale of posts and cables; but I might now
rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up
against it of turfs, about two foot thick on the outside;
and after some time, I think it was a year and a half,
I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and
thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such
things as I could get to keep out the rain, which I
found at some times of the year very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had
made behind me; but I must observe, too, that at
first this was a confused heap of goods, which as
they lay in no order, so they took up all my place:
I had no room to turn myself; so I set myself to
enlarge my cave and works farther into the earth;
for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to
the labour I bestowed on it; and so when I found I
was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked side-
ways to the right hand into the rock; and then,
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and
made me a door to come out, on the outside of my
pale, or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it
were a back-way to my tent and to my storehouse,
but gave me room to stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu-
larly a chair and a table; for without these I was not
able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I
could not write or eat, or do several things with so
much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs observe,
that as reason is the substance and original of the
mathematics, so, by stating and squaring everything
by reason, and by making the most rational judg-
ment of things, every man may be in time master of
every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in
my life, and yet in time, by labour, application, and
contrivance, I found at last that I wanted nothing
but I could have made it, especially if I had had tools; however, I made abundance of things, even
without tools, and some with no more tools than an
adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made
that way before, and that with infinite labour; for
example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way
but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me,
and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had
brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it
smooth with my adze. It is true, by this method I
could make but one board out of a whole tree; but
this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than
I had for the prodigious deal of time and labour which
it took me up to make a plank or board; but my
time or labour was little worth, and so it was as well
employed one way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
served above, in the first place; and this I did out of
the short pieces of boards that I brought on my raft
from the ship; but when I had wrought out some
boards, as above, I made large shelves of the breadth
of a foot and a half one over another, all along one
side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron
37
work, and, in a word, to separate everything at large
in their places, that I might come easily at them. I
knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my
guns, and all things that would hang up.
So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things; and
I had everything so ready at my hand, that it was a
great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such
order, and especially to find my stock of all neces-
saries so great.
And now it was that I began to keep a journal of
every day's employment; for indeed at first I was in
too much a hurry; and not only hurry as to labour,
but in too much discomposure of mind, and my
journal would have been full of many dull things.
For example, I must have said thus: Sept. the 30th,
after I got to shore, and had escaped drowning,
instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited with the great quantity of salt
water which was gotten into my stomach, and re-
covering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wring-
ing my hands, and beating my head and face,
exclaiming at my misery, and crying out, "I was
undone, undone!" till tired and faint, I was forced
to lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not
sleep for fear of being devoured.
Some days after this, and after I had been on board
the ship, and got all that I could out of her, yet I
could not forbear getting up to the top of a little
mountain, and looking out to sea in hopes of seeing
a ship; then fancy, at a vast distance, I spied a sail;
please myself with the hopes of it; and then, after
looking steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite,
and sit down and weep like a child, and thus increase
my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things in some mea-
sure, and having settled my household stuffand habita-
tion, made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome
about me as I could, I began to keep my journal, of
which I shall here give you the copy (though in it
will be told all these particulars over again) as long
as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I was forced to
leave it off.
CHAPTER V.
/ BEGIN TO KEEP A JOURNAL — CHRISTEN MY DESERT ISLAND THE ISLAND OF DESPAIR FALL UPON VARIOUS SCHEMES TO MAKE TOOLS, BASKETS, &>C.,
AND BEGIN TO BUILD MY HOUSE AT A GREAT LOSS OF AN EVENING FOR CANDLE, BUT FALL UPON
AN EXPEDIENT TO SUPPLY THE WANT—STRANGE DISCOVERY OF CORN A TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKE, AND STORM.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30, 1659.
I, POOR miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm in the offing, came
on shore on this dismal unfortunate island, which I
called the Island of Despair; all the rest of the ship's
company being drowned, and myself almost dead.
All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself
89
at the dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz., I
had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, or place to
fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw nothing but
death before me, either that I should be devoured by
wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death
for want of food. At the approach of night I slept
in a tree, for fear of wild creatures, but slept soundly,
though it rained all night.
October i. In the morning I saw, to my great sur-
prise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and
was driven on shore again much nearer the island;
which, as it was some comfort on one hand, for, seeing
her sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if
the wind abated, I might get on board, and get some
food and necessaries out of her for my relief; so, on
the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my
comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on
board, might have saved the ship, or at least that
they would not have been all drowned, as they were;
and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps
have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to
have carried us to some other part of the world. I
spent great part of this day in perplexing myself on
these things; but at length, seeing the ship almost
dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and
then swam on board. This day also it continued
raining, though with no wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in many several voyages to get
all I could out of the ship, which I brought on
shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain
also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I
had got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the
things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them
when the tide was out.
Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with
some gusts of wind; during which time the ship
broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be seen, except the
wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent
this day in covering and securing the goods which
I had saved, that rain might not spoil them.
Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all
day, to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly
concerned to secure myself from any attack in the
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards
night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a semicircle for my encampment, which
I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or forti-
fication, made of double piles, lined within with cable
and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the
island with my gun, to see for some food, and dis-
cover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and
her kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed
also, because it would not feed.
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and
lay there for the first night, making it as large as I
could, with stakes driven in to swing my hammock
upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and
9'
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with
them formed a fence round me, a little within the
place I had marked out for my fortification.
Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In
the afternoon went to work to make me a table.
Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times
of work; of going out with my gun, time of sleep,
and time of diversion; viz., every morning I walked
out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did
not rain, then employed myself to work till about
eleven o'clock, then ate what I had to live on, and
from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather
being excessive hot, and then in the evening to work
again: the working part of this day and of the next
were wholly employed in making my table; for I was
yet but a very sorry workman, though time and neces-
sity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after,
as I believe it would do any one else.
Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty soft,
but her flesh good for nothing; every creature I
killed I took off the skins, and preserved them.—
Coming back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of
sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was sur-
prised, and almost frighted, with two or three seals,
which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what
they were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that
time.
Nov. 6. After my morning walk, I went to work
with my table again, and finished it, though not to
my liking; nor was it long before I learned to mend
it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the
nth was Sunday), I took wholly up to make me a
chair, and, with much ado, brought it to a tolerable
shape, but never to please me; and even in the
making, I pulled it in pieces several times. Note—
I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for omitting
my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was
which.
Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was ac-
companied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frighted me dreadfully for fear of my powder: as
soon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock
of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that
it might not be in danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in
making little square chests or boxes, which might
hold about a pound, or two pound at most, of powder;
and so putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as
secure and remote from one another as possible. On
one of these three days I killed a large bird that was
good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my
tent into the rock, to make room for my further con-
veniency. Note—Three things I wanted exceedingly
for this work, viz., a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheel-
barrow or basket; so I desisted from my work, and
began to consider how to supply that want, and make
me some tools: as for a pickaxe, I made use of the
iron-crows, which were proper enough, though heavy;
but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this was
so absolutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing
93.
effectually without it; but what kind of one to make
I knew not.
Nov. 18. The next day in searching the woods,
I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the
Brazils they call the Iron Tree, for its exceeding
hardness: of this, with great labour, and almost
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home
too with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding
heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this ma-
chine; for I worked it effectually by little and little
into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle ex-
actly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom,
it would not last me so long; however, it served
well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put
it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made after
that fashion, or so long a-making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a
wheel-barrow; a basket I could not make by any
means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker-ware, at least none yet found
out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of,
neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I
had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for
the spindle, or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave
it over; and so, for carrying away the earth which
I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the labourers carry mortar in when they serve
the bricklayers.
This was not so difficult to me as the making the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt
which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took
me up no less than four days, I mean always except-
ing my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom
failed; and very seldom failed also bringing home
something to eat.
Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were
finished I went on, and working every day, as my
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
might hold my goods commodiously.
Note—During all this time, I worked to make this
room, or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as
a warehouse, or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room,
and a cellar: as for my lodging, I kept to the tent,
except that sometimes in the wet season of the year,
it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry,
which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
within my pale with long poles in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and load them with flags
and large leaves of trees like a thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my cave or
vault finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell down
from the top and one side, so much that, in short, it
frighted me, and not without reason too; for if I
had been under it, I had never wanted a grave-digger.
Upon this disaster I had a great deal of work to do
over again; for I had the loose earth to carry out,
and which was of more importance, I had the ceiling
to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would
come down.
95
Dec. II. This day I went to work with it ac-
cordingly, and got two shores, or posts, pitched
upright to the top, with two pieces of boards across
over each post; this I finished the next day; and
setting more posts up with boards, in about a week
more I had the roof secured; and the posts, stand-
ing in rows, served me for partitions to part off my
house.
Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I placed
shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts to hang
everything up that could be hung up; and now I
began to be in some order within doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carried everything into the cave,
and began to furnish my house, and set up some
pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my victuals
upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me:
also I made me another table.
Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no
stirring out.
Dec. 25. Rain all day.
Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler
than before, and pleasanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another,
so that I caught it, and led it home in a string; when
I had it home, I bound and splintered up its leg,
which was broke. N. B.—I took such care of it, that
it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong as ever;
but by nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed upon
the little green at my door, and would not go away.
This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding 'up some tame creatures, that I might
have food when my powder and shot was all spent. Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats, and no breeze; so
that there was no stirring abroad, except in the
evening for food. This time I spent in putting all
my things in order within doors.
January I. Very hot still; but I went abroad
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the
middle of the day. This evening going farther into
the valleys, which lay towards the centre of the
island, I found there was plenty of goats, though
exceeding shy and hard to come at; however, I
resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt
them down.
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day I went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was mis-
taken, for they all faced about upon the dog: and
he knew his danger too well; for he would not come
near them.
Jan. 3. I began my fence, or wall, which, being
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I
resolved to make very thick and strong.
N.B.—This wall being described before, I pur-
posely omit what was said in the Journal; it is
sufficient to observe, that I was no less time,
than from the 3d of January to the I4th of
April, working, finishing, and perfecting this
wall, though it was no more than about twenty-
four yards in length, being a half-circle, from
one place in the rock to another place about
eight yards from it, the door of the cave being
in the centre behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hin-
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks to-
gether; but I thought I should never be perfectly
97
secure, until this wall was finished; and it is scarce
credible what inexpressible labour everything was
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the
woods, and driving them into the ground; for I
made them much bigger than I need to have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside
double fenced with a turf wall raised up close to it,
I persuaded myself that if any people were to come
on shore there, they would not perceive anything
like a habitation; and it was very well I did so, as
may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable
occasion.
During this time, I made my rounds in the woods
for game, every day, when the rain admitted me,
and made frequent discoveries, in these walks, of
something or other to my advantage; particularly,
I found a kind of wild pigeons, who built not as
wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons,
in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame; and
did so: but when they grew older, they flew away,
which perhaps was at first for want of feeding
them; for I had nothing to give them. However, I
frequently found their nests, and got their young
ones, which were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs,
I found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at first it was impossible for me to make, as
indeed as to some of them it was; for instance, I
could never make a cask to be hooped. I had a
small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I could
never arrive to the capacity of making one by them,
though I spent many weeks about it; I could neither
VOL. I. G
put in the heads, or joint the staves so true to one
another, as to make them hold water, so I gave
that also over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle,
so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was
generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to
bed. I remembered the lump of bees'-wax with which
I made candles in my African adventure; but I had
none of that now. The only remedy I had, was,
that when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow,
and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked
in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum,
I made me a lamp; and this gave me a light, though
not a clear, steady light like a candle. In the middle
of all my labours, it happened, that rummaging my
things, I found a little bag which, as I hinted before,
had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry,
not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when
the ship came from Lisbon. What little remainder
of corn had been in the bag was all devoured with
the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and
dust; and being willing to have the bag for some
other use, I think it was to put powder in, when I
divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use,
I shook the husks of corn out of it, on one side of my
fortification, under the rock.
It was a little before the great rains just now men-
tioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice
of anything, and not so much as remembering that I
had thrown anything there; when about a month
after, or thereabout, I saw some few stalks of some-
thing green shooting out of the ground, which I
fancied might be some plant I had not seen; but I
99
was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after
a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears
come out, which were perfect green barley, of the
same kind as our European, nay, as our English
barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion. I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all.
Indeed I had very few notions of religion in my
head, or had entertained any sense of anything that
had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as
we lightly say, what pleases God; without so much
as inquiring into the end of Providence in these
things, or His order in governing events in the world.
But after I saw barley grow there, in a climate
which I knew was not proper for corn, and especially
that I knew not how it came there, it startled me
strangely, and I began to suggest that God had
miraculously caused this grain to grow, without any
help of seed sown; and that it was so directed purely
for my sustenance on that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears
out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself that
such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my
account; and this was the more strange to me, be-
cause I saw near it still, all along by the side of the
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to
be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had
seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions
of Providence for my support, but not doubting but
that there was more in the place, I went all over that
part of the island, where I had been before, peeping
in every corner, and under every rock, to see for more
of it; but I could not find any. At last it occurred
to my thought that I had shook a bag of chickens'
meat out in that place, and then the wonder began
to cease; and I must confess, my religious thankful-
ness to God's providence began to abate too, upon
discovering that all this was nothing but what was
common, though I ought to have been as thankful for
so strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had
been miraculous; for it was really the work of Provi-
dence, as to me, that should order or appoint ten or
twelve grains of corn to remain unspoiled, when the
rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been
dropped from heaven : as also, that I should throw it
out in that particular place, where, it being in the
shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately;
whereas, if I had thrown it anywhere else at that time,
it had been burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of corn, you may be sure,
in their season, which was about the end of June, and,
laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again,
hoping in time to have some quantity sufficient to
supply me with bread; but it was not till the fourth
year that I could allow myself the least grain of this
corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall
say afterwards in its order; for I lost all that I sowed
the first season, by not observing the proper time;
for I sowed it just before the dry season, so that it
never came up at all, at least not as it would have
done: of which in its place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the same kind, or to
101
the same purpose, viz., to'make me bread, or rather
food; for I found ways to cook it up without baking,
though I did that also after some time. But to return
to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four months
to get my wall done; and the I4th of April I closed
it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door, but over
the wall by a ladder, that there might be no sign, in
the outside, of my habitation.
April 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up with
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me,
and let it down on the inside; this was a complete
enclosure to me, for within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from without, unless it
could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was finished, I
had almost had all my labour overthrown at once
and myself killed. The case was thus: As I was
busy in the inside of it behind my tent, just in the
entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with
a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for on a
sudden I found the earth come crumbling down from
the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill,
over my head, and two of the posts I had set up in
the cave cracked in a frightful manner: I was heartily
scared, but thought nothing of what was really the
cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was
falling in, as some of it had done before; and for fear
I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder,
and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over
my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill, which I ex-
pected might roll down upon me. I was no sooner
stepped down upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw
it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood
on shook three times at about eight minutes' distance,
with three such shocks, as would have overturned the
strongest building that could be supposed to have
stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of
a rock, which stood about half a mile from me, next
the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise as I never
heard in all my life: I perceived also the very sea
was [put into violent motion by it; and I believe the
shocks were stronger under the water than on the
island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, or discoursed with any one that had, that
I was like one dead or stupefied; and the motion of
the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was
tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling of the rock
awaked me, as it were, and rousing me from the
stupefied condition I was in, filled me with horror,
and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling
upon my tent and all my household goods, and bury-
ing all at once; and thus sunk my very soul within
me a second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no more
for some time, I began to take courage; and yet I
had not heart enough to get over my wall again,
for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon
the ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not
knowing what to do. All this while I had not the
least serious religious thought, nothing but the
common "Lord, have mercy upon me 1" and when it
was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and
grow cloudy, as if it would rain; soon after that the
103
wind rose by little and little, so that in less than
half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane: the
sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and
froth, the shore was covered with the breach of the
water, the trees were torn up by the roots, and a
terrible storm it was; and this held about three
hours, and then began to abate, and in two hours
more it was stark calm, and began to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected, when on a sudden it came
into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture into
my cave again: with this thought my spirits began
to revive, and the rain also helping to persuade me,
I went in and sat down in my tent; but the rain
was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten
down with it; and I was forced to go into my cave,
though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it
should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz.,
to cut a hole through my new fortification like a
sink, to let water go out, which would else have
drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave
some time, and found still no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed;
and now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted
it very much, I went to my little store, and took a
small cup of rum, which, however, I did then, and
always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no
more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great part
of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad;
but my mind being more composed, I began to
think of what I had best do, concluding that if the
island was subject to these earthquakes, there would
be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider
of building me some little hut in an open place,
which I might surround with a wall as I had done
here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts
or men: but concluded, if I stayed where I was, I
should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my
tent from the place where it stood, which was just
under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which,
if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon
my tent. And I spent the two next days, being the
19th and 2Oth of April, in contriving where and how
to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me
that I never slept in quiet, and yet the apprehen-
sion of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost
equal to it; but still, when I looked about, and saw
how everything was put in order, how pleasantly
concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made
me very loath to remove.
In the meantime, it occurred to me that it would
require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and
that I must be contented to run the venture where I
was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had
secured it so as to remove to it. So, with this re-
solution, I composed myself for a time, and resolved
that I would go to work with all speed, to build me
a wall with piles and cables,'&c, in a circle as be-
fore; and set my tent up in it when it was finished,
but that I would venture to stay where I was till
it was finished, and fit to remove to. This was the
2 1 St.
April 22. The next morning I began to consider
of means to put this resolve in execution, but I was
at a great loss about my tools. I had three large
axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the
hatchets for traffic with the Indians), but with much
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were
all full of notches and dull; and though I had a
grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools
too: this cost me as much thought as a statesman
would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or
a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length
I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my
foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty.
Note—I had never seen any such thing in England,
or at least not to take notice how it was done, though
since I have observed it very common there; besides
that, my grindstone was very large and heavy. This
machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to
perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in
grinding my tools, my machine for turning my grind-
stone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, now I took a survey of it, and re-
duced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made
my heart very heavy.
CHAPTER VI.
OBSERVE THE SHIP DRIVEN FURTHER AGROUND BY THE
LATE STORM PROCURE A VAST QUANTITY OF
NECESSARIES FROM THE WRECK—CATCH A LARGE
TURTLE / FALL ILL OF A FEVER AND AGUE— TERRIBLE DREAM, AND SERIOUS REFLECTIONS THEREUPON FIND A BIBLE IN ONE OF THE SEAMEN'S CHESTS THROWN ASHORE, THE READING
WHEREOF GIVES ME GREAT COMFORT. >
May i. In the morning, looking towards the sea-
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the
shore bigger than ordinary; and it looked like a cask.
When I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two
or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were
driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie
higher out of the water than it used to do. I exa-
mined the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon
found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken
water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone;
however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present,
and went on upon the sands as near as I could to the
wreck of the ship, to look for more.
When I came down to the ship I found it strangely
removed; the forecastle, which lay before buried in
sand, was heaved up at least six foot; and the stern,
which was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest
by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging
her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side,
and the sand was thrown so high on that side next
107
her stern, that whereas there was a great place of
water before, so that I could not come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I
was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded
it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this
violence the ship was more broken open than for-
merly, so many things came daily on shore which the
sea had loosened, and which the winds and water
rolled by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design
of removing my habitation; and I busied myself
mightily, that day especially, in searching whether
I could make any way into the ship; but I found
nothing was to be expected of that kind, for that
all the inside of the ship was choked up with
sand; however, as I had learnt not to despair of
anything, I resolved to pull everything to pieces
that I could of the ship, concluding that every-
thing I could get from her would be of some use
or other to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of
a beam through, which I thought held some of the
upper part or quarter-deck together, and when I
had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well
as I could from the side which lay highest; but the
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that
time.
May 4. I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish
that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when
just going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I
had made me along line of some rope-yarn, but I had
no hooks, yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much
as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun, and
ate them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir planks off from
the decks, which I tied together, and made swim on
shore when the tide of flood came on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron work;
worked very hard, and came home very much tired,
and had thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to work, but found the weight of the
wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut,
that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose,
and the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could
see into it, but almost full of water and sand.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite
clear of water or sand; I wrenched open two planks,
and brought them on shore also with the tide: I left
the iron crow in the wreck for next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt several
casks, and loosened them with the crow, but could
not break them up: I felt also the roll of English
lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy to re-
move.
May 10, II, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber, and
boards, or plank, and two or three hundred weight
of iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could
not cut a piece of the roll of lead, by placing the edge
109
of one hatchet, and driving it with the other; but as
it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could
not make any blow to drive the hatchet.
May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the force of the
water; but I stayed so long in the woods to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going
to the wreck that day.
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown
on shore at a great distance, near two miles off me,
but resolved to see what they were, and found it
was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to
bring away.
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on the
wreck, and, with hard labour, I loosened some things
so much with the crow, that the first flowing tide
several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's
chests; but the wind blowing from the shore, no-
thing came to land that day but pieces of timber,
and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it,
but the salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of
June, except the time necessary to get food, which
I always appointed, during this part of my employ-
ment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be
ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time I
had gotten timber, and plank, and iron work enough
to have built a good boat, if I had known how; and
also I got at several times, and in several pieces,
near one hundred-weight of the sheet-lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a
large tortoise, or turtle: this was the first I had seen,
which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any
defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day, as I found after-
wards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle; I found
in her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I
tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats
and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.
June 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within.
I thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which I knew was not usual in
that latitude.
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
had been cold.
June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in my
head, and feverish.
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with
the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick,
and no help. Prayed to God, for the first time since
the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or
why; my thoughts being all confused.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful
apprehensions of sickness.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering,
and then a violent headache.
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after
it.
June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak; however,
I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty, got it
111
home, and broiled some of it, and ate; I would fain
have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no
pot.
June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay
a-bed all day, and neither ate nor drank. I was ready
to perish for thirst, but so weak I had not strength
to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink.
Prayed to God again, but was light headed; and
when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not
what to say; only I lay, and cried, "Lord, look upon
me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!" I
suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours,
till the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake
till far in the night; when I waked, I found myself
much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty;
however, as I had no water in my whole habitation,
I was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep
again. In this second sleep I had this terrible
dream.
I thought that I was sitting on the ground on the
outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend
from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire,
and light upon the ground. He was all over as
bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to
look towards him; his countenance was most inex-
pressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe;
when he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I
thought the earth trembled, just as it had done
before in the earthquake, and all the air looked to
my apprehension as if it had been filled with flashes
of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
I
moved forward towards me, with a long spear, or
weapon, in his hand to kill me; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible
to express the terror of it; all that I can say I un-
derstood was this:—" Seeing all these things have
not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;"
at which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that
was in his hand to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will ex-
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors
of my soul at this terrible vision; I mean that even
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those hor-
rors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind, when I
awaked and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge. What I had
received by the good instruction of my father was
then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight
years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant con-
versation with nothing but such as were, like myself,
wicked and profane to the last degree. I do not
remember that I had, in all that time, one thought
that so much as tended either to looking upwards
towards God, or inwards towards a reflection upon
my own ways. But a certain stupidity of soul, with-
out desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely
overwhelmed me, and I was all that the most har-
dened, unthinking, wicked creature among our com-
mon sailors can be supposed to be, not having the
least sense, either of the fear of God in danger, or of
thankfulness to God in deliverances.
In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when I shall
add, that through all the variety of miseries that
had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as
one thought of it being the hand of God, or that it
was a just punishment for my sin; my rebellious
behaviour against my father, or my present sins,
which were great, or so much as a punishment for
the general course of my wicked life. When I was
on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of
Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what
would become of me, or one wish to God to direct
me whither I should go, or to keep me from the
danger which apparently surrounded me, as well
from voracious creatures as cruel savages; but I
was merely thoughtless of a God, or a Providence;
acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature,
and by the dictates of common sense only, and in-
deed hardly that.
When I was delivered, and taken up at sea by the
Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not
the least thankfulness in my thoughts. When again
I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drown-
ing on this island, I was as far from remorse, or
looking on it as a judgment; I only said to myself
often that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be
always miserable.
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found
all my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was
surprised with a kind of ecstacy, and some transports
of soul, which, had the grace of God assisted, might
have come up to true thankfulness; but it ended where
it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may
VOL. I. H
say, being glad I was alive, without the least reflecJ"
tion upon the distinguishing goodness of the Hand
which had preserved me, and had singled me out to
be preserved, when all the rest were destroyed; or
an inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful
to me: even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after they have got safe on
shore from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the
next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it
is over; and all the rest of my life was like it.
Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration,
made sensible of my condition, how I was cast on
this dreadful place, out of the reach of human kind,
out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption,
as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and that I
should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense
of my affliction wore off, and I began to be very
easy, applied myself to the works proper for my
preservation and supply, and was far enough from
being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment from
Heaven, or as the hand of God against me: these
were thoughts which very seldom entered into my
head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my
journal, had at first some little influence upon me,
and began to affect me with seriousness, as long as I
thought it had something miraculous in it; but as
soon as ever that part of thought was removed, all
the impression, which was raised from it, wore off
also, as I have noted already.
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately
directing to the invisible Power, which alone directs
such things; yet no sooner was the first fright over,
but the impression it had made went off also. I had
no more sense of God, or His judgments, much less
of the present affliction of my circumstances being
from His hand, than if I had been in the most pros-
perous condition of life.
But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely
view of the miseries of death came to place itself
before me; when my spirits began to sink under
the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was
exhausted with the violence of the fever, conscience,
that had slept so long, began to awake, and I began
to reproach myself with my past life, in which I had
so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked
the justice of God to lay me under uncommon
strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a
manner.
These reflections oppressed me, from the second
or third day of my distemper; and in the violence,
as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of
my conscience, extorted some words from me, like
praying to God, though I cannot say they were either
a prayer attended with desires, or with hopes; it
was rather the voice of mere fright and distress;
my thoughts were confused, the convictions great
upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such a
miserable condition raised vapours into my head
with the mere apprehensions; and in these hurries
of my soul, I knew not what my tongue might
express: but it was rather exclamation, such as
"Lord! what a miserable creature am I! If I should
be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help, and
what will become of me!" Then the tears burst
out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good
while.
In this interval the good advice of my father came
to my mind, and presently his prediction, which I
mentioned in the beginning of this story; viz., that
if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless
me; and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect
upon having neglected his counsel, when there might
be none to assist in my recovery. "Now," said I
aloud, "my dear father's words are come to pass;
God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to
help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a posture, or station
of life, wherein I might have been happy and easy;
but I would neither see it myself, nor learn to know
the blessing of it from my parents. I left them to
mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn
under the consequences of it. I refused their help
and assistance, who would have lifted me into the
world, and would have made everything easy to me,
and now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great
for even nature itself to support, and no assistance,
no help, no comfort, no advice." Then I cried out,
"Lord, be my help; for I am in great distress!"
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But I return to my
journal.
June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the
sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got
up; and though the fright and terror of my dream
was very great,'yet I considered that the fit of the
ague would return again the next day, and now was
my time to get something to refresh and support
"7
myself, when I should be ill: and the first thing I
did, I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and
set it upon my table, in reach of my bed; and to take
off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I put
about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed
them together; then I got me a piece of the goat's
flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very
little. I walked about, but was very weak, and withal
very sad and heavy-hearted, under a sense of my
miserable condition, dreading the return of my dis-
temper the next day. At night, I made my supper
of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the
ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell; and this was
the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing
to, even, as I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found my-
self so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for
I never went out without that); so I went but a little
way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and
smooth. As I sat here some such thoughts as these
occurred to me:—
What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen so
much? Whence is it produced? And what am I,
and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human
and brutal; whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who
is that?
Then it followed most naturally:—It is God that
has made it all. Well, but then, it came on strangely,
if God has made all these things, He guides and go-
verns them all, and all things that concern them; for
the Being that could make all things, must certainly
have power to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of
His works, either without His knowledge or appoint-
ment.
And if nothing happens without His knowledge,
He knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful con-
dition; and if nothing happens without His appoint-
ment, He has appointed all this to befall me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs
be that God had appointed all this to befall me;
that I was brought to this miserable circumstance
by His direction, He having the sole power, not of
me only, but of everything that happened in the
world. Immediately it followed,
Why has God done this to me? What have I
done to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that in-
quiry, as if I had blasphemed; and methought it
spoke to me, like a voice:—" Wretch! dost thou ask
what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful
misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not
done? Ask why it is that thou wert not long ago
destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yar-
mouth Roads? killed in the fight, when the ship was
taken by the Sallee man-of-war? devoured by the
wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or drowned HERE
when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost thou
ask, What have I done?"
I was struck with these reflections, as one aston-
ished, and had not a word to say, no, not to answer
119
to myself; but rose up pensive and sad, walked back
to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had
been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly dis-
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep, so I sat
down in my chair, and lighted my lamp; for it began
to be dark. Now, as the apprehensions of the return
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred
to my thought that the Brazilians take no physic
but their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I
had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests,
which was quite cured, and some also that was green,
and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt; for in this
chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I
opened the chest, and found what I looked for, viz.,
the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay
there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I
mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had not
found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into;
I say, I took it out, and brought both that and the
tobacco with me to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as
to my distemper, or whether it was good for it or
no; but I tried several experiments with it, as if I
was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first
took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth,
which indeed at first almost stupefied my brain, the
tobacco being green and strong, and that I had not
been much used to it; then I took some and steeped
it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take
a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I burnt
some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close
over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, aswell for the heat, as the virtue of it, and I held
almost to suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the
Bible, and began to read; but my head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at
least at that time; only, having opened the book
casually, the first words that occurred to me were
these—"Call on Me, in the day of trouble, and I
will deliver; and thou shalt glorify Me."
The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading them, though not so much as they did after-
wards; for, as for being delivered, the word had no
sound, as I may say, to me. The thing was so re-
mote, so impossible, in my apprehension of things,
that I began to say, as the children of Israel did
when they were promised flesh to eat, "Can God
spread a table in the wilderness?" So I began to
say, Can God Himself deliver me from this place?
And as it was not for many years that any hope ap-
peared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts.
But, however, the words made a very great impres-
sion upon me, and I mused upon them very often.
It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said,
dozed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep, so
that I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I
should want anything in the night, and went to
bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never
had done in all my life, I kneeled down, and prayed
to God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called
upon Him in the day of trouble, He would deliver
me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was
over, I drank the rum, in which I had steeped the
tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco,
that indeed I could scarce get it down. Immediately
upon this, I went to bed, and I found presently it
flew up into my head violently; but I fell into a
sound sleep, and waked no more, till, by the sun, it
must necessarily be near three o'clock in the after-
noon the next day; nay, to this hour, I am partly of
the opinion that I slept all the next day and night,
and till almost three the day after; for otherwise I
know not how I should lose a day out of my reckon-
ing, in the days of the week, as it appeared, some
years after, I had done: for if I had lost it by cross-
ing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more
than a day; but in my account it was lost, and I
never knew which way.
Be that, however, one way or other; when I
awaked, I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and
my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up, I
was stronger than I was the day before, and my
stomach better; for I was hungry; and, in short, I
had no fit the next day, but continued much altered
for the better: this was the 29th.
The 3Oth was my well day of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far; I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a
brand goose, and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them: so I ate some more of
the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This even-
ing I renewed the medicine which I had supposed
did me good the day before, viz., the tobacco
steeped in rum; only I did not take so much as
before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke; however, I was not so well the
next day, which was the 1st of July, as I hoped I
should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold
fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dozed myself with it at first, and doubled the
quantity which I drank.
July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, "I
will deliver thee;" and the impossibility of my de-
liverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever
expecting it: but as I was discouraging myself with
such thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored
so much upon my deliverance from the main afflic-
tion, that I disregarded the deliverance I had re-
ceived; and I was, as it were, made to ask myself
such questions as these, viz., Have I not been de-
livered, and wonderfully too, from sickness? from
the most distressing condition that could be, and
that was so frightful to me? and what notice had I
taken of it? had I done my part? God had de-
livered me, but I had not glorified Him: that is to say,
I had not owned and been thankful for that as a
deliverance; and how could I expect greater de-
liverance?
This touched my heart very much, and immedi-
ately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud
for my recovery from my sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read awhile
every morning and every night, not tying myself to
123
the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
should engage me. It was not long after I set seri-
ously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my
past life. The impression of my dream revived;
and the words, " All these things have not brought
thee to repentance," ran seriously in my thoughts. I
was earnestly begging of God to give me repentance,
when it happened providentially the very day, that
reading the Scripture, I came to these words: "He
is exalted a Prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance,
and to give remission." I threw down the book, and
with my heart as well as my hand lifted up to heaven,
in a kind of ecstacy of joy, I cried out aloud, "Jesus,
Thou Son of David! Jesus, Thou exalted Prince and
Saviour, give me repentance!"
This was the first time that I could say, in the
true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life;
for now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and
with a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the
encouragement of the Word of God; and from this
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God
would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, " Call on Me, and I will deliver thee," in a
different sense from what I had ever done before;
for then I had no notion of anything being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the cap-
tivity I was in: for though I was indeed at large in
the place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me,
and that in the worst sense of the word; but now I
learnt to take it in another sense. Now I looked
back upon my past life with such horror, and my
sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought
nothing of God but deliverance from the load of
guilt that bore down all my comfort. As for my
solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much as
pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was all
of no consideration in comparison of this; and I
added this part here, to hint to whoever shall read
it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things,
they will find deliverance from sin a much greater
blessing than deliverance from affliction.
But leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not less
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier
to my mind; and my thoughts being directed by a
constant reading the Scripture, and praying to God,
to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of
comfort within, which till now I knew nothing of:
also as my health and strength returned, I bestirred
myself to furnish myself with everything that I wanted,
and make my way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the I4th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my gun in my hand,
a little and a little at a time, as a man that was gather-
ing up his strength after a fit of sickness; for it is
hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what
weakness I was reduced. The application which I
made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what
had never cured an ague before; neither can I re-
commend it to any one to practise by this experiment;
and though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather con-
tributed to weaken me; for I had frequent convulsions
in my nerves and limbs for some time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that being
125
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious
thing to my health that could be, especially in those
rains which came attended with storms and hurri-
canes of wind; for as the rain which came in a dry
season was always most accompanied with such
storms, so I found this rain was much more dangerous
than the rain which fell in September and October.
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten
months; all possibility of deliverance from this con-
dition seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I
firmly believed that no human shape had ever set
foot upon that place. Having now secured my habi-
tation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the
island, and to see what other productions I might
find, which yet I knew nothing of.
CHAPTER VII.
/ BEGIN TO TAKE A SURVEY OF MY ISLAND—DISCOVER
PLENTY OF TOBACCO, GRAPES, LEMONSr AND SUGAR-
CANES, WILD, BUT NO HUMAN INHABITANTS—RESOLVE TO LAY UP A STORE OF THESE ARTICLES, TO FURNISH
ME AGAINST THE WET SEASON—MY CAT, WHICH I
SUPPOSED LOST, RETURNS WITH KITTENS / REGU-
LATE MY DIET, AND SHUT MYSELF UP FOR THE WET
SEASON—SOW MY GRAIN, WHICH COMES TO NOTHING; BUT I DISCOVER, AND REMEDY MY ERROR TAKE
ACCOUNT OF THE COURSE OF THE WEATHER.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the
creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on
shore. I found, after I came about two miles up,
that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it
was no more than a little brook of running water,
and very fresh and good; but this being the dry
season, there was hardly any water in some parts of
it, at least not enough to run into any stream, so as it
could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant
savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grass; and on the rising parts of them, next
to the higher grounds, where the water, as it might
be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal
of tobacco, green and growing to a great and very
strong stalk: there were divers others plants which
I had no notion of, or understanding about; and
might perhaps have virtues of their own, which I
could not find out.
I searched for the cassave root, which the Indians
in all that climate make their bread of, but I could
find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not
then understand them: I saw several sugar-canes,
but wild, and for want of cultivation, imperfect. I
contented myself with these discoveries for this
time, and came back musing with myself what
course I might take to know the virtue and good-
ness of any of the fruits or plants which I should
discover, but could bring it to no conclusion; for,
in short, I had made so little observation while I
was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants
of the field, at least, very little that might serve me
to any purpose now in my distress.
The next day, the i6th, I went up the same way
again; and after going something farther than I had
127
done the day before, I found the brook and the savan-
nas began to cease, and the country became more
woody than before. In this part I found different
fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the
ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the
trees; the vines had spread indeed over the trees,
and the clusters of grapes were just now in their
prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising
discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I
was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of
them, remembering, that when I was ashore in Bar-
bary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Eng-
lishmen who were slaves there, by throwing them
into fluxes and fevers: but I found an excellent use
for these grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in
the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are
kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they
were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat, when
no grapes might be had.
I spent all that evening there, and went not back
to my habitation; which, by the way, was the first
night, as I might say, I had lain from home. In the
night I took my first contrivance, and got up into a
tree, where I slept well, and the next morning pro-
ceeded upon my discovery, travelling near four miles,
as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping
still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and
north side of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west;
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of
the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is,
due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green,
so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure,
or flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted
garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts), to think- that this was all my own, that I was king and lord of
all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of pos-
session; and if I could convey it, I might have it in
inheritance, as completely as any lord of a manor in
England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees,
orange and lemon, and citron trees, but all wild,
and few bearing any fruit; at least, not then: how-
ever, the green limes that I gathered were not
only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I
mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made
it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.
I found now I had business enough to gather and
carry home; and resolved to lay up a store, as well
of grapes, as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for
the wet season, which I knew was approaching.
In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, and a lesser heap in another
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in
another place; and taking a few of each with me, I
travelled homeward, and resolved to come again,
and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to
carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this jour-
ney, I came home (so I must now call my tent, and
my cave); but before I got thither, the grapes were
spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and the weight of
the juice, having broken them, and bruised them,
they were good for little or nothing; as to the limes,
they were good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the igth, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest.
But I was surprised when, coming to my heap of
grapes which were so rich and fine when I gathered
them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces,
and dragged about, some here, some there, and
abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded
there were some wild creatures thereabouts, which
had done this; but what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them
up on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack,
but that one way they would be destroyed, and the
other way they would be crushed with their own
weight, I took another course; for I gathered a large
quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the
out branches of the trees, that they might cure
and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well
stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contem-
plated, with great pleasure, on the fruitfulness of
that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation,
the security from storms on that side of the water,
and the wood; and concluded that I had pitched
upon a place to fix my abode, which was by far the
worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began
to consider of removing my habitation, and to look
out for a place equally safe as where I now was
situated, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part
of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was
VOL. I. I
exceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness
of the place tempting me; but when I came to a
nearer view of it, and to consider that I was now
by the sea-side, where it was at least possible that
something might happen to my advantage, and that
the same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring
some other unhappy wretches to the same place;
and though it was scarce probable that any such
thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself
among the hills and woods, in the centre of the
island, was to anticipate my bondage, and to render
such an affair not only improbable, but impossible;
and that therefore I ought not by any means to
remove.
However, I was so enamoured with this place,
that I spent much of my time there for the whole
remaining part of the month of July; and though,
upon second thoughts, I resolved as above, not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and
surrounded it at a distance, with a strong fence,
being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well
staked, and filled between with brushwood; and
here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three
nights together, always going over it with a ladder,
as before; so that I fancied now I had my country-
house, and my sea-coast house; and this work took
me up the beginning of August.
I had but newly finished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my first habitation; for though I
had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of
a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a
131
cave behind me, to retreat into when the rains were
extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The
3rd of August I found the grapes I had hung up
were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good
raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down
from the trees, and it was very happy that I did so;
for the rains which followed would have spoiled them,
and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for
I had above two hundred large bunches of them.
No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried
most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain;
and from thence, which was the 14th of August, it
rained more or less every day, till the middle of
October, and sometimes so violently that I could
not stir out of my cave for several days.
In this season I was much surprised with the in-
crease of my family: I had been concerned for the
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or,
as I thought, had been dead; and I heard no more
tale or tidings of her, till to my astonishment she
came home about the end of August, with three
kittens. This was the more strange to me, because
though I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with
my gun, yet I thought it was a quite different kind
from our European cats; yet the young cats were
the same kind of house breed like the old one; and
both my cats being females, I thought it very
strange: but from these three cats, I afterwards
came to be so pestered with cats, that I was forced
to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive
them from my house as much as possible.
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
From the I4th of August to the 26th, incessant
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very care-
ful not to be much wet. In this confinement I began
to be straitened for food; but venturing out twice, I
one day killed a goat: and the last day, which was
the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a
treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I ate
a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled
(for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil
or stew anything); and two or three of the turtle's
eggs for supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the rain,
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my
cave; and by degrees worked it on towards one
side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made
a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or
wall; and so I came in and out this way. But I was
not perfectly easy at lying so open; for as I had
managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure,
whereas now I thought I lay exposed; and yet I
could not perceive that there was any living thing to
fear, the biggest creature that I had seen upon the
island being a goat.
September the 10th. I was now come to the un-
happy anniversary of my landing: I cast up the
notches on my post, and found I had been on shore
three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious ex-
ercise, prostrating myself to the ground with the
most serious humiliation, confessing myself to God,
acknowledging His righteous judgment upon me, and
praying to Him to have mercy on me, through Jesus
133
Christ; and having not tasted the least refreshment
for twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun,
I then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and
went to bed, finishing the day as I began it.
I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for
as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind,
I had after some time omitted to distinguish the
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for
the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what
any of the days were; but now, having cast up the
days as above, I found I had been there a year; so I
divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh
day for a Sabbath; though I found at the end of my
account I had lost a day or two of my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so
I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to
write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a daily memorandum of other
things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them
so as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought
all my experience before I had it; and this I am
going to relate, was one of the most discouraging
experiments that I made at all. I have mentioned
that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice which
I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought,
of themselves, and believe there were about thirty
stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now
I thought it a proper time to sow it after the rains,
the sun being in its southern position going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well as
I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it into
two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing,
it casually occurred to my thought, that I would not
sow it all at first, because I did not know when was
the proper time for it; so I sowed about two-thirds
of the seeds, leaving about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did
so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time came
to anything; for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had
no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up
at all, till the wet season had come again, and then
it grew as if it had been newly sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy months
of March and April to water it, sprung up very
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; but having
part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all
that I had yet, I had but a small quantity at last,
my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck
of each kind. ',
But by this experience I was made master of my
business, and knew exactly when the proper season
was to sow; and that I might expect two seed-times,
and two harvests, every year.
While this corn was growing, I made a little dis-
covery, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the rains were over, and the weather began to
settle, which was about the month of November, I
made a visit up the country to my bower, where
135
though I had not been some months, yet I found all
things just as I left them. The circle or double
hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire,
but the stakes which I had cut off of some trees that
grew thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown with
long branches, as much as a willow tree usually
shoots the first year after lopping its head. I could
not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to
see the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and
led them up to grow as much alike as I could; and
it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grew
into in three years; so that though the hedge made
a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet
the trees, for such I might now call them, soon
covered it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient to
lodge under all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,
and make me a hedge like this in a semicircle round
my wall, I mean that of my first dwelling, which I
did; and placing the trees, or stakes, in a double
row, at above eight yards' distance from my first
fence, they grew presently, and were at first a fine
cover to my habitation, and afterwards served for a
defence also, as I shall observe in its order.
I found now, that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter,
as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry
seasons, which were generally thus —

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter
as the winds happened to blow; but this was the
general observation I made. After I had found, by
experience, the ill consequence of being abroad in the
rain, I took care to furnish myself with provision
beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out;
and I sat within doors as much as possible during the
wet months.
In this time I found much employment (and very
suitable also to the time), for I found great occasion
of many things which I had no way to furnish myself
with, but by hard labour and constant application;
particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a
basket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpose
proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when
I was a boy I used to take great delight in standing
at a basket-maker's in the town where my father
lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and
137
being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and
a great observer of the manner how they worked
those things, and sometimes lent a hand, I had by
this means so full knowledge of the methods of it,
that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it
came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from
whence I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be
as tough as the sallows and willows and osiers in
England; and I resolved to try.
Accordingly the next day I went to my country-
house, as I called it; and cutting some of the smaller
twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire; whereupon I came the next time pre-
pared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I
soon found, for there was a great plenty of them:
these I set up to dry within my circle or hedges; and
when they were fit for use, I carried them to my
cave; and here, during the next season, I employed
myself in making (as well as I could) a great many
baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up
anything, as I had occasion; and though I did not
finish them very handsomely, yet I made them suffi-
ciently serviceable for my purpose; and thus after-
wards I took care never to be without them: and as
my wicker-ware decayed I made more; especially I
made strong deep baskets to place my corn in, instead
of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity
of it.
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if
possible, how to supply two wants. I had no vessels
to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets,
which were almost full of rum, and some glass
bottles, some of the common size, and others which
were case-bottles square, for the holding of waters,
spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to boil
anything in, except a great kettle which I saved
out of the ship, and which was too big for such uses
as I desired it for, viz., to make broth, and stew a bit
of meat by itself. The second thing I would fain
have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible
for me to make one; however, I found a contrivance
for that too at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows of
stakes of piles, and in this wicker-work, all the sum-
mer, or dry season; when another business took me up
more time than it could be imagined I could spare.
CHAPTER VIII.
MAKE A SECOND TOUR THROUGH THE ISLAND—CATCH
A YOUNG PARROT, WHICH I AFTERWARDS TEACH TO SPEAK—MY MODE OF SLEEPING AT NIGHT—FIND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND MUCH MORE PLEA-
SANT THAN MINE, AND COVERED WITH TURTLE AND
SEA-FOWL—CATCH A YOUNG KID WHICH I TAME—
RETURN TO MY OLD HABITATION—GREAT PLAGUE
WITH MY HARVEST.
I MENTIONED before that I had a great mind to see
the whole island, and that I had travelled up the
brook, and so on to where I built my bower, and
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite across to the sea-shore on that side. So, tak-
ing my gun and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger
quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two
139
biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my
pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When
I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as
above, I came within view of the sea, to the west;
and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land,
whether an island or continent I could not tell; but
it lay very high, extending from the west, to the
W.S.W. at a very great distance; by my guess it
could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might
be, otherwise than that I knew it must be part of
America; and as I concluded by all my observa-
tions, must be near the Spanish dominions, and
perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where if I
should have landed, I had been in a worse condition
than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the
dispositions of Providence, which I began now to
own, and to believe ordered everything for the best;
I say, I quieted my mind with this, and left afflicting
myself with fruitless wishes of being there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con-
sidered that if this land was the Spanish coast, I
should certainly, one time or other, see some vessels
pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then it
was the savage coast between the Spanish country
and Brazil, which were indeed the worst of savages;
for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and fail not to
murder and devour all the human bodies that fall
into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island where I
now was much pleasanter than mine, the open or
savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass,
and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of
parrots, and fain would I have caught one, if possible,
to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to
me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young
parrot; for I knocked it down with a stick, and
having recovered it, I brought it home, but it was
some years before I could make him speak. How-
ever, at last I taught him to call me by my name
very familiarly: but the accident that followed,
though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its
place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I
found in the low grounds hares, as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all the
other kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy
myself to eat them, though I killed several: but I
had no need to be venturous; for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too; especi-
ally these three sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and turtle
or tortoise; which added to my grapes, Leadenhall-
market could not have furnished a better table than
I, in proportion to the company; and though my
case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause
for thankfulness, that I was not driven to any ex-
tremities for food; but rather plenty, even to
dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so
many turns and returns, to see what discoveries I
could make, that I came weary enough to the place
where I resolved to sit down for all night; and
then either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded
myself with a row of stakes set upright in the
141
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as
no wild creature could come at me without waking
me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was sur-
prised to see that I had taken up my lot on the
worst side of the island; for here indeed the shore
was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on
the other side, I had found but three in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls
of many kinds, some of which I had not seen before,
and many of them very good meat; but such as
I knew not the names of except those called pen-
guins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot: and therefore
had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which
I could better feed on; and though there were many
goats here more than on the other side of the island,
yet it was with much more difficulty that I could
come near them; the country being flat and even,
and they saw me much sooner than when I was on
the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but yet I had not the least inclina-
tion to remove; for as I was fixed in my habitation,
it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while
I was here to be, as it were, upon a journey, and
from home: however, I travelled along the shore
of the sea towards the east, I suppose, about twelve
miles; and then setting up a great pole upon the
shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again; and the next journey I took should be on
the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round, till I came to my post again: of which
in its place.
I took another way to come back than that I went,
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much
in my view, that I could not miss finding my first
dwelling by viewing the country: but I found myself
mistaken; for, being come about two or three miles, I
found myself descended into a very large valley; but
so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with
woods, that I could not see which was my way by any
direction but that of the sun; nor even then, unless I
knew very well the position of the sun at that time of
the day.
It happened, to my further misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days while I
was in this valley; and not being able to see the sun,
I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last
was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for my post,
and come back the same way I went; and then by
easy journeys I turned homeward, the weather being
exceeding hot; and my gun, ammunition, hatchet,
and other things, very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running in to take hold of it,
caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I had a
great mind to bring it home, if I could: for I had
often been musing whether it might not be possible
to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame
goats, which might supply me when my powder and
shot should be spent.
I made a collar for this little creature, and with a
string which I made of some rope-yarn, which I always
carried about me, I led him along, though with some

difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there I en-
closed him, and left him, for I was very impatient to
be at home, from whence I had been absent above a
month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my ham-
mock-bed: this little wandering journey, without a
settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me,
that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a
perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it
rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I
resolved I would never go a great way from it again,
while it should be my lot to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale my-
self after my long journey; during which, most of the
time was taken up in the weightyaffair of making acage
for my Poll, who began now to be a mere domestic,
and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I
began to think of the poor kid which I had pent in
within my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch
it home, and give it some food; accordingly I went,
and found it where I left it; for indeed it could not
get out, but was almost starved for want of food. I
went and cut boughs of trees and branches of such
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and having
fed it, I tied it as I did before to lead it away; but it
was so tame with being hungry, that I had no need
to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog; and as
I continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so
gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me
afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was
now come, and I kept the 30th of September in the
same solemn manner as before, being the anniver-
sary of my landing on the island, having now been
there two years, and no more prospect of being
delivered than the first day I came there. I spent
the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledg-
ments of the many wonderful mercies which my
solitary condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miserable.
I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God had
been pleased to discover to me even that it was
possible I might be more happy in this solitary con-
dition than I should have been in a liberty of society,
and in all the pleasures of the world: that He could
fully make up to me the deficiencies of my solitary
state, and the want of human society, by His presence,
and the communication of His grace to my soul, sup-
porting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend
upon His providence here, and hope for His eternal
presence hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how
much more happy the life I now led was, with all
its miserable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed,
abominable life I led all the past part of my days;
and now, having changed both my sorrows and my
joys, my very desires altered, my affections changed
their gust, and my delights were perfectly new from
what they were at first coming, or indeed for the
two years past.
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul
at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me to
think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I
was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up with
the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an unin-
habited wilderness, without redemption. In the
midst of the greatest composures of my mind, this
would break out upon me like a storm, and made
me wring my hands, and weep like a child. Some-
times it would take me in the middle of my work,
and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and
look upon the ground for an hour or two together,
and this was still worse to me; for if I could burst
out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go
off; and the grief having exhausted itself, would
abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts; I daily read the Word of God, and ap-
plied all the comforts of it to my present state.
One morning being very sad, I opened the Bible
upon these words, "I will never, never leave thee,
nor forsake thee!" Immediately it occurred that
these words were to me; why else should they be
directed in such a manner, just at the moment
when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of God and man?"Well, then," said I,
"if God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence
can it be, or what matters it though the world should
all forsake me; seeing, on the other hand, if I had
all the world, and should lose the favour and bless-
ing of God, there would be no comparison in the
loss?"
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was pro-
VOL. I. K
bable I should have ever been in any other particular
state in the world; and with this thought I was
going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this
place.
I know not what it was, but something shocked
my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak
the words. "How canst thou be such a hypocrite,"
said I, even audibly, "to pretend to be thankful for
a condition, which, however thou mayest endeavour
to be contented with, thou wouldest rather pray
heartily to be delivered from?" So I stopped there;
but though I could not say I thanked God for being
there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for open-
ing my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences, to
see the former condition of my life, and to mourn
for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the
Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within me blessed
God for directing my friend in England, without any
order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and
for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the
wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my
third year; and though I have not given the reader
the trouble of so particular an account of my works
this year as at the first, yet in general it may be
observed that I was very seldom idle; having regu-
larly divided my time according to the several daily
employments that were before me; such as, first, my
duty to God, and reading the Scriptures, which I
constantly set apart some time for thrice every day;
secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food,
which generally took me up three hours every morn-
ing when it did not rain ; thirdly, the ordering, curing,
147
preserving, and cooking what I had killed or catched
for my supply; these took up great part of the day:
also, it is to be considered that in the middle of the
day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of
the heat was too great to stir out; so that about four
hours in the evening was all the time I could be sup-
posed to work in ; with this exception, that sometimes
I changed my hours of hunting and working, and
went to work in the morning, and abroad with my
gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may
be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work;
the many hours, which, for want of tools, want of
help, and want of skill, everything that I did took
up out of my time: for example, I was full two-and-
forty days making me a board for a long shelf, which I
wanted in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their
tools and saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of
the same tree in half a day.
My case was this: it was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, because my board was to be a
broad one. The tree I was three days a cutting down,
and two more a cutting off the boughs, and reducing
it to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible
hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into
chips, till it began to be light enough to move; then I
turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat, as
a board, from end to end: then, turning that side
downward, cut the other side till I brought the plank
to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both
sides. Any one may judge the labour of my hands
in such a piece of work; but labour and patience
carried me through that and many other things: I
only observe this in particular, to show the reason
why so much of my time went away with so little
work, viz., that what might be a little to be done with
help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a pro-
digious time, to do alone, and by hand.
But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour,
I went through many things, and indeed everything
that my circumstances made necessary for me to do,
as will appear by what follows.
I was now in the months of November and De-
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost one
whole crop by sowing in the dry season; but now my
crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found
I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of
several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep
from it; as first, the goats, and wild creatures which
I called hares, which, tasting the sweetness of the
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up,
and ate it so close that it could get no time to shoot
up into stalks.
This I saw no remedy for but by making an en-
closure about it with a hedge, which I did with a
great deal of toil; and the more, because it required
a great deal of speed; the creatures daily spoiling
my corn. However, as my arable land was but
small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced
in about three weeks' time, and shooting some of the
creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it
in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate,
where he would stand and bark all night long; so
149
in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the
corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen
apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn
was in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin
me now, when it was in the ear; for, going along by
the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop
surrounded with fowls of I know not how many
sorts, which stood as it were watching till I should
be gone. I immediately let fly among them (for I
always had my gun with me). I had no sooner shot,
but there arose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had
not seen at all, from among the corn itself.
This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw that in
a few days they would devour all my hopes; that I
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop
at all; and what to do I could not tell: however, I
resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I
should watch it night and day. In the first place,
I went among it to see what damage was already
done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it;
but that, as it was yet too green for them, the loss
was not so great, but the remainder was like to be a
good crop, if it could be saved.
I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I was
gone away, and the event proved it to be so; for,
as I walked off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out
of their sight, but they dropped down one by one into
the corn again. I was so provoked that I could not
have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that
every grain that they ate now was, as it might be
said, a peck loaf to me in the consequence; but
coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed
three of them. This was what I wished for; so I
took them up, and served them as we serve notorious
thieves in England, viz., hanged them in chains for a
terror to others. It is impossible to imagine almost
that this should have such an effect as it had; for the
fowls would not only not come at the corn, but in
short they forsook all that part of the island, and I
could never see a bird near the place as long as my
scarecrows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my corn.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as
well as I could out of one of the broadswords, or
cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the
ship. However, as my crop was but small, I had no
great difficulty to cut it down; in short, I reaped it
my way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried
it away in a great basket which I had made, and so
rubbed it out with my hands: and at the end of all
my harvesting, I found that out of my half-peck of
seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two
bushels and a half of barley, that is to say by my
guess, for I had no measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me;
and I foresaw that in time it would please God to
supply me with bread: and yet here I was perplexed
again; for I neither knew how to grind or make
meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part
it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it;
and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake
it. These things being added to my desire of having
a good quantity for store, and to secure a constant
supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but
to preserve it all for seed against the next season,
and in the meantime to employ all my study and
hours of working, to accomplish this great work of
providing myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly said that I now worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I believe
few people have thought much upon; viz., the strange
multitude of little things necessary in the providing,
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this
one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature,
found this to be my daily discouragement, and was
made more and more sensible of it every hour, even
after I got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as
I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a
surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by
making a wooden spade, as I observed before; but
this did my work but in a wooden manner; and
though it cost me a great many days to make it,
yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner
but made my work the harder, and made it be per-
formed much worse.
However, this I bore with too, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the badness
of the performance. When the corn was sowed, I
had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself,
and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to
scratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than
rake or harrow it.
When it was growing, or grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure
it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it home, thresh,
part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted
a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in; and
all these things I did without, as shall be observed;
and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and
advantage to me too. But all this, as I said, made
everything laborious and tedious to me, but that there
was no help for: neither was my time so much loss
to me, because I had divided it; a certain part of it
was every day appointed to these works; and as I
resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a
greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to
apply myself wholly, by labour and invention, to fur-
nish myself with utensils proper for the performing
all the operations necessary for making the corn,
when I had it, fit for my use.
But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now
seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before
I did this, I had a week's work at least to make me a
spade, which, when it was done, was a very sorry one
indeed, and very heavy, and required double labour
to work with it; however I went through that, and
sowed my seeds in two large flat pieces of ground, as
near my house as I could find them to my mind, and
fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of
which were all cut off that wood which I had set
before, which I knew would grow; so that in one
year's time I knew I should have a quick or living
hedge, that would want but little repair. This work
was not so little as to take me up less than three
months; because great part of that time was in the
wet season, when I could not go abroad.
Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following
occasion, always observing, that all the while I was
at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot,
and teaching him to speak; and I quickly learnt him
to know his own name; at last, to speak it out pretty
loud, POLL; which was the first word I ever heard
spoken in the island by any mouth but my own.
This therefore was not my work, but an assistant to
my work; for now, as I said, I had a great employ-
ment upon my hands, as follows: viz., I had long
studied, by some means or other, to make myself
some earthen vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely,
but knew not where to come at them: however, con-
sidering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but
if I could find out any such clay, I might botch up
some such pot as might, being dried by the sun, be
hard enough and strong enough to bear handling, and
to hold anything that was dry, and required to be
kept so; and as this was necessary in preparing corn,
meal, &c., which was the thing I was upon, I resolved
to make some as large as I could, and fit only to
stand like jars to hold what should be put into them.

DESCRIPTION OF MY MODE OF BAKING—BEGIN TO MAKE A BOAT—AFTER IT IS FINISHED, AM UNABLE TO GET IT DOWN TO THE WATER—SERIOUS RE-
FLECTIONS—MY INK AND BISCUIT EXHA USTED, AND
CLOTHES IN A BAD STATE—CONTRIVE TO MAKE A
DRESS OF SKINS.
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to
raise this paste, what odd misshapen ugly things I
made, how many of them fell in, and how many fell
out, the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own
weight; how many cracked by the overviolent heat
of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many
fell to pieces with only removing, as well before as
after they were dried; and, in a word, how after
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to
temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not
make above two large earthen ugly things, I cannot
call them jars, in about two months' labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set them
down again in two great wicker-baskets, which I had
made on purpose for them, that they might not break;
and as between the pot and the basket there was a
little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and
barley straw; and these two pots being to stand
always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and
perhaps the meal when the corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and anything my hand turned
to; and the heat of the sun baked them strangely
hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and
bear the fire, which none of these could do. It hap-
pened after some time, making a pretty large fire for
cooking my meat, when I went to put it out, after I
had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of
my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a
stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised
to see it, and said to myself, that certainly they
might be made to burn whole if they would burn
broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so as
to make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of
a kiln such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but
I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots,
in a pile one upon another, and placed my firewood
all round it, with a great heap of embers under them:
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed that they did not crack
at all: when I saw them clear red, I let them stand
in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run;
for the sand which was mixed with the clay melted
by the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradu-
ally, till the pots began to abate of the red colour;
and watching them all night that I might not let the
fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very
pood, I will not say handsome pipkins, and two other
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired; and
one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the
sand.
After this experiment I need not say that I wanted
no sort of earthenware for my use; but I must needs
say, as to the shapes of them, they were very indiffe-
rent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of
making them, but as the children make dirt-pies, or
as a woman would make pies that never learnt to
raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly
patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one
upon the fire again with some water in it, to boil me
some meat, which I did admirably well; and with a
piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though
I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients
requisite to make it so good as I would have had
it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to
stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art
with one pair of hands. To supply this want, I was
at a great loss; for of all trades in the world I was
as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for any
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it
with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone
big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar,
157
and could find none at all except what was in the
solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut
out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hard-
ness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling
stone, which would neither bear the weight of a
heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without filling
it with sand; so after a great deal of time lost in
searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to
look out a great block of hard wood, which I found
indeed much easier; and, getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then with the
help of fire and infinite labour, made a hollow place
in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes.
After this, I made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of
the wood called the iron-wood, and this I prepared
and laid by against I had my next crop of corn, when
I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my
corn or meal to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve or scarce, to dress my meal, and part it from the bran and the
husk, without which I did not see it possible I could
have any bread. This was a most difficult thing,
so much as but to think on; for to be sure I had
nothing like the necessary things to make it with;
I mean fine thin canvass, or stuff, to scarce the meal
through. And here I was at a full stop for many
months; nor did I really know what to do: linen I
had none left but what was mere rags; I had goat's
hair, but neither knew I how to weave or spin it;
and had I known how, here were no tools to work
it with. All the remedy that I found for this was,
that at last I did remember I had among the sea-
men's clothes, which were saved out of the ship,
some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with some
pieces of these I made three small sieves, but proper
enough for the work; and thus I made shift for
some years; how I did afterwards, I shall show in
its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be con-
sidered, and how I should make bread when I came
to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast: as to that
part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not
concern myself much about it. But for an oven, I
was indeed in great pain. At length I found out an
experiment for that also, which was this: I made
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep; that
is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above
nine inches deep; these I burnt in the fire, as I had
done the others, and laid them by; and when I
wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth,
which I had paved with some square tiles of my own
making and burning also; but I should not call
them square.
When the firewood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon
this hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I let
them lie, till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping
away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves,
and whelming down the earthen pot upon them,
drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to
keep in, and add to the heat: and thus, as well as
in the best oven in the world, I baked my barley-
loaves, and became in a little time a mere pastry-
cook into the bargain; for I made myself several
cakes of the rice, and puddings; indeed I made no
pies, neither had I anything to put into them, sup-
posing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or
goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things
took me up most part of the third year of my abode
here; for it is to be observed, that in the intervals of
these things I had my new harvest and husbandry
to manage: for I reaped my corn in its season, and
carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in
the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub
it out; for I had no floor to thresh it on, or instru-
ment to thresh it with.
And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, I
really wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted
a place to lay it up in; for the increase of the corn
now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley
about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or
more; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to use
it freely, for my bread had been quite gone a great
while; also I resolved to see what quantity would
be sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow but
once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could consume
in a year: so I resolved to sow just the same quantity
every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a
quantity would fully provide me with bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing you may be
sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect
of land which I had seen from the other side of the
island; and I was not without secret wishes that I
was on shore there, fancying that seeing the mainland
and an inhabited country, I might find some way or
other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last
find some means of escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I might fall
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I
might have reason to think far worse than the lions
and tigers of Africa: that if I once came into their
power, I should run a hazard more than a thousand
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten;
for I had heard that the people of the Carribbean
coasts were cannibals, or men-eaters; and I knew by
the latitude that I could not be far off from that
shore; that suppose they were not cannibals, yet
they might kill me, as many Europeans who had
fallen into their hands had been served, even when
they had been ten or twenty together; much more I
that was but one, and could make little or no defence.
All these things, I say, which I ought to have con-
sidered well of, and I did cast up in my thoughts
afterwards, yet took none of my apprehensions at
first; and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts
of getting over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat
with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but
this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and
look on our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was
blown up upon the shore a great way in the storm,
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where
she did at first, but not quite; and was turned by the
force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom up-
wards, against the high ridge of a beachy rough sand,
but no water about her as before.
161
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have
launched her into the water, the boat would have
done well enough, and I might have gone back into
the Brazils with her easy enough; but I might have
easily foreseen that I could no more turn her, and
set her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove
the island. However, I went to the wood, and cut
levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, re-
solving to try what I could do; suggesting to myself,
that if I could but turn her down, I might easily
repair the damage she had received, and she would
be a very good boat, and I might go to sea in her
very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it;
at last, finding it impossible to heave it up with my
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand to
undermine it; and so to make it fall down, setting
pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the
fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it
up again, or to get under it, much less to move it
forwards towards the water; so I was forced to give
it over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the
boat, my desire to venture over for the main increased,
rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed
impossible.
This at length set me upon thinking whether it
was not possible to make myself a canoe or periagua,
such as the natives of those climates make, even
without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz.,
of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought
possible, but easy; and pleased myself extremely
VOL. L L
with my thoughts of making it, and with my having
much more convenience for it than any of the negroes
or Indians; but not at all considering the particular
inconveniences which I lay under more than the
Indians did, viz., want of hands to move it into the
water when it was made; a difficulty much harder
for me to surmount than all the consequences of want
of tools could be to them; for what was it to me,
that when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I
might with great trouble cut it down, if after I might
be able with my tools to hew and dub the outside
into a proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out
the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of
it, if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I
found it, and was not able to launch it into the
water?
One would have thought I could not have had
the least reflection upon my mind of my circum-
stances, while I was making this boat, but I should
have immediately thought how I should get it into
the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon my
voyage over the sea in it, that I never once con-
sidered how I should get it off the land; and it was
really in its own nature more easy for me to guide
it over forty-five miles of sea, than about forty-five
fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the
water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a
fool that ever man did, who had any of his senses
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake
it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
came often into my head; but I put a stop to my
163
own inquiries into it by this foolish answer, which
I gave myself; "Let me first make it, I'll warrant
I'll find some way or other to get it along when it is
done."
This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I
went, and felled a cedar tree: I question much
whether Solomon ever had such a one for the
building the temple at Jerusalem. It was five feet
ten inches diameter at the lower part next the stump,
and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of
twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for awhile,
and then parted into branches. It was not without
infinite labour that I felled this tree; I was twenty
days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was
fourteen more getting the branches and limbs, and the
vast spreading head of it, cut off: which I hacked and
hewed through with my axe and hatchet, with in-
expressible labour; after this it cost me a month to
shape it, and dub it to a proportion, and to something
like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as
it ought to do. It cost me near three months more to
clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an
exact boat of it: this I did indeed without fire, by mere
mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till
I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and
big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and
consequently big enough to have carried me and all
my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it: the boat was really much
bigger than I ever saw a canoe or periagua, that
was made of one tree, in my life; many a weary
stroke it had cost, you may be sure, for there re-
mained nothing but to get it into the water; and
had I gotten it into the water, I made no question
but I should have begun the maddest voyage, and
the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was
undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed
me, though they cost infinite labour too; it lay
about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up
hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface
of the earth, and so make a declivity; this I began,
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but who
grudge pains that have their deliverance in view?
but when this was worked through, and this difficulty
managed, it was still much at one; for I could no
more stir the canoe than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up
to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe
down to the water: well I began this work, and
when I began to enter into it, and calculated how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff to
be thrown out, I found, that by the number of hands
I had, being none but my own, it must have been
ten or twelve years before I should have gone through
with it; for the shore lay high, so that at the upper
end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so
at length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this
attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the
same devotion, and with as much comfort as ever
before; for, by a constant study, and serious appli-
cation of the Word of God, and by the assistance of
His grace, I gained a different knowledge from what
I had before; I entertained different notions of
things; I looked now upon the world as a thing
remote, which I had nothing to do with, no expecta-
tion from, and indeed no desires about: in a word,
I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever
like to have; so I thought it looked as we may per-
haps look upon it hereafter; viz., as a place I had
lived in, but was come out of it; and well I might
say, as father Abraham to Dives, "Between me and
thee there is a great gulf fixed."
In the first place, I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here: I had neither the lust
of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life;
I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was now
capable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor,
or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor
over the whole country which I had possession of;
there was no rival; I had no competitor, none to
dispute sovereignty or command with me; I might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use
for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough
for my occasion: I had tortoises or turtles enough;
but now and then one was as much as I could put to
any use; I had timber enough to have built a fleet
of ships; I had grapes enough to have made wine,
or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet
when they had been built.
But all I could make use of, was all that was
valuable: I had enough to eat, and to supply my
wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed
more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or
the vermin; if I sowed more corn than I could eat,
it must be spoiled. The trees that I cut down were
lying to rot on the ground, I could make no more
use of them than for fuel; and that I had no occa-
sion for, but to dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the
good things of this world are no further good to us,
than as they are for our use: and that whatever we
may heap up indeed to give to others, we enjoy
as much as we can use, and no more. The most
covetous griping miser in the world would have been
cured of the vice of covetousness, if he had been
in my case; for I possessed infinitely more than I
knew what to do with. I had no room for desire,
except it was of things which I had not, and they
were but trifles, though indeed of great use to me.
I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well
gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling: alas!
there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no
manner of business for it; and I often thought with
myself, that I would have given a handful of it for a
gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my
corn; nay, I would have given it all for sixpenny
worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England,
or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of
ink: as it was I had not the least advantage by it,
167
or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer,
and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave, in
the wet season; and if I had had the drawer full of
diamonds, it had been the same case; and they had
been of no manner of value to me, because of no
use.
I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier
to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently
sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and admired
the hand of God's providence, which had thus spread
my table in the wilderness; I learnt to look more
upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon
the dark side; and to consider what I enjoyed, rather
than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes
such secret comforts, that I cannot express them;
and which I take notice of here, to put those dis-
contented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy
comfortably what God hath given them, because
they see and covet something that He has not given
them: all our discontents about what we want, ap-
peared to me to spring from the want of thankfulness
for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall
into such distress as mine was; and this was, to
compare my presentcondition with what I at first
expected it should be; nay, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good providence of God
had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up
near to the shore, where I not only could come at
her, but could bring what I got out of her to the
shore for my relief and comfort; without which I
had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence, or
gunpowder and shot for getting my food.
I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in
representing to myself, in the most lively colours,
how I must have acted, if I had got nothing out of
the ship; how I could not have so much as got any
food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it was
long before I found any of them, I must have
perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not
perished, like a mere savage; that if I had killed a
goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no way to
flay or open them, or part the flesh from the skin
and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it
with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a
beast.
These reflections made me very sensible of the
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful for
my present condition, with all its hardships and mis-
fortunes: and this part also I cannot but recommend
to the reflection of those who are apt in their misery
to say, Is any affliction like mine? Let them con-
sider how much worse the cases of some people are,
and what their case might have been, if Providence
had thought fit.
I had another reflection which assisted me also to
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was compar-
ing my present condition with what I had deserved,
and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of
Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly
destitute of the knowledge and fear of God; I had
been well instructed by father and mother; neither
had they been wanting to me in their early endea-
vours to infuse a religious awe of God into my mind,
169
a sense of my duty, and of what the nature and end
of my being required of me. But, alas! falling early
into the seafaring life, which of all the lives is the
most destitute of the fear of God, though His terrors
are always before them; I say, falling early into the
seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that
little sense of religion which I had entertained, was
laughed out of me by my messmates; by a hardened
despising of dangers, and the views of death, which
grew habitual to me; by my long absence from all
manner of opportunities to converse with anything
but what was like myself, or to hear anything of
what was good, or tended towards it.
So void was I of everything that was good, or of
the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in
the greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my escape
from Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese
master of the ship, my being planted so well in Brazil,
my receiving the cargo from England, and the like, I
never once had the words, Thank God, so much as
on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest
distress had I so much thought as to pray to Him;
nor so much as to say, Lord, have mercy upon me!
no, not to mention the name of God, unless it was to
swear by, and blaspheme it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account
of my wicked and hardened life past; and when I
looked about me, and considered what particular
providences had attended me, since my coming into
this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with
me; had not only punished me less than my iniquity
deserved, but had so plentifully provided for me;
this gave me great hopes that my repentance was
accepted, and that God had yet mercies in store for
me.
With these reflections I worked my mind up, not
only to resignation to the will of God in the present
disposition of my circumstances, but even to a sincere
thankfulness of my condition; and that I, who was
yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had
not the due punishment of my sins; that I en-
joyed so many mercies, which I had no reason to
have expected in that place, that I ought never
more to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and
to give daily thanks for that daily bread which
nothing but a cloud of wonders could have brought;
that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a
miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by
ravens; nay, by a long series of miracles; and that
I could hardly have named a place in the uninhabited
part of the world, where I could have been cast more
to my advantage: a place, where as I had no society,
which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no
ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers to threaten
my life; no venomous creatures or poisonous, which
I might have fed on to my hurt; no savages to
murder and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way,
so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted
nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able to
make my sense of God's goodness to me, and care
over me in this condition, be my daily consolation;
and after I made a just improvement of these things,
I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things
171
which I brought on shore for my help, were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with
water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce
left any appearance of black upon the paper: as long
as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the days
of the month on which any remarkable thing hap-
pened to me; and first, by casting up times past
I remembered that there was a strange concurrence
of days, in the various providences which befell me,
and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined
to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have
had reason to have looked upon with a great deal
of curiosity.
First, I had observed, that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran
away to Hull in order to go to sea, the same day
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and
made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of the
wreck of the ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day
of the year afterwards I made my escape from Sallee
in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz., the
2Oth of September, the same day I had my life so
miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I
was cast on shore in this island; so that my wicked
life, and solitary life, both began on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that
of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought out
of the ship. This I had husbanded to the last degree,
allowing myself but one cake of bread a day, for
above a year: and yet I was quite without bread
for a year before I got any corn of my own; and
great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at
all, the getting it being, as has been already observed,
next to miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to
linen, I had none a good while, except some che-
quered shirts which I found in the chests of the other
seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because
many times I could bear no other clothes on but a
shirt; and it was a very great help to me, that I had
among all the men's clothes of the ship almost three
dozen of shirts. There were also several thick watch-
coats of the seamen, which were left behind, but they
were too hot to wear; and though it is true that the
weather was so violent hot that there was no need
of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked: no, though
I had been inclined to it, which I was not; nor could
I abide the thought of it, though I was all alone.
One reason why I could not go quite naked was,
I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
quite naked as with some clothes on; nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin; whereas, with a
shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whist-
ling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without
it; no more could I ever bring myself to go out in
the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat; the heat
of the sun beating with such violence as it does in
that place, would give me the headache presently, by
darting so directly on my head, without a cap or hat
on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on
my hat, it would presently go away.
Upon these views I began to consider about put-
173
ting the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into
some order: I had worn out all the waistcoats I had,
and my business was now to try if I could not make
jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by
me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set
to work a-tailoring, or rather indeed a-botching; for
I made most piteous work of it. However, I made
shift to make two or three waistcoats, which I hoped
would serve me a great while; as for breeches or
drawers, I made but very sorry shift indeed till
afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the
creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and
I had hung them up stretched out with sticks in the
sun; by which means some of them were so dry and
hard, that they were fit for little; but others, it seems,
were very useful. The first thing I made of these
was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the
outside to shoot off the rain: and this I performed
so well, that after this I made a suit of clothes wholly
of those skins; that is to say, a waistcoat and breeches
open at the knees, and both loose; for they were
rather wanted to keep me cool than to keep me
warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they
were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter,
I was a worse tailor; however, they were such as I
made a very good shift with; and when I was abroad,
if it happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and
cap being outmost, I was kept very dry.
After this, I spent a deal of time and pains to
make me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want
of one, and had a great mind to make one: I had
seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very
useful in the great heats which are there; and I felt
the heats every jot as great here, and greater too,
being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged
to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me,
as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of
pains at it, and was a great while before I could
make anything likely to hold; nay, after I thought
I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I
made one to my mind, but at last I made one that
answered indifferently well. The main difficulty I
found was to make it to let down: I could make it
to spread; but if it did not let down too, and draw in,
it would not be portable for me any way, but just
over my head, which would not do. However, at
last, as I said, I made one to answer; I covered it
with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the
rain like a penthouse, and kept off the sun so effec-
tually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the
weather, with greater advantage than I could before
in the coolest; and when I had no need of it, I could
close it and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed by resigning to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal ef His
providence: this made my life better than sociable;
for, when I began to regret the want of conversation,
I would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutu-
ally with my own thoughts, and as I hope I may
say, with even my Maker, by ejaculations and
petitions, was not better than the utmost enjoyment
of human society in the world?
I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any
extraordinary thing happened to me; but I lived
175
on in the same course, in the same posture and place,
just as before. The chief thing I was employed in,
besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I always
kept up just enough to have a sufficient stock of the
year's provisions beforehand; I say, besides this
yearly labour, and my daily labour of going out with
my gun, I had one labour to make me a canoe, which
at last I finished: so that by digging a canal to it,
six feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the
creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, that was
so vastly big, as I made it without considering before-
hand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to launch
it; so, never being able to bring it to the water, or
bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where
it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser next
time. Indeed, the next time, though I could not get
a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could
not get the water to it, at any less distance than, as I
have said, of near half a mile; yet as I saw it was
practicable at last, I never gave it over; and though
I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged
my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea
at last.
CHAPTER X.
1 SUCCEED IN GETTING A CANOE AFLOAT, AND SET OUT ON
A VOYAGE IN THE SIXTH YEAR OF MY REIGN, OR CAP-
TIVITY—BLOWN OUT TO SEA—REACH THE SHORE WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY—FALL ASLEEP, AND AM AWAKENED BY A VOICE CALLING MY NAME—DEVISE VARIOUS SCHEMES TO TAME GOATS, AND AT LAST
SUCCEED.
HOWEVER, though my little periagua was finished,
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the
design which I had in view, when I made the first;
I mean of venturing over to the Terra Firma, where
it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as I
had a boat, my next design was to make a tour
round the island : for, as I had been on the other
side, in one place, crossing, as I have already de-
scribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that journey made me very eager to see the other
parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I thought
of nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do everything
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail to it out of some
of the pieces of the ship's sails, which lay in store, and
of which I had a great store by me.
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
I found she would sail very well. Then I made little
177
lockers and boxes at each end of my boat, to put
provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, &c., into, to
be kept dry either from rain, or the spray of the sea;
and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside of
the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to
hang down over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern,
like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the
heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus I
every now and then took a little voyage upon the
sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little
creek; but at last, being eager to view the circum-
ference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my
tour, and accordingly I victualled my ship for the
voyage; putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes
I should rather call them) of barley-bread; an
earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I ate a great
deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder
with shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats,
of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved
out of the seamen's chests; these I took, one to lie
upon, and the other to cover me in the night.
It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I
set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer
than I expected; for though the island itself was
not very large, yet when I came to the east side of
it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two
leagues into the sea, some above water, some under
it; and beyond this a shoal of sand, lying dry half
a league more: so that I was obliged to go a great
way out to sea to double that point.
When I first discovered them, I was going to give
VOL. L M
over my enterprise, and come back again, not know-
ing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and,
above all, doubting how I should get back again; so
I came to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of
an anchor, with a peace of broken grappling which
I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and
went on shore, climbing up a hill, which seemed to
overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of
it; and resolved to venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood,
I perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious
current, which ran to the east, even came close to
the point; and I took the more notice of it, because
I saw there might be some danger, that when I came
into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength
of it, and not be able to make the island again.
And indeed, had I not gotten first upon this hill,
I believe it would have been so; for there was the
same current on the other side of the island, only
that it set off at a farther distance; and I saw there
was a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing
to do but to get out of the first current, and I should
presently be in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; because the wind
blowing pretty fresh (at E.S.E., and that being just
contrary to the said current), made a great breach
of the sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for
me to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor
to go too far off because of the stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over-night, the sea was calm, and I ventured:
but I am a warning-piece again to all rash and igno-
179
rant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point,
when I was not my boat's length from the shore, but
I found myself in a great depth of water, and a cur-
rent like a sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along
with it with such violence, that all I could do could
not keep her so much as on the edge of it: but I
found it hurried me farther and farther out from the
eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no
wind stirring to help me, and all that I could do with
my paddles signified nothing; and now I began to
give myself over for lost; for, as the current was on
both sides the island, I knew in a few leagues'
distance they must join again, and then I was
irrecoverably gone: nor did I see any possibility of
avoiding it; so that I had no prospect before me
but of perishing; not by the sea, for that was calm
enough, but of starving for hunger. I had indeed
found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I
could lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I
had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of
my earthen pots; but what was all this to being
driven into the vast ocean, where to be sure, there
was no shore, no mainland or island, for a thousand
leagues at least?
And now I saw how easy it was for the providence
of God to make the most miserable condition that
mankind could be in, worse. Now I looked back
upon my desolate solitary island as the most pleasant
place in the world, and all the happiness my heart
could wish for was to be there again: I stretched out
my hands to it with eager wishes; "Oh happy desert!"
said I, " I shall never see thee more! Oh miserable
creature!" said I," whither am I going?" Then I re-
proached myself with my unthankful temper, and
how I had repined at my solitary condition; and
now what would I give to be on shore there again?
Thus we never see the true state of our condition
till it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor know
how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it.
It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I
was now in, being driven from my beloved island (for
so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean,
almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever
recovering it again: however, I worked hard, till
indeed my strength was almost exhausted; and kept
my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards
the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as
possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun passed
the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind
in my face, springing up from the S.S.E. This
cheered my heart a little, and especially, when in about
half an hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale.
By this time I was gotten at a frightful distance
from the island; and, had the least cloud or hazy
weather intervened, I had been undone another way
too; for I had no compass on board, and should
never have known how to have steered towards the
island, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the
weather continuing clear I applied myself to get up
my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away
to the north as much as possible, to get out of the
current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw even by the clearness
of the water some alteration of the current was near;
for where the current was so strong, the water was
foul: but perceiving the water clear, I found the
current abate, and presently I found to the east, at
about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some
rocks: these rocks I found caused the current to part
again; and as the main stress of it ran away more
southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the
other returned by the repulse of the rock, and made
a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-
west with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves just going to murder them,'or who have
been in such-like extremities, may guess what my
present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my
boat into the stream of this eddy; and the wind also
freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running
cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or
eddy under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way
back again directly towards the island, but about
two leagues more towards the northward than the
current lay, which carried me away at first; so that
when I came near the island, I found myself open
to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other
end of the island, opposite to that which I went out
from.
When I had made something more than a league
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found
it was spent, and served me no farther. However,
I found, that being between the two great currents,
viz., that on the south side which had hurried me
away, and that on the north which lay about two
leagues on the other side; I say, between these two,
in the west of the island, I found the water at least
still, and running no way; and having still a breeze
of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for
the island, though not making such fresh way as I
did before.
About four o'clock in the evening, being then
within about a league of the island, I found the point
of the rocks which occasioned this distance stretch-
ing out as is described before, to the southward, and
casting off the current more southwardly, had of
course made another eddy to the north; and this I
found very strong, not directly setting the way my
course lay, which was due west, but almost full north.
However, having a fresh gale, I stretched across this
eddy slanting north-west, and in about an hour came
within about a mile of the shore, where, it being
smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave
God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and
refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had
espied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep,
being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew
too much the cause, to think of attempting it by the
way I went out; and what might be at the other
side (I mean the west side), I knew not, nor had I
any mind to run any more ventures; so I only re-
solved in the morning to make my way westward
along the shore, and to see if there was no creek
where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to
have her again if I wanted her. In about three
miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to
a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet, or brook,
where I found a convenient harbour for my boat,
and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock
made on purpose for her; here I put in, and having
stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to look
about me, and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the place
where I had been before when I travelled on foot to
that shore; so, taking nothing out of my boat but
my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot,
I began my march: the way was comfortable enough
after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached
my old bower in the evening, where I found every-
thing standing as I left it; for I always kept it in
good order, being, as I said before, my country-
house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the
shade to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and
fell asleep; but judge if you can, you that read my
story, what a surprise I must be in, when I was
awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by my
name several times, " Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe,
poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe?
Where are you? Where have you been?"
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of
the day, and walking the latter part, that I did not
awake thoroughly; and dozing between sleeping and
waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to
me; but as the voice continued to repeat Robin
Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to awake more
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and
started up in the utmost consternation: but no
sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Pol sitting
on the top of the hedge, and immediately knew that
this was he that spoke to me; for just in such be-
moaning language I had used to talk to him, and
teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that
he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to
my face, and cry, "Poor Robin Crusoe, where are
you? Where have you been? How came you here?"
and such things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot,
and that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a
good while before I could compose myself. First, I
was amazed how the creature got thither, and then
how he should just keep about the place, and nowhere
else: but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody
but honest Pol, I got it over; and holding out my
hand, and calling him by his name, Pol, the sociable
creature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he
used to do, and continued talking to me, Poor Robin
Crusoe, and, how did I come here? and, where had I
been? just as if he had been overjoyed to see me
again; and so I carried him home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some
time, and had enough to do for many days to sit still
and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I would
have been very glad to have had my boat again on
my side of the island, but I knew not how it was
practicable to get it about: as to the east side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart
would shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to
think of it: and to the other side of the island, I did
not know how it might be there; but supposing the
current ran with the same force against the shore
at the east, as it passed by it on the other, I might
run the same risk of being driven down the stream,
and carried by the island, as I had been before of
being carried away from it. So with these thoughts
I contented myself to be without any boat, though it
had been the product of so many months' labour to
make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained near
a year, lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may
well suppose; and my thoughts being very much
composed as to my condition, and fully comforted
in resigning myself to the dispositions of Providence,
I thought I lived really very happily in all things,
except that of society.
I improved myself in-this time in all the mechanic
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying
myself to; and I believe could, upon occasion, have
made a very good carpenter, especially considering
how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection
in my earthenware, and contrived well enough to
make them with a wheel, which I found infinitely
easier and better; because I made things round and
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for anything I found
out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe;
and though it was a very ugly clumsy thing when it
was done, and only burnt red like other earthenware,
yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the
smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; for I
had been always used to smoke, and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards when
I searched the ship again, I could not come at any
pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention showed me, though not very handsome, yet
convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching
things home in. For example, if I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress
it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket:
and the like by a turtle; I could cut it up, take out
the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh, which was
enough for me, and bring them home in a basket,
and leave the rest behind me. Also large deep baskets
were my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept it in
great baskets instead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated consider-
ably ; and this was a want which it was impossible for
me to supply, and I began seriously to consider what
I must do when I should have no more powder; that
is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I had, as
I observed, in the third year of my being here, kept
a young kid, and bred her tame; I was in hopes of
getting a he-kid, but I could not by any means bring
it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I could
never find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last
of mere age.
187
But being now in the eleventh year of my residence,
and, as I have said, my ammunition growing low, I
set myself to study some art to trap and snare the
goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them
alive; and particularly I wanted a she-goat great
with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them,
and believe they were more than once taken in them;
but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and
always found them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I had
observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits
I placed hurdles, of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them; and several times I put ears of
barley, and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I
could easily perceive, that the goats had gone in, and
eaten up the corn, that I could see the mark of their
feet; at length, I set three traps in one night, and
going the next morning, I found them all standing,
and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very dis-
couraging; however, I altered my trap; and, not to
trouble you with particulars, going one morning to
see my traps, I found in one of them a large old he-
goat; and, in one of the other three kids, a male and
two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him;
he was so fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him;
that is to say, to go about to bring him away alive,
which was what I wanted. I could have killed him,
but that was not my business, nor would it answer
my end; so I e'en let him out, and he ran away as if
he had been frightened out of his wits; but I did not
then know what I afterwards learnt, that hunger would
tame a lion: if I had let him stay there three or four
days without food, and then have carried him some
water to drink, and then a little corn, he would have
been as tame as one of the kids; for they are mighty
sagacious tractable creatures, where they are well
used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no
better at that time: then I went to the three kids;
and, taking them one by one, I tied them with strings
together; and with some difficulty brought them all
home.
It was a good while before they would feed; but
throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame: and now I found, that
if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh,
when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some
up tame was my only way, when perhaps I might
have them about my house like a flock of sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I must
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would
always run wild when they grew up; and the only
way for this was to have some enclosed piece of
ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to
keep them up so effectually, that those within might
not break out, or those without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of
hands; yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity
of doing it, my first piece of work was to find out a
proper piece of ground; viz., where there was likely
to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to
drink, and cover to keep them from the sun. Those who understand such enclosures, will think
189
I had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a
place very proper for all these, being a plain open
piece of meadow-land or savannah (as our people
call it in the western colonies), which had two or
three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end
was very woody; I say they will smile at my fore-
cast, when I shall tell them I began my enclosing
of this piece of ground in such a manner that my
hedge or pale must have been at least two miles
about: nor was the madness of it so great as to the
compass; for if it was ten miles about, I was like to
have time enough to do it in; but I did not consider,
that my goats would be as wild in so much compass,
as if they had had the whole island; and I should
have so much room to chase them in, that I should
never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to
me; so I presently stopped short, and for the first
beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of about one
hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as
many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as
my flock increased, I could add more ground to my
enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done it, I
tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and
used them to feed as near me as possible, to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and
feed them out of my hand;, so that after my enclo-
sure was finished, and I let them loose, they would
follow me up and down, bleating after me for a
handful of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and a
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all;
and in two years more I had three-and-forty, besides
several that I took and killed for my food; and after
that I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed
them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take
them as I wanted them; and gates out of one piece
of ground into another.
But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing
which indeed in my beginning I did not so much as
think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,
was really an agreeable surprise; for now I set up
my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk
in a day. And as nature, who gives supplies of food
to every creature, dictates even naturally how to
make use of it; so I, that never milked a cow, much
less a goat, or saw butter or cheese made, very
readily and handily, though after a great many essays
and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese
at last, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat His
creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can
He sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us
cause to praise Him for dungeons and prisons! What
a table was here spread for me in a wilderness, where
I saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!
It would have made a stoic smile to have seen
me and my little family sit down to dinner: there
191
was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole
island; I had the lives of all my subjects at absolute
command; I could hang, draw, give life and liberty
and take it away, and no rebels among all my sub-
jects.
Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone,
attended by my servants! Pol, as if he had been my
favourite, as the only person permitted to talk to me;
my dog, which was now grown very old and crazy,
and found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat
always at my right hand; and two cats, one on one
side the table, and one on the other, expecting now
and then a bit from my hand as a mark of special
favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at first; for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my habitation by my own
hands; but one of them having multiplied by I know
not what kind of creature, these were two which I
preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild into the
woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at
last; for they would often come into my house, and
plunder me too, till at last I was obliged to shoot
them, and did kill a great many: at length they left
me. With this attendance, and in this plentiful
manner, I lived; neither could I be said to want
anything but society, and of that, in some time
after this, I was like to have too much.
CHAPTER XI.
DESCRIPTION OF MY FIGURE—ALSO OF MY DWELLING AND ENCLOSURES DREADFUL ALARM ON SEEING THE
PRINT OF A MAN'S FOOT ON THE SHORE REFLECTIONS
TAKE EVERY POSSIBLE MEASURE OF PRECAUTION.
I WAS something impatient, as I had observed, to
have the use of my boat, though very loath to run
any more hazard; and therefore sometimes I sat
contriving ways to get her about the island, and at
other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my
mind to go down to the point of the island, where,
as I have said in my last ramble, I went up the hill
to see how the shore lay, and how the current set,
that I might see what I had to do. This inclination
increased upon me every day, and at length I resolved
to travel thither by land, and following the edge of
the shore, I did so: but had any one in England
been to meet such a man as I was, it must either
have frighted them, or raised a great deal of laughter;
and as I frequently stood still to look at myself, I
could not but smile at the notion of my travelling
through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such
a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure as
follows:
I had a great high shapeless cap made of goat's
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to
keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain off from
running into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in
these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the
clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts
coming down to about the middle of my thighs; and
a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same: the
breeches were made of a skin of an old he-goat,
whose hair hung down such a length on either side
that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my
legs. Stockings and shoes I had none; but I had
made me a pair of something, I scarce knew what to
call them, like buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace
on either side like spatterdashes; but of a most
barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my
clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the same, instead
of buckles; and in a kind of a frog on either side of
this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little
saw and a hatchet; one on one side, one on the
other: I had another belt, not so broad, and fastened
in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder;
and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two
pouches, both made of goat's skin too; in one of
which hung my powder, in the other my shot: at my
back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun,
and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin
umbrella; but which, after all, was the most neces-
sary thing I had about me, next to my gun. As for
my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-
like as one might expect from a man not at all care-
ful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the
equinox. My beard I had once suffered to grow till
it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had
VOL. I. N
both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty
short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I saw
at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear such, though
the Turks did: of these mustachios, or whiskers, I
will not say they were long enough to hang my hat
upon them; but they were of length and shape mon-
strous enough, and such as in England would have
passed for frightful.
But all this is by the by: for as to my figure, I
had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner
of consequence; so I say no more to that part. In
this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was
out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-
shore, directly to the place where I first brought my
boat to an anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and
having no boat now to take care of, I went over the
land a nearer way, to the same height that I was
upon before; when looking forward to the point of
the rock which lay out, and which I was to double
with my boat, as I said above, I was surprised to
see the sea all smooth and quiet; no rippling, no
motion, no current, any more there than in other
places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and re-
solved to spend some time in the observing of it, to
see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occa-
sioned it: but I was presently convinced how it was;
viz., that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and
joining with the current of waters from some great
river on the shore, must be the occasion of this
current, and that according as the wind blew more
forcible from the west, or from the north, this current
came near, or went farther from the shore; for, wait-
ing thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock
again, and then, the tide of ebb being made, I plainly
saw the current again as before, only that it ran
farther off, being near half a league from the shore;
whereas, in my case, it set close upon the shore, and
hurried me in my canoe along with it, which at
another time it would not have done.
This observation convinced me that I had nothing
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of
the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about
the island again: but when I began to think of put-
ting it in practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits
at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that
I could not think of it again with any patience; but
on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which
was more safe, though more laborious; and this was
that I would build, or rather make me another peria-
gua, or canoe; and so have one for one side of the
island, and one for the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under
the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this
time I had enlarged into several apartments or caves,
one within another. One of these, which was the
driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my
wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond where my
wall joined to the rock, was all filled up with large
earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and
with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would
hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my
stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the
ear cut off short from the straw, and the other rubbed
out with my hands.
As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and spread so very much,
that there was not the least appearance, to any one's
view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two
pieces of corn-ground; which I kept duly cultivated
and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest
in its season: and whenever I had occasion for more
corn, I had more land adjoining, as fit as that.
Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there also; for first, I had
my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair;
that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled it in, con-
stantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder stand-
ing always in the inside; I kept the trees, which at
first were no more than stakes, but were now grown
very firm and tall,—I kept them always so cut, that
they might spread and grow thick and wild, and
make the more agreeable shade, which they did
effectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had
my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail
spread over poles set up for that purpose, and which
never wanted any repair or renewing; and under
this I had made me a squab or couch, with the skins
of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft
things, and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged
to our sea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great
watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had
197
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up
my country habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my
cattle, that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose
this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
lest the goats should break through, that I never left
off till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of
the edge so full of small stakes, and so near to one
another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and
there was scarce room to put a hand through be-
tween them, which afterwards, when those stakes
grew, as they all did in the next rainy season, made
the enclosure strong, like a wall; indeed, stronger
than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever
appeared necessary for my comfortable support; for
I considered the keeping up a breed of tame crea-
tures thus at my hand, would be a living magazine of
flesh, milk, butter, and cheese, for me, as long as I
lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and
that keeping them in my reach depended entirely
upon my perfecting my enclosures, to such a degree
that I might be sure of keeping them together;
which by this method indeed I so effectually secured,
that when these little stakes began to grow, I had
planted them so very thick, I was forced to pull
some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter store of
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable
only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and re-
freshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half-way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my
boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my way
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and
I kept all things about or belonging to her in very
good order: sometimes I went out in her to divert
myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go,
nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the
shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out of
my knowledge again by the currents, or winds, or any
other accident. But now I come to a new scene of
my life.
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very
plain to be seen in the sand: I stood like one thunder-
struck, or as if I had seen an apparition; I listened,
I looked round me, I could hear nothing, nor see
anything; I went up to a rising ground to look
farther; I went up the shore and down the shore,
but it was all one, I could see no other impression
but that one; I went to it again to see if there were
any more, and to observe if it might not be my
fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was
exactly the very print of a foot, toes, heel, and every
part of a foot; how it came thither I knew not, nor
could in the least imagine. But after innumerable
fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused
and out of myself, I came home to my fortification,
not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but
199
terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at
every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and
tree, and fancing every stump at a distance to be a
man; nor is it possible to describe how many various
shapes an affrighted imagination represented things
to me in; how many wild ideas were formed every
moment in my fancy, and what strange unaccount-
able whimsies came into my thoughts by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued;
whether I went over by the ladder, as first con-
trived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I
called a door, I cannot remember; for never frighted
hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror
of mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night; the farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my appre-
hensions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so em-
barrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to
myself, even though I was now a great way off it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil; and
reason joined in with me upon this supposition. For
how should any other thing in human shape come
into the place? Where was the vessel that brought
them? What marks were there of any other foot-
steps? And how was it possible a man should come
there? But then to think that Satan should take
human shape upon him in such a place, where there
could be no manner of occasion for it but to leave
the print of his foot behind him, and that even for
no purpose too (for he could not be sure I should
see it), this was an amazement the other way: I
considered that the devil might have found out
abundance of other ways to have terrified me than
this of the single print of a foot; that, as I lived
quite on the other side of the island, he would never
have been so simple to leave a mark in a place where
it was ten thousand to one whether I should ever see
it or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of
the sea upon a high wind would have defaced entirely.
All this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and
with all notions we usually entertain of the subtlety
of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue
me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil.
And I presently concluded that it must be some more
dangerous creature; viz., that it must be some of the
savages of the mainland over against me, who had
wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either driven
by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made the
island, and had been on shore, but were gone away
again to sea, being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed
in this desolate island as I would have been to have
had them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my
mind, I was very thankful in my thought, that I
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,
or that they did not see my boat, by which they
would have concluded that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther
for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my imagina-
tion about their having found my boat, and that
there were people here; and that if so, I should
201
certainly have them come again in greater numbers
and devour me; that if it should happen so that
they should not find me, yet they would find my
enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away all my
flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for
mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope; all
that former confidence in God, which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of His
goodness, now vanished; as if He, that had fed me
by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by His power
the provision which He had made for me by His
goodness. I reproached myself with my uneasiness,
that I would not sow any more corn one year, than
would just serve me till the next season, as if no
accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying
the crop that was upon the ground. And this I
thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the
future to have two or three years corn beforehand,
so that, whatever might come, I might not perish
for want of bread.
How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the
life of man! And by what secret differing springs
are the affections hurried about, as differing circum-
stances present! To-day we love what to-morrow
we hate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun;
to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear; nay, even
tremble at the apprehensions of. This was exem-
plified in me at this time in the most lively manner
imaginable; for I, whose only affliction was, that I
seemed banished from human society, that I was
alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off
from mankind, and condemned to what I call a silent
life; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not
worthy to be numbered among the living, or to ap-
pear among the rest of His creatures; that to have
seen one of my own species would have seemed to
me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest
blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme
blessing of salvation, could bestow; I say, that I
should now tremble at the very apprehensions of
seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground
at but the shadow, or silent appearance, of a man's
having set his foot on the island.
Such is the uneven state of human life; and it
afforded me a great many curious speculations after-
wards, when I had a little recovered my first sur-
prise: I considered that this was the station of life
the infinitely wise and good providence of God had
determined for me; that, as I could not foresee
what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this,
so I was not to dispute His sovereignty, who, as I
was His creature, had an undoubted right by crea-
tion to govern and dispose of me absolutely as He
thought fit; and who, as I was a creature who had
offended him, had likewise a judicial right to con-
demn me to what punishment He thought fit; and
that it was my part to submit to bear His indigna-
tion because I had sinned against Him.
I then reflected that God, who was not only
righteous but omnipotent, as He had thought fit
thus to punish and afflict me, so He was able to de-
liver me; that if He did not think fit to do it, it was
my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely
and entirely to His will; and, on the other hand, it
was my duty also to hope in Him, pray to Him, and
203
quietly to attend the dictates and directions of His
daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days,
nay, I may say, weeks and months; and one parti-
cular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I
cannot omit: viz., one morning early, lying in my
bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from
the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed
me very much; upon which those words of the
Scripture came into my thoughts, " Call upon me in
the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me."
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and
encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance.
When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and
opening it to read, the first words that presented to
me were, " Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer,
and He shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on
the Lord." It is impossible to express the comfort
this gave me; and in return, I thankfully laid down
the book and was no more sad, at least, not on that
occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehen-
sions, and reflections, it came into my thoughts one
day that all this might be a mere chimera of my
own, and that this foot might be the print of my own
foot, when I came on shore from my boat. This
cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade
myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else
but my own foot; and why might not I come that
way from the boat, as well as I was going that way
to the boat? Again, I considered also, that I could
by no means tell for certain where I had trod, and
where I had not; and that if at last this was only
the print of my own foot, I had played the part of
those fools who strive to make stories of spectres and
apparitions, and then are themselves frighted at them
more than anybody else.
Now I began to take courage and to peep abroad
again; for I had not stirred out of my castle for
three days and nights, so that I began to starve for
provision; for I had little or nothing within doors
but some barley-cakes and water. Then I knew that
my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually
was my evening diversion: and the poor creatures
were in great pain and inconvenience for want of
it; and indeed it almost spoiled some of them, and
almost dried up their milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief that
this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet
(and so I might be truly said to start at my own
shadow), I began to go abroad again, and went to
my country-house to milk my flock; but to see with
what fear I went forward, how often I looked be-
hind me, how I was ready every now and then to
lay down my basket and run for my life; it would
have made any one have thought I was haunted
with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately
most terribly frighted; and so indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a little
bolder, and to think there was really nothing in it
but my own imagination; but I could not persuade
myself fully of this, till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure
it by my own, and see if there was any similitude
or fitness, that I might be assured it was my own
foot. But when I came to the place first, it appeared
evident to me that when I laid up my boat I could
not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabouts.
Secondly, when I came to measure the mark with
my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a
great deal. Both these things filled my head with
new imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to
the highest degree; so that I shook with cold, like
one in an ague, and I went home again filled with
the belief that some man or men had been on shore
there; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, and
I might be surprised before I was aware; and what
course to take for my security I knew not.
Oh what ridiculous resolutions men take when
possessed with fear! It deprives them of the use of
those means which reason offers for their relief. The
first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down
my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the island in prospect of the same, or
the like booty; then to the simple thing of digging
up my two corn-fields, that they might not find such
a grain there, and still be prompted to frequent the
island; then to demolish my bower and tent, that
they might not see any vestiges of my habitation,
and be prompted to look farther, in order to find out
the persons inhabiting.
These were the subjects of the first night's cogita-
tion, after I was come home again, while the appre-
hensions which had so overrun my mind were fresh
upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above.
Thus, fear of danger is ten thousand times more
terrifying than danger itself when apparent to the
eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater by
much than the evil which we are anxious about:
but, which was worse than all this, I had not that
relief in this trouble from the resignation I used to
practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought,
like Saul, who complained not only that the Philis-
tines were upon him, but that God had forsaken
him; for I did not now take due ways to compose
my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and rest-
ing upon His providence, as I had done before, for
my defence and deliverance; which if I had done,
I had, at least, been more cheerfully supported under
this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it
with more resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking
all night; but in the morning I fell asleep, and
having, by the amusement of my mind, been, as it
were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very
soundly, and awaked much better composed than I
had ever been before. And now I began to think
sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with myself,
I concluded, that this island, which was so exceeding
pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the mainland
than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned
as I might imagine: that although there were no
stated inhabitants who lived on the spot; yet that
there might sometimes come boats off from the shore,
who either with design, or perhaps never but when
they were driven by cross winds, might come to this
place.
That I had lived here fifteen years now, and had
207
not met with the least shadow or figure of any people
before; and that if at any time they should be driven
here, it was probable they went away again as soon
as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit
to fix there upon any occasion, to this time.
That the most I could suggest any danger from,
was from any such casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against
their wills; so they made no stay here, but went
off again with all possible speed, seldom staying one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of
the tides and daylight back again; and that there-
fore I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe
retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon
the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my
cave so large, as to bring a door through again,
which door, as I said, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely con-
sidering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a
second fortification, in the manner of a semicircle,
at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted
a double row of trees about twelve years before, of
which I made mention: these trees having been
planted so thick before, there wanted but a few piles
to be driven between them, that they should be
thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon
finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and everything I could think of to make it strong;
having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might
put my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened
my wall to about ten feet thick, continually bringing
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the
wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven
holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I
took notice that I got seven on shore out of the ship;
these, I say, I planted like my cannon, and fitted
them into frames that held them like a carriage, that
so I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes'
time. This wall I was many a weary month in
finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it
was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground without
my wall, for a great way every way, as full with stakes
or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt
to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch that I be-
lieve I might set in near twenty thousand of them,
leaving a pretty large space between them and my
wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and
they might have no shelter from the young trees, if
they attempted to approach my outer wall.
Thus in two years' time I had a thick grove; and
in five or six years' time I had a wood before my
dwelling, grown so monstrous thick and strong, that
it was indeed perfectly impassible; and no man of
what kind soever would ever imagine that there was
anything beyond it, much less a habitation. As for
the way I proposed myself to go in and out (for I left
no avenue), it was by setting two ladders; one to a
part of the rock which was low, and then broke in,
and left room to place another ladder upon that; so
when the two ladders were taken down, no man
living could come down to me without mischiefing
209
himself; and if they had come down, they were still
on the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence
could suggest for my own preservation; and it will
be seen at length that they were not altogether
without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at
that time more than my mere fear suggested.
While this was doing, I was not altogether careless
of my other affairs; for I had a great concern upon
me for my little herd of goats; they were not only
a present supply to me upon every occasion, and
began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of
powder and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my
hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose
the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse
up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
think but of two ways to preserve them: one was to
find another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and
the other was to enclose two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and as much concealed
as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young goats in each place; so that if any disaster
happened to the flock in general, I might be able to
raise them again with little trouble and time: and
this, though it would require a great deal of time
and labour, I thought was the most rational design.
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon
one which was as private indeed as my heart could
wish; for it was a little damp piece of ground in
the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as VOL. I. O
is observed, I almost lost myself once before, en-
deavouring to come back that way from the eastern
part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of
land near three acres, so surrounded with woods
that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least
it did not want near so much labour to make it so,
as the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard
at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground, and in less than a month's time I had so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first
they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it. So without any further delay, I re-
moved ten she-goats and two he-goats to this piece;
and when there, I continued to perfect the fence,
till I had made it as secure as the other, which,
however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up
more time by a great deal.
CHAPTER XII.
/ OBSERVE A CANOE OUT AT SEA—FIND ON THE SHORE THE REMNANT OF A FEAST OF CANNIBALS—HORROR
OF MIND THEREON—DOUBLE ARM MYSELF—TERRIBLY
ALARMED BY A GOAT—DISCOVER A SINGULAR CAVE,
OR GROTTO, OF WHICH I FORM MY MAGAZINE—MY
FEARS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SAVAGES BEGIN TO SUB-
SIDE.
ALL this labour I was at the expense of, purely from
my apprehensions on the account of the print of a
man's foot which I had seen; for as yet I never saw any
human creature come near the island, and I had now
lived two years under these uneasinesses, which in-
deed made my life much less comfortable than it was
before; as may well be imagined, by any who know
what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of
man; and this I must observe with grief too, that the
discomposure of my mind had too great impressions
also upon the religious part of my thoughts; for the
dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages
and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom
found myself in a due temper for application to my
Maker; at least, not with the sedate calmness and
resignation of soul which I was wont to do. I rather
prayed to God as under great affliction and pressure
of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation
every night of being murdered and devoured before
the morning; and I must testify from my experience,
that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affec-
tion is much more the proper frame for prayer than
that of terror and discomposure; and that under the
dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit
for a comforting performance of the duty of praying
to God, than he is for repentance on a sick bed; for
these discomposures affect the mind as the others do
the body; and the discomposure of the mind must
necessarily be as great a disability as that of the
body, and much greater; praying to God being
properly an act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of
my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place to make such
another deposit; when wandering more to the west
point of the island than I had ever done yet, and
looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the
sea at a great distance; I had found a perspective
glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I
saved out of our ship; but I had it not about me,
and this was so remote, that I could not tell what to
make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were
not able to look any longer: whether it was a boat
or not, I do not know: but as I descended from the
hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over; only
I resolved to go no more without a perspective glass
in my pocket.
When I was come down the hill to the end of the
island, where indeed I had never been before, I was
presently convinced that the seeing the print of a
man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island
as I imagined; and, but that it was a special provi-
dence that I was cast upon the side of the island
where the savages never came, I should easily have
known that nothing was more frequent than for the
canoes from the main, when they happened to be a
little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of
the island for harbour; likewise, as they often met,
and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken
any prisoners, would bring them over to this shore,
where, according to their dreadful customs, being all
cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which
hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I
said above, being the S.W. point of the island, I was
perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible
for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing
the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human bodies; and particularly I observed
213
a place where there had been a fire made, and a
circle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit, where it is
supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their
inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-
creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself
from it, for a long while; all my apprehensions were
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of
human nature; which, though I had heard of often,
yet I never had so near a view of before: in short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of
fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from
my stomach, and having vomited with uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to
stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the hill
again with all the speed I could, and walked on to-
wards my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the island,
I stood still awhile as amazed; and then recovering
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my
soul, and with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God
thanks that had cast my first lot in a part of the
world where I was distinguished from such dreadful
creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given
me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to
give thanks for than to complain of; and this above
all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the
hope of His blessing, which was a felicity more than
sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before;
for I observed that these wretches never came to this
island in search of what they could get; perhaps not
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here,
and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered
woody part of it without finding anything to their
purpose. I knew I had been here now almost
eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of
a human creature there before; and might be here
eighteen more as entirely concealed as I was now, if
I did not discover myself to them, which I had no
manner of occasion to do, it being my only business
to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless
I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to
make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and
eating one another up, that I continued pensive and
sad, and kept close within my own circle for almost
two years after this : when I say my own circle, I
mean by it my three plantations, viz., my castle, my
country-seat, which I called my bower, and my en-
closure in the woods; nor did I look after this for
any other use than as an enclosure for my goats; for
the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish
wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing
them as of seeing the devil himself; nor did I so
much as go to look after my boat in all this time,
but began rather to think of making me another; for
I could not think of ever making any more attempts
to bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I
should meet with some of those creatures at sea, in
which, if I had happened to have fallen into their
hands, I knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these people,
began to wear off my uneasiness about them; and I
began to live just in the same composed manner as
before; only with this difference, that I used more
caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of
them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing
my gun, lest any of them on the island should happen
to hear it; and it was therefore a very good provi-
dence to me, that I had furnished myself with a tame
breed of goats, that I had no need to hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch
any more of them after this, it was by traps and
snares, as I had done before; so that for two years
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off,
though I never went out without it; and, which was
more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I
always carried them out with me, or at least two of
them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt: I likewise
furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out
of the ship, and made me a belt to put it in also; so
that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at
when I went abroad, if you add to the former descrip-
tion of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a
great broadsword, hanging at my side in a belt, but
without a scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some
time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be re-
duced to my former calm sedate way of living. All
these things tended to show me more and more how
far my condition was from being miserable, compared
to some others; nay, to many other particulars of
life, which it might have pleased God to have made
my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repin-
ing there would be among mankind, at any condition
of life, if people would rather compare their condi-
tion with those that are worse, in order to be thank-
ful, than be always comparing them with those which
are better, to assist their murmurings and complain-
ings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own
preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention
for my own conveniences, and I had dropped a good
design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon;
and that was, to try if I could not make some of my
barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some
beer: this was really a whimsical thought, and I
reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I
presently saw there would be the want of several
things necessary to the making my beer, that would
be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to
preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have
observed already, I could never compass; no, though
I spent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in
attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place,
I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it
217
work, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet,
had not all these things intervened, I mean the frights
and terrors I was in about the savages, I had under- ,taken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I
seldom gave anything over without accomplishing it,
when I once had it in my head enough to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way; for
night and day I could think of nothing, but how I
might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim
they should bring hither to destroy. It would take
up a larger volume than this whole work is intended
to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or
rather brooded upon in my thoughts, for the destroy-
ing these creatures, or at least frightening them, so
as to prevent their coming hither any more; but all
was abortive; nothing could be possible to take
effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself; and
what could one man do among them, when perhaps
there might be twenty or thirty of them together,
with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which
they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with
my gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the
place where they made their fire, and put in five or
six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled
their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up
all that was near it; but as, in the first place, I should
be very loath to waste so much powder upon them,
my store being now within the quantity of a barrel,
so neither could I be sure of its going off at any
certain time, when it might surprise them; and, at
best, that it would do little more than just blow the
fire about their ears, and fright them, but not suffi-
cient to make them forsake the place; so I laid it
aside, and then proposed, that I would place myself
in ambush in some convenient place, with my three
guns all double loaded, and in the middle of their
bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should be
sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every
shoot; and then falling in upon them with my three
pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if
there were twenty, I should kill them all: this fancy
pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so
full of it that I often dreamed of it; and sometimes
that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.
I went so far with it in my indignation, that I
employed myself several days to find out proper
places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to
watch for them; and I went frequently to the place
itself, which was now grown more familiar to me;
and especially while my mind was thus filled with
thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty
or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it; but
the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of
the barbarous wretches devouring one another, abated
my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the side of the
hill, where I was satisfied I might securely wait till
I saw any of the boats coming, and might then, even
before they would be ready to come on shore, con-
vey myself unseen into thickets of trees, in one of
which there was a hollow large enough to conceal
me entirely; and where I might sit, and observe all
their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their
heads, when they were so close together, as that it
219
would be next to impossible that I should miss my
shoot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of
them at the first shoot.
In this place then I resolved to fix my design;
and accordingly I prepared two muskets and my
ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded
with a brace of slugs each and four or five smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets, and the
fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-
shot of the largest size; I also loaded my pistols
with about four bullets each: and in this posture,
well provided with ammunition for a second and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and in my imagination put it in practice, I continu-
ally made my tour every morning up to the top of
the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it,
about three miles or more, to see if I could observe
any boats upon the sea coming near the island, or
standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this
hard duty, after I had for two or three months con-
stantly kept my watch, but came always back with-
out any discovery, there having not in all that time
been the least appearance, not only on or near the
shore, but not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes
or glasses could reach every way.
As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to
look out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my
design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while in
a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as
the killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an
offence, which I had not at all entered into a discus-
sion of in my thoughts, any further than my passions
were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the
unnatural custom of the people of that country, who,
it seems, had been suffered by Providence, in His
wise disposition of the world, to have no other guide
than that of their own abominable and vitiated
passions; and consequently were left, and perhaps
had been for some ages, to act such horrid things,
and receive such dreadful customs as nothing but
nature, entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actuated
by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them
into; but now, when, as I have said, I began to be
weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made
so long, and so far, every morning in vain; so my
opinion of the action itself began to alter, and I
began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider
what it was I was going to engage in; what autho-
rity or call I had to pretend to be judge and execu-
tioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven
had thought fit for so many ages to suffer, unpunished,
to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of
His judgments upon one another; also, how far these
people were offenders against me, and what right I
had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which
they shed promiscuously one upon another. I de-
bated this very often with myself thus: How do I
know what God himself judges in this particular
case? It is certain these people do not commit this
as a crime; it is not against their own consciences
reproving, or their light reproaching, them. They do
not know it to be an offence, and then commit it
in defiance of Divine justice, as we do in almost all
the sins we commit. They think it no more a crime
to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill
an ox, nor to eat human flesh, than we do to eat
mutton.
When I had considered this a little, it followed
necessarily, that I was certainly in the wrong in it:
that these people were not murderers in the sense
that I had before condemned them in my thoughts,
any more than those Christians were murderers, who
often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or
more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter,
though they threw down their arms and submitted.
In the next place it occurred to me, that albeit the
usage they gave one another was thus brutish and
inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me: these
people had done me no injury: that if they attempted
me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate preserva-
tion to fall upon them, something might be said for
it; but that I was yet out of their power, and they
had really no knowledge of me, and consequently no
design upon me; and therefore it could not be just
for me to fall upon them: that this would justify the
conduct of the Spaniards, in all their barbarities prac-
tised in America, where they destroyed millions of
these people, who, however they were idolators and
barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous
rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards,
very innocent people; and that the rooting them out
of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhor-
rence and detestation, even by the Spaniards them-
selves, at this time; and by all other Christian nations
of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural
piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man;
and such, as for which the very name of a Spaniard
is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people
of humanity, or of Christian compassion: as if the
kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the
product of a race of men who were without principles
of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the
miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of a
generous temper in the mind.
These considerations really put me to a pause, and
to a kind of a full stop; and I began by little and
little to be off of my design, and to conclude I had
taken a wrong measure in my resolutions to attack
the savages; that it was not my business to meddle
with them, unless they first attacked me, and this it
was my business, if possible, to prevent; but that, if
I were discovered and attacked, then I knew my
duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely
to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to
kill every one that not only should be on shore at
that time, but that should ever come on shore after-
wards, if but one of them escaped to tell their country-
people what had happened, they would come over
again by thousands to revenge the death of their
fellows; and I should only bring upon myself a
certain destruction, which at present I had no manner
of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in
principles nor in policy, I ought one way or other
to concern myself in this affair: that my business
was, by all possible means, to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to
223
guess by, that there were any living creatures upon
the island, I mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was
convinced now many ways that I was perfectly out
of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody schemes
for the destruction of innocent creatures, I mean
innocent as to me; as to the crimes they were guilty
of towards one another, I had nothing to do with
them; they were national punishments to make a
just retribution for national offences; and to bring
public judgments upon those who offend in a public
manner, by such ways as best please God.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me, than that I had not
been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much
reason to believe would have been no less a sin than
that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I
gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that
had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness; be-
seeching Him to grant me the protection of His
Providence, that I might not fall into the hands of
barbarians; or that I might not lay my hands upon
them, unless I had a more clear call from Heaven
to do it, in defence of my own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year
after this: and so far was I from desiring an occasion
for falling upon these wretches, that in all that time
I never once went up the hill to see whether there
were any of them in sight, or to know whether any
of them had been on shore there, or not; that I
might not be tempted to renew any of my con-
trivances against them, or be provoked by any ad-
vantage which might present itself to fall upon
them; only this I did, I went and removed my boat,
which I had on the other side of the island, and
carried it down to the east end of the whole island,
where I ran it into a little cove which I found under
some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of
the currents, the savages durst not, at least would
not, come with their boats upon any account what-
soever.
With my boat I carried away everything that I
had left there belonging to her, though not necessary
for the bare going thither; viz., a mast and sail,
which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor,
but indeed, which could not be called either anchor
or grappling; however, it was the best I could make
of its kind. All these I removed, that there might
not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any
appearance of any boat, or of any habitation upon
the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired
than ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than
upon my constant employment, viz., to milk my she-
goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which,
as it was quite on the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger; for certain it is, that these
savage people, who sometimes haunted this island,
never came with any thoughts of finding anything
here, and consequently never wandered off from the
coast; and I doubt not but they might have been
several times on shore, after my apprehensions of
them had made me cautious, as well as before; and
indeed I looked back with some horror upon the
thoughts of what my condition would have been, if
I had chopped upon them, and been discovered
225
before that, when naked and unarmed, except with
one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot.
I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the
island, to see what I could get: what a surprise
should I have been in, if, when I discovered the print
of a man's foot, I had instead of that seen fifteen or
twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and,
by the swiftness of their running, no possibility of
my escaping them!
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul
within me, and distressed my mind so much, that I
could not soon recover it; to think what I might
have done, and how I not only should not have been
able to resist them, but even should not have had
presence of mind enough to do what I should have
done; much less what now, after so much considera-
tion and preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed,
after serious thinking of these things, I would be very
melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great
while; but I resolved it at last all into thankfulness
to that Providence which had delivered me from so
many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those
mischiefs, which I could no way have been the agent
in delivering myself from; because I |had not the
least notion of any such thing depending, or the least
supposition of its being possible.
This renewed a contemplation, which often had
come to my thoughts in former time, when first I
began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in
the dangers we run through in this life; how wonder-
fully we are delivered when we know nothing of it;
how, when we are in a quandary (as we call it), a
VOL. L P
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or that
way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we
intended to go another way; nay, when sense, our
own inclination, and perhaps business, has called to
go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the
mind, from we know not what springs, and by we
know not what power, shall overrule us to go this
way; and it shall afterwards appear, that had we
gone that way which we would have gone, and even
to our imagination ought to have gone, we should
have been ruined and lost. Upon these, and many
like reflections, I afterwards made it a certain rule
with me, that whenever I found those secret hints, or
pressings of my mind, to doing or not doing anything
that presented, or to going this way or that way, I
never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I
knew no other reason for it, than that such a pressure,
or such a hint, hung upon my mind: I could give
many examples of the success of this conduct in the
course of my life; but more especially in the latter
part of my inhabiting this unhappy island; besides
many occasions which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of if I had seen with the same eyes
then that I saw with now: but it is never too late
to be wise; and I cannot but advise all considering
men, whose lives are attended with such extraordinary
incidents as mine, or even though not so extra-
ordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of
Providence, let them come from what invisible in-
telligence they will; that I shall not discuss, and
perhaps cannot account for: but certainly they are a
proof of the converse of spirits, and the secret com-
munication between those embodied, and those un-
227
embodied; and such a proof as can never be with-
stood: of which I shall have occasion to give some
very remarkable instances in the remainder of my
solitary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it
strange, if I confess that these anxieties, these con-
stant dangers I lived in, and the concern that was now
upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the
contrivances that I had laid for my future accommo-
dations and conveniences. I had the care of my
safety more now upon my hands than that of my
food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of
wood now, for fear the noise I should make should
be heard; much less would I fire a gun, for the same
reason; and, above all, I was very uneasy at making
any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great
distance in the day, should betray me; and for this
reason I removed that part of my business which
required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in the wood; where, after I
had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable conso-
lation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in
a vast way, and where, I daresay, no savage, had he
been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to ven-
ture in, nor indeed would any man else, but one who,
like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where, by mere accident (I would say,
if I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe all
such things now to Providence), I was cutting down
some thick branches of trees to make charcoal; and
before I go on, I must observe the reason of my
making this charcoal, which was thus:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habita-
tion, as I said before; and yet I could not live there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so
I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen
done in England under turf, till it became chark, or
dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved
the coal to carry home, and perform the other
services which fire was wanting for at home, without
danger or smoke.
But this by the by. While I was cutting down
some wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick
branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there was a
kind of hollow place: I was curious to look into it,
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I
found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for
me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with
me; but I must confess to you, I made more haste
out than I did in; when looking further into the
place, which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad
shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man
I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim
light from the cave's mouth shining directly in and
making the reflection.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself,
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone, and
that I durst to believe there was nothing in this cave
that was more frightful than myself: upon this,
plucking up my courage, I took up a large firebrand,
and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my
hand: I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost
as much frightened as I was before; for I heard a
229
very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain; and
it was followed by a broken noise, as if of words half-
expressed, and then a deep sigh again: I stepped
back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise,
that it put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had a
hat on my head, I will not answer for it that my hair
might not have lifted it off. But still plucking up
my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging my-
self a little, with considering that the power and
presence of God was everywhere, and was able to
protect me; upon this I stepped forward again, and
by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little
over my head, I saw lying on the ground a most
monstrous frightful old he-goat, just making his will,
as we say gasping for life, and dying indeed of mere
old age.
I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out,
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise
himself; and I thought with myself, he might even
lie there; for if he had frightened me so, he would
certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them
should be so hardy as to come in there, while he had
any life in him.
I was now recovered from my surprise, and began
to look round me, when I found the cave was but
very small; that is to say, it might be about twelve
feet over, but in no manner of shape, either round or
square, no hands having ever been employed in
making it but those of mere nature: I observed also,
that there was a place at the further side of it that
went in further, but so low, that it required me to
creep upon my hands and knees to get into it, and
whither it went I knew not; so having no candle, I
gave it over for some time, but resolved to come again
the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-
box, which I had made of the lock of one of the
muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with
six large candles of my own making, for I made very
good candles now of goat's tallow; and going into
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours,
as I have said, almost ten yards; which by the way,
I thought was a venture bold enough, considering
that I knew not how far it might go, or what was
beyond it. When I was got through the strait, I
found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the
island, I daresay, as it was, to look round the sides
and roof of this vault or cave. The walls reflected a
hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles;
what it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any
other precious stones, or gold, which I rather sup-
posed it to be, I knew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had
a sort of small loose gravel upon it; so that there was
no nauseous creature to be seen; neither was there
any damp or wet on the sides of the roof: the only
difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as it
was a place of security, and such a retreat as I
wanted, I thought that was a convenience; so that I
was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved,
without any delay, to bring some of those things
which I was most anxious about to this place; parti-
cularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of
powder, and all my spare arms; viz., two fowling-
pieces (for I had three in all), and three muskets (for
of them I had eight in all); so I kept at my castle
only five, which stood ready mounted, like pieces of
cannon, on my utmost fence, and were ready also to
take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I
was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I
took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and
I found that the water had penetrated about three
or four inches into the powder on every side, which,
caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside
like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the
cask; and this was an agreeable discovery to me at
that time; so I carried all away thither, never keep-
ing above two or three pounds of powder with me in
my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind; I also
carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants,
which were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks,
where none could come at them; for I persuaded
myself while I was here, if five hundred savages were
to hunt me, they could never find me out; or if they
did, they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave the next day after I made this
discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a great
hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with
earth, than to drag him out: so I interred him there
to prevent offence to my nose.

WHICH I DISCERN TO BE SPANISH PROCURE A GREAT
VARIETY OF ARTICLES FROM THE VESSEL.
I WAS now in my twenty-third year of residence in
this island, and was so naturalised to the place, and
to the manner of living, that could I have but en-
joyed the certainty that no savages would come to
the place to disturb me, I could have been content
to have capitulated for spending the rest of my time
there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me
down and died, like the old goat, in the cave: I had
also arrived to some little diversions and amusements,
which made the time pass more pleasantly with me
a great deal than it did before; as, first, I had
taught my Pol, as I noted before, to speak: and he
did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and
plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived
with me no less than six-and-twenty years: how
long he might live afterwards I knew not; though
I know they have a notion in the Brazils, that they
live a hundred years; perhaps some of my Pols may
be alive there still, calling after poor Robin Crusoe
to this day; I wish no Englishman the ill luck to
come there and hear them; but if he did, he would
233
certainly believe it was the devil. My dog was a
very pleasant and loving companion to me for no
less than sixteen years of my time, and then died of
mere old age; as for my cats, they multiplied, as I
have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to
shoot several of them at first, to keep them from
devouring me and all I had; but at length, when
the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and
after some time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no provision with me, they
all ran wild into the woods, except two or three
favourites, which I kept tame, and whose young,
when they had any, I always drowned, and these
were part of my family: besides these, I always kept
two or three household kids about me, which I taught
to feed out of my hand; and I had also more parrots
which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin
Crusoe, but none like my first; nor, indeed, did I take
the pains with any of them that I had done with him:
I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose names I
know not, which I caught upon the shore, and cut
their wings; and the little stakes which I had planted
before my castle wall, being now grown up to a good
thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low
trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to
me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well
contented with the life I led, if it might but have
been secured from the dread of savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it might not be
amiss for all people who shall meet with my story,
to make this just observation from it, viz., How
frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil, which
in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we
are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is often-
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
times the very means or door of our deliverance, by
which alone we can be raised again from the afflic-
tion we are fallen into. I could give many examples
of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but
in nothing was it more particularly remarkable, than
in the circumstances of my last years of solitary
residence in this island.
It was now the month of December, as I said
above, in my twenty-third year; and this being the
southern solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was
the particular time of my harvest, and required my
being pretty much abroad in the fields; when going
out pretty early in the morning, even before it was
thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a
light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from
me of about two miles towards the end of the island,
where I had observed some savages had been, as
before; but not on the other side; but, to my great
affliction, it was on my side of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no more
peace within, from the apprehensions I had, that if
these savages, in rambling over the island, should
find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works
and improvements, they would immediately con-
clude that there were people in the place, and would
then never give over till they found me out. In this
extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled
up the ladder after me, having made all things with-
out look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in
a posture of defence; I loaded all my cannon, as I
called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were
235
mounted upon my new fortification, and all my
pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last
gasp; not forgetting seriously to recommend myself
to the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God
to deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians; and
in this posture I continued about two hours, but
began to be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad,
for I had no spies to send out.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting
in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the
side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I
observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after
me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of
the hill; and pulling out my perspective glass, which
I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on my
belly on the ground, and began to look for the place.
I presently found there were no less than nine naked
savages sitting round a small fire they had made;
not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the
weather being extreme hot; but, as I supposed, to
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh
which they had brought with them, whether alive
or dead I could not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore; and as it was then tide of
ebb, they seemed to me to wait the return of the
flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine
what confusion this sight put me into, especially
seeing them come on my side the island, and so near
me too; but when I observed their coming must be
always with the current of the ebb, I began after-
wards to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied
that I might go abroad with safety all the time of
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
tide of flood, if they were not on shore before; and
having made this observation, I went abroad about
my harvest work with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take boat,
and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away: I should
have observed, that for an hour and more before
they went off, they went to dancing, and I could
easily discern their postures and gestures by my
glasses: I could only perceive, by my nicest obser-
vation, that they were stark naked, and had not the
least covering upon them; but whether they were
men or women, that I could not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a
scabbard; and with all the speed I was able to make,
I went away to the hill, where I had discovered the
first appearance of all. As soon as I got thither,
which was not less than two hours (for I could not
go apace, being so loaded with arms as I was), I per-
ceived there had been three canoes more of savages
on that place; and looking out further, I saw they
were all at sea together, making over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me, especially, when
going down to the shore, I could see the marks of
horror which the dismal work they had been about
had left behind it, viz., the blood, the bones, and part
of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured by
those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so
filled with indignation at the sight, that I began now
to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
there, let them be who, or how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they
23?
thus made to this island were not very frequent; for
it was above fifteen months before any more of them
came on shore there again; that is to say, I never
saw them, or any footsteps or signals of them, in all
that time; for as to the rainy seasons then they are
sure not to come abroad, at least not so far; yet all
this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the
constant apprehensions I was in of their coming
upon me by surprise; from whence I observe, that
the expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffer-
ing, especially if there is no room to shake off that
expectation, or those apprehensions.
During all this time I was in the murdering humour;
and took up most of my hours, which should have
been better employed, in contriving how to circum-
vent and fall upon them the very next time I should
see them; especially if they should be divided, as
they were the last time, into two parties; nor did I
consider at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten
or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or month,
to kill another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till
I should be at length no less a murderer than they
were in being men-eaters, and perhaps much more so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or
other fall into the hands of those merciless creatures;
if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not with-
out looking round me with the greatest care and cau-
tion imaginable; and now I found to my great comfort,
how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock
or herd of goats; for I durst not, upon any account,
fire my gun, especially near that side of the island
where they usually came, lest I should alarm the
savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was
sure to have them come back again, with perhaps
two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days,
and then I knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months more
before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then
I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is
true, they might have been there once or twice, but
either they made no stay, or, at least, I did not hear
them; but in the month of May, as near as I could
calculate, and in my four and twentieth year, I had
a very strange encounter with them, of which in its
place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen
or sixteen months' interval, was very great; I slept
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often
started out of my sleep in the night; in the day
great troubles overwhelmed my mind: in the night I
dreamed often of killing the savages, and the reasons
why I might justify the doing of it. But to waive all
this for awhile, it was in the middle of May, on the
sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden
calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon the
post still; I say, it was on the sixteenth of May,
that it blew a great storm of wind all day, with a
great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul
night was after it: I know not what was the particular
occasion of it; but as I was reading in the Bible, and
taken up with serious thoughts about my present
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as
I thought, fired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different
nature from any I had met with before; for the
notions this put into my thoughts were quite of an-
other kind: I started up in the greatest haste imagin-
239
able; and in a trice clapped up my ladder to the
middle place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and
mounting it the second time got to the top of the
hill; that very moment a flash of fire bade me listen
for a second gun, which accordingly in about half a
minute I heard, and by the sound knew that it was
from that part of the sea where I was driven out with
the current in my boat.
I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and fired these guns for
signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had this
presence of mind at that minute as to think, that
though I could not help them, it may be they might
help me; so I brought together all the dry wood I
could get at hand, and making a good handsome pile,
I set it on fire upon the hill; the wood was dry, and
blazed freely, and though the wind blew very hard,
yet it burnt fairly out, so that I was certain, if there
was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it,
and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire
blazed up, I heard another gun, and after that several
others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all
night long, till day broke; and when it was broad
day, and the air cleared up, I saw something at a
great distance at sea, full east of the island, whether
a sail, or a hull, I could not distinguish, no, not with
my glasses, the distance was so great, and the wea-
ther still something hazy also: at least it was so out
at sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently con-
cluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being eager,
you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in
my hand, and ran towards the south-east side of the
island, to the rocks, where I had been formerly
carried away with the current, and getting up there,
the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I
could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of
a ship cast away in the night upon those concealed
rocks, which I found when I was out in my boat;
and which rocks, as they checked the violence of
the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or
eddy, were the occasion of my recovering then from
the most desperate hopeless condition that ever I
had been in all my life.
Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E.
and E.N.E. Had they seen the island, as I must
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
thought, have endeavoured to have saved themselves
on shore by the help of their boat; but the firing of
their guns for help, especially when they saw, as I
imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts:
first, I imagined that, upon seeing my light, they
might have put themselves into their boat, and have
endeavoured to make the shore; but that the sea
going very high, they might have been cast away;
other times I imagined, that they might have lost
their boat before, as might be the case many ways;
as particularly, by the breaking of the sea upon their
ship, which many times obliges men to stave, or
take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw
it overboard with their own hands; other times I
imagined they had some other ship or ships in
241
company, who, upon the signals of distress they
had made, had taken them up, and carried them
off; other whiles I fancied they were all gone off
to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the
current that I had been formerly in, were carried out
into the great ocean, where there was nothing but
misery and perishing, and that perhaps they might
by this time think of starving, and of being in a
condition to eat one another.
All these were but conjectures at best; so, in the
condition I was in, I could do no more than look
upon the misery of the poor men, and pity them;
which had still this good effect on my side, that it
gave me more and more cause to give thanks to
God, who had so happily and comfortably provided
for me in my desolate condition; and that of two
ships' companies, who were now cast away upon this
part of the world, not one life should be spared but
mine. I learnt here again to observe, that it is very
rare that the providence of God casts us into any
condition of life so low, or any misery so great, but
we may see something or other to be thankful for,
and may see others in worse circumstances than our
own.
Such certainly was the case with these men, of
whom I could not so much as see room to suppose
any of them were saved; nothing could make it
rational, so much as to wish or expect that they
did not all perish there, except the possibility only
of their being taken up by another ship in company:
and this was but mere possibility indeed; for I
saw not the least signal or appearance of any such
thing.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words,
VOL. I. Q
what a strange longing, or hankering of desire, I
felt in my soul upon this sight; breaking out some-
times thus: "Oh, that there had been but one or two,
nay, but one soul saved out of the ship, to have
escaped to me, that I might but have had one com-
panion, one fellow-creature to have spoken to me,
and to have conversed with!" In all the time of
my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a
desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so
deep a regret at the want of it.
There are some secret moving springs in the affec-
tions which, when they are set a going by some
object in view, or be it some object though not in
view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power
of imagination, that motion carries out the soul by
its impetuosity to such violent eager embracings of
the object, that the absence of it is insupportable.
Such were these earnest wishings, " That but one
man had been saved! Oh, that it had been but one!"
I believe I repeated the words," Oh, that it had been
but one!" a thousand times; and my desires were
so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press
the palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft
thing in my hand, it would have crushed it involun-
tarily; and my teeth in my head would strike to-
gether, and set against one another so strong, that
for some time I could not part them again.
Let the naturalist explain these things, and the
reason and manner of them; all I can say of them
is, to describe the fact, which was ever surprising to
me when I found it, though I knew not from what
it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect of
ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my
243
mind, realising the comfort which the conversation
of one of my fellow-Christians would have been to
me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine,
or both, forbade it; for till the last year of my being
on this island, I never knew whether any were saved
out of that ship, or no; and had only the affliction
some days after to see the corpse of a drowned boy
come on shore, at the end of the island which was
next the shipwreck: he had on no clothes but a sea-
man's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers,
and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so
much as to guess what nation he was of: he had
nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a
tobacco-pipe; the last was to me of ten times more
value than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to ven-
ture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but
I might find something on board that might be use-
ful to me; but that did not altogether press me so
much, as the possibility that there might be yet
some living creature on board, whose life I might
not only save, but might, by saving that life, com-
fort my own to the last degree; and this thought
clung so to my heart, that I could not be quiet night
nor day, but I must venture out in my boat on board
this wreck; and committing the rest to God's pro-
vidence, I thought the impression was so strong
upon my mind that it could not be resisted, that it
must come from some invisible direction, and that I
should be wanting to myself if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared everything for my voy-
age, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for fresh
water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I
had still a great deal of that left), a basket full of
raisins; and thus loading myself with everything
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water
out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo
in her, and then went home again for more: my
second cargo was a great bag full of rice, the um-
brella to set up over my head for shade, another
large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen of
my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before,
with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese; all which
with great labour and sweat I brought to my boat;
and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore,
I came at last to the utmost point of the island, on
that side, viz., N.E. And now I was to launch out
into the ocean, and either to venture, or not to ven-
ture; I looked on the rapid currents which ran con-
stantly on both sides of the island, at a distance, and
which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance
of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart
began to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven
into either of those currents, I should be carried a
vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach or
sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat
was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise,
I should be inevitably lost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I
began to give over my enterprise ; and having hauled
my boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped
out, and sat me down upon a little spot of rising
ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and
desire, about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I
could perceive that the tide was turned, and the
245
flood came on, upon which my going was for so
many hours impracticable; upon this it presently
occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest
piece of ground I could find, and observe, if I could,
how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the
flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven
another way home with the same rapidness of the
currents. This thought was no sooner in my head,
but I cast my eye upon a little hill which sufficiently
overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I
had a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide,
and which way I was to guide myself in my return:
here I found, that as the current of the ebb set out
close by the south point of the island, so the current
of the flood set in close by the shore of the north
side; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to
the north of the island in my return, and I should
do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the
next morning to set out with the first of the tide;
and reposing myself for that night in the canoe,
under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched
out. I made first a little out to sea full north, till
I began to feel the benefit of the current, which set
eastward, and which carried me at a great rate, and
yet did not so hurry me as the southern side current
had done before, and so as to take from me all govern-
ment of the boat; but having a strong steerage with
my paddle, I went, I say, at a great rate, directly
for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up
to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which
by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her mainmast and foremast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short
off, but her boltsprit was sound, and the head and bow
appeared firm. When I came close to her, a dog
appeared upon her, which seeing me coming, yelped
and cried, and as soon as I called him jumped into
the sea to come to me; and I took him into the
boat, but found him almost dead for hunger and
thirst; I gave him a cake of my bread, and he ate
like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fort-
night in the snow: I then gave the poor creature
some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him,
he would have burst himself.
After this I went on board. The first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one
another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that
when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea
broke so high, and so continually over her, that the
men were not able to bear it, and were strangled
with the constant rushing in of the water, as much as
if they had been under water. Besides the dog, there
was nothing left in the ship that had life, nor any
goods that I could see, but what were spoiled by the
water: there were some casks of liquor, whether wine
or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold,
and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see;
but they were too big to meddle with; I saw several
chests which I believed belonged to some of the sea-
men, and I got two of them into the boat without
examining what was in them.
247
Had the'stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore-
part been broken off, I am persuaded I might have
made a good voyage; for by what I found in these
two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a
great deal of wealth on board; and if I may guess by
the course she steered, she must have been bound
from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in
the south part of America, beyond the Brazils, to the
Havanna, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to
Spain: she had, no doubt, a great treasure in her,
but of no use at that time to anybody: and what
became of the rest of the people I then knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat with much difficulty. There were several mus-
kets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about
four pounds of powder in it: as for the muskets, I
had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took
the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs,
which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-
iron; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came away,
the tide beginning to make home again; and the
same evening, about an hour within night, I reached
the island again, weary and fatigued to the last
degree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning
I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new
cave, not to carry it home to my castle. After re-
freshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and
began to examine the particulars; the cask of liquor
I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had
at the Brazils; and, in a word, not at all good; but
when I came to open the chests, I found several
things which I wanted: for example, I found in one
a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and
filled with cordial waters, fine, and very good;
the bottles held about three pints each, and were
tipped with silver: I found two pots of very good suc-
cades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that
the salt water had not hurt them; and two more of
the same, which the water had spoiled; I found some
very good shirts, which were very welcome to me,
and about a dozen and a half of white linen hand-
kerchiefs and coloured neckcloths; the former were
also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to
wipe my face in a hot day. Besides this, when I
came to the till in the chest, I found there three
great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven
hundred pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped
up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small
bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all
weigh near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it,
but of little value; but by the circumstances, it must
have belonged to the gunner's mate, as there was
no powder in it, but about two pounds of glazed
powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose, for
charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon
the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was
of much use to me; for, as to the money, I had no
manner of occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt
under my feet; and I would have given it all for
three or four pair of English shoes and stockings,
which were things I greatly wanted, but had not had
on my feet now for many years ; I had, indeed, got two
pair of shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two
drowned men whom I saw in the wreck; and I found
249
two pair more in one of the chests, which were very
welcome to me; but they were not like our English
shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we
call pumps than shoes. I found in the seaman's
chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no
gold: I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than
the other, which seemed to belong to some officer.
Well, however, I lugged the money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before which
I brought from our own ship; but it was great pity,
as I said, that the other part of the ship had not
come to my share, for I am satisfied I might have
loaded my canoe several times over with money,
which, if I had ever escaped to England, would have
lain here safe enough till I might have come again
and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and
secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or
paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where
I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my
old habitation, where I found everything safe and
quiet; so I began to repose myself, live after my old
fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for
a while I lived easy enough; only that I was more
vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and
did not go abroad so much; and if at any time I did
stir with any freedom, it was always to the east part
of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the
savages never came, and where I could go without
so many precautions, and such a load of arms and
ammunition as I always carried with me, if I went
the other way.
CHAPTER XIV.
REFLECTIONS—AN EXTRAORDINARY DREAM—DISCOVER FIVE CANOES OF SAVAGES ON SHORE—OBSERVE FROM MY STATION TWO MISERABLE WRETCHES DRAGGED OUT OF THEIR BOATS TO BE DEVOURED ONE OF THEM MAKES HIS ESCAPE, AND RUNS DIRECTLY
TOWARDS ME, PURSUED BY TWO OTHERS / TAKE
MEASURES SO AS TO DESTROY HIS PURSUERS AND
SAVE HIS LIFE—CHRISTEN HIM BY THE NAME OF
FRIDAY, AND HE BECOMES A FAITHFUL AND EXCEL-
LENT SERVANT.
I LIVED in this condition near two years more; but
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it
was born to make my body miserable, was all these
two years filled with projects and designs, how, if
it were possible, I might get away from this island;
for sometimes I was for making another voyage to
the wreck, though my reason told me, that there was
nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage;
sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes another;
and I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went
from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound
anywhere, I knew not whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento
to those who are touched with that general plague of
mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of
their miseries flow: I mean, that of not being satisfied
with the station wherein God and nature hath placed
them; for, not to look back upon my primitive con-
dition, and the excellent advice of my father, the
opposition to which was, as I may call it, my original
sin, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind have
been the means of my coming into this miserable
condition; for had that Providence which so happily
had seated me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me
with confined desires, and could I have been con-
tented to have gone on gradually, I might have been
by this time, I mean in the time of my being on this
island, one of the most considerable planters in the
Brazils; nay, I am persuaded that by the improve-
ments I had made in that little time I lived there,
and the increase I should probably have made if I
had stayed, I might have been worth a hundred
thousand moidores; and what business had I to
leave a settled fortune, well-stocked plantation, im-
proving and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea,
to fetch negroes, when patience and time would have
so increased our stock at home, that we could have
bought them at our own doors from those whose
business it was to fetch them? And though it had
cost us something more, yet the difference of that
price was by no means worth saving at so great a
hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads,
so reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the
exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought experi-
ence of time; and so it was with me now; and yet,
so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper,
that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but
was continually poring upon the means and possi-
bility of my escape from this place; and that I may,
with the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the
remaining part of my story, it may not be improper
to give some account of my first conceptions on the
subject of this foolish scheme for my escape; and
how, and upon what foundation, I acted.
I am now to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate
laid up, and secure under water as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before: I had more
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at all
the richer; for I had no more use for it than the
Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came
thither.
It was one of the nights in the rainy season in
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first setting
foot in this island of solitariness, I was lying in my
bed or hammock, awake, and very well in health,
had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, no,
nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but
could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as to
sleep; no, not a wink all night long otherwise than
as follows:
It is as impossible as needless to set down the
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through
that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in
this night's time; I ran over the whole history of my
life in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it,
to my coming to this island; and also of that part of
my life since I came to this island; in my reflections
upon the state of my case since I came on shore on
this island, I was comparing the happy posture of
my affairs, in the first years of my habitation here,
to that course of anxiety, fear, and care, which I lived
in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the
sand; not that I did not believe the savages had
frequented the island even all the while, and might
have been several hundreds of them at times on the
shore there; but as I had never known it, and was
incapable of-any apprehensions about it, my satisfac-
253
tion was perfect, though my danger was the same;
and I was as happy in not knowing my danger, as if
I had never really been exposed to it: this furnished
my thoughts with many very profitable reflections,
and particularly this one: How infinitely good that
Providence is, which has settled in its government of
mankind such narrow bounds to his sight and know-
ledge of things; and though he walks in the midst of
so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if
discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink
his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the
events of things hid from his eyes, and knowing
nothing of the dangers which surround him.
After these thoughts had for some time entertained
me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real danger
I had been in for so many years in this very island;
and how I had walked about in the greatest security,
and with all possible tranquillity, even perhaps when
nothing but a brow of a hill, a great tree, or the
casual approach of night, had been between me and
the worst kind of destruction, viz., that of falling into
the hands of cannibals and savages, who would have
seized on me with the same view as I did on a goat
or turtle, and have thought it no more a crime to
kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a
curlew. I should unjustly slander myself, if I should
say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Pre-
server, to whose singular protection I acknowledged,
with great humility, that all these unknown deliver-
ances were due, and without which I should inevitably
have fallen into their merciless hands.
When these thoughts were over, my head was for
some time taken up in considering the nature of these
wretched creatures, I mean, the savages; and how it
came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of
all things should give up any of His creatures to such
inhumanity, nay, to something so much below even
brutality itself, as to devour its own kind: but as
this ended in some (at that time fruitless) specula-
tions, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the
world these wretches lived in; how far off the coast
was from whence they came; what they ventured so
far from home for; what kind of boats they had; and
why I might not order myself, and my business, so
that I might be as able to go over thither, as they
were to come to me?
I never so much as troubled myself to consider
what I should do with myself when I came thither;
what should become of me if I fell into the hands of
the savages; or how I should escape from them, if
they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it was
possible for me to reach the coast, and not be at-
tacked by some or other of them, without any pos-
sibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall
into their hands, what I should do for provision, or
whither I should bend my course: none of these
thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but
my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my
passing over in my boat to the mainland. I looked
back upon my present condition as the most miser-
able that could possibly be; that I was not able to
throw myself into anything but death that could be
called worse; that if I reached the shore of the
main, I might, perhaps, meet with relief; or I might
coast along, as I did on the shore of Africa, till I
came to some inhabited country, and where I might
find some relief; and after all, perhaps I might fall
in with some Christian ship that might take me in;
and if the worst came to the worst, I could but die,
which would put an end to all these miseries at once.
Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind,
an impatient temper, made as it were desperate by
the long continuance of my troubles, and the dis-
appointments I had met in the wreck I had been on
board of, and where I had been so near the obtaining
of what I had so earnestly longed for, viz., somebody
to speak to, and to learn some knowledge from, of
the place where I was, and of the probable means of
my deliverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by
these thoughts. All my calm of mind in my resig-
nation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the
dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be suspended;
and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts
to anything but the project of a voyage to the main;
which came upon me with such force, and such an
impetuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts for two
hours or more, with such violence that it set my
very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as
high as if I had been in a fever, merely with the
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it; nature,
as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the
very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep: one
would have thought I should have dreamed of it;
but I did not, nor of anything relating to it; but I
dreamed that as I was going out in the morning,
as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore two
canoes and eleven savages coming to land, and that
they brought with them another savage, whom they
were going to kill, in order to eat him; when on a
sudden, the savage that they were going to kill
jumped away, and ran for his life: then I thought in
my sleep, that he came running into my little thick
grove, before my fortification, to hide himself; and
that I seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the
others sought him that way, showed myself to him,
and, smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he
kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to assist
him; upon which I showed my ladder, made him go
up it, and carried him into my cave, and he became my
servant; and that as soon as I had got this man, I
said to myself, "Now I may certainly venture to the
mainland; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and
will tell me what to do, and whither to go for pro-
visions, and whither not to go for fear of being de-
voured; what places to venture into, and what to
escape." I waked with this thought, and was under
such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect
of my escape in my dream, that the disappointments
which I felt upon coming to myself, and finding it
was no more than a dream, were equally extravagant
the other way, and threw me into a very great dejec-
tion of spirits.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was, if possible, to get a savage in my possession;
and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should
bring hither to kill; but these thoughts still were
attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible
to effect this, without attacking a whole caravan of
them, and killing them all; and this was not only a
very desperate attempt, and might miscarry; but,
on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the law-
fulness of it to me, and my heart trembled at the
thought of shedding so much blood, though it was
257
for my deliverance: I need not repeat the arguments
which occurred to me against this, they being the
same mentioned before: but though I had other
reasons to offer now, viz., that those men were ene-
mies to my life, and would devour me, if they could;
that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree,
to deliver myself from this death of a life, and was
acting in my own defence, as much as if they were
actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though
these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shed-
ding human blood for my deliverance were very
terrible to me, and such as I could by no means
reconcile myself to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with
myself, and after great perplexities about it (for all
these arguments, one way and another, struggled in
my head a long time), the eager prevailing desire of
deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and I
resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into
my hands, cost what it would: the next thing then
was to contrive how to do it; and this indeed was
very difficult to resolve on: but as I could pitch
upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put
myself upon the watch to see them when they came
on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such
measures as the opportunity should present, let it be
what it would.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set my-
self upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed
so often till I was heartily tired of it; for it was
above a year and a half that I waited, and for a
great part of that time went out to the west end and
south-west corner of the island, almost every day,
to see for canoes, but none appeared. This was
VOL. I. R
very discouraging, and began to trouble me much;
though I can't say that it did in this case, as it had
done some time before that, viz., wear off the edge
of my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed
to be delayed, the more eager I was for it; in a
word, I was not at first more careful to shun the sight
of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, than
I was now eager to be upon them.
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay,
two or three savages, if I had them, so as to make
them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should
direct them, and to prevent their being able, at any
time, to do me any hurt. It was a great while that
I pleased myself with this affair, but nothing still
presented; all my fancies and schemes came to no-
thing, for no savages came near me for a great while. About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and by long musing, had as it were
resolved them all into nothing, for want of an occa-
sion to put them in execution, I was surprised one
morning early, with seeing no less than five canoes
all on shore together, on my side the island, and the
people who belonged to them all landed, and out of
my sight: the number of them broke all my mea-
sures; for seeing so many, and knowing that they
always came four, or six, or sometimes more, in a
boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to
take any measures to attack twenty or thirty men
single-handed; so I lay still in my castle, perplexed
and discomforted; however, I put myself into all the
same postures for an attack that I had formerly pro-
vided, and was just ready for action, if anything had
presented. Having waited a good while, listening to
hear if they made any noise; at length being very
impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and clambered up to the top of the hill by my two
stages, as usual, standing so, however, that my head
did not appear above the hill, so that they could not
perceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the
help of my perspective glass, that they were no less
than thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled,
and that they had had meat dressed; how they
cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they
were all dancing in I know not how many barbarous
gestures and figures, their own way, round the fire.
When I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by
my perspective, two miserable wretches dragged
from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by,
and were now brought out for the slaughter: I per-
ceived one of them immediately fall, being knocked
down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for
that was their way; and two or three others were
at work immediately, cutting him open for their
cookery, while the other victim was left standing by
himself, till they should be ready for him. In that
very moment this poor wretch seeing himself a little at
liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he
started away from them, and ran with incredible swift-
ness along the sands, directly towards me; I mean to-
wards that part of the coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge)
when I perceived him to run my way: and especially
when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole
body; and now I expected that part of my dream
was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take
shelter in my grove; but I could not depend, by any
means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz., that the
other savages would not pursue him thither, and find
him there. However, I kept my station, and my spirits
began to recover, when I found that there were not
above three men that followed him ; and still more was
I encouraged when I found that he outstripped them
exceedingly in running, and gained ground of them;
so that if he could but hold it for half an hour, I saw
easily he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the first part of my story,
when I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this
I knew he must necessarily swim over, or the poor
wretch would be taken there: but when the savage
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though
the tide was then up; but plunging in, swam through
in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran
on with exceeding strength and swiftness. When the
three pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of
them could swim, but the third could not, and that
he, standing on the other side looked at the others, but
went no further; and soon after went softly back again,
which, as it happened, was very well for him in the
main.
I observed that the two who swam were yet more
than twice as long swimming over the creek as
the fellow was that fled from them. It came now
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresis-
tibly, that now was my time to get a servant, and
perhaps a companion, or assistant, and that I was
called plainly by Providence to save this poor crea-
ture's life. I immediately got down the ladders
with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns,
for they were both at the foot of the ladder, as I
observed above; and getting up again with the same
haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the
261
sea; and having a very short cut, and all down-hill,
clapped myself in the way between the pursuers and
the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who,
looking back, was at first perhaps as much frighted
at me as at them; but I beckoned with my hand to
him to come back; and in the meantime I slowly
advanced towards the two that followed; then rush-
ing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down
with the stock of my piece; I was loath to fire, be-
cause I would not have the rest hear, though at that
distance it would not have been easily heard: and
being out of sight of the smoke too, they would not
have easily known what to make of it. Having
knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued
him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I
advanced apace towards him: but as I came nearer,
I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and
was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then neces-
sitated to shoot at him first; which I did, and killed
him at the first shot. The poor savage who fled,
but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies
fallen, and killed (as he thought), yet was so frighted
with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood
stock-still, and neither came forward nor went back-
ward, though he seemed rather inclined to fly still
than to come on. I hallooed again to him, and
made signs to come forward, which he easily under-
stood, and came a little way, then stopped again,
and then a little further, and stopped again; and I
could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if
he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to
be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned him
again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of
encouragement that I could think of; and he came
nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve
steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his
life. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and
beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length
he came close to me, and then he kneeled down
again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon
the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot
upon his head. This, it seems, was in token of
swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up,
and made much of him, and encouraged him all I
could. But there was more work to do yet; for I
perceived the savage, whom I knocked down, was
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to
come to himself; so I pointed to him, and showed
him the savage, that he was not dead: upon this he
spoke some words to me; and though I could not
understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant
to hear, for they were the first sound of a man's
voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for above
five-and-twenty years. But there was no time for
such reflections now: the savage, who was knocked
down, recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the
ground; and I perceived that my savage began to
be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my
other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him;
upon this my savage, for so I call him now, made a
motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side; so I did: he no sooner
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow
cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Ger-
many could have done it sooner or better, which I
thought very strange for one who, I had reason to
believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except
their own wooden swords; however, it seems, as I

263
learnt afterwards, they make their wooden swords so
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they
will cut off heads even with them, nay, and arms,
and that at one blow too. When he had done this,
he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and with abundance of
gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down,
with the head of the savage that he had killed, just
before me.
But that which astonished him most was, to
know how I had killed the other Indian so far off;
so pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him
go to him; so I bade him go, as well as I could.
When he came to him, he stood like one amazed,
looking at him; turned him first on one side, then
on t'other; looked at the wound the bullet had
made, which it seems was just in his breast, where
it had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood
had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was
quite dead. Then he took up his bow and arrows,
and came back; so I turned to go away, and beckoned
him to follow me, making signs to him that more
might come after him.
Upon this he signed to me, that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by the
rest, if they followed; and so I made signs again to
him to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant he
had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big
enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him
into it, and covered him, and did so also by the
other; I believe he had buried them both in a quar-
ter of an hour: then calling him away, I carried him,
not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the
further part of the island; so I did not let my dream-
come to pass in that part, viz., that he came into my
grove for shelter.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was
indeed in great distress for, by his running; and
having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go
lie down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had
laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon
it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so
the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well
made, with straight long limbs, not too large, tall,
and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not
a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have some-
thing very manly in his face, and yet he had all the
sweetness and softness of an European in his coun-
tenance too, especially when he smiled; his hair was
long and black, not curled like wool; his forehead
very high and large, and a great vivacity and spark-
ling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin
was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet not of
an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and
Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of
a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it
something very agreeable, though not very easy to
describe. His face was round and plump, his nose
small, but not flat like the negro's, a very good
mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well set, and
white as ivory. After he had slumbered, rather
than slept, about half an hour, he waked again, and
comes out of the cave to me, for I had been milking
my goats, which I had in the enclosure just by; when
he spied me, he came running to me, laying himself
265
down again upon the ground, with all the possible
signs of a humble thankful disposition, making many
antic gestures to show it. At last he lays his head
flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my
other foot upon his head, as he had done before;
and after this, made all the signs to me of subjection,
servitude, and submission imaginable, to let me know
how much he would serve me as long as he lived. I
understood him in many things, and let him know I
was very well pleased with him. In a little time I
began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to
me; and first, I made him know his name should be
Friday, which was the day I saved his life; and I
called him so for the memory of the time; I likewise
taught him to say Master, and then let him know
that was to be my name; I likewise taught him to
say Yes and No, and to know the meaning of them.
I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and let him
see me drink it before him, and sop my bread in it;
and I gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which
he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was
very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me, and
let him know I would give him some clothes; at
which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked.
As we went by the place where he had buried the
two men, he pointed out exactly the spot, and showed
me the marks that he had made to find them again,
making signs to me that we should dig them up
again, and eat them: at this I appeared very angry,
expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would
vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my
hand to him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great submission. I then led him up to the top
of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone, and pull-
ing out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place
where they had been, but no appearance of them or
their canoes; so that it was plain that they were
gone, and left their two comrades behind them, with-
out any search after them.
But I was not content with this discovery; but
having now more courage, and consequently more
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at
his back, which I found he could use very dexter-
ously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two
for myself, and away we marched to the place where
these creatures had been; for I had a mind now to
get some fuller intelligence of them. When I came
to the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins,
and my heart sunk within me at the horror of the
spectacle; indeed it was a dreadful sight, at least it
was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it: the
place was covered with human bones, the ground
dyed with the blood, great pieces of flesh left here
and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; and,
in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast that
they had been making there, after a victory over
their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and
the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abund-
ance of other parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his
signs, made me understand that they brought over
four prisoners to feast upon ; that three of them were
eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the
fourth; that there had been a great battle between
them and their next king, whose subjects, it seems,
he had been one of; and that they had taken a great
267
number of prisoners, all which were carried to several
places by those that had taken them in the fight, in
order to feast upon them, as was done here by these
wretches upon those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones,
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them together
on a heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn
them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hanker-
ing stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a
cannibal in his nature; but I discovered so much
abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least
appearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for I
had, by some means, let him know that I would kill
him if he offered it.
When he had done this, we came back to our
castle, and there I fell to work for my man Friday;
and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I men-
tioned, and which I found in the wreck; and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well; then I
made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my skill
would allow, and I was now grown a tolerable good
tailor; and I gave him a cap, which I had made of a
hare skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough,
and thus he was dressed, for the present, tolerably
well, and mighty well was he pleased to see himself
almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he
went awkwardly in these things at first; wearing the
drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of
the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of
his arms; but a little easing them, where he com-
plained they hurt him, and using himself to them, at
length he took to them very well.
The next day after I came home to my hutch with
him, I began to consider where I should lodge him;
and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly
easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the
vacant place between my two fortifications, in the
inside of the last, and in the outside of the first: and
as there was a door or entrance there into my cave,
I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to it
of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little within
the entrance; and causing the door to open on the
inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my
ladders too; so that Friday could no way come at
me in the inside of my innermost wall, without mak-
ing so much noise in getting over, that it must needs
awaken me; for my first wall had now a complete
roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and
leaning up to the side of the hill, which was again
laid across with small sticks instead of laths, and then
thatched over a great thickness with the rice straw,
which was strong like reeds; and at the hole or place
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had
placed a kind of trap-door, which if it had been
attempted on the outside, would not have opened at
all, but would have fallen down, and made a great
noise; and as to weapons, I took them all into my
side every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution; for never
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant, than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or
designs; perfectly obliging and engaging; his very
affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a
father; and I daresay, he would have sacrificed his
life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatso-
ever: the many testimonies he gave me of this put
it out of doubt; and soon convinced me that I
269
needed to use no precautions as to my safety on his
account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that however it had pleased God
in His providence, and in the government of the works
of His hands, to take from so great a part of the
world of His creatures, the best uses to which their
faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted;
yet that He has bestowed upon them the same
powers, the same reason, the same affections, the
same sentiments of kindness and obligation, the
same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same
sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the
capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that
He has given to us; and that when He pleases to
offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as
ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right
uses for which they were bestowed, than we are.
And this made me very melancholy sometimes, in
reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how
mean a use we make of all these, even though we
have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of
instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge
of His Word, added to our understanding; and why
it has pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge
from so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge
by this poor savage, would make a much better use
of it than we did.
From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade
the sovereignty of Providence; and as it were,
arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of
things, that should hide that light from some, and
reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from
both: but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts
with this conclusion: first, that we do not know by
what light and law these should be condemned; but
that as God was necessarily, and by the nature of His
being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be,
that if these creatures were all sentenced to absence
from Himself, it was on account of sinning against
that light, which as the Scripture says, was a law to
themselves, and by such rules as their consciences
would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation
was not discovered to us: and, secondly, that still,
as we are all clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel
could say to Him, "Why hast Thou formed me
thus?"
But to return to my new companion: I was greatly
delighted with him, and made it my business to teach
him everything that was proper to make him useful,
handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak,
and understand me when I spake: and he was the
aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly was so
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when
he could but understand me, or make me understand
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him.
And now my life began to be so easy, that I began
to say to myself, that could I but have been safe from
more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove
from the place where I lived.

CHAPTER XV.
/ AM AT GKEAT PAINS TO INSTRUCT FRIDAY RESPECTING
MY ABHORRENCE OF THE CANNIBAL PRACTICES OF THE
SAVAGESHE IS AMAZED AT THE EFFECTS OF THE GUN, AND CONSIDERS IT AN INTELLIGENT BEING— BEGINS TO TALK ENGLISH TOLERABLY—A DIALOGUE
—/ INSTRUCT HIM IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF RELIGION,
AND FIND HIM VERY APT—HE DESCRIBES TO ME
SOME WHITE MEN WHO HAD COME TO HIS COUNTRY
AND STILL LIVED THERE.
AFTER I had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought, that in order to bring Friday off
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of
a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other
flesh; so I took him out with me one morning to the
woods: I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of
my own flock, and bring it home and dress it; but as I
was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of
Friday: "Hold," said I, "stand still;" and made
signs to him not to stir. Immediately I presented
my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor
creature, who had at a distance indeed seen me kill
the savage his enemy, but did not know, or could
imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised,
trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed, that I
thought he would have sunk down: he did not see
the kid I had shot at, or perceive I had killed it,
but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not
wounded; and, as I found, presently thought I was
resolved to kill him: for he came and kneeled down
to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many
things I did not understand; but I could easily see
that his meaning was to pray me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would
do him no harm; and taking him up by the hand,
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which
he did; and while he was wondering and looking
to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again, and by and by I saw a great fowl, like a
hawk, sit upon a tree within shot, so, to let Friday
understand a little what I would do, I called him to
me again, pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a
parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say,
pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the
ground under the parrot, to let him see I would
make him fall, I made him understand that I would
shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and
bid him look, and immediately he saw the parrot
fall: he stood like one frightened again, notwithstand-
ing all that I had said to him; and I found he was
the more amazed, because he did not see me put
anything into the gun: but thought there must be
some wonderful fund of death and destruction in
that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything
near or far off; for the astonishment this created in
him was such, as could not wear off for a long time;
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have
worshipped me and my gun: as for the gun itself, he
would not so much as touch it for several days after;
but would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
swered him, when he was by himself; which, as I
afterwards learnt of him, was to desire it not to kill
him.
Well: after his astonishment was a little over at
273
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I
had shot, which he did, but stayed some time; for
the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a good
way off from the place where she fell; however, he
found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and
as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun before,
I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and
not let him see me do it, that I might be ready for
any other mark that might present: but nothing more
offered at that time; so I brought home the kid, and
the same evening took the skin off, and cut it out as
well as I could, and having a pot for that purpose, I
boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some
very good broth: after I had begun to eat some, I
gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it,
and liked it very well; but that which was strangest
to him was, to see me eat salt with it. He made a
sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and
putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to
nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing
his mouth with fresh water after it. On the other
hand, I took some meat in my mouth without salt,
and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt,
as fast as he had done at the salt; but it would not
do, he would never care for salt with meat, or in his
broth; at least, not for a great while, and then but a
very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth,
I was resolved to feast him the next day with roast-
ing a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it be-
fore the fire in a string, as I had seen many people
do in England, setting two poles up, one on each
side of a fire, and one cross on the top, and tying
the string to the cross stick, letting the meat run VOL. I. S
continually: this Friday admired very much; but
when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many
ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could
not but understand him; and at last he told me he
would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was
very glad to hear.
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as
I observed before; and he soon understood how to do
it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the
meaning of it was: and that it was to make bread
of; for after that I let him see me make my bread,
and bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able
to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it
myself.
I began now to consider, that, having two mouths
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of
land, and began the fence in the same manner as
before, in which Friday not only worked very will-
ingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully; and
I told him what it was for, that it was for corn to
make more bread, because he was now with me, and
that I might have enough for him and myself too:
he appeared very sensible of that part, and let me
know, that he thought I had much more labour upon
me on his account, than I had for myself, and that
he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him
what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and
understand the names of almost everything I had
occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send
275
him to,and talk a great deal to me; so that, in short,
I began now to have some use for my tongue again,
which indeed I had very little occasion for before;
that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure
of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the
fellow himself; his simple unfeigned honesty ap-
peared to me more and more every day, and I began
really to love the creature; and on his side, I believe,
he loved me more than it was possible for him ever
to love anything before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again; and having
learnt him English so well, that he could answer
me almost any questions, I asked him, whether the
nation that he belonged to never conquered in bat-
tle? At which he smiled and said, "Yes, yes, we
always fight the better;" that is, he meant, always
get the better in fight; and so we began the follow-
ing discourse: "You always fight the better!" said I,
"how came you to be taken prisoner then, Friday?"
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Master. How beat? if your nation beat them, how
came you to be taken?
Friday. They more than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me;
my nation over-beat them in the yonder place, where
me no was; there my nation take one, two great
thousand.
Master. But why did not your nation recover you
from the hands of your enemies then?
Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that
time.
Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away, and eat them as these do?
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Master. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
else place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here [points to the N.W. side
of the island, which, it seems, was their side].
By this, I understood that my man Friday had
formerly been among the savages, who used to come
on shore on the further part of the island, on the
said man-eating occasions that he was now brought
for; and some time after, when I took the courage
to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly
mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told
me, he was there once when they ate up twenty
men, two women, and one child: he could not tell
twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying
so many stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell
them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces what
follows; that after I had had this discourse with him,
I asked him, how far it was from our island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost;
he told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost;
but that after a little way out to sea, there was a
current, and a wind always one way in the morning,
the other in the afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the sets of
the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I afterwards
understood it was occasioned by the great draught
and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque; in the
mouth of which river, as I thought afterwards, our
island lay; and that this land which I perceived to
the W. and N.W. was the great island Trinidad, on
the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the
inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were
near: he told me all he knew with the greatest open-
ness imaginable. I asked him the names of the
several nations of his sort of people, but could get
no other name than Caribs; from whence I easily
understood, that these were the Caribbees, which our
maps place on that part of America which reaches
from the mouth of the river Oroonoque to Guinea,
and onwards to St. Martha. He told me, that up a
great way beyond the moon; that was, beyond the
setting of the moon, which must be west from their
country, there dwelt white-bearded men, like me, and
pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned
before; and that they had killed much mans, that
was his word: by which I understood he meant the
Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been
spread over the whole countries, and were remem-
bered by all the nations from father to son.
I inquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men;
he told me, Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe; I
could not understand what he meant by two canoe,
till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant
that it must be in a large great boat as big as two
canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish
with me very well; and from this time I entertained
some hopes, that one time or other I might find an
opportunity to make my escape from this place, and
that this poor savage might be a means to help me
to do it.
During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and
understand me, I was not wanting to lay a founda-
tion of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly
I asked him one time, Who made him? The poor
creature did not understand me at all, but thought I
had asked who was his father: but I took it by
another handle, and asked him, Who made the sea,
the ground he walked on, and the hills and woods?
He told me it was one old Benamuckee, that lived
beyond all: he could describe nothing of this great
person, but that he was very old; much older, he
said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or the
stars. I asked him then, if this old person had
made all things, why did not all things worship him?
He looked very grave, and, with a perfect look of
innocence, said, All things said O! to him. I asked
him if the people who die in his country, went away
anywhere? He said, Yes, they all went to Bena-
muckee. Then I asked him, whether those they ate
up went thither too? he said, Yes.
From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the
great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up
towards heaven; that He governs the world by the
same power and providence by which He made it;
that He was omnipotent, could do everything for us,
give everything to us, take everything from us: and
thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened
with great attention, and received with pleasure the
notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and
279
the manner of making our prayers to God, and His
being able to hear us, even into heaven: he told me
one day, that if our God could hear us up beyond
the sun, he must needs be a greater God than their
Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet
could not hear, till they went up to the great moun-
tains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him
if ever he went thitherto speak to him? He said,
No, they never went that were young men; none
went thither but the old men; whom he called their
Oowookakee: that is, as I made him explain it to me,
their religious, or clergy; and that they went to say
O! (so he called saying prayers), and then came
back, and told them what Benamuckee said. By
this I observed, that there is priestcraft even amongst
the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world; and
the policy of making a secret of religion, in order to
preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy,
is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
among all religions in the world, even among the
most brutish and barbarous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday; and told him that the pretence of their old
men going up to the mountains to say O! to their
god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing
word from thence what he said, was much more so;
that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any
one there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then I
entered into a long discourse with him about the
devil, the original of him, his rebellion against God,
his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting him-
self up in the dark parts of the world to be
worshipped instead of God, and as God, and the
many stratagems he made use of, to delude mankind
to their ruin; how he had a secret access to our
passions and to our affections, to adapt his snares so
to our inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own
tempters, and to run upon our own destruction by
our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the
being of a God; nature assisted all my arguments
to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First
Cause, and over-ruling governing Power, a secret
directing Providence, and of the equity and justice
of paying homage to Him that made us, and the
like: but there appeared nothing of all this in the
notion of an evil spirit, of his original, his being, his
nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do evil,
and to draw us in to do so too; and the poor crea-
ture puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question
merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew
what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal
to him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His
dreadful aversion to sin, His being a consuming fire
to the workers of iniquity; how, as He had made us
all, He could destroy us and all the world in a
moment; and he listened with great seriousness to
me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of
Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the
world, and the like: "Well," says Friday, "but you
say God is so strong, so great, is He not much strong,
much might as the devil?"—"Yes, yes," said I,
"Friday, God is stronger than the devil, God is above
the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him
281
under our feet, and enable us to resist his tempta-
tions, and quench his fiery darts." "But," says he
again," if God much strong, much might, as the devil,
why God not kill the devil, so make him no more
wicked?"
I was strangely surprised at his question; and,
after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was
but a young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a
casuist, or a solver of difficulties: and at first, I could
not tell what to say; so I pretended not to hear him,
and asked him what he said? but he was too earnest
for an answer to forget his question, so that he re-
peated it in the very same broken words, as above.
By this time I had recovered myself a little, and I
said, " God will at last punish him severely; he is re-
served for the judgment, and is to be cast into the
bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This
did not satisfy Friday; but he returns upon me, re-
peating my words, "Reserve at last! me no under-
stand: but why not kill the devil now, not kill great
ago ?"—" You may as well ask me," said I, "why God
does not kill you and me, when we do wicked things
here that offend Him: we are preserved to repent and
be pardoned." He muses awhile at this; "Well,
well," says he, mighty affectionately, "that well; so
you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God
pardon all." Here I was run down again by him to
the last degree, and it was a testimony to me, how
the mere notions of nature, though they will guide
reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God, and
of a worship or homage due to the supreme being of
God, as the consequence of our nature; yet nothing
but divine revelation can form the knowledge of
Jesus Christ, and of a redemption purchased for us;
of a Mediator; of a new covenant; and of an Inter-
cessor at the footstool of God's throne; I say, nothing
but a revelation from Heaven can form these in the
soul; and that therefore the Gospel of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and
the Spirit of God, promised for the guide and
sanctifier of His people, are the absolutely necessary
instructors of the souls of men in the saving know-
ledge of God, and the means of salvation.
I therefore diverted the present discourse between
me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some
sudden occasion of going out; then sending him for
something a great way off, I seriously prayed to God,
that He would enable me to instruct savingly this
poor savage, assisting, by His Spirit, the heart of the
poor ignorant creature to receive the light of the
knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling him to Him-
self, and would guide me to speak so to him from
the Word of God, as his conscience might be con-
vinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When
he came again to me, I entered into a long discourse
with him upon the subject of the redemption of man
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of
the Gospel preached from Heaven, viz., of the repent-
ance towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord
Jesus: I then explained to him, as well as I could,
why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the
nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham, and how,
for that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the
redemption; that He came only to the lost sheep of
the house of Israel, and the like.
I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge,
in all the methods I took for this poor creature's in-
struction; and must acknowledge, what I believe all
283
that act upon the same principle will find, that in
laying things open to him, I really informed and
instructed myself in many things that either I did
not know, or had not fully considered before; but
which occurred naturally to my mind, upon my search-
ing into them for the information of this poor savage;
and I had more affection in my inquiry after things
upon this occasion, than ever I felt before; so that
whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me
or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever he
came to me: my grief sat lighter upon me, my habi-
tation grew comfortable to me beyond measure; and
when I reflected, that in this solitary life, which I had
been confined to, I had not only been moved myself
to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand that
brought me thither, but was now to be made an in-
strument, under Providence, to save the life, and for
aught I knew, the soul, of a poor savage, and bring
him to the true knowledge of religion, and of the
Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus,
to know whom is life eternal; I say, when I reflected
upon all these things, a secret joy ran through every
part of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I
was brought to this place, which I had often thought
the most dreadful of all afflictions that could possibly
have befallen me.
In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder
of my time; and the conversation which employed
the hours between Friday and me was such as made
the three years which we lived there together perfectly
and completely happy, if any such thing as complete
happiness can be found in a sublunary state. The
savage was now a good Christian, a much better than
I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for
it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted re-
stored penitents: we had here the Word of God to
read, and no further off from His Spirit to instruct
than if we had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scripture,
and to let him know as well as I could the meaning
of what I read; and he again, by his serious inquiries
and questions, made me, as I said before, a much
better scholar in the Scripture knowledge than I
should ever have been by my own private reading.
Another thing I cannot refrain from observing here
also from experience, in this retired part of my life;
viz., how infinite and inexpressible a blessing it is,
that the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of
salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in
the Word of God, so easy to be received and under-
stood, that as the bare reading the Scripture made
me capable of understanding enough of my duty to
carry me directly on to the great work of sincere
repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour
for life and salvation, to a stated reformation of prac-
tice, and obedience to all God's commands, and this
without any teacher or instructor (I mean, human);
so the plain instruction sufficiently served to the en-
lightening this savage creature, and bringing him to
be such a Christian, as I have known few equal to
him in my life.
As to the disputes, wranglings, strife, and conten-
tion, which has happened in the world about religion,
whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes of Church-
government, they were all perfectly useless to us, as
for aught I can yet see, they have been to all the rest
in the world: we had the sure guide to heaven, viz.,
the Word of God; and we had, blessed be God,
comfortable views of the Spirit of God, teaching and
instructing us by His Word, leading us into all truth,
and making us both willing and obedient to the
instruction of His Word; and I cannot see the least
use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed
points in religion, which have made such confusions
in the world, would have been to us, if we could have
obtained it. But I must go on with the historical
part of things, and take every part in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almost all I
said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken
English, to me, I acquainted him with my own story,
or at least so much of it as related to my coming
into the place, how I had lived there, and how long;
I let him into the mystery (for such it was to him)
of gunpowder and bullets, and taught him how to
shoot; I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully
delighted with; and I made him a belt with a frog
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers
in; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him
a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in
some cases, but much more useful upon many oc-
casions.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts
of the world. I gave him an account of the wreck
which I had been on board of, and showed him,
as near as I could, the place where she lay; but
she was all beaten in pieces long before, and quite
gone.
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost
when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my
whole strength then, but was now fallen almost all to
pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing
a great while, and said nothing; I asked him what it
was he studied upon? At last, says he, "Me see
such boat like come to place at my nation."
I did not understand him a good while; but at
last, when I had examined further into it, I under-
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived; that
is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of
weather. I presently imagined that some European
ship must have been cast away upon their coast, and
the boat might get loose, and drive ashore; but was
so dull, that I never once thought of men making
escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they
might come; so I only inquired after a description of
the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him, when he added,
with some warmth, "We save the white mans from
drown." Then I presently asked him, if there were
any white mans, as he called them, in the boat?
"Yes," he said, "the boat full of white mans." I
asked him, how many? he told upon his fingers
seventeen. I asked him then, what became of them?
he told me, "They live, they dwell at my nation."
This put new thoughts into my head again; for
I presently imagined, that these might be the men
belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight of
my island, as I now call it; and who, after the ship
was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably
lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were
landed upon that wild shore among the savages.
287
Upon this I inquired of him more critically, what
was become of them? He assured me they lived still
there, that they had been there about four years,
that the savages left them alone, and gave them
victuals to live. I asked him how it came to pass
they did not kill them, and eat them? He said,
"No, they make brother with them:" that is, as I
understood him, a truce: and then he added, "They
eat no mans but when make the war fight:" that is
to say, they never eat any men, but such as come
to fight with them, and are taken in battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the
island, from whence, as I have said, I had in a clear
day discovered the main or continent of America;
Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very
earnestly towards the mainland, and in a kind of
surprise falls a-jumping and dancing, and calls out
to me, for I was at some distance from him: I asked
him what was the matter?"O joy!" says he, "O
glad! there see my country, there my nation!"
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he
had a mind to be in his own country again; and
this observation of mine put a great many thoughts
into me; which made me at first not so easy about
my new man Friday as I was before; and I made no
doubt but that if Friday could get back to his own
nation again, he would not only forget all his religion,
but all his obligations to me; and would be forward
enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and
come back, perhaps, with a hundred or two of them,
and make a feast upon me, at which he might be as
merry as he used to be with those of his enemies,
when they were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very
much, for which I was very sorry afterwards: how-
ever, as my jealousy increased, and held me some
weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and not so
familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
certainly in the wrong too, the honest grateful
creature having no thought about it, but what con-
sisted of the best principles, both as a religious
Christian and as a grateful friend, as appeared after-
wards to my full satisfaction.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure
I was every day pumping him, to see if he would
discover any of the new thoughts which I suspected
were in him; but I found everything he said was so
honest and so innocent, that I could find nothing to
nourish my suspicion; and in spite of all my uneasi-
ness, he made me at last entirely his own again; nor
did he in the least perceive that I was uneasy; and
therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con-
tinent, I called to him, and said, "Friday, do not you
wish yourself in your own country, your own nation?"
—" Yes," he said," I be much O glad to be at my own
nation." — "What would you do there?" said I:
"would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh again,
and be a savage as you were before?" He looked
full of concern, and shaking his head, said, "No, no,
Friday tell them to live good, tell them to pray God,
tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk, no eat
man again."—"Why, then," said I to him, "they will
kill you." He looked grave at that, and then said,
289
"No, they no kill me, they willing love learn:" he
meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He
added, they learned much of the bearded mans that
came in the boat. Then I asked him if he would go
back to them? He smiled at that, and told me he
could not swim so far. I told him I would make a
canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would
go with him. "I go," said I, "why, they would eat
me if I come there."—" No, no," says he, "me make
them no eat you, me make they much love you : " he
meant he would tell them how I had killed his
enemies and saved his life, and so he would make
them love me. Then he told me, as well as he could,
how kind they were to seventeen white men, or
bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore
in distress.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture
over and see if I could possibly join with these
bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards
or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we
might find some method to escape from thence,
being upon the continent and a good company
together, better than I could from an island forty
miles off the shore, and alone without help. So,
after some days, I took Friday to work again, by
way of discourse; and I told him I would give him
a boat to go back to his own nation; and accordingly
I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
side of the island; and having cleared it of water
(for I always kept it sunk in the water), I brought it
out, showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at manag-
ing it, would make it go almost as swift and fast
again as I could; so when he was in I said to him,
VOL. I. T
"Well now, Friday, shall we go to your nation?"
He looked very dull at my saying so, which, it seems,
was because he thought the boat too small to go so
fc>o far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next
day I went to the place where the first boat lay
which I had made, but which I could not get into
the water; he said that was big enough; but then
as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or
three and twenty years there, the sun had split and
dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told
me such a boat would do very well, and would carry
"much enough vittle, drink, bread :" that was his way
of talking.
CHAPTER XVI.
/ determine to go over to the continent—friday
and i construct a boat equal to carry twenty

friday and i fire upon the wretches, and

killed and wounded discover a poor indian
bound in one of the canoes, who turns out to
be Friday's father.
UPON the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon
my design of going over with him to the continent,
that I told him we would go and make one as big as
that, and he should go home in it. He answered
not one word, but looked very grave and sad. I
asked him what was the matter with him? He
291
asked me again thus, "Why you angry mad with
Friday? what me done?" I asked him what he
meant? I told him I was not angry with him at all:
"No angry! no angry!" says he, repeating the
words several times, "why send Friday home away
to my nation ?"—" Why," said I, "Friday, did you
not say you wished you were there ?"—" Yes, yes,"
says he, "wish be both there; no wish Friday there,
no master there." In a word, he would not think
of going there without me. "I go there, Friday!"
said I; "what should I do there?" He turned very
quick upon me at this; "You do great deal much
good," says he; "you teach wild mans be good,
sober, tame mans; you tell them know God, pray
God, and live new life."—"Alas, Friday," said I,
"thou knowest not what thou sayest; I am but an
ignorant man myself."—"Yes, yes," says he, "you
teachee me good, you teachee them good."—"No,
no, Friday," said I, "you shall go without me; leave
me here to live by myself, as I did before." He
looked confused again at that word, and running
to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he
takes it up hastily, and gives it to me. "What must
I do with this?" said I to him. "You take kill
Friday," says he. "What must I kill you for?" said
I again. He returns very quick, "What you send
Friday away for? take kill Friday, no send Friday
away." This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears
stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered
the utmost affection in him to me, that I told him
then, and often after, that I would never send him
away from me, if he was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a
settled affection to me, and that nothing should part
him from me, so I found all the foundation of his
desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent
affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing
them good; a thing which, as I had no notion of
myself, so I had not the least thought, or intention,
or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a
strong inclination to my attempting an escape, as
above, founded on the supposition gathered from the
discourse; viz., that there were seventeen bearded
men there; and therefore, without any delay, I went
to work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper
to fell, and make a large periagua or canoe, to
undertake the voyage; there were trees enough in
the island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas
and canoes only, but even of good large vessels; but
the main thing I looked at, was to get one so near
the water, that we might launch it when it was made,
to avoid the mistake I committed at first.
At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found
he knew much better than I what kind of wood was
fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood
to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very
like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour
and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or
cavity of this tree out, to make it into a boat; but
I showed how rather to cut it out with tools, which
after I showed him how to use, he did very handily;
and in about a month's hard labour we finished it
and made it very handsome, especially when, with
our axes, which I showed him how to handle, we
cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of
a boat; after this, however, it cost us near a fort-
night's time to get her along, as it were inch by
293
inch, upon great rollers, into the water; but when
she was in, she would have carried twenty men with
ease.
When she was in the water, and though she was
so big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity, and
how swift, my man Friday could manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along; so I asked him if he
would, and if we might, venture over in her?"Yes,"
he said, "he venture over in her very well, though
great blow wind." However, I had a further design
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a
mast and sail, and to fit her with an anchor and
cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get;
so I pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and which there was a great
plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to work to
cut it down, and gave him directions how to shape
and order it: but as to the sail, that was my par-
ticular care; I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces
of old sails enough; but as I had had them now
twenty-six years by me, and had not been very care-
ful to preserve them, not imagining that I should
ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt
but they were all rotten; and indeed most of them
were so; however I found two pieces which appeared
pretty good, and with these I went to work, and
with a great deal of pains, and awkward tedious
stitching (you may be sure) for want of needles, I at
length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what
we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the
top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with,
and such as I best knew how to manage; because it
was such a one as I used in the boat in which I made
my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part
of my story.
I was near two months performing this last
work, viz., rigging and fitting my mast and sails,
for I finished them very complete, making a small
stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if we should
turn to windward; and which was more than all, I
fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to steer with; and
though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I
knew the usefulness, and even necessity of such a
thing, I applied myself with so much pains to do it,
that at last I brought it to pass, though, considering
the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I
think it cost me almost as much labour as making the
boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat; for though he knew very well how to paddle
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail
and a rudder, and was the more amazed when he
saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the
rudder, and how the sail gibed, and filled this way or
that way, as the course we sailed changed; I say,
when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and
amazed; however, with a little use, I made all these
things familiar to him, and he became an expert
sailor, except that as to the compass I could make
him understand very little of that; on the other
hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and
seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was
the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were
always to be seen by night, and the shore by day,
except in the rainy seasons; and then nobody cared
to stir abroad, either by land or sea.
295
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the three
last years that I had this creature with me, ought
rather to be left out of the account, my habitation
being quite of another kind than in all the rest of
my time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here
with the same thankfulness to God for His mercies
as at first; and if I had such cause of acknowledg-
ment at first, I had much more so now, having such
additional testimonies of the care of Providence over
me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually
and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible im-
pression upon my thoughts, that my deliverance was
at hand, and that I should not be another year in
this place. However, I went on with my husbandry,
digging, planting, and fencing, as usual; I gathered
and cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing,
as before.
The rainy season was in the meantime upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times;
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we
could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I
said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the
ship; and hauling her up to the shore at high-water
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just
big enough for her to float in; and then, when the
tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end
of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as
to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain off,
we laid a great many boughs of trees so thick, that
she was as well thatched as a house; and thus we
waited for the months of November and December,
in which I designed to make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the
thought of my design returned with the fair weather,
I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the first
thing I did was to lay up a certain quantity of pro-
visions, being the store for the voyage; and intended,
in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon
something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and
bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find
a turtle or tortoise; a thing which we generally got
once a week, for the sake of the eggs, as well as the
flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came
running back, and flew over my outward wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps
he set his feet on; and before I had time to speak to
him, he cried out to me, "O master! O master! O
sorrow! O bad!"—"What's the matter, Friday!"
said I. "O yonder there," says he, "one, two, three,
canoe! one, two, three!" By this way of speaking,
I concluded there were six; but on inquiry I found
there were but three. "Well, Friday," said I, "do
not be frighted;" so I heartened him up as well as I
could. However, I saw the poor fellow most terribly
scared; for nothing ran in his head but that they
were come to look for him, and would cut him in
pieces, and eat him; the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him; I comforted
him as well as I could, and told him I was in as
much danger as he, and that they would eat me as
well as him. "But," said I, "Friday, we must re-
solve to fight them: can you fight, Friday ?"—" Me
shoot," says he, "but there come many great num-
ber."—"No matter for that," said I again; "our guns
will fright them that we do not kill." So I asked
him whither, if I resolved to defend him, he would

defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bade him?
He said, "Me die, when you bid die, master;" so I
went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave
him; for I had been so good a husband of my rum,
that I had a great deal left. When he had drank it,
I made him take the two fowling-pieces which we
always carried, and load them with large swan-shot
as big as small pistol-bullets; then I took four mus-
kets, and loaded them with two slugs and five small
bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a
brace of bullets each: I hung my great sword, as
usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared myself, I took my
perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the
hill, to see what I could discover; and I found
quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-
twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes;
and that their whole business seemed to be the
triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies;
a barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more than, as
I had observed, was usual with them.
I observed also that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to the
sea; this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand
these wretches came about, so filled me with indig-
nation, that I came down again to Friday, and told
him I was resolved to go down to them and kill
them all; and asked him if he would stand by me.
He was now gotten over his fright, and his spirits
being a little raised with the dram I had given him,
he was very cheerful; and told me, as before, he
would die when I bid die.
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the
arms, which I had charged, as before, between us;
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and
three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol,
and the other three myself; and in this posture we
marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more
powder and bullet; and as to orders, I charged him to
keep close behind me, and not to stir, shoot, or do
anything till I bid him; and in the meantime, not to
speak a word. In this posture I fetched a compass
to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the
creek as to get into the wood; so that I might come
within shot of them before I could be discovered,
which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former
thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolution;
I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their
number; for as they were naked, unarmed wretches,
it is certain I was superior to them; nay, though I
had been alone; but it occurred to my thoughts,
what call, what occasion, much less what necessity,
I was in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack
people who had neither done nor intended me any
wrong, who, as to me, were innocent, and whose
barbarous customs were their own disaster, being
in them a token indeed of God's having left them,
with the other nations of that part of the world, to
such stupidity and to such inhuman courses; but
did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of
their actions, much less an executioner of His justice;
that whenever He thought fit, He would take the
cause into His own hands, and by national vengeance
punish them for national crimes; but that in the
299
meantime it was none of my business; that it was
true, Friday might justify it, because he was a de-
clared enemy, and in a state of war with those very
particular people, and it was lawful for him to attack
them; but I could not say the same with respect to
me. These things were so warmly pressed upon my
thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I
would only go place myself near them, that I might
observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act
then as God should direct; but that unless some-
thing offered that was more a call to me than yet
I knew of, I would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood, and with
all possible wariness and silence (Friday following
close at my heels) I marched till I came to the
skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to
them; only that one corner of the wood lay between
me and them: here I called softly to Friday, and
showing him a great tree, which was just at the
corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and
bring me word if he could see there plainly what
they were doing: he did so, and came immediately
back to me, and told me they might be plainly
viewed there; that they were all about the fire, eating
the flesh of one of their prisoners; and that another
lay bound upon the sand, a little from them, whom
he said they would kill next, and which fired the
very soul within me. He told me it was not one of
their nation, but one of the bearded men whom he
had told me of, who came to their country in the
boat. I was filled with horror at the very naming
the white-bearded man, and going to the tree, I saw
plainly by my glass, a white man, who lay upon the
beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied
with flags, or things like rushes; and that he was a
European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the place
where I was, which by going a little way about, I
saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I
should be within half-shot of them; so I withheld
my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the
highest degree; and going back about twenty paces,
I got behind some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to the other tree, and then I came to a
little rising ground, which gave me a full view of
them at the distance of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of
the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all close
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps
limb by limb, to their fire; and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to
Friday; "Now, Friday," said I, "do as I bid thee."
Friday said he would. "Then, Friday," said I, "do
exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing." So I set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon
the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with
the other musket I took my aim at the savages,
bidding him do the like. Then asking him if he was
ready, he said "Yes."—"Then fire at them," said I;
and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them and
wounded three more; and on my side, I killed one,
and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in
a dreadful consternation; and all of them, who were
not hurt, jumped up upon their feet immediately,
301
but did not know which way to run, or which way to
look; for they knew not from whence their destruc-
tion came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me,
that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I did;
so as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down
the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday
did the like; he sees me cock and present; he did
the same again. "Are you ready, Friday?" said I.
"Yes," says he. "Let fly,then," said I, "in the name
of God;" and with that I fired again among the
amazed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our
pieces were now loaden with what I called swan-
shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only two
drop; but so many were wounded, that they ran
about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all
bloody, and miserably wounded most of them;
whereof three more fell quickly after, though not
quite dead.
"Now, Friday," said I, laying down the discharged
pieces and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden, "follow me," said I; which he did with
a deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of
the wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at
my foot: as soon as I perceived they saw me, I
shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so
too; and running as fast as I could, which by the
way was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I
was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who
was, as I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between
the place where they sat and the sea; the two
butchers who were just going to work with him,
had left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and
fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest
made the same way: I turned to Friday, and bade
him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood
me immediately, and running about forty yards to
be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had
killed them all; for I saw them all fall in a heap
into the boat; though I saw two of them up again
quickly; however, he killed two of them, and
wounded the third, so that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat, as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out
my knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor vic-
tim; and loosing his hands and feet I lifted him up,
and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he
was? he answered in Latin, Christianus; but was
so weak and faint, that he could scarce stand, or
speak; I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave
it him, making signs that he should drink, which
he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he
ate; then I asked him what countryman he was?
and he said Espagnole; and being a little recovered,
let me know, by all the signs he could possibly make,
how much he was in my debt for his deliverance.
"Seignior," said I, with as much Spanish as I could
make up, "we will talk afterwards, but we must
fight now; if you have any strength left, take this
pistol and sword, and lay about you :" he took them
very thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in
his hands, but as if they had put new vigour into
him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and
had cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for
the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so
the poor creatures were so much frighted with the
noise of our pieces, that they fell down for mere
amazement and fear, and had no more power to at-
303
tempt their own escape, than their flesh had to resist
our shot; and that was the case of those five that
Friday shot in the boat; for as three of them fell
with the hurt they received, so the other two fell
with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing-,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I
called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which
lay there, that had been discharged, which he did
with great swiftness; and then giving him my mus-
ket, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and
bade them come to me when they wanted. While I
was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the
savages, who made at him with one of their great
wooden swords, the same weapon that was to have
killed him before, if I had not prevented it: the
Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as could be
imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian a
good while, and had cut him two great wounds on his
head; but the savage, being a stout lusty fellow,
closing in with him, had thrown him down (being
faint), and was wringing my sword out of his hand,
when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quit-
ting his sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot
the savage through the body, and killed him upon
the spot, before I, who was running to help, could
come near him.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand, but his
hatchet; and with that he despatched those three
who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him
one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued
two of the savages, and wounded them both; but as
he was not able to run, they both got from him into
the woods, where Friday pursued them, and killed
one of them; but the other was too nimble for him;
and though he was wounded, yet he plunged into the
sea, and swam with all his might off to those who
were left in the canoe; which three in the canoe, with
one wounded, who we know not whether he died or
no, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-
twenty. The account of the rest is as follows:
3 Killed at our shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto, of those first wounded.
I Killed by ditto in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropped here and there of
their wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase
of them.
4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded if
not dead.
21 in all.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get
out of gun-shot; and though Friday made two or
three shots at them, I did not find that he hit any of
them; Friday would fain have had me take one of
their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed I was
very anxious about their escape; lest, carrying the
news home to their people, they should come back,
perhaps with two or three hundred of their canoes,
3°5
and devour us by mere multitudes; so I consented
to pursue them by sea; and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in and bade Friday follow me;
but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find
another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand
and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter,
and almost dead with fear, not knowing what the
matter was; for he had not been able to look up
over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard, neck
and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had
really little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not stand or speak,
but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems still,
that he was only unbound in order to be killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling out
my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram,
which, with the news of his being delivered, revived
him, and he sat up in the boat; but when Friday
came to hear him speak, and looked in his face, it
would have moved any one to tears, to have seen
how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him,
cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung,
then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face
and head, and then sung and jumped about again
like a distracted creature. It was a good while
before I could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the matter; but when he came a little to
himself, he told me that it was his father.
It was not easy for me to express how it moved
me, to see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked
in this poor savage, at the sight of his father, and of
VOL. I. U
his being delivered from death; nor indeed can I
describe half the extravagances of his affection after
this; for he went into the boat and out of the boat
a great many times: when he went in to him, he
would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his
father's head close to his bosom, half an hour together
to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles,
which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I per-
ceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of
my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great
deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe
with the other savages, who were now gotten almost
out of sight; and it was happy for us that we did
not; for it blew so hard within two hours after, and
before they could be gotten a quarter of their way,
and continued blowing so hard all night, and that
from the north-west, which was against them, that
I could not suppose their boat could live, or that
they ever reached to their own coast.
But to return to Friday: he was so busy about his
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him
off for some time; but after I thought he could leave
him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping
and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme.
Then I asked him if he had given his father any
bread? He shook his head, and said, "None: ugly
dog eat all up self." So I gave him a cake of bread
out of a little pouch I carried on purpose; I also
gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste
it, but carried it to his father: I had in my pocket
also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave
him a handful of them for his father. He had no
307
sooner given his father these raisins, but I saw him
come out of the boat, and run away as if he had been
bewitched. He ran at such a rate (for he was the
swiftest fellow of his feet that ever I saw)—I say he
ran at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it
were, in an instant; and though I called and hallooed
too after him, it was all one; away he went and in
a quarter of an hour I saw him come back again,
though not so fast as he went; and as he came
nearer, I found his pace was slacker, because he had
something in his hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his
father some fresh water; and that he had got two
more cakes, or loaves of bread. The bread he gave
me, but the water he carried to his father; however,
as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it:
this water revived his father more than all the rum
or spirits I had given him; for he was just fainting
with thirst.
When his father had drank, I called him, to know
if there was any water left. He said "Yes;" and I
bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in
as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of
the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard too,
who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself
upon a green place, under the shade of a tree, and
whose limbs were also very stiff and very much
swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with:
when I saw that upon Friday's coming to him with
the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread,
and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a
handful of raisins: he looked up in my face with all
the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could
appear in any countenance; but was so weak, not-
withstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight,
that he could not stand upon his feet; he tried to do
it two or three times, but was really not able, his
ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so I
bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his
ankles, and bathe them with rum as he had done his
father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature every two
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here,
turned his head about, to see if his father was in the
same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at
last he found he was not to be seen; at which he
started up, and without speaking a word, flew with
that swiftness to him that one could scarce perceive
his feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he
came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease
his limbs; so Friday came back to me presently, and
I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him
up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he
should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take
care of him: but Friday, a lusty young fellow, took
the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried him
away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the
side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the in-
side of it, and then lifted them quite in, and set him
close to his father, and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too; so he brought them both safe into our
creek; and leaving them in the boat, runs away to
fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to
him, and asked him whither he went? He told me
".Go fetch more boat;" so away he went, like the
309
wind; for sure never man or horse ran like him, and
he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon
as I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and
then went to help our new guests out of the boat,
which he did; but they were neither of them able to
walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my thought,
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of
handbarrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car-
ried them up both together upon it between us;
but when we got them to the outside of our wall or
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before;
for it was impossible to get them over; and I was
resolved not to break it down: so I set to work
again; and Friday and I, in about two hours'time,
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails,
and above that with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and between that
and the grove of young wood which I had planted,
and here we made two beds of such things as I had,
viz., of good rice straw, with blankets laid upon it to
lie on, and another to cover them on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought myself
very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked:
first of all, the whole country was my own mere pro-
perty, so that I had an undoubted right of dominion;
2ndly, my people were perfectly subjected. I was
absolute lord and lawgiver. They all owed their
lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives,
if there had been occasion for it, for me; it was
remarkable too, I had but three subjects, and they
were of three different religions. My man Friday
was a Protestant, his father a Pagan and a cannibal,
and the Spaniard was a Papist; however, I allowed
liberty of conscience throughout my dominions, but
this by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter and a place to rest
them upon, I began to think of making some pro-
vision for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered
Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a
goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed; then I
cut off the hind quarter, and chopping it into small
pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing,
and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of
flesh and broth, having put some barley and rice also
into the broth; and as I cooked it without doors (for
I made no fire within my inner wall), so I carried it all
into the new tent; and having set a table there for
them, I sat down and ate my dinner also with them,
and as well as I could, cheered them and encouraged
them, Friday being my interpreter, especially to his
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the Spa-
niard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
our muskets and other fire-arms, which, for want of
time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the
next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun,
and would presently be offensive; and I also or-
dered him to bury the horrid remains of their
barbarous feast, which I knew were pretty much,
and which I could not think of doing myself; nay,
I could not bear to see them, if I went that way:
all which he punctually performed, and defaced the
3"
very appearance of the savages being there; so that
when I went again, I could scarce know where it was,
otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing
to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation
with my two new subjects; and first I set Friday to
inquire of his father what he thought of the escape of
the savages in that canoe? and whether he might
expect a return of them with a power too great
for us to resist? His first opinion was, that the
savages in the boat never could live out the storm
which blew that night they went off, but must of
necessity be drowned or driven south to those other
shores, where they were as sure to be devoured, as
they were to be drowned if they were cast away; but
as to what they would do if they came safe on shore,
he said he knew not; but it was his opinion, that
they were so dreadfully frighted with the manner of
being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he be-
lieved they would tell their people they were all
killed by thunder and lightning, and not by the
hand of man; and that the two which appeared (viz.,
Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits or furies
come down to destroy them, and not men with
weapons. This, he said, he knew, because he heard
them all cry out so in their language to one another;
for it was impossible for them to conceive that a
man should dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill
at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was
done now. And this old savage was in the right;
for as I understood since by other hands, the savages
of that part never attempted to go over to the island
afterwards. They were so terrified with the accounts
given by these four men (for it seems they did escape
the sea), that they believed whoever went to that
enchanted island would be destroyed with fire from
the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was
under continual apprehensions for a good while, and
kept always upon my guard, I and all my army; for
as there were now four of us, I would have ventured
upon a hundred of them fairly in the open field at
any time.
In a little time, however, no more canoes appear-
ing, the fear of their coming wore off; and I began
to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the
main into consideration, being likewise assured by
Friday's father that I might depend upon good
usage from their nation on his account if I would
go-

BUT my thoughts were a little suspended, when I
had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when
I understood that there were sixteen more of his
313
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast
away, and made their escape to that side, lived there
at peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore
put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life: I asked
him all the particulars of their voyage; and found
they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la
Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave their
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and
to bring back what European goods they could meet
with there; that they had five Portuguese seamen on
board, whom they took out of another wreck; that
five of their own men were drowned when first the
ship was lost; and that these escaped through infinite
dangers and hazards, and arrived almost starved on
the cannibal coast, where they expected to have been
devoured every moment.
He told me they had some arms with them; but
they were perfectly useless; for that they had neither
powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled
all their powder, but a little which they used
at their first landing to provide themselves some
food.
I asked him what he thought would become of
them there; and if they had formed no design of
making any escape? He said, they had many con-
sultations about it; but that having neither vessel,
nor tools to build one, nor provisions'of any kind, their
counsels always ended in tears and despair.
I asked him how he thought they would receive
a proposal from me, which might tend towards an
escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put
my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no
inherent virtue in the nature of man; nor did men
always square their dealings by the obligations they
had received, so much as they did by the advantages
they expected; I told him, it would be very hard
that I should be the instrument of their deliverance,
and that they should afterwards make me their
prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was
certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or
what accident soever, brought him thither; and that
I had rather be delivered up to the savages, and be
devoured alive, than fall into the merciless claws of
the priests, and be carried into the inquisition. I
added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were
all here, we might, with so many hands, build a bark
large enough to carry us all away either to the
Brazils southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast
northward; but that if in requital they should, when
I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by
force among their own people, I might be ill used
for my kindness to them, and make my case worse
than it was before.
He answered with a great deal of candour and
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable, and
that they were so sensible of it, that he believed they
would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly
that should contribute to their deliverance; and that,
if I pleased, he would go to them with the old man,
and discourse with them about it, and return again,
and bring me their answer; that he would make con-
ditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they
would be absolutely under my leading, as their com-
mander and captain; and that they should swear
upon the holy Sacraments and Gospel, to be true to
me, and go to such Christian country as I should
agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly
and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed
safely in such country as I intended; and that he
would bring a contract from them under their hands
for that purpose.
Then he told me, he would first swear to me him-
self, that he would never stir from me as long as he
lived, till I gave him order; and that he would take
my side to the last drop of blood, if there should
happen the least breach of faith among his country-
men.
He told me they were all of them very civil, honest
men, and they were under the greatest distress im-
aginable, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any
food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages;
out of all hopes of ever returning to their own
country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake
their relief, they would live and die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to
relieve them if possible, and to send the old savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat; but when
he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so
much prudence in it on one hand, and so much sin-
cerity on the other hand, that I could not but be
very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off
the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a
year. The case was this:
He had been with us now about a month; during
which time I had let him see in what manner I had
provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my
support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn
and rice I had laid up, which, as it was more than
sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least
without good husbandry, for my family, now it was
increased to number four; but much less would it
be sufficient if his countrymen who were, as he
said, fourteen still alive, should come over; and
least of all would it be sufficient to victual our ves-
sel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any of
the Christian colonies of America. So he told me,
he thought it would be more advisable to let him
and the other two dig and cultivate some more land,
as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that we
should wait another harvest, that we might have a
supply of corn for his countrymen when they should
come; for want might be a temptation to them to dis-
agree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise
than out of one difficulty into another: "You know,"
says he," the children of Israel, though they rejoiced at
first at their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled
even against God Himself, that delivered them, when
they came to want bread in the wilderness."
His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with
his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fide-
lity. So we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as
the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted;
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it
was seed-time, we had gotten as much land cured
and trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of
barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in
short, all the seed we had to spare; nor indeed did
we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food
for the six months that we had to expect our crop,
that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our
seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it
is six months in the ground in that country.
Having now society enough, and our number
being sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages,
if they had come, unless their number had been very
great, we went freely all over the island, wherever we
found occasion; and as here we had our escape or de-
liverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least
for me, to have the means of it out of mine; to this
purpose, I marked out several trees, which I thought
fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to
cutting them down; and then I caused the Spaniard,
to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to
oversee and direct their work; I showed them with
what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into
single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till
they had made about a dozen large planks of good
oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and
from two inches to four inches thick: what prodigious
labour it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time I contrived to increase my little
flock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard to go out
one day, and myself with Friday the next day, for
we took our turns: and by this means we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock: but, above all, the season
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a
prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that
I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins
of the sun are cured, we should have filled sixty or
eighty barrels; and these with our bread, was a
great part of our food, and very good living too, I
assure you; for it is an exceeding nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order;
it was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in
the island, but, however, it was enough to answer
our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley, we
brought in and threshed out above two hundred and
twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the rice,
which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been
on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for
a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled
our ship, to have carried us to any part of the world,
that is to say, of America. When we had thus
housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell
to work to make more wicker-work; viz., great
baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was
very handy and dexterous at this part, and often
blamed me, that I did not make some things for
defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of
it. And now having a full supply of food for all the
guests expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main, to sec what he could do with those
he left behind him there: I gave him a strict charge
in writing not to bring any man with him, who would
not first swear, in the presence of himself and of the
old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with,
or attack the person he should find in the island,
who was so kind to send for them, in order to their
deliverance; but that they would stand by and
defend him against all such attempts; and wherever
they went, would be entirely under, and subjected
to his command; and that this should be put in
writing and signed with their hands: how we were
to have this done, when I knew they had neither
pen nor ink, that indeed was a question which we
never asked.
319
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the
old savage (the father of Friday), went away in one
of the canoes, which they might be said to come in,
or rather were brought in, when they came as pri-
soners to be devoured by the savages.
I gave each of them a musket with a firelock
on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball,
charging them to be very good husbands of both,
and not to use either of them but upon urgent occa-
sions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first measures
used by me in view of my deliverance for now
twenty-seven years and some days. I gave them
provisions of bread, and of dried grapes sufficient for
themselves for many days, and sufficient for their
countrymen for about eight days time; and wishing
them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing with
them about a signal they should hang out at their
return, by which I should know them again, when
they came back, at a distance, before they came on
shore.
They went away with a fair gale on the day that
the moon was at the full; by my account in the
month of October; but as for the exact reckoning of
days, after I had once lost it, I could never recover it
again; nor had I kept even the number of years so
punctually, as to be sure that I was right, though, as
it proved when I afterwards examined my account, I
found I had kept a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened,
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in
history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning,
when my man Friday came running in to me, and
called aloud, "Master, master, they are come, they
are come."
I jumped up, and regardless of danger, I went out
as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my
little grove, which (by the way) was by this time
grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of
danger, I went without my arms, which was not my
custom to do; but I was surprised, when, turning my
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a
league and a halfs distance, standing in for the shore,
with a shoulder of mutton sail, as they call it, and the
wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in. Also I
observed presently, that they did not come from that
side which the shore lay on, but from the southern-
most end of the island. Upon this I called Friday
in, and bid him lie close, for these were not the people
we looked for, and that we did not know yet whether
they were friends or enemies.
In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspec-
tive-glass, to see what I could make of them; and
having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the
top of the hill, as I used to do when I was appre-
hensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer
without being discovered.
I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye
plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about
two leagues and a half's distance from me, S.S.E.
but not above a league and a half from the shore.
By my observation it appeared plainly to be an Eng-
lish ship, and the boat appeared to be an English
long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one whom I had reason
to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and
321
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep
upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me
to consider what business an English ship could have
in that part of the world; since it was not the way to
or from any part of the world where the English had
any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to
drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they
were English really, it was most probable that they
were here upon no good design; and that I had
better continue as I was, than fall into the hands of
thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of
danger which sometimes are given him when he may
think there is no possibility of its being real. That
such hints and notices are given us, I believe few
that have made any observation of things can deny •
that they are certain discoveries of an invisible world,
and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if
the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of
danger, why should we not suppose they are from
some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior
and subordinate, is not the question), and that they
are given for our good?
The present question abundantly confirms me in
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been
made cautious by this secret admonition, come from
whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and
in a far worse condition than before, as you will see
presently.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at for the convenience of
VOL. L X
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
landing; however, as they did not come quite far
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I
formerly landed my rafts, but run their boat on
shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me,
which was very happy for me; for otherwise they
would have landed just, as I may say, at my door,
and would have soon beaten me out of my castle,
and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on shore I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one
or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove
so. There were in all eleven men, whereof three
of them I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them were
jumped on shore, they took those three out of the
boat as prisoners; one of the three I could perceive
using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, af-
fliction, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance;
the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands
sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, but not
to such a degree as the first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew
not what the meaning of it should be; Friday called
out to me in English, as well as he could, "O
master! you see English mans eat prisoners as well
as savage mans."—" Why," said I, "Friday, do you
think they are going to eat them then?"—"Yes,"
says Friday, "they will eat them." "No, no," said
I, "Friday; I am afraid they will murder them in-
deed; but you may be sure they will not eat them."
All this while I had no thought of what the mat-
ter really was, but stood trembling with the horror
of the sight, expecting every moment when the three
prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of
the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass (as
the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one of the
poor men; and I expected to see him fall every
moment, at which all the blood in my body seemed
to run chill in my veins.
I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the
savage that was gone with him; or that I had any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of them,
that I might have rescued the three men; for I saw
no fire-arms they had among them; but it fell out to
my mind another way.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of the
three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the
fellows ran scattering about the land, as if they
wanted to see the country. I observed, also, that
the three other men had liberty to go where they
pleased; but they sat down all three upon the
ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair.
This put me in mind of the first time when I
came on shore, and began to look about me; how I
gave myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round
me, what dreadful apprehensions I had, and how I
lodged in the tree all night for fear of being devoured
by wild beasts.
As I knew nothing that night of the supply I
was to receive by the providential driving of the ship
nearer the land, by the storms and tides, by which
I have since been so long nourished and supported:
so these three poor desolate men knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they were,
how near it was to them, and how effectually and
really they were in a condition of safety, at the same
time they thought themselves lost, and their case
desperate.
So little do we see before us in the world, and
so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon
the great Maker of the world, that He does not
leave His creatures so absolutely destitute, but that
in the worst circumstances they have always some-
thing to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even
brought to their deliverance by the means by which
they seem to be brought to their destruction.
It was just at the top of high water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
parleying with the prisoners they brought, and
partly while they rambled about to see what kind
of place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed consider-
ably away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too fast
aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the rest who
were straggling about, upon which they all soon
came to the boat; but it was past all their strength
to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the
shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost
like a quicksand.
In this condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps
the least of all mankind given to forethought, they
gave it over, and away they strolled about the country
again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another
(calling them off from the boat), "Why, let her alone,
Jack, can't ye? she'll float next tide." By which I
was fully confirmed in the main inquiry, of what
countrymen they were. -.
«
All this while I kept myself close, not once daring
to stir out of my castle, any further than to my
place of observation, near the top of the hill; and
very glad I was to think how well it was fortified.
I knew it was no less than ten hours before the
boat could be on float again, and by that time it
would be dark, and I might be more at liberty to
see their motions, and to hear their discourse, if
they had any.
In the meantime I fitted myself up for a battle,
as before, though with more caution, knowing I had
to do with another kind of enemy than I had at
first; I ordered Friday also, whom I had made an
excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself
with arms: I took myself two fowling-pieces, and
I gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed,
was very fierce; I had my formidable goatskin
coat on, with the great cap I mentioned, a naked
sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each
shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have
made any attempt till it was dark; but about two
o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that in
short they were all gone straggling into the woods,
and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep. The
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their con-
dition to get any sleep, were however set down under
the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a
mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any
of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immediately
I marched in the figure above, my man Friday at a
good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms
as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like
figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to
them in Spanish, "What are ye, gentlemen?"
They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure that I made: they made no answer at all, but
I thought I perceived them just going to fly from me,
when I spoke to them in English : "Gentlemen," said
I, "do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may have
a friend near you, when you did not expect it." "He
must be sent directly from Heaven, then," said one of
them very gravely to me, pulling off his hat at the
same time, "for our condition is past the help of man."
"All help is from Heaven, sir," said I: "but can you
put a stranger in the way how to help you? for you
seem to me to be in some great distress. I saw you
when you landed; and when you seemed to make
application to the brutes that came with you, I saw
one of them lift up his sword to kill you."
The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned,
"Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real man, or
an angel ?"—" Be in no fear about that, sir," said I:
"if God had sent an angel to relieve you, He would
have come better clothed, and armed after another
manner than you see me in; pray lay aside your
fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to
assist you; you see I have one servant only; we have
arms and ammunition; tell us freely can we serve
you? What is your case?"
"Our case," said he, "sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are so near; but in short, sir, I
327
was commander of that ship; my men having muti-
nied against me, they have been hardly prevailed on
not to murder me, and at last have set me on shore
in this desolate place, with these two men with me,
one my mate, the other a passenger, where we ex-
pected to perish, believing the place to be unin-
habited, and know not yet what to think of it."
"Where are those brutes, your enemies ?" said I;
"do you know where they are gone ?"—" There they
are, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; "my
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard
you speak; if they have, they will certainly murder
us all."
"Have they any fire-arms?" said I: he answered,
"They had only two pieces, and one which they
left in the boat."—"Well, then," said I, "leave the
rest to me; I see they are all asleep; it is an easy
thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take
them prisoners?" He told me there were two des-
perate villains among them, that it was scarce safe
to show any mercy to; but if they were secured, he
believed all the rest would return to their duty: I
asked him which they were? He told me, he could
not at that distance describe them; but he would
obey my orders in anything I would direct. "Well,"
said I, "let us retreat out of their view or hearing,
lest they awake, and we will resolve further;" so
they willingly went back with me, till the woods
covered us from them.
"Look you, sir," said I, "if I venture upon your
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions
with me?" He anticipated my proposals, by telling
me, that both he and his ship, if recovered, should
be wholly directed and commanded by me in every-
thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he would
live and die with me in what part of the world
soever I would send him; and the other two men
said the same.
"Well," said I, "my conditions are but two: 1.
That while you stay on this island with me, you
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I
put arms into your hands, you will upon all occasions
give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or
mine, upon this island, and in the meantime to be
governed by my orders.
"2. That if the ship is or may be recovered, you
will carry me and my man to England, passage
free."
He gave me all the assurance that the invention
and faith of a man could devise, that he would
comply with these most reasonable demands; and
besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all occasions as long as he lived.
"Well, then," said I, "here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you
think is proper to be done." He showed all the
testimony of his gratitude that he was able; but
offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him,
I thought it was hard venturing anything, but the
best method I could think of was, to fire upon them
at once, as they lay; and if any were not killed at
the first volley, and offered to submit, we might
save them, and so put it wholly upon God's provi-
dence to direct the shot.
He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all
the mutiny in the ship; and if they escaped, we
329
should be undone still; for they would go on
board, and bring the whole ship's company, and
destroy us all. "Well then," said I, "necessity legi-
timates my advice; for it is the only way to save
our lives."
However, seeing him still cautious of shedding
blood, I told him, they should go themselves, and
manage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on
their feet. I asked him if either of them were the
men who he had said were the heads of the mutiny?
He said, No. "Well then," said I, "you may let
them escape, and Providence seems to have wakened
them on purpose to save themselves. Now," said I,
"if the rest escape you, it is your fault."
Animated with this, he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and his
two comrades with him, with each man a piece in
his hand: the two men who were with him, going
first, made some noise, at which one of the seamen,
who was awake, turned about, and seeing them
coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too late
then: for the moment he cried out, they fired; I
mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving his
own piece: they had so well aimed their shot at
the men they knew, that one of them was killed
on the spot, and the other very much wounded;
but not being dead, he started up to his feet, and
called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain
stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for
help; he should call upon God to forgive his villany;
and with that word knocked him down with the
stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more:
there were three more in the company, and one of
them was also slightly wounded. By this time I
was come; and when they saw their danger, and
that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy.
The captain told them he would spare their lives, if
they would give him any assurance of their abhor-
rence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and
would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the
ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica,
from whence they came. They gave him all the
protestations of their sincerity that could be desired,
and he was willing to believe them, and spare their
lives which I was not against; only I obliged him
to keep them bound hand and foot while they were
upon the island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure
her, and bring away the oars and sail, which they
did; and by and by, three straggling men, that
were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came
back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their
captain who before was their prisoner, now their
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and
so our victory was complete.
It now remained that the captain and I should
inquire into one another's circumstances: I began
first, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and in-
deed as my story is a whole collection of wonders,
it affected him deeply; but when he reflected from
thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been
preserved there on purpose to save his life, the tears
331
ran down his face, and he could not speak a word
more.
After this communication was at an end, I carried
him and his two men into my apartments, leading
them in just where I came out, viz., at the top of the
house; where I refreshed them with such provisions
as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I
had made during my long, long inhabiting that
place.
All I showed them, all I said to them, was per-
fectly amazing; but, above all, the captain admired
my fortification: and how perfectly I had concealed
my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having now
been planted near twenty years, and the trees grow-
ing much faster than in England, was become a
little wood, and so thick, that it was unpassable in
any part of it, but at that one side where I had re-
served my little winding passage into it: this I told
him was my castle, and my residence; but that I
had a seat in the country, as most princes have,
whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would
show him that too another time; but at present our
business was to consider how to recover the ship.
He agreed with me as to that; but told me he was
perfectly at a loss what measure to take; for that
there were still six-and-twenty hands on board, who
having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which
they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would
be hardened in it now by desperation; and would
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced, they
should be brought to the gallows as soon as they
came to England, or to any of the English colonies;
and that therefore there would be no attacking them
with so small a number as we were.
'THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it was a very rational conclusion, and that
therefore something was to be resolved on very speed-
ily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare
for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us,
and destroying us. Upon this, it presently occurred
to me, that in a little while the ship's crew, wondering
what was become of their comrades and of the boat,
would certainly come on shore in their other boat to
see for them; and that then perhaps they might come
armed, and be too strong for us; this he allowed was
rational.
Upon this I told him the first thing we had to do
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so
that they might not carry her off; and taking every-
thing out of her, leaving her so far useless as not to
be fit to swim; accordingly we went on board, took
the arms which were left on board out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of
brandy and another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a
horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece
of canvas; the sugar was five or six pounds; all
which was very welcome to me, especially the
brandy and sugar, of which I had none left for many
years.
When we had carried all these things on shore
(the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were
carried before as above), we knocked a great hole in
her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to
master us, yet they could not carry off the boat.
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts that we
could be capable to recover the ship; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again to carry
333
us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our
friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still
in my thoughts.
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE SHIP MAKES SIGNALS FOR HER BOAT—ON RECEIVING
NO ANSWER, SHE SENDS ANOTHER BOAT ON SHORE
METHODS BY WHICH WE SECURE THIS BOAT'S CREW,
AND RECOVER THE SHIP.
WHILE we were thus preparing our designs, and had
first by main strength heaved the boat up upon the
beach, so high that the tide would not float her off at
high water mark; and, besides, had broken a hole in
her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were
sat down musing what we should do; we heard the
ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her
ancient, as a signal for the boat to come on board;
but no boat stirred; and they fired several times,
making other signals for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw
them (by the help of our glasses) hoist another boat
out, and row towards the shore; and we found, as
they approached, that there were no less than ten
men in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore,
we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain
sight of the men, even of their faces; because the
tide having set them a little to the east of the other
boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the
same place where the other had landed, and where
the boat lay.
By this means, I say, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the persons and characters of
all the men in the boat; of whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows who he was sure were
led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over-
powered and frighted: but that for the boatswain,
who, it seems, was the chief officer among them, and
all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the
ship's crew; and were, no doubt, made desperate in
their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he
was, that they would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our
circumstances were past the operations of fear; that
seeing almost every condition that could be was
better than that we were supposed to be in, we ought
to expect that the consequence, whether death or
life, would be sure to be a deliverance: I asked him,
what he thought of the circumstances of my life, and
whether a deliverance were not worth venturing
for?"And where, sir," said I, "is your belief of
my being preserved here on purpose to save your life,
which elevated you a little while ago? For my part,"
said I, "there seems to be one thing amiss in all the
prospect of it."—"What's that?" says he. "Why,"
said I, "'tis that as you say, there are three or four
honest fellows among them, which should be spared;
had they been all of the'wicked part of the crew, I
should have thought God's providence had singled
them out to deliver them into your hands: for,
depend upon it, every man of them that comes
ashore are our own, and shall die or live as they
behave to us."
335
As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so
we set vigorously to our business. We had, upon
the first appearance of the boat's coming from the
ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and had
indeed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured
than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the
three (delivered men) to my cave, where they were
remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods,
if they could have delivered themselves: here they
left them bound, but gave them provisions, and
promised them, if they continued there quietly, to
give them their liberty in a day or two; but that if
they attempted their escape, they should be put to
death without mercy. They promised faithfully to
bear their confinement with patience, and were very
thankful that they had such good usage as to have
provisions and a light left them; for Friday gave
them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their
comfort; and they did not know but that he stood
sentinel over them at the entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage > two of them
were kept pinioned indeed, because the captain was
not free to trust them; but the other two were taken
into my service upon their captain's recommendation,
and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die
with us; so, with them and the three honest men,
we were seven men well armed; and I made no
doubt we should be able to deal well enough with
the ten that were a-coming, considering that the
captain had said, there were three or four honest
men among them also.
As soon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and
came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them,
which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would
rather have left the boat at an anchor, some distance
from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her;
and so we should not be able to seize the boat.
Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran
all to the other boat; and it was easy to see they
were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as
above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her
bottom.
After they had mused a while upon this, they set
up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions
hear; but all was to no purpose: then they came all
close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms,
which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the
woods ring; but it was all one: those in the cave
we were sure could not hear; and those in our keep-
ing, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give
no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go
all on board again to their ship, and let them know
there that the men were all murdered and the long
boat staved; accordingly, they immediately launched
the boat again, and got all of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the ship again and set sail, giving their comrades up
for lost, and so he should still lose the ship which he
was in hopes we should have recovered; but he was
quickly as much frighted the other way.
337
They had not been long put off with the boat, but
we perceived them all coming on shore again; but
with this new measure in their conduct, which it
seems they consulted together upon; viz., to leave
three men in the boat, and the rest to go on shore,
and go up into the country to look for their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us; for now
we were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if
we let the boat escape, because they would then row
away to the ship; and then the rest of them would
be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our recovering
the ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present. The seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained in
the boat put her off to a good distance from the
shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them; so
that it was impossible for us to come at them in the
boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay; and we could see them
plainly, though they could not perceive us; we
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them;
or that they would have gone further off, that we
might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the hill,
where they could see a great way in the valley and
woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hal-
looed till they were weary; and not caring, it seems,
to venture far from the shore, nor far from one
VOL. I. Y
another, they sat down together under a tree, to con-
sider of it; had they thought fit to have gone to
sleep there, as the other party of them had done,
they had done the job for us; but they were too full
of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep,
though they could not tell what the danger was they
had to fear neither.
The captain made a very just proposal to me
upon this consultation of theirs; viz., that perhaps
they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to
make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally
upon them, just at the juncture when their pieces
were all discharged, and they would certainly yield,
and we should have them without bloodshed. I
liked the proposal, provided it was done while we
were near enough to come up to them, before they
could load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen, and we lay still a
long time very irresolute what course to take; at
length I told them there would be nothing to be
done in my opinion till night; and then if they did
not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way
to get between them and the shore, and so might
use some stratagem with them in the boat, to get
them on shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneasy; when,
after long consultations, we saw them start all up,
and march down towards the sea: it seems they had
such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger
of the place, that they resolved to go on board the
ship again, give their companions over for lost, and
so go on with their intended voyage with the
ship.
339
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined it to be as it really was; that they had
given over their search, and were for going back
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of
it; but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch
them back again, and which answered my end to a
tittle.
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go
over the little creek westward, towards the place
where the savages came on shore when Friday was
rescued; and as soon as they came to a little rising
ground at about half a mile distance, I bade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they found
the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they
heard the seamen answer them, they should return
it again, and then, keeping out of sight, take a
round, always answering when the others hallooed,
to draw them as far into the island, and among the
woods, as possible, and then wheel about again to
me, by such ways as I directed.
They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard
them, and answering, run along the shore westward,
towards the voice they heard, when they were pre-
sently stopped by the creek, where the water being
up, they could not get over, and calling for the boat
to come up, and set them over, as indeed I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed
that the boat being gone up a good way into the creek,
and as it were in a harbour within the land, they
took one of the three men out of her to go along with
them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened
her to the stump of a little tree on the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their busi-
ness, I took the rest with me, and crossing the creek
out of their sight, we surprised the two men before
they were aware, one of them lying on shore, and
the other being in the boat; the fellow on shore was
between sleeping and waking, and going to start up,
the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him and
knocked him down, and then called out to him in
the boat to yield, or he was a dead man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him,
and his comrade knocked down; besides, this was,
it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in
the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to
join very sincerely with us.
In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business with the rest, that
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one hill to another, and from one wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, but left them
where they were very sure they could not reach back
to the boat before it was dark; and indeed they were
heartily tired themselves also by the time they came
back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make
sure work with them.
It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came
quite up, calling to those behind to come along; and
could also hear them answer, and complain how
341
lame and tired they were, and not being able to come
any faster, which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is
impossible to express their confusion, when they
found the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide
ebbed out, and their two men gone; we could hear
them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were gotten into
an enchanted island; that either there were inha-
bitants in it, and they should all be murdered; or
else there were devils or spirits in it, and they should
be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two com-
rades by their names a great many times, but no
answer: after some time, we could see them, by the
little light there was, run about wringing their hands,
like men in despair; and that sometimes they would
go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then
come ashore, and walk about again, and so the same
thing over again.
My men would fain have had me given them leave
to fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was
willing to take them at some advantage, so to spare
them, and kill as few of them as I could; and espe-
cially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our
men, knowing the other men were very well armed:
I resolved to wait to see if they did not separate;
and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my
ambuscade nearer; and ordered Friday and the
captain to creep upon their hands and feet as close
to the ground as they could, that they might not be
discovered, and get as near them as they could
possibly, before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, till the
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the
mutiny, and had now shown himself the most de-
jected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking
towards them with two more of the crew; the cap-
tain was so eager, at having the principal rogue so
much in his power, that he could hardly have patience
to let him come so near as to be sure of him; for
they only heard his tongue before: but when they
came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on
their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next
man was shot in the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after; and
the third run for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men;
viz., myself generalissimo; Friday my lieutenant-
general; the captain and his two men, and the three
prisoners of war, whom he had trusted with arms.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the
man they had left in the boat, who was now one of
us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them
to terms; which fell out just as we desired; for in-
deed it was easy to think, as their condition then
was, they would be very willing to capitulate; so he
calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them, "Tom
Smith, Tom Smith." Tom Smith answered immedi-
ately, "Who's that? Robinson?" For it seems
he knew his voice. The other answered, "Ay, ay;
for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms,
and yield, or you are all dead men this moment."
"Who must we yield to? where are they?" says
343
Smith again. "Here they are," says he; "here is
our captain and fifty men with him, have been hunt-
ing you this two hours; the boatswain is killed,
Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if
you do not yield, you are all lost."
"Will they give us quarter, then," says Tom
Smith, "and we will yield?" "I'll go and ask, if
you promise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked
the captain, and the captain himself then calls out,
"You, Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down
your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have
your lives, all but Will Atkins."
Upon this Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake,
captain, give me quarter: what have I done? they
have all been as bad as I" (which by the way was
not true, either; for it seems this Will Atkins was the
first man that laid hold of the captain when they
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying
his hands, and giving him injurious language); how-
ever, the captain told him he must lay down his
arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's mercy,
by which he meant me; for they all called me
governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had
parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them
all; and then my great army of fifty men, which
particularly with those three, were in all but eight came up and seized upon them all, and upon their
boat, only that I kept myself and one more out of
sight, for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he
had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with
them upon the villany of their practices with him,
and at length, upon the further wickedness of their
design; and how certainly it must bring them to
misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives: as for that, he told them they were
none of his prisoners, but the commander's of the island; that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren uninhabited island; but it had pleased
God so to direct them, that the island was inhabited,
and that the governor was an Englishman; that he
might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he
had given them all quarter, he supposed he would send
them to England, to be dealt with there as justice
required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded
by the governor to advise to prepare for death; for
that he would be hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had
its desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees to beg
the captain to intercede with the governor for his
life; and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake,
that they might not be sent to England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver-
ance was come, and that it would be a most easy
thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting
possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from
them, that they might not see what kind of a governor
they had, and called the captain to me: when I
called, as at a good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, "Cap-
tain, the commander calls for you," and presently the
captain replied, "Tell his excellency I am just a-
coming." This more perfectly amused them; and
345
they all believed that the commander was just by
with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonder-
fully well, and resolved to put it in execution the
next morning.
But in order to execute it with more art, and to
be secure of success, I told him we must divide the
prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins, and
two more of the worst of them, and send them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay: this was
committed to Friday, and the two men who came on
shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison;
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition.
The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it,
of which I have given a full description; and as it
was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was
secure enough, considering they were upon their
behaviour.
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to
try them, and tell me, whether he thought they might
be trusted or no to go on board, and surprise the
ship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of
the condition they were brought to; and that though
the governor had given them quarter for their lives,
as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to
England, they would all be hanged in chains, to be
sure; but that if they would join in such an attempt
as to recover the ship, he would have the governor's
engagement for their pardon. Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell _down on their knees to the captain, and pro-
mised, with the deepest imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that
they should owe their lives to him and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own
him for a father to them as long as they lived.
"Well," says the captain, " I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to consent to it." So he brought me an
account of the temper he found them in; and that
he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told
him he should go back again, and choose out five of
them, and tell them that they should see that they
did not want men; but he would take out those five
to be his assistants, and that the governor would
keep the other two, and the three that were sent
prisoners to the castle (my cave), as hostages for
the fidelity of those five; and that, if they proved
unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should
be hanged in chains alive upon the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest; however, they had no way
left them but to accept it; and it was now the busi-
ness of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to
persuade the other five to do their duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the ex-
pedition: 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger.
2. Then the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom,
having their characters from the captain, I had given
their liberty, and trusted them with arms. 3. The
other two whom I kept till now in my bower pinioned,
but, upon the captain's motion, had now released.
347
4. These five released at last; so that they were
twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the
cave for hostages.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture
with these hands on board the ship: for, as for me,
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper
for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it
was employment enough for us to keep them asunder,
and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep
them fast; but Friday went twice a day to them,
to supply them with necessaries; and I made the
other two carry provisions to a certain distance
where Friday was to take it.
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was
with the captain, who told them, I was the person
the governor had ordered to look after them, and
that it was the governor's pleasure that they should
not stir anywhere but by my direction; that if they
did, they should be fetched into the castle, and be
laid in irons; so that as we never suffered them to
see me as governor, so I now appeared as another
person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the
castle, and the like upon all occasions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him, but
to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and
man them: he made his passenger captain of one,
with four other men; and himself, and his mate, and
five more, went in the other: and they contrived
their business very well; for they came up to the
ship about midnight. As soon as they came within
call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and
tell them he had brought off the men and the boat,
but that it was a long time before they had found
them, and the like; holding them in a chat, till they
came to the ship's side; when the captain and the
mate, entering first with their arms, immediately
knocked down the second mate and carpenter with
the butt end of their muskets; being very faithfully
seconded by their men, they secured all the rest that
were upon the main and quarter decks, and began
to fasten the hatches to keep them down who were
below: when the other boat, and their men, entering
at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of the ship,
and the scuttle which went down into the cook-room,
making three men they found there prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break
into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay,
and having taken the alarm, was gotten up, and with
two men and a boy had gotten fire-arms in their
hands; and when the mate with a crow split open
the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket-
ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of
the men, but killed nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and with his
pistol shot the new captain through the head, the
bullets entering at his mouth, and came out again
behind one of his ears; so that he never spoke a
word; upon which the rest yielded, and the ship
was taken effectually without any more lives being
lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal
agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his success;
which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, hav-
349
ing sat watching upon the shore for it till near two of
the clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to
me, I slept very sound, till I was something surprised
with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I
heard a man call me by the name of Governor, Gover-
nor! and presently I knew the captain's voice; when
climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and
pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms:
"My dear friend and deliverer," says he, "there's
your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all
that belong to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and
there she rode within a little more than half a mile of
the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon
as they were masters of her; and the weather being
fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a little creek; and the tide being up, the
captain had brought the pinnace in near the place
where I first landed my rafts, and so landed just at
my door.
I was, at first, ready to sink down with the sur-
prise: for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At
first, for some time, I was not able to answer one
word; but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast
by him, or I should have fallen to the ground.
He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled
a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of
cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me:
after I drank it I sat down upon the ground, and
though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a word to him.
All this while the poor man was in as great an
ecstacy as I, only not under any surprise, as I was;
and he said a thousand kind tender things to me, to
compose and bring me to myself: but such was the
flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into
confusion; at last it broke into tears, and in a little
while after I recovered my speech.
Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my
deliverer; and we rejoiced together: I told him, I
looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed
to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these
were the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Pro-
vidence governing the world, and an evidence, that
the eyes of an infinite Power could search into the
remotest corner of the world, and send help to the
miserable whenever He pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to
Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless Him,
who had not only in a miraculous manner provided
for one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate
condition, but from whom every deliverance must
always be acknowledged to proceed?
When we had talked awhile, the captain told me
he had brought me some little refreshments, such as
the ship afforded, and such as the wretches who had
been so long his masters had not plundered him of.
Upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bids his
men bring the things ashore that were for the gover-
nor; and indeed it was a present, as if I had been
one, not that I was to be carried along with them,
but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still,
and they were to go without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of
excellent cordial waters; six large bottles of Madeira
wine, the bottles held two quarts apiece; two pounds
of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the
ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of
pease, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit.
He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour,
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and
abundance of other things: but besides these, and
what was a thousand times more useful to me, he
brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neck-
clothes, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat,
and one pair of stockings, and a very good suit of
clothes of his own, which had been worn but very
little. In a word, he clothed me from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any
one may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but
never was anything in the world of that kind so
unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me
to wear such clothes at their first putting on.
After these ceremonies passed, and after all his
good things were brought into my little apartment,
we began to consult what was to be done with the
prisoners we had; for it was worth considering
whether we might venture to take them away with
us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to
be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and
the captain said, he knew they were such rogues, that
there was no obliging them; and if he did carry them
away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be
delivered over to justice at the first English colony
he could come at; and I found that the captain him-
self was very anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that, if he desired it, I durst
undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES
it their own request that he should leave them upon
the island: "I should be very glad of that," says the
captain, "with all my heart."
"Well," said I, " I will send for them, and talk with
them for you :" so I caused Friday and the two host-
ages, for they were now discharged, their comrades
having performed their promise; I say, I caused
them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men,
pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them
there till I came.
After some time, I came thither dressed in my
new habit, and now I was called governor again.
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused
the men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full account of their villainous behaviour
to the captain, and how they had run away with the
ship, and were preparing to commit further robberies;
but that Providence had ensnared them in their own
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which
they had digged for others.
I let them know, that by my direction the ship
had been seized, that she lay now in the road, and
they might see, by and by, that their new captain
had received the reward of his villany; for that they
might see him hanging at the yard-arm: that as to
them, I wanted to know what they had to say, why
I should not execute them as pirates taken in the
fact, as by my commission they could not doubt I
had authority to do.
One of them answered in the name of the rest,
that they had nothing to say but this, that when they
were taken, the captain promised them their lives,
and they humbly implored my mercy: but I told
them I knew not what mercy to show them; for, as
353
for myself, I had resolved to quit the island with all
my men, and had taken passage with the captain to
go for England: and as for the captain, he could
not carry them to England, other than as prisoners
in irons to be tried for mutiny and running away
with the ship; the consequence of which, they must
needs know, would be the gallows; so that I could
not tell which was best for them, unless they had a
mind to take their fate in the island; if they desired
that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it: I
had some inclination to give them their lives, if they
thought they could shift on shore. They seemed
very thankful for it; said they would much rather
venture to stay there, than to be carried to England
to be hanged; so I left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some diffi-
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there; upon
this I seemed to be a little angry with the captain,
and told him, that they were my prisoners, not his;
and that seeing I had offered them so much favour,
I would be as good as my word; and that if he did
not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at
liberty as I found them; and if he did not like that,
he might take them again if he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire
into the woods, to the place whence they came, and
I would leave them some firearms, some ammuni-
tion, and some directions how they should live very
well, if they thought fit.
Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship,
but told the captain, that I would stay that night to
prepare my things; and desired him to go on board
in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and
VOL. I. Z
send the boat on shore the next day for me: ordering
him in the meantime to cause the new captain who
was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these
men might see him.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up
to me to my apartment, and entered seriously into
discourse with them of their circumstances: I told
them I thought they had made a right choice; that
if the captain carried them away, they would certainly
be hanged: I showed them their captain hanging at
the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had
nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to
stay, I then told them I would let them into the
story of my living there, and put them into the way
of making it easy to them: accordingly I gave them
the whole history of the place, and of my coming to
it; showed them my fortifications, the way I made
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and,
in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy.
I told them the story of the sixteen Spaniards that
were to be expected; for whom I left a letter, and
made them promise to treat them in common with
themselves.
I left them my firearms; viz., five muskets, three
fowling-pieces, and three swords: I had about a
barrel of powder left; for after the first year or two
I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a
description of the way I managed the goats, and
directions to milk and fatten them, to make both
butter and cheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own
story; and I told them I would prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder
355
more, and some garden-seed, which I told them I
would have been very glad of; also I gave them
the bag of peas which the captain had brought me
to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase
them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day
and went on board the ship; we prepared imme-
diately to sail, but did not weigh that night: the
next morning early two of the five men came
swimming to the ship's side, and, making a most
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to
be taken into the ship for God's sake, for they
should be murdered: and begged the captain to
take them on board though he hanged them imme-
diately.
Upon this the captain pretended to have no power
without me; but after some difficulty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on
board, and were some time after soundly whipped
and pickled; after which they proved very honest
and quiet fellows.
Some time after this I went with the boat on
shore, the tide being up, with the things promised
to the men, to which the captain, at my intercession,
caused their chests and clothes to be added, which
they took, and were very thankful for: I also en-
couraged them, by telling them, that if it lay in my
way to send a vessel to take them in, I would not
forget them.
CHAPTER XIX.
/ TAKE LEAVE OF THE ISLAND, AND, AFTER A LONG
VOYAGE ARRIVE IN ENGLAND—GO DOWN INTO YORK-
SHIRE, AND FIND THE GREATER PART OF MY FAMILY
DEADRESOLVE TO GO TO LISBON FOR INFORMATION RESPECTING MY PLANTA TION AT THE BRAZILS—MEET
AN OLD FRIEND THERE, BY WHOSE MEANS I BECOME
RICHSET OUT FOR ENGLAND OVER LAND MUCH ANNOYED BY WOLVES ON THE ROAD.
WHEN I took leave of this island I carried on board
for relics the great goat-skin cap I had made, my
umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I forgot not
to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had
lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty,
or tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver till it
had been a little rubbed and handled; and also the
money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.
And thus I left the island the nineteenth of De-
cember, as I found by the ship's account, in the year
1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years,
two months and nineteen days: being delivered from
the second captivity the same day of the month that
I first made my escape in the barcolongo from
among the Moors of Salee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687,
having been thirty and five years absent.
When I came to England, I was a perfect stranger
to all the world, as if I had never been known there:
my benefactor and faithful steward, whom I had left in
trust with my money, was alive, but had had great
misfortunes in the world, was become a widow the
357
second time, and very low in the world: I made her
easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in grati-
tude to her former care and faithfulness to me, I
relieved her as my little stock would afford, which
at that time would indeed allow me to do but little
for her; but I assured her I would never forget her
former kindness to me; nor did I forget her when I
had sufficient to help her; as shall be observed in its
place.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother, and all the family
extinct; except that I found two sisters, and two of
the children of one of my brothers: and as I had
been long ago given over for dead, there had been
no provision made for me; so that, in a word, I
found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that little
money I had would not do much for me as to set-
tling in the world.
I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I
did not expect; and this was, that the master of the
ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by the
same means saved the ship and cargo, having given
a very handsome account to the owners of the man-
ner how I had saved the lives of the men and the
ship, they invited me to meet them and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a
very handsome compliment upon that subject, and
a present of almost two hundred pounds sterling.
But after making several reflections upon the cir-
cumstances of my life, and how little way this would
go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to go
to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some
information of the state of my plantation in the
Brazils, and what was become of my partner, who, I
had reason to suppose, had some years now given
me over for dead.
With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where
I arrived in April following; my man Friday ac-
companying me very honestly in all these ram-
blings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all
occasions.
When I came to Lisbon I found out by inquiry,
and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the
captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea, off
the shore of Africa: he was now grown old, and
had left off the sea, having put his son, who was far
from a young man, into his ship: and who still used
the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me,
and, indeed, I hardly knew him; but I soon brought
myself to his remembrance when I told him who I
was.
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
plantation and my partner: the old man told me
he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years;
but that he could assure me, that when he came
away my partner was living; but the trustees,
whom I had joined with him to take cognisance
of my part, were both dead; that, however, he be-
lieved that I would have a very good account of
the improvement of the plantation; for, that upon
the general belief of my being cast away and
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of
the produce of my part of the plantation, to the
procurator fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case
I never came to claim it, one-third to the king, and
two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be
359
expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the
conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but
that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the
inheritance, it would be restored; only that the im-
provement, or annual production, being distributed
to charitable uses, could not be restored; but he as-
sured me that the steward of the king's revenue
(from lands), and the provedore, or steward of the
monastery, had taken great care all along, that the
incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every
year a faithful account of the produce, of which they
received duly my moiety.
I asked him if he knew to what height of im-
provement he had brought the plantation; and
whether he thought it might be worth looking
after; or whether, on my going thither, I should
meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just
right in the moiety.
He told me he could not tell exactly to what de-
gree the plantation was improved; but this he knew,
that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon
the enjoying but one-half of it; and that, to the
best of his remembrance, he had heard, that the
king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted
away to some other monastery, or religious house,
amounted to above two hundred moidores a year;
that, as to my being restored to a quiet possession
of it, there was no question to be made of that, my
partner being alive to witness my title, and my name
being also enrolled in the register of the country.
Also, he told me, that the survivors of my two trus-
tees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy,
and he believed I would not only have their assistance
for putting me in possession, but would find a very
considerable sum of money in their hands for my ac-
count, being the produce of the farm, while their fathers
held the trust, and before it was given up, as above,
which, as he remembered, was about twelve years.
I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at
this account, and inquired of the old captain, how
it came to pass, that the trustees should thus dis-
pose of my effects, when he knew that I had made
my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain,
my universal heir, &c.
He told me that was true; but that, as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as exe-
cutor until some certain account should come of my
death; and that, besides, he was not willing to inter-
meddle with a thing so remote; that it was true he
had registered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead
or alive, he would have acted by procuration, and
taken possession of the ingenio (so they called the
sugar-house), and had given his son, who was now at
the Brazils, order to do it.
"But," says the old man, "I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so ac-
ceptable to you as the rest; and that is, that believ-
ing you were lost, and all the world believing so also,
your partner and trustees did offer to account to
me, in your name, for six or eight of the first years
of profit, which I received; but there being at that
time," says he, "great disbursements for increasing
the works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it
did not amount to near so much as afterwards it pro-
duced; however," says the old man, "I shall give
you a true account of what I have received in all,
and how I have disposed of it."
After a few days further conference with this an-
cient friend, he brought me an account of the six
first years' income of my plantation, signed by my
partner and the merchants' trustees, being always
delivered in goods; viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the
consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by this
account that every year the income considerably in-
creased: but, as above, the disbursement being large,
the sum at first was small: however, the old man let
me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and
seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of
sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were
lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked coming
home to Lisbon about eleven years after my leaving
the place.
The good man then began to complain of his mis-
fortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use
of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a
share in a new ship; "However, my old friend," says
he, "you shall not want a supply in your necessity;
and as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully
satisfied."
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me
two hundred Portugal moidores in gold; and giving
me the writings of his title to the ship which his son
was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was a quarter
part owner, and his son another, he puts them both
in my hands for security of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kind-
ness of the poor man to be able to bear this; and
remembering what he had done for me, how he had
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used
me on all occasions, and particularly how sincere a
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weep-
ing at what he said to me; therefore first I asked him
if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much
money at that time, and if it would not straiten him?
He told me he could not say but it might straiten him
a little; but, however, it was my money, and I might
want it more than he.
Everything the good man said was full of affection,
and I could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke.
In short, I took one hundred of the moidores, and
called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for
them; then I returned him the rest, and told him,
if ever I had possession of the plantation, I would
return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards
did; and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his
son's ship, I would not take it by any means; but
that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest
enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to re-
ceive what he gave me reason to expect, I would
never have a penny more from him.
When this was past, the old man began to ask
me if he should put me in a method to make my
claim to my plantation. I told him, I thought to
go over to it myself. He said, I might do so if I
pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways
enough to secure my right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the profits to my use; and as there were
ships in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go away
to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public
register, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that
I was alive, and that I was the same person who
took up the land for the planting the said plantation
at first.
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a
363
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with a
letter of his writing to a merchant of his acquaint-
ance at the place; and then proposed my staying
with him till an account came of the return.
Never anything was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants, on whose
account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed.
First, there was the account current of the pro-
duce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal
captain, being for six years; the balance appeared
to be 1174 moidores in my favour.
Secondly, there was the account of four years
more while they kept the effects in their hands,
before the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found,
which they call civil death; and the balance of this,
the value of the plantation increasing, amounted to
29,169 crusadoes, which made 3241 moidores.
Thirdly, there was the prior of the Augustines'
account who had received the profits for above four-
teen years; but not being able to account for what
was disposed to the hospital, very honestly declared
he had 872 moidores not distributed, which he ac-
knowledged to my account. As to the king's part,
that refunded nothing.
There was also a letter of my partner's congratu-
lating me very affectionately upon my being alive;
giving me an account how the estate was improved,
and what it produced a year, with a particular of the
number of squares or acres that it contained; how
planted, how many slaves there were upon it; and,
making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told
me he had said so many Ave Marias to thank the
Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very
passionately to come over and take possession of my
own, and in the meantime to give him orders to
whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not come
myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his
friendship and that of his family; and sent me as
a present seven fine leopard skins, which he had, it
seems, received from Africa by some other ship
which he had sent thither; and who, it seems, had
made a better voyage than I. He sent me also five
chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces
of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores.
By the same fleet my merchant-trustees shipped
me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and
the rest of the whole account in gold.
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end
of Job was better than the beginning. It is impos-
sible to express the flutterings of my very heart,
when I looked over these letters, and especially
when I found all my wealth about me; for as the
Brazil ships came all in fleets, the same ships which
brought my letters brought my goods; and the
effects were safe in the Tagus before the letter
came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale and
grew sick; and had not the old man run and
fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise
of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the
spot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so
some hours, till a physician being sent for, and
something of the real cause of my illness being
365
known, he ordered me to be let blood, after which
I had relief and grew well; but I verily believe, if
it had not been eased by the vent given in that
manner to the spirits, I should have died.
I was now master, all on a sudden, of about fifty
thousand pounds sterling in money, and had an
estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of
above a thousand pounds a-year, as sure as an estate
of lands in England; and, in a word, I was in a con-
dition which I scarce knew how to understand, or
how to compose myself for the enjoyment of.
The first thing I did was to recompense my ori-
ginal benefactor, my good old captain, who had been
first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in
the beginning, and honest to me at the end. I
showed him all that was sent me; I told him, that,
next to the providence of Heaven, which disposes
all things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay
on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred-
fold. So I first returned to him the hundred moi-
dores I had received of him; then I sent for a notary,
and caused him to draw up a general release or dis-
charge for the four hundred and seventy moidores,
which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the
fullest and firmest manner possible; after which I
caused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him
to be my receiver of the annual profits of my plan-
tation, and appointing my partner to account to him,
and make the returns by the usual fleets to him in
my name; and a clause in the end, being a grant of
one hundred moidores a-year to him during his life,
out of the effects; and fifty moidores a-year to his
son after him, for his life. And thus I requited my
old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my
course next, and what to do with the estate that
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, indeed,
I had more care upon my head now than I had in my
silent state of life in the island, where I wanted
nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what
I wanted: whereas I had now a great charge upon
me, and my business was how to secure it: I had
never a cave to hide my money in, or a place where
it might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy
and tarnished before anybody would meddle with it.
On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom
to trust with it; my old patron, the captain, indeed,
was honest, and that was the only refuge I had.
In the next place, my interest in the Brazils
seemed to summon me thither; but now I could
not tell how to think of going thither till I had set-
tled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands
behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the
widow, who, I knew, was honest, and would be just
to me; but then she was in years, and but poor, and,
for aught I knew, might be in debt; so that, in a
word, I had no way but to go back to England
myself, and take my effects with me.
It was some months, however, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to satisfaction, who had been my
former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor
widow, whose husband had been my first benefac-
tor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful
steward and instructor; so the first thing I did, I got
a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent
in London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find
her out, and carry her in money a hundred pounds
367
from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in
her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have
a further supply. At the same time I sent my two
sisters in the country, each of them a hundred
pounds, they being, though not in want, yet not in
very good circumstances; one having been married,
and left a widow; and the other having a husband
not so kind to her as he should be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances, I
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst com-
mit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to
the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils,
and have settled myself there, for I was, as it were,
naturalised to the place; but I had some little
scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly
drew me back, of which I shall say more presently.
However, it was not religion that kept me from
going thither for the present; and as I had made
no scruple of being openly of the religion of the
country all the while I was among them, so neither
did I yet; only that now and then having of late
thought more of it than formerly, when I began to
think of living and dying among them, I began
to regret my having professed myself a papist,
and thought it might not be the best religion to
die in.
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to the Brazils, but that
really I did not know with whom to leave my effects
behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England
with them, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should
make some acquaintance, or find some relations
that would be faithful to me; and accordingly I
prepared to go for England with all my wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going home, I
first (the Brazil fleet being just going away) resolved
to give answers suitable to the just and faithful ac-
count of things I had from thence; and first to the
prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks
for his just dealings, and the offer of the eight hun-
dred and seventy-two moidores, which was undis-
posed of, which I desired might be given, five
hundred to the monastery, and three hundred and
seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct,
desiring the good Padre's prayers for me, and the
like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees,
with all the acknowledgment that so much justice
and honesty called for; as for sending them any pre-
sent, they were far above having any occasion of it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his
industry in the improving the plantation, and his
integrity in increasing the stock of the works; giving
him instructions for his future government of my
part according to the powers I had left with my old
patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever
became due to me, till he should hear from me more
particularly: assuring him that it was my intention
not only to come to him, but to settle myself there
for the remainder of my life. To this I added a very
handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife
and two daughters, for such the captain's son in-
formed me he had; with two pieces of fine English
broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five
pieces of black bays, and some Flanders lace of a
good value.
369
Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my
next difficulty was, which way to go to England.
I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet
I had a strange aversion to go to England by sea
at that time; and though I could give no reason for
it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that
though I had once shipped my baggage in order to
go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but two
or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons. But let no man
slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in
cases of such moment. Two of the ships which I
had singled out to go in, I mean more particularly
singled out than any other, that is to say, so as in
one of them to put my things on board, and in the
other to have agreed with the captain; I say, two
of these ships miscarried, viz., one was taken by the
Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start,
near Torbay, and all the people drowned except
three; so that, in either of those vessels, I had been
made miserable, and in which most, it was hard to
say.
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my
old pilot, to whom I communicated everything,
pressed me earnestly not to go to sea; but either
to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay
of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an
easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to
Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all
the way by land through France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going
by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I
VOL. L 2 A
resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as I
was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was
by much the pleasanter way; and to make it more
so, my old captain brought an English gentleman,
the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to
travel with me; after which we picked up two who
were English, and merchants also, and two young
Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only:
so that we were in all six of us, and five servants,
the two merchants and the two Portuguese content-
ing themselves with one servant between two, to save
the charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor
to travel with me as a servant, besides my man Fri-
day, who was too much a stranger to be capable of
supplying the place of a servant upon the road.
In this manner I set out from Lisbon: and our
company being all very well mounted and armed,
we made a little troop, whereof they did me the
honour to call me captain, as well because I was
the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and
indeed was the original of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my sea
journals, so shall I trouble you with none of my
land journals. But some adventures that happened
to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not
omit. When we came to Madrid, we being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time
to see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth
observing; but it being the latter part of the summer,
we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about
the middle of October. But when we came to the
edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns
on the way, with an account that so much snow was
fallen on the French side of the mountains, that
several travellers were obliged to come back to
Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an extreme
hazard, to pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it
so indeed; and to me, that had been always used
to a hot climate, and indeed to countries where we
could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insuf-
ferable; nor, indeed, was it more painful than it was
surprising: to come but ten days before out of Old
Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but
very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the
Pyrenean mountains, so very keen, so severely cold,
as to be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and
perishing of our fingers and toes, was very strange.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold
weather, which he had never seen or felt before in
his life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence, and so
long, that the people said, winter was come before its
time; and the roads, which were difficult before,
were now quite impassable: in a word, the snow lay
in some places too thick for us to travel; and being
not hard frozen, as is the case in northern coun-
tries, there was no going without being in danger of
being buried alive every step. We stayed no less
than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the
winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being
better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe
that had been known in many years) I proposed
that we should all go away to Fontarabia, and there
take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little
voyage.
But while we were considering this there came in
four French gentlemen, who having been stopped on
the French side of the passes, as we were on the
Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing the
country near the head of Languedoc, had brought
them over the mountains by such ways, that they
were not much incommoded with the snow; and
where they met with snow in any quantity, they
said it was frozen hard enough to bear them and
their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard
from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently
to protect us from wild beasts: for he said, upon
these great snows it was frequent for some wolves
to show themselves at the foot of the mountains,
being made ravenous for want of food, the ground
being covered with snow. We told him we were
well enough prepared for such creatures as they
were, if he would insure us from a kind of two-
legged wolves, which we were told we were in most
danger from, especially on the French side of the
mountains.
He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in
the way that we were to go: so we readily agreed to
follow him; as did also twelve other gentlemen, with
their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as
I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with
our guide, on the fifteenth of November; and indeed I
was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with us, on the same road that
we came from Madrid, above twenty miles; when
373
having passed two rivers, and come into the plain
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be
seen; but on a sudden, turning to the left, he ap-
proached the mountains another way; and though
it is true the hills and the precipices looked dread-
fully, yet he made so many tours, such meanders,
and led us by such winding ways, we insensibly
passed the height of the mountains, without being
much encumbered with the snow; and all on a sud-
den he showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of
Languedoc and Gascoigne, all green and flourishing;
though indeed they were at a great distance, and we
had some rough way to pass yet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
it snowed one whole day and a night, so fast, that
we could not travel; but he bid us be easy, we should
soon be past it all; we found, indeed, that we began
to descend every day, and to come more north than
before; and so, depending upon our guide, we went
on.
It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being something before us, and not just in
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after
them a bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to a
thick wood. Two of the wolves flew upon the guide,
and had he been half a mile before us, he had been
devoured indeed, before we could have helped him:
one of them fastened upon his horse, and the other
attacked the man with that violence, that he had not
time, or not presence of mind enough, to draw his
pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily.
My man Friday being next to me, I bid him ride up,
and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday
came in sight of the man, he hallooed as loud as the
other, "O master! 0 master!" But, like a bold
fellow, rode directly up to the man, and with his
pistol shot the wolf that attacked him, in the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my
man Friday; for he, having been used to that kind
of creature in his country, had no fear upon him, but
went close up to him, and shot him as above; where-
as any of us would have fired at a further distance,
and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endan-
gered shooting the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than I, and indeed it alarmed all our company, when,
with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on both
sides the dismallest howlings of wolves, and the noise
redoubled by the echo of the mountains, that it was
to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of
them; and perhaps indeed there was not such a few,
as that we had no cause of apprehensions.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other
that had fastened upon the horse left him imme-
diately, and fled, having happily fastened upon his
head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his
teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt: the
man, indeed, was most hurt; for the raging creature
had bit him twice, once on the arm, and the other
time a little above his knee; and he was just as it
were tumbling down by the disorder of the horse,
when Friday came up and shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as
the way (which was very difficult) would give us
leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we
375
saw plainly what had been the case, and how Friday
had disengaged the poor guide; though we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was he had
killed.
CHAPTER XX.
STRANGE BATTLE BETWIXT FRIDAY AND A BEAR—TERRIBLE ENGAGEMENT WITH A WHOLE ARMY OF
WOLVESARRIVE IN ENGLAND SAFELY, AND SETTLE MY AFFAIRS THERE—/ MARRY, AND HAVE A FAMILY.
BUT never was a fight managed so hardily, and in
such a surprising manner, as that which followed
between Friday and the bear, which gave us all
(though at first we were surprised and afraid for
him) the greatest diversion imaginable. As the
bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gal-
lop as the wolf does, which is swift and light; so he
has two particular qualities, which generally are the
rule of his actions: first, as to men, who are not his
proper prey; I say not his proper prey, because
though I can't say what excessive hunger might do,
which was now their case, the ground being all
covered with snow; yet as to men, he does not
usually attempt them, unless they first attack him;
on the contrary, if you meet him in the woods, if you
don't meddle with him, he won't meddle with you:
yet then you must take care to be very civil to him,
and give him the road; for he is a very nice gentle-
man, he won't go a step out of the way for a prince;
nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look
another way, and keep going on; for sometimes, if
you stop and stand still, and look steadfastly at him,
he takes it for an affront; and if you throw or toss
anything at him, and it hits him, though it were but
a bit of stick as big as your finger, he takes it for an
affront; and sets all other business aside to pursue
his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in point of
honour, and this is his first quality; the next is,
that if he be once affronted, he will never leave you,
night or day, till he has his revenge, but follow at a
good round rate till he overtakes you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his horse; for the man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the last more than the first;
when on a sudden we espied the bear come out of
the wood, and a very monstrous one it was, the
biggest by far that ever I saw: we were all a little
surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fel-
low's countenance. "O! O! O!" says Friday three
times, pointing to him, "O master! you give me te
leave, me shakee te hand with him, me makee you
good laugh."
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased: "You
fool you," said I, "he will eat you up."—" Eatee me
up! eatee me up!" says Friday twice over again;
"me eatee him up; me make you good laugh; you
all stay here, me show you good laugh." So down
he sits and gets his boots off in a moment, and put
on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they
wear), and which he had in his pocket, and gives my
other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to
377
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near,
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him:
"Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, "me speekee wit
you." We followed at a distance; for now being
come down to the Gascoigne side of the mountains,
we were entered a vast great forest, where the coun-
try was plain and pretty open, though many trees
in it scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear,
come up with him quickly, and takes up a great
stone and throws at him, and hit him just on the
head; but did him no more harm than if he had
thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday's
end; for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did
it purely to make the bear follow him, and show us
some laugh, as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the stone and saw him, he
turns about and comes after him, taking devilish long
strides, and shuffling along at a strange rate, so as he
would put a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs
Friday, and takes his course, as if he ran towards us
for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the
bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at
him heartily for bringing the bear back upon us,
when he was going about his own business another
way; and especially I was angry that he had turned
the bear upon us, and then run away; and I called
out, "You dog," said I, "is this your making us
laugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we
may shoot the creature." He hears me and cries out,
"No shoot, no shoot, stand still, you get much laugh;"
and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's
one, he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and
seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he beck-
oned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he gets
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground at about five or six yards from the bottom of
the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at
a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at the
gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles
into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous
heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of
my man, and could not for my life see anything to
laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we
all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small of a large limb of the tree, and the
bear got about half-way to him. As soon as the bear
got out to that part where the limb of the tree was
weaker, "Ha," says he to us, "now you see me
teachee the bear dance;" so he falls a-jumping, and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter,
but stood still, and began to look behind him, to see
how he should get back; then indeed we did laugh
heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a
great deal: when he sees him stand still, he calls out
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could
speak English, "What, you come no further? Pray
you come further." So he left jumping and shaking
the bough: and the bear, just as if he understood
what he said, did come a little further; then he fell
a-jumping again, and the bear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him on
the head, and called to Friday to stand still, and we
would shoot the bear; but he cried out earnestly,
"O pray! O pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then;"
he would have said by and by. However to shorten
379
the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood
so ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but
still could not imagine what the fellow would do; for
first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear
off; and we found the bear was too cunning for
that too; for he would not get out far enough to be
thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad
claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what
would be the end of it, and where the jest would be
at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would
not be persuaded to come any further, "Well, well,"
said Friday, "you no come further, me go, me go;
you no come to me, me come to you ;" and upon this
he goes out to the smallest end of the bough, where
it would bend with his weight, and gently lets himself
down by it sliding down the bough, till he came near
enough to jump down on his feet; and away he ran
to his gun, takes it up, and stands still.
"Well," said I to him, "Friday, what will you do
now? Why don't you shoot him?"—"No shoot,"
says Friday, "no yet; me shoot now me no kill;
me stay, give you one more laugh;" and indeed so
he did, as you will see presently: for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough
where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every step, and coming backward till
he got into the body of the tree; then with the
same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree,
grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at
a time very leisurely. At this juncture, and just
before he could set his hind feet upon the ground,
Friday stepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece into his ear, and shot him as dead as a
stone.
Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our
looks, he falls a-laughing himself very loud. "So
we kill bear in my country," says Friday. "So you
kill them?" said I; "why, you have no guns."—
"No," says he, "no guns, but shoot great much
long arrow."
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us; but
we were still in a wild place and our guide very
much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the
howling of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed
except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa,
of which I have said something already, I never
heard anything that filled me with so much horror.
These things, and the approach of night, called
us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon-
strous creature off, which was worth saving; but we
had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us;
so we left him, and went forward on our journey.
The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains;
and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards,
were come down into the forest and plain country,
pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done
a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they
surprised the country-people, killed a great many of
their sheep and horses, and some people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which
our guide told us, if there were any more wolves in
the country, we should find them there; and this
was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every
38l
side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which we
were to pass to get through the wood, and then we
should come to the village where we were to lodge.
It was within half an hour of sunset when we en-
tered the first wood; and a little after sunset, when
we came into the plain. We met with nothing in
the first wood, except that in a little plain within
the wood, which was not above two furlongs over,
we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed
one after another, as if they had been in chase of
some prey, and had it in view: they took no notice
of us, and were gone and out of sight in a few
moments.
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a
ready posture, for he believed there were more
wolves a-coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and entered
the plain: as soon as we came into the plain, we
had occasion enough to look about us. The first
object we met with was a dead horse, that is to say,
a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and at
least a dozen of them at work; we could not say
eating of him, but picking of his bones rather; for
they had eaten up all the flesh before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast,
neither did they take much notice of us; Friday
would have let fly at them, but I would not suffer
him by any means; for I found we were like to have
more business upon our hands than we were aware of.
We were not half gone over the plain, but we began
to hear the wolves howl in the woods on our left in
a frightful manner; and presently after we saw about
a hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a
body, and most of them in a line, as regularly as an
army drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce
knew in what manner to receive them; but found to
draw ourselves in a close line was the only way; so
we formed in a moment; but, that we might not have
too much interval, I ordered that only every other
man should fire; and that the others, who had not
fired, should stand ready to give them a second vol-
ley immediately, if they continued to advance upon
us; and that then those who had fired at first, should
not pretend to load their fusils again, but stand
ready, with every one a pistol, for we were all armed
with a fusil and a pair of pistols each man; so we
were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half of
us at a time; however, at present we had no neces-
sity; for upon firing the first volley, the enemy made
a full stop, being terrified, as well with the noise as
with the fire; four of them being shot in the head,
dropped; several others were wounded, and went
bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I found
they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; where-
upon, remembering that I had been told, that the
fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man,
I caused all our company to halloo as loud as we
could, and I found the notion not altogether mis-
taken: for upon our shout, they began to retire, and
turn about; then I ordered a second volley to be
fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop, and
away they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again,
and that we might lose no time, we kept going; but
we had but little more than loaded our fusils, and
383
put ourselves into a readiness, when we heard a ter-
rible noise in the same wood on our left; only that
it was further onward the same way we were to go.
The night was coming on, and the night began to
be dusky, which made it the worse on our side; but,
the noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it
was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures;
and on a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of
wolves on our left, one behind us, and one on our
front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them;
however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our
way forward as fast as we could make our horses go,
which, the way being very rough, was only a good
large trot; and in this manner we only came in view
of the entrance of the wood through which we were
to pass, at the further side of the plain; but we were
greatly surprised when, coming near the lane, or
pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing
just at the entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we
heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that way, out
rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him,
flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves
after him full speed: indeed the horse had the heels
of them; but as we supposed that he could not
hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would
get up with him at last; and no question but they
did.
Here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up
to the entrance where the horse came out, we found
the carcass of another horse, and of two men de-
voured by these ravenous creatures, and of one the
man was no doubt the same whom we heard fire a
gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as
to the man, his head and the upper part of his body
were eaten up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew not what
course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon,
for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of
prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred
of them. It happened very much to our advantage,
that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way
from it, there lay some large timber trees, which had
been cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay
there for carriage; I drew my little troop in among
these trees, and placing ourselves in a line behind
one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and,
keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to
stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing our
horses in the centre.
We did so, and it was well we did; for never was
a more furious charge than the creatures made upon
us in this place; they came on us with a growling
kind of a noise, and mounted the piece of timber
(which, as I said, was our breastwork), as if they
were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of
theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their
seeing our horses behind us, which was the prey
they aimed at. I ordered our men to fire as before,
every man; and they took their aim so sure, that
indeed they killed several of the wolves at the first
volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual
firing, for they came on like devils, those behind
pushing on those before.
When we had fired our second volley of fusils, we
thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would
have gone off; but it was but a moment, for others
came forward again; so we fired our volleys of
pistols; and I believe in these four firings we killed
seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as
many; yet they came on again.
I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily; so
I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was
better employed; for, with the greatest dexterity
imaginable, he charged my fusil and his own while
we were engaged; but, as I said, I called my other
man; and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him
lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it
be a large train; he did so, and had but time to get
away when the wolves came up to it, and some were
got up upon it; when I, snapping an uncharged
pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; and those
that were upon the timber were scorched with it, and
six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped in among
us, with the force and fright of the fire: we despatched
these in an instant, and the rest were so frighted
with the light, which the night, for now it was very
near dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a
little.
Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired
off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout:
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied im-
mediately upon near twenty lame ones, which'we
found struggling on the ground, and fell a-cutting
them with our swords, which answered our expecta-
tion; for the crying and howling they made were
better understood by their fellows; so that they fled
and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore of
them; and had it been daylight we had killed
many more. The field of battle being thus cleared,
we made forward again; for we had still near a
VOL. I. 2 B
league to go. We heard the ravenous creatures
howl and yell in the woods, as we went, several
times; and sometimes we fancied we saw some of
them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were not
certain; so in about an hour more we came to the
town, where we were to lodge, which we found in a
terrible fright, and all in arms; for it seems that,
the night before, the wolves and some bears had
broken into that village and put them in a terrible
fright; and they were obliged to keep guard night
and day, but especially in the night, to preserve
their cattle, and indeed their people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two wounds,
that he could go no farther; so we were obliged to
take a new guide there, and go to Toulouse, where
we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country,
and no snow, no wolves, or anything like them; but
when we told our story at Toulouse, they told us it
was nothing but what was ordinary in the great
forest at the foot of the mountains, especially when
the snow lay on the ground; but they inquired
much what kind of a guide we had gotten, that would
venture to bring us that way in such a severe season;
and told us, it was much to be wondered we were not
all devoured. When we told them how we placed
ourselves, and the horses in the middle, they blamed
us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we
had been all destroyed ; for it was the sight of the horses
that made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey;
and that at other times they are really afraid of a
gun; but they being excessive hungry, and raging
on that account, the eagerness to come at the horses
had made them senseless of danger; and that if we
387
had not by the continued fire, and at last by the
stratagem of the train of powder, mastered them, it
had been great odds but that we had been torn to
pieces; whereas, had we been content to have sat
still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would
not have taken the horses so much for their own,
when men were on their backs, as otherwise; and
withal they told us, that at last, if we had stood all
together, and left our horses, they would have been
so eager to have devoured them, that we might have
come off safe, especially having our firearms in our
hands, and being so many in number.
For my part I was never so sensible of danger in
my life; for seeing above three hundred devils come
roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having
nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself
over for lost; and as it was, I believe I shall never
care to cross those mountains again; I think I would
much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I
were sure to meet with a storm once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in
my passage through France; nothing but what other
travellers have given an account of with much more
advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse to
Paris, and without any considerable stay came to
Calais, and landed safe at Dover the fourteenth of
January, after having had a severe cold season to
travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and
had in a little time all my new-discovered estate safe
about me; the bills of exchange, which I brought
with me, having been very currently paid.
My principal guide and privy counsellor was my
good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money
I had sent her, thought no pains too much or care
too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so
entirely with everything, that I was perfectly easy as
to the security of my effects; and indeed I was very
happy from my beginning, and now to the end, in
the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my effects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so
to the Brazils. But now another scruple came in
the way, and that was religion; for as I had enter-
tained some doubts about the Roman religion, even
while I was abroad, especially in my state of solitude,
so I knew there was no going to the Brazils for me,
much less going to settle there, unless I resolved to
embrace the Roman Catholic religion, without any
reserve; except, on the other hand, I resolved to be
a sacrifice to my principles, be a martyr for religion,
and die in the Inquisition: so I resolved to stay at
home, and, if I could find means for it, to dispose of
my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,
who in return gave me notice, that he could easily
dispose of it there; but that if I thought fit to give
him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants,
the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils,
who must fully understand the value of it, who lived
just upon the spot, and who I knew to be very rich,
so that he believed they would be fond of buying
it; he did not doubt, but I should make four or five
thousand pieces of eight the more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it
to them, and he did so; and in about eight months
more, the ship being then returned, he sent me an
account that they had accepted the offer, and had
389
remitted 33,000 pieces of eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to
my old man, who sent me the bills of exchange for
32,880 pieces of eight for the estate; reserving the
payment of a hundred moidores a-year to him (the
old man) during his life, and fifty moidores after-
wards to his son for his life, which I had promised
them; and which the plantation was to make good
as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first
part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of Provi-
dence's chequer-work, and of a variety which the world
will seldom be able to show the like of: beginning
foolishly, but closing much more happily than any
part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this state of com-
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards, and so indeed I had been, if other circum-
stances had concurred: but I was inured to a
wandering life, had no family, nor many relations;
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaint-
ance; and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils,
yet I could not keep that country out of my head,
and had a great mind to be upon the wing again;
especially I could not resist the strong inclination I
had to see my island, and to know if the poor
Spaniards were in being there; and how the rogues
I left there had used them.
My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded me
from it, and so far prevailed with me, that almost
for seven years she prevented my running abroad;
during which time I took my two nephews, the
children of one of my brothers, into my care: the
eldest having something of his own, I bred up as a
gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some ad-
dition to his estate, after my decease; the other I
put out to a captain of a ship: and after five years,
finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young
fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to
sea: and this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as
old as I was, to further adventures myself.
In the meantime I in part settled myself here:
for, first of all, I married, and that not either to my
disadvantage or dissatisfaction; and had three chil-
dren, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying,
and my nephew coming home with good success from
a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and
his importunity, prevailed and engaged me to go in
his ship as a private trader to the East-Indies: this
was in the year 1694.
In this voyage I visited my new colony in the
island, saw my successors the Spaniards, had the
whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left
there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards;
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, sepa-
rated; how at last the Spaniards were obliged to use
violence with them, how they were subjected to the
Spaniards, how honestly the Spaniards used them;—
a history, if it were entered into, as full of variety
and wonderful accidents, as my own part, particu-
larly also as to their battles with the Caribbeans,
who landed several times upon the island, and as to
the improvement they made upon the island itself,
and how five of them made an attempt upon the
mainland, and brought away eleven men and five
women prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found
about twenty young children on the island.
39'
Here I stayed about twenty days, left them supplies
of all necessary things, and particularly of arms,
powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which
I brought from England with me, viz., a carpenter
and a smith.
Besides this, I shared the island into parts with
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole,
but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed
on; and having settled all things with them, and
engaged them not to leave the place, I left them
there.
From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence
I sent a bark, which I bought there, with more people
to the island, and in it, beside other supplies, I sent
seven women, being such as I found proper for
service, or for wives to such as would take them; as
to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them
some women from England with a good cargo of
necessaries, if they would apply themselves to plant-
ing; which I afterwards performed. And the fellows
proved very honest and diligent after they were
mastered, and had their properties set apart for them.
I sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three of
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some
hogs, which, when I came again, were considerably
increased.
But all these things, with an account how three
hundred Caribbees came and invaded them, and
ruined their plantations, and how they fought with
that whole number twice, and were at first defeated,
and three of them killed; but at last a storm destroy-
ing their enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed
almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the
possession of their plantation, and still lived upon
the island.
All these things, with some very surprising in-
cidents in some new adventures of my own, for ten
years more, I may, perhaps, give a further account
of hereafter.
