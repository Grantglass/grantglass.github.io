INTRODUCTION 



IN this volume are found two, or possibly three, 
works by Daniel Defoe which have been con- 
nected with the name of a well-known char- 
acter of the early eighteenth century, Duncan 
Campbell. Two other works relating to the same 
man have been at times attributed to Defoe, but the 
best opinion is that they were not from his pen. 

So far as the facts in the life of Campbell can now 
be ascertained, they are substantially the same as 
those related by Defoe in his History of the Life and 
Adventures of Mr, Duncan Campbell. The subject 
of this History was the son of a Mr. Campbell of 
Argyllshire and a lady of Lapland. On the death 
of his wife, whom he married abroad, Mr. Campbell 
returned to Scotland, taking with him his only child, 
a son, who seems to have been born about 1680. 
This boy, Duncan, always passed for deaf and dumb, 
and there is no good reason to believe that he was 
not. Asserting that he had the gift of second 
sight, he became so famous in Scotland by his re- 
markable predictions that in 1694, desiring wider 
fame, he went up to London to become a pro- 
fessional seer. From then to the time of his death, 
his object was ever to keep himself in the notice of 
the English public.

INTRODUCTION 



In the earlier part of his career, when Campbell 
had just come of age, he seems to have been rather 
wild and extravagant. At one time he was so 
heavily in debt that he decided to sojourn in Hol- 
land for a while. Thence, after various adventures, 
he returned to London, where he married a young 
widow, lived in pretty fair style, and became more 
famous as a soothsayer than ever. 

References in the Tatler and the Spectator prove 
that for years Duncan Campbell had a consider- 
able vogue. In No. 14 of the former periodi- 
cal, May 12th, 1709, Steele wrote under date of 
" White's Chocolate-house, May 11 " : — " A gentle- 
man here this evening was giving me an account of 
a dumb Fortune-Teller, who outdoes Mi-. Partridge, 1 
mvself, or the Unborn Doctor, for predictions: all 
his visitants come to him full of expectations, and 
pay his own rate for the interpretations they put 
upon his shrugs and nods. There ifl a fine rich City- 
widow stole thither the other day," — and then the 
Tatler goes on to tell of her wish to know whether 
she should marry again, of the fortune-teller's inti- 
mation that she should marry not once but twice, and 
of her speculations as to which gentlemen, among 
those who frequented the soothsayer's apartment, 
were her husbands-to-be. 

Three years later Addison mentioned Campbell in 
No. 323 of the Spectator. 2 Part of a young lady's

journal has supposedly come to the Spectator's atten- 
tion, a week's journal of a life " filled with a fash- 
ionable kind of Gayety and Laziness ; " and in the 
last entry we read : — " Monday. Eight a Clock. 
Waked by Miss Kitty. . . . Went in our Mobbs to 
the dumb Man, according to Appointment. Told 
me that my Lover's Name began with a G. Mem. the 
Conjurer was within a Letter of Mr. Froth's Name, 
&c." 

In September of the same year, in No. 474, Steele 
made a certain " Dulcibella Thankley " write enthu- 
siastically of " Mr. Campbell, the dumb Man," to 
whom she wishes especially to render thanks, be- 
cause through his prophecies she is become " the 
happiest She in Kent." Inasmuch as no reference to 
Mr. Campbell in either the Tatler or the Spectator 
was more flattering than this, Defoe gave the letter 
in full in Chapter VIII. of the present volume. 

Later references of the Spectator to the dumb man 
are more satirical. In No. 505, 1 appeared a letter 
which was supposed to come from one recommend- 
ing himself as an interpreter of dreams. " I am 
pretty well qualified for this office, . . . r> Addison 
made the correspondent write. " My great Uncle 
by my Wife's Side was a Scotch Highlander, and 
second Sighted." And at the conclusion the corre- 
spondent wrote, " N. B. I am not dumb." 

Again Addison wrote in No. 560, 2 " Everyone has 
heard of the famous Conjurer, who, according to the 
Opinion of the Vulgar, has studied himself dumb; 
1 October 9th, 1712. 2 June 28th, 1714.

for which Reason, as it is believed, he delivers out 
all his Oracles in Writing. Be that as it will, the 
blind Teresias was not more famous in Greece, than 
this dumb Artist has been for some Years last past, 
in the Cities of London and Westminster." 

Finally, in his 619th paper, 1 the Spectator, in try- 
ing to give some idea of the variety of the letters 
which he receives, writes of one dated from Cornhill, 
from Charissa, who "desires to be eased in some 
Scruples relating to the Skill of Astrologers. Re- 
ferred to the Dumb Man for an Answer." 

Fads appear to have lasted longer at the begin- 
ning of the eighteenth century than at the end of 
the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth. 
Novell v did not succeed novelty then with the same 
rapidity as now. Still all things in time had their 
turn, and there is a sign that Mr. Campbell had had 
his in the advertising he resorted to towards the 
end of his life to keep his name before the public. 
Defoe's Life of Campbell, in a way, is part of this 
advertising. True, we cannot say that it was 
written at the suggestion of the fortune-teller. 
Defoe^ unceasing interest in vulgar wonders would 
naturally have led him to "write up" Campbell; 
moreover, the publisher, thinking the book a good 
commercial venture, may have offered Defoe a good 
price for it. Still, one cannot read the preface 
addressed " To the Ladies and Gentlemen of Great 
Britain," and signed by Campbell, without feeling 
that an important purpose of the book was to get

INTRODUCTION 



people into the habit of consulting the seer again. 
That they had got out of this habit is plain from 
Campbell's attacks on other fortune-tellers and all 
kinds of independent divination, and from his self- 
commendation. There can be little doubt that 
Defoe was helping to advertise a partially forgotten 
favourite, when he wrote The History of the Life 
and Adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell. A Gentle- 
man^ who though born Deaf and Dumb, writes down 
any Stranger's Name at First Sight ; and their 
Future Contingencies of Fortune. Now living in 
Exeter Court, over against the Savoy in the Strand. 

This work was published by Curll on the thirtieth 
of April, 1720. Two days later, by clever manage- 
ment on some one's part, " Mr. Campbell, the Deaf 
and Dumb Gentleman . . . Kiss'd the King's Hand, 
and presented to his Majesty The History of his Life 
and Adventures, which was by his Majesty most 
graciously received. v> 1 

Even this advertisement of Defoe's book seems 
not to have made it sell so well as had been hoped. 
The next month, accordingly, a pamphlet was is- 
sued — it is conjectured to improve the sale — en- 
titled, Mr. Campbell's Pacquet for the Entertainment 
of Gentlemen and Ladies, Containing, I, Verses to 
Mr. Campbell, Occasioned by the History of his Life 
and Adventures. By Mrs. Fowke, Mr. Philips, fyc.

dictions of Mr. Campbell. By Capt. Stanhope. Ill,

INTRODUCTION 



A n Account of a Most Surprising Apparition ; sent 
from Launceston in Cornwall. Attested by the Rev. 
Mr. Ruddle, Minister there. It is conjectured that 
Campbell's original plan was to publish only the 
first two sections of his Pacquet. As they proved, 
however, too short for a pamphlet, he probably asked 
Defoe to supply a third section. Whether or not 
the Pacquet improved the sale of Campbell's Life 
and Adventures, a second edition of the latter ap- 
peared in August, 1720, with the Pacquet included. 
It may be noted here that a third edition followed 
in 1728, with a titlepage which gave no clue to its 
being the Life and Adventures of Campbell already 
published. The Pacquet was included in this third 
edition, as it was in a fourth, published at the end of 
December of the same year. 

The part of the Pacquet which chiefly concerns 
us is the third, which, as I have said, was probably 
supplied by Defoe, and is therefore included in this 
volume. Having no direct connection with Camp- 
bell, it must have been inserted in his Pacquet on 
the supposition that any account of a remarkable 
vision would be of interest in a book referring to 
hi in. It purports to tell the story of A Remarkable 
Passage of an Apparition which was seen by the Rev. 
John Ruddle, a clergyman of Cornwall, in the year 
1665. This Apparition till very recently has been 
attributed to Defoe; and the story is so much the 
sort of thing that he would lia\e written, that one 
is naturally loath to deny his authorship. In the 
light of recent investigation, however, we must admit 

L *> i J

INTRODUCTION 



that the Most Surprising Apparition was probably 
not his. 

Defoe himself gave the credit of the story to 
Ruddle. In Campbell's Pacquet, at the head of 
the narrative are the words, " Related by the Rev. 
Dr. Ruddle, of Launceston in Cornwall, in the Year 
1665." This of itself without corroboration would 
mean nothing, for one may say of such statements 
of Defoe in general, that they are as likely to be 
false as true. But Mr. Alfred F. Robbins, in an 
article written in 1895 for Notes and Queries, 1 and 
in another for the Speaker, 2 has shown that in this 
case Defoe probably spoke the truth. 

Mr. Robbins calls attention to the fact that C. S. 
Gilbert's History of Cornwall, published in 1817, 
contained the story of Dorothy Dingley's ghost in 
almost the very words of the account in Campbell's 
Pacquet. Gilbert said that he had got the story 
from the Rev. Jago Arundell, a native of Launces- 
ton, who had found it in the course of antiquarian 
researches, and was convinced that " it was in 
Ruddle's handwriting." The question at once arises, 
did the Rev. Jago Arundell speak the truth ? There 
seems to be no reason to suppose that he did not. 
He was both a conscientious and experienced anti- 
quarian. The notice of his life in the Dictionary 
of National Biography shows that from his child- 
hood he was interested in Cornish history ; and 
Mr. Robbins shows that Arundell, in his antiquarian 
researches, had seen both papers in Ruddle's hand- 
i September 21st, 1895. 2 October 19th, 1895.

INTRODUCTION 



writing and entries of his in the Launceston Parish 
Register. As to the variations between the account 
which Defoe secured for Campbell's Pacquet and 
that which Gilbert published nearly a century later, 
they may be due, says Mr. Quiller-Couch, 1 writing 
on Mr. Robbings first article, " to slight alterations 
made by Defoe in putting the MS. through the 
press, or to his carelessness in correcting the proofs, 1 '' 
and to the possibility that the narrative found by 
Mr. Aruildel] was a M subsequent 4 fair copy, 1 in which 
Ruddle had made a few trifling alterations. 11 

None of the facts of Ruddle's life, so far as they 
are known, will prevent our accepting his author- 
ship of the strange narrative in question. What 
little we know of his literary ability would lead us 
to expect a narrative inferior to another on a similar 
subject, which is pretty certainly by Defoe, and 
which will be found in a later volume of this edi- 
tion, — The Apparition of Mm. Veal. But though 
the story of the Cornish apparition is inferior as 
narrative to that of The Apparition <rf Mrs. Im/, 
it is not without such touches ;ts to an amazing 
degree produce belief in Defoe's stories. It is 
good testimony, for instance, for the reality of the 
apparition, that on one occasion " a spaniel dog, 
who followed the company unregarded, did bark 
and run away, as the spectrum passed by ; whence 
it is easy to conclude that it was not our fear or 
fancy which made the apparition. 11 Such realistic 
touches, however, are by no means so common as

INTRODUCTION 



they would be in a story of Defoe's. On the whole, 
the tale of the Cornish apparition is not too skil- 
fully written to be the work of a clergyman of good 
education and some literary feeling, who had been 
profoundly impressed by a wonder which he believed 
he had seen. 

Nor do the dates of Ruddle's life forbid the as- 
sumption of his authorship. He began his ministry 
at Launceston in 1663, two years before he said 
that he saw Dorothy Dingley\s ghost. He died in 
1699, twenty-one years before Campbell's Pacquet 
appeared. An account of the Apparition in Ruddle's 
handwriting, therefore, could not have been copied 
from the account which Defoe added to his second 
edition of Campbell's Life. On the other hand, 
Defoe, with his half-credulous interest in marvels, 
would have been likely to get hold of Ruddle's 
story, if he had visited Launceston. That he did 
visit the place — probably on one of his secret politi- 
cal journeys — we know from his mention of it in 
his Tour thro'' the Whole Island of Great Britain} 

Defoe was not the only author to bestow attention 
on Duncan Campbell. In 1724 there came out A 
Spy upon the Conjuror^ a pamphlet whose manifest 

1 If the style of the Most Surprising Apparition were such 
as to make us of necessity believe that Defoe wrote it, we 
might assume that he made a visit to Launceston in the life- 
time of Ruddle (perhaps when in hiding after the failure of 
Monmouth's rebellion), got the story then by word of mouth, 
and put it into a written form which Ruddle subsequently 
copied with a few alterations. The style, however, does not 
force us into such an hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION 



object was to laud the "astonishing penetration and 
event " of his predictions. The author was Eliza 
Haywood. It probable that from her pen, too, 
came in 17~5 The Dumb Projector} being a surpris- 
ing account of a Trip to Holland made by Mr. 
CampbeB) with the manner qf his Reception and Be- 
haviour there. This has at times been attributed to 
Defoe, but Mr. Lee was satisfied that it was not his. 

There is no doubt, though, that Defoe wrote at 
least the larger part of The Friendly Demon, which 
concludes this volume. It appeared in 1726 in two 
parts. The first was a letter signed by Duncan 
Campbell and addressed to a certain friend, whose 
name was not mentioned, asking the friend's opinion 
on Campbell's recent miraculous cure after an illness 
which had lasted the Ix»tter part of eight years. In 
this letter Campbell stated that his guardian angel, 
or friendly demon, had prescribed the remedy which 
had wrought his cure, and he intimated that it might 
prove equally beneficial to others, presumably if they 
would pay him for it. The second part was a reply 
from the anonymous friend, who was no other than 
Defoe, to 44 my deaf and dumb Friend, Mr. Duncan 
Campbell." Mr. \jcq has written with some enthusi- 
asm of Defoe's conscientiousness in his reply to Camp- 
bell's alleged letter, of his unwillingness to commend 
a miraculous cure which he could hardly believe in, 
and of his desire to help his friend. Though there 
is no actual recommendation of the loadstone and 
powders which had effected Campbell's cure, the 
whole tone of the reply, with its discussion of familiar 

I *x J 



INTRODUCTION 

spirits and the like, seems to me designed to induce 
as many people as possible to try Campbell's remedy. 
In fine, it is not unlikely that Defoe composed Camp- 
bell's letter as well as the reply, and that both were 
written because Campbell, having failed as a fortune- 
teller through sickness and loss of vogue, wished to 
support himself as a quack doctor. 

The Friendly Demon seems to have been the last 
piece which Defoe wrote for Campbell. In 1730 the 
dumb man was attacked with a sickness which proved 
too much for his " demon." This time there was no 
miraculous restoration to health ; it was decreed that 
Campbell should die. 

Enough interest was still felt in the man to war- 
rant the publication in 1732 of Secret Memoirs of the 
Late Mr. Duncan Campbell, the famous Deaf and 
Dumb Gentleman, written by himself, who ordered 
that they should be published after his Decease. Mr. 
Lee declares that, in spite of this having been 
ascribed to Defoe, the only part of the work really 
his was the Friendly Demon . which was reprinted 
with it.

TO THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF 
GREAT BRITAIN 



I AM not unacquainted that, ever since this 
book was first promised by way of advertise- 
ment to the world, it was greedily coveted by 
a great many persons of airy tempers, for the 
same reason that it has been condemned by those of 
a more formal class, who thought it was calculated 
partly to introduce a great many new and diverting 
curiosities in the way of superstition, and partly to 
divulge the secret intrigues and amours of one part 
of the sex, to give the other part room to make 
favourite scandal the subject of their discourse, and 
so to make one-half of the fair species very merry 
over the blushes and the mortifications of the other 
half. But when they come to read the following 
sheets, they will find their expectations disappointed, 
but I hope I may say too, very agreeably disappointed. 
They will find a much more elegant entertainment 
than they expected. Instead of making them a bill 
of fare out of patchwork romances of polluting 
scandal, the good old gentleman who wrote the ad- 
ventures of my life has made it his business to treat 
them with a great variety of entertaining passages 
which always terminate in morals that tend to the 
edification of all readers, of whatsoever sex, age, or 

[ xxiii ] 



TO THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 



profession. Instead of seducing young, innocent, 
unwary minds, into the vicious delight which is too 
often taken in reading the gay and bewitching chi- 
meras of the cabalists, and in perusing the enticing 
fables of new-invented tricks of superstition, my 
ancient friend, the writer, strikes at the very root of 
these superstitions, and shows them how they may 
be satisfied in their several curiosities, by having 
recourse to time, who by the talent of the second- 
si^ht (which he so beautifully represents how nature 
is so kind frequently to implant in the minds of men 
born in the same climate with myself) can tell you 
those things naturally, which, when you try to learn 
yourselves, you either run the hazard of being im- 
posed upon in your pockets by cheats, gipsies, and 
common fortune-tellers, or else of being imposed 
upon in a still worse way, in your most lasting wel- 
fare, by having recourse to conjurors or enchanters 
that deal in black arts, and involve all their con- 
suiters in one general partnership of their execrable 
guilt ; or lastly, of imposing worst of all on your 
own selves, by getting into an itch of practising and 
trying the little tricks of female superstition, which 
are often more officiously handed down by the tradi- 
tion of credulous nurses and old women, from one 
generation to another, than the first principles of 
Christian doctrine, which it is their duty to instil 
early into little children. But I hope when this 
book comes to be pretty generally read among you 
ladies (as by your generous and numerous subscrip- 
tions I have good reason to expect), that it will afford 
a perfect remedy and a thorough cure to that dis- 

[ \xiv ] 



OF GREAT BRITAIN 



temper, which first took its rise from too great a 
growth of curiosity, and too large a stock of cre- 
dulity, nursed prejudicially up with you in your more 
tender and infant years. 

Whatever young maid hereafter has an innocent 
but longing desire to know who shall be her hus- 
band, and what time she shall be married, will, I 
hope, when she has read in the following sheets 
of a man that can set her right in the knowledge 
of those points, purely by possessing the gift of the 
second-sight, sooner have recourse innocently to such 
a man than use unlawful means to acquire it, such as 
running to conjurors to have his figure shown in their 
enchanted glasses, or using any of those traditionary 
superstitions by which they may dream of their hus- 
bands, or cause visionary shapes of them to appear 
on such and such festival nights of the year ; all 
which practices are not ordinarily wicked and im- 
pious, but downright diabolical. I hope that 
the next twenty-ninth of June, which is St. John 
the Baptist's Day, I shall not see the several pasture 
fields adjacent to this metropolis, especially that 
behind Montague House, thronged, as they were 
the last year, with well-dressed voung ladies, crawl- 
ing busily up and down upon their knees, as if they 
were a parcel of weeders, when all the business is to 
hunt superstitiously after a coal under the root of a 
plantain, to put under their heads that night, that 
they may dream who shall be their husbands. In 
order to shame them out of this silly but guilty 
practice, I do intend to have some spies out on that 
day, that shall discover who they are, and what they 

[ xxv ] 



TO THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 



have been about ; and I here give notice to the public 
that this ill-acted comedy (if it be acted at all this 
year) must begin, according to the rule of their 
superstition, on that day precisely at the hour of 
twelve. And so much for the pretty weeders ; but 
as you (ladies) have had several magical traditions 
delivered to you, which, if you put in exercise and 
practice, will be greatly prejudicial to your honour 
and your virtue, let me interpose my counsels, which 
will conduct jrou innocuously to the same end which 
some ladies have laboured to arrive at by these im- 
pieties. Give me leave first to tell you that though 
what you aim at may be arrived to by these means, 
yet these means make that a miserable fortune which 
would have been a good one ; because, in order to 
know human things beforehand, you use preter- 
natural mediums, which destroy the goodness of the 
courses which nature herself was taking for you, and 
annexes to them diabolical influences, w hich commonly 
cai ries alone with them fatalities in this world as 
well as the next. You will therefore give me your 
pardon likewise, ladies, if I relate some other of 
these practices ; which bare relation, of itself, after 
what I have said before, seems to me sufficient to 
explode them. 

Another of the nurses' prescriptions is this. Upon 
a St. Agnes's Night, the twenty-first day of January, 
take a row of pins and pull out every one, one after 
another, saying a Pater Noster, or Our Father, stick- 
ing a pin in your sleeve, and you will dream of her 
you shall marry. Ben Jonson, in one of his 
masques, makes some mention of this — 

[ xxvi J 



« 



OF GREAT BRITAIN 



" And on sweet St. Agnes' night 
Please you with the promised sight, 
Some of husbands, some of lovers, 
Which an empty dream discovers." 

Now what can be more infinitely profane than to 
use the prayer of our Lord instituted in such a way? 

There is another prescription, which is as follows : 
You must lie in another county, and knit the left 
garter about the right-legged stocking (let the other 
garter and stocking alone), and as you rehearse these 
following verses, at every comma knit a knot — 

"This knot I knit, 
To know the thing I know not yet, 
That I may see 

The man that shall my husband be : 
How he goes, and what he wears, 
And what he does all days and years." 

Accordingly, in your dream you will see him : if a 
musician, with a lute or other instrument ; if a scholar, 
with a book, &c. Now I appeal to you, ladies, what 
a ridiculous prescription is this ? But yet, as slight 
a thing as it is, it may be of great importance if it 
be brought about, because then it must be construed 
to be done by preternatural means, and then those 
words are nothing less than an application to the 
devil. 

Mr. Aubrey, of the Royal Society, says a gentle- 
woman that he knew confessed, in his hearing, that 
she used this method, and dreamed of her husband, 
whom she had never seen. About two or three years 
after, as she was one Sunday at church, up pops a 
young Oxonian in the pulpit : she cries out presently 

[ xxvii ] 



TO THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 



to her sister, " This is the very face of the man I saw 
in my dream." Sir William Somcs\s lady did the like. 

Another way is to charm the moon thus (as the 
old nunei give out): at the first appearance of the 
moon after New Year's Day (some say any other new 
moon is as good ), go out in the evening, and stand 
over the spars of a gate or stile, looking on the moon 
(here remark that in Yorkshire t hey kneel on a ground- 
fast stone), and say — 

11 All hail to the moon, all hail to thec ; 
I prithee, good moon, reveal to me 
This night who my husband shall be." 

You must presently after go to bed. The aforesaid 
Mr. Aubrey knew two gentlewomen that did thus 
when they were young maids, and they had dreams 
of those t li.it married them. 

But a great many of the wittiest part of your sex 
laugh at these common superstitions ; but then they 
are apt to run into worse. They give themselves up 
to the reading of the cabalistical systems of sylphs, 
and gnomes, and mandrakes, which are very wicked 
and delusive imaginations. 

I would not have you imagine, ladies, that I im- 
pute these things as infirmities and frailties peculiar 
to your sex. No, men, and great men, too, and 
scholars, and even statesmen and princes themselves, 
have been tainted with superstitions ; and where they 
infect the minds of such great personages, they make 
the deeper impression, according to the stronger and 
more manly ideas they have of them. Their greater 
degree of strength in the intellect only subjects them to 

[ xxviii ] 



OF GREAT BRITAIN 



greater weaknesses. Such was even the great Paracelsus, 
the wonder and miracle of learning in the age wherein 
he lived ; and such were all his followers, scholars, 
statesmen, divines, and princes, that are talismanists. 

These talismans that Paracelsus pretends to owe 
to the excogitation and invention of honest art, seem 
to me to be of a very diabolical nature, and to owe 
their rise to being dedicated by the author to the 
heathen gods. Thus the cabalists, pretending to a 
vast penetration into arts and sciences ( though all 
their thoughts are chimeras and extravagances, unless 
they be helped by preternatural means), say they have 
found out the several methods appropriated to the 
several planets. They have appropriated gold to 
the sun on the Sunday, silver to the moon on the 
Monday, iron to Mars on the Tuesday, quicksilver 
to Mercury on the Wednesday, tin to Jupiter on the 
Thursday, copper or brass to Venus on the Friday, 
and lead to Saturn on the Saturday. The methods 
they take in forming these talismans are too long to 
dwell upon here ; but the properties which they pre- 
tend belong to them are, that the first talisman or 
seal of the sun will make a man beloved by all princes 
and potentates, and cause him to abound with all the 
riches his heart can wish. The second preserves 
travellers from danger, and is favourable to mer- 
chants, tradesmen, and workmen. The third carries 
destruction to any place where it is put; and it is 
said that a certain great minister of state ordered one 
of these to be carried into England in the times of 
the revolution of the government caused by Oliver 
Cromwell. The fourth, they pretend, cures fevers and 

[ xxix J 



TO THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN 



other diseases : and if it be put under the bolster, it 
makes the proprietor have true dreams, in which he 
sees all he desires to know. The fifth, according to 
them, renders a man lucky and fortunate in all his 
businesses and undertakings ; it dissipates melancholy, 
drives away all importunate cares, and banishes panic 
fears from the mind. The sixth, by being put into 
the liquor which any one drinks, reconciles mortal 
enemies, and makes them intimate friends ; it gains 
the love of all women, and renders the proprietor 
very dexterous in the art of music. The seventh 
makes women be easily brought to bed without pain ; 
and if a horseman carries it in his left boot, himself 
and his hone become invulnerable. 

This Paracelsus and his learned followers say is 
owing to the influence of the stars ; but I cannot help 
arguing these acts of diabolical impiety. But as these 
arts are rarely known among the middling part of 
mankind, I shall neither open their mysteries, nor 
inveigh against them any further. 

The persons who are most to be avoided, are your 
ordinary fortune-telling women and men about this 
town, whose houses ought to be avoided as a plague or 
a pestilence, either because they are cheats and im- 
postors, or because they deal with black arts, none 
of them that I know having any pretensions to the 
gift of a second-eight. Among many, a few of the most 
notorious that I can call to mind now, are as follow. 

The first and chiefest of these mischievous fortune- 
tellers is a woman that does not live far from the Old 
Bailey. And truly the justice hall in that place is 
the properest place for her to appear at, where, if she 

[ xxx ] 



OF GREAT BRITAIN 

was tried for pretending to give charms written upon 
paper with odd scrawls, which she calls figures, she 
would be probably convicted, and very justly con- 
demned, and doomed to have her last journey from 
the Old Bailey to Newgate, and from Newgate to Ty- 
burn. The other is a fellow that lives in Moorfields, 
in which place, those who go to consult him ought to 
live all their lifetimes at the famous palaces of the 
senseless men. He is the successor of the famous 
Dr. Trotter, whose widow he married ; and from being 
a tailor, and patching men's garments, he now cuts 
flourishes with his shears upon parchment, considers 
the heavens as a garment, and from the spangles 
thereupon he calculates nativities, and sets up for a 
very profound astrologer. The third is an ignorant 
fellow that caws out strange predictions in Crow 
Alley, of whose croaking noise I shall here take no 
notice, he having been sufficiently mauled in the most 
ingenious Spectators. These, and such counterfeits 
as these, I would desire all gentlemen and ladies to 
avoid. The only two really learned men that I ever 
knew in the art of astrology were my good friends, 
Dr. Williams and Mr. Gadbury ; and I thought it 
necessary to pay this esteem to their manes, let the 
world judge of them what it will. I will here say no 
more, nor hinder you any longer, gentlemen and 
ladies, from the diversion which my good old friend, 
who is now departed this life, has prepared for you in 
his book, which a young gentleman of my acquaint- 
ance revised, and only subscribe myself, yours, &c, 

Duncan Campbell.

AUTHORS INTRODUCTION 



OF all the writings delivered in an histori- 
cal manner to the world, none certainly 
were ever held in greater esteem than 
those which give us the lives of dis- 
tinguished private men at full length ; and, as I 
may say, to the life. Such curious fragments of 
biography are the rarities which great men seek 
after with eager industry, and when found, prize 
them as the chief jewels and ornaments that enrich 
their libraries ; and deservedly, for they are the beau- 
ties of the greatest men's lives handed down by way 
of example or instruction to posterity, and commonly 
handed down likewise by the greatest men. Since, 
therefore, persons distinguished for merit in one kind 
or other are the constant subjects of such discourses, 
and the most elegant writers of each age have been 
usually the only authors who choose upon such sub- 
jects to employ their pens, and since persons of the 
highest rank and dignity, and genii of the most re- 
fined and delicate relish, are frequently curious enougli 
to be the readers of them, and to esteem them the most 
valuable pieces in a whole collection of learned works, 
it is a wonder to me, that when any man's life has 
something in it peculiarly great and remarkable in its 
kind, it should not move some more skilful writer

than myself to give the public a taste of it, because 
it must be at least vastly entertaining, if it be not, 
which is next to impossible) immensely instructive and 
profitable withal. 

If ever the life of any man under the sun was re- 
markable, this Mr. Duncan Campbell's, which I am 
going to treat upon, is so to a very eminent degree. 

It affords Mich variety of incidents, and is accom- 
panied with such diversity of circumstances, that it 
includes within it what must yield entire satisfaction 
to the most learned, and admiration to persons of a 
moderate understanding. The prince and the peasant 
will have their several ends of worthy delight in read- 
ing it ; and Mr. Campbell's life is of that extent that 
it concerns and collects (as I may say) within itself 
every station of life in the universe. Besides, there 
is a demand, in almost every page that relates any 
new act of his, for the finest and closest disquisitions 
that learning can make upon human nature, to ac- 
count how those acts could be done by him ; for he 
daily practised, and still practises, those things natu- 
rally which puts art to the rack to find out how na! ore 
can so operate in him ; and his fleshly body, by these 
operations, is a living practic al system or bod v of new 
philosophy, which exceeds even all those that have 
hitherto been compounded by the labour and art of 
many ages. 

If one that had speculated deep into abstruse mat- 
ters, and made it his study not only to know how to 
assign natural reasons for some strange new acts, that 
looked like miracles by being peculiar to the individ- 
ual genius of some particular admired man, but 

[ xxxiv ] 



AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION 



carrying his inquiry to a much greater height, had 
speculated likewise what might possibly be achieved 
by human genius in the full perfection of nature, and 
had laid it down as a thesis by strong arguments, that 
such things might be compassed by a human genius 
(if in its true degree of perfection) as are the hourly 
operations of the person's life I am writing, he would 
have been counted a wild, romantic enthusiast, instead 
of a natural philosopher. Some of the wisest would 
be infidels to so new and so refined a scheme of think- 
ing, and demand experiment, or cry it was all against 
reason, and would not allow the least tittle to be true 
without it. Yet the man that had found out so great 
a mystery as to tell us what might be done by human 
genius, as it is here actually done, would have been a 
great man within himself ; but wanting farther ex- 
perimental proof, could lay no claim to the belief of 
others, or consequently to their esteem. But how 
great, then, is the man who makes it constantly his 
practice actually to do what would not otherwise 
have been thought to be of such a nature as might 
ever be acquired by mortal capacity, though in its 
full complement of all possible perfection ? He is not 
only great within himself, he is great to the world : 
his experiments force our belief, and the amazing 
singularity of those experiments provokes both our 
wonder and esteem. 

If any learned man should have advanced this prop- 
osition, that mere human art could give to the deaf 
man what should be equal to his hearing, and to the 
dumb man an equivalent for his want of speech, so 
that he should converse as freely almost as other hear-

ing or talking persons ; that ho might, though born 
deaf, be by art taught how to read, write, and under- 
stand any language as well as students that have 
their hearing, would not the world, and many even 
of the learned part of it, say that nothing could be 
more extravagantly wild, more mad and frantic ? 
The learned Dr. Wallis, geometry professor of Ox- 
ford, did first of all lay down this proposition, and 
was counted In many t<> have overshot the point of 
learning, and to have been the author of a whimsical 
thesis. And I should not have wondered if, after a 
man's having asserted this might be done before it 

was actually done, some blind devout people in those 
days had accused him of heresy, and of attributing to 
men a power of working miracles. The notion of the 
antipodes was by the most learned men of the age in 
which St. Augustine lived, and by the great St. 
Austin himself, treated in no milder a manner ; yet 
if the ability of teaching the deaf and the dumb a 
language proved a truth in experience afterwards, 
ought not those to turn their contempt into admira- 
tion, ought not those very people to vote him into 
the Royal Society for laying down the proposition, 
who, before it proved true, in fact, would have been 
very forward to have sent him to Bedlam ? The 
first instance of this accomplishment in a dumb per- 
son was proved before King Charles II. by this same 
Dr. Wallis, who was a fellow of the Royal Society, 
and one of the most ingenious of that society. 

But notwithstanding this, should I come after- 
wards and say, that there is now living a deaf and 
dumb man, and born so, who could by dint of his

AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION 



own genius teach all others deaf and dumb to read, 
write, and converse with the talking and hearing part 
of mankind, some would, I warrant, very religiously 
conclude, that I was about to introduce some strange 
new miracle- monger and impostor into the world, 
with a design of setting up some new sect of anti- 
Christianism as formidable as that of Brahmans. 
Should I proceed still farther and say, that this same 
person, so deaf and dumb, might be able also to show 
a presaging power, or kind of prophetical genius (if I 
may be allowed the expression) by telling any strange 
persons he never saw before in his life, their names at 
first sight in writing, and by telling them the past 
actions of their lives, and predicting to them deter- 
mined truths of future contingencies, notwithstand- 
ing what divines say, that " in futuris contingentibus 
non datur determinata Veritas," would not they con- 
clude that I was going to usher in a new Mahomet ? 
Since, therefore, there does exist such a man in Lon- 
don, who actually is deaf and dumb, and was born 
so ; who does write and read, and converse as well as 
anybody ; who teaches others deaf and dumb to 
write and read and converse with anybody ; who 
likewise can, by a presaging gift, set down in writing 
the name of any stranger at first sight, tell him his 
past actions, and predict his future occurrences in 
fortune ; and since he has practised this talent as a 
profession with great success for a long series of 
years upon innumerable persons in every state and 
vocation in life, from the peeress to the waiting- 
woman, and from the lady mayoress to the milliner 
and sempstress, will it not be wonderfully entertain-

ing to give the world a perfect history of this so 
singular a man's life ? And while we are relating 
the pleasant adventures with such prodigious variety, 
can anything be more agreeably instructive in a new 
way than to intersperse the reasons, and account for 
the manner how nature, having a mind to be remark- 
able, performs by him acts so mysterious? 

I have premised this introduction, compounded of 
the merry and the serious, with the hopes of engaging 
man\ curious people of all sorts to be my readers, 
even from the airy nice peruser of novels and ro- 
mances, neatly bound and finely gilt, to the grave 
philosopher, that is daily thumbing over the musty 
and tattered pieces of more solid antiquity. I have 
all the wonders to tell that such a merry kind of a 
prophet has told, to entertain the fancies of the first 
gay tribe, by which means I may entice them into 
some solid knowledge and judgment of human na- 
ture ; and I have several solid disquisitions of learn- 
ing to make, accounting for the manner of these 
mysterious operations, never touched upon before in 
due form and order by the hands of the ancient or 
modern sages, that I may bribe the judgment of this 
last grave class so far as to endure the intermixing 
entertainment with their severer studies.

THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE AND 
SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF 
MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



THE HISTORY OF the LIFE AND 
SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF 
MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



CHAPTER ONE 

mr. Campbell's descent, family, birth, etc. 

OF the goodness and antiquity of the 
name and family of this gentleman, 
nobody can ever make any question. 
He is a Campbell, lineally descended 
from the house of Argyll, and bears a distant rela- 
tion to the present duke of that name in Scotland, 
and who is now constituted a duke of England, by 
the style and title of Duke of Greenwich. 

It happens frequently that the birth of extraordi- 
nary persons is so long disputed by different people, 
each claiming him for their own, that the real place 
where he first took breath grows at last dubious. 
And thus it fares with the person who is the subject 
of the following sheets ; as, therefore, it is my 
proposal to have a strict regard to historical faith, 
so I am obliged to tell the reader that I can with 
no certainty give an account of him till after he was 
three years old, from which age I knew him even to 
this day. I will answer for the truths which I 
impart to the public during that time, and as for 

[3] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



his birth and the circumstances of it, and how the 
first three years of his life passed, I can only deliver 
them the same account I have received from others, 
and leave them to their own judgments, whether it 
ought to be deemed real or fabulous. 

The father of our Mr. Duncan Campbell (as these 
relate the story) was from his infancy of a very 
curious inquisitive nature, and of an enterprising 
genius, and if lit' heard of anything surprising to be 
seen, the difficulty in practice was enough to rec- 
ommend to him the attempting to get a sight of it 
at any rate or any hazard. It is certain that during 
some civil broils and troubles in Scotland, the grand- 
father of our Mr. Campbell was driven with his 
wife and family, by the fate of war, into the isle of 
Shetland, where he lived many years, and during his 
residence there, Mr. Archibald Campbell, the father 
of our Duncan Campbell, was born. 

Shetland lies north-east from Orkney, between 60 
and 61 degrees of latitude. The largest isle of 
Shetland, by the natives called the Mainland, is 
sixty miles in length, from south-west to the north- 
east, and from sixteen to one mile in breadth. 

The people who live in the smaller isles have 
abundance of eggs and fowl, which contributes to 
maintain their families during the summer. 

The ordinary folks are mostly very nimble and 
active in climbing the rocks in quest of those eggs 
and fowl. This exercise is far more diverting than 
hunting and hawking among us, and would certainly, 
for the pleasure of it, be followed by people of 
greater distinction, was it not attended with very 

[*] 



A WAY OF FOWLING 



great dangers, sufficient to turn sport into sorrow, 
and which have often proved fatal to those who too 
eagerly pursue their game. Mr. Archibald Camp- 
bell, however, delighted extremely in this way of 
fowling, and used to condescend to mix with the 
common people for company, because none of the 
youths of his rank and condition were venturesome 
enough to go along with him. 

The most remarkable experiment of this sort is at 
the isle called the Noss of Brassah. The Noss 
standing at sixteen fathom distance from the side of 
the opposite main, the higher and lower rocks have 
two stakes fastened in each of them, and to these 
there are ropes tied ; upon the ropes there is an 
engine hung, which they call a cradle, and in this a 
man makes his way over from the greater to the 
smaller rocks, where he makes a considerable purchase 
of eggs and fowl ; but his return being by an ascent 
makes it the more dangerous, though those on the 
great rock have a rope tied to the cradle, by which 
they draw it and the man safe over for the most part. 
Over this rock Mr. Archibald Campbell and five 
others were in that matter let down by cradles and 
ropes ; but before they could be all drawn back again 
it grew dark, and their associates not daring to be 
benighted, were forced to withdraw, and Mr. Camp- 
bell was the unfortunate person left behind, having 
wandered too far, and not minded how the day 
declined, being intent on his game. He passed that 
night, you may easily guess, without much sleep, 
and with great anxiety of heart. The night, too, as 
he lav in the open air, was, to add to his misfortunes, 

[5] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



as boisterous and tempestuous as his own mind ; but 
in the end the tempest proved very happy for him. 
The reader is to understand that the Hamburghers, 
Bremeners, and Hollanders, carry on a great fish 
trade there. Accordingly, a Holland vessel that was 
just coming in the sound of Brassah, was by this 
tempest driven into a creek of the rock, which nature 
had made into a harbour, and they were providen- 
tially saved from the bottom of the sea by a rock, 
from which, humanly speaking, they could expect 
nothing but destruction, and being sent to the bottom 
of that sea. As never could a man be taken hold of 
with so sudden and surprising a disaster, so nobody 
could meet with a more sudden and surprising relief 
than Mr. Campbell found when he saw a ship so near. 
He made to the vessel, and begged the Hollanders 
to take him in. They asked him what he would give 
them, u or," said the barbarous sailors, " we will even 
leave you where you are." He told them his disaster, 
but they asked money, and nothing else would move 
them. As he knew them a self-interested people, he 
bethought himself that if he should tell them of the 
plenty of fowls and eggs they would get there, he 
might not only be taken in a passenger, but made a 
partner in the money arising from the stock. It 
succeeded accordingly : when he proposed it, the 
whole crew were all at work, and in four hours, pretty 
well stored the vessel, and then, returning on board, 
set sail for Holland. They offered Mr. Campbell to 
put him in at his own island, but having a mind to 
see Holland, and, being a partner, to learn their way 
of merchandise, which he thought he might turn to 

[6] 



A DISAPPEARANCE 

his countrymen's advantage, he told them he would 
go the voyage out with them, and see the country of 
those who were his deliverers, a necessary way of 
speech, when one has a design to soothe barbarians, 
who but for interest would have left him unredeemed, 
and, for aught they knew, a perpetual sole inhabitant 
of a dreadful rock, encompassed round with preci- 
pices, some three hundred fathom high. Not so the 
islanders (who are wrongly called a savage set of 
mortals); no, they came in quest of him after so 
bitter a night, not doubting to find him, but fearing 
to find him in a lamentable condition. They hunted 
and ransacked every little hole and corner in the 
rock, but all in vain ; in one place they saw a great 
slaughter of fowls, enough to serve forty families for 
a week, and then they guessed, though they had not 
the ill fortune to meet the eagles frequently noted 
to hover about those isles, that they might have 
devoured part of him on some precipice of the rock, 
and dropped the remnant into the sea. Night came 
upon them, and they were afraid of falling into the 
same disaster they went to relieve Mr. Campbell 
from. They returned each to their proper basket, 
and were drawn up safe by their respective friends, 
who were amazed that one basket was drawn up 
empty which was let down for Mr. Campbell, and 
that there was not the least intelligence to be had 
concerning him, but the supposititious story of his 
having been devoured by eagles. The story was told 
at home, and with the lamentation of the whole 
family, and all his friends, he was looked upon to 
be murdered or dead. 

m 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



Return we now to Mr. Archibald Campbell, still 
alive, and on board the Holland vessel, secure, as he 
thought within himself, that from the delivery he 
lately had by the gift of Providence, he was not in- 
tended to be liable to any more misfortunes and 
dangers of life, in the compass of so small a voyage. 
But his lot was placed otherwise in the book of fate 
than he too fondly imagined ; his time of happiness 
was dated some pages lower down, and more rubs 
and difficulties were to be encountered with before 
his stars intended to lead him to the port of felicity. 
Just as he arrived within sight of Amsterdam a 
terrible storm arose, and, in danger of their lives 
for many hours, they weathered out the tempest, 
and a calm promising fair afresh, they made to the 
coast of Zealand ; but a new hurricane prevented 
the ship from coming there also, and after having 
lost their masts and rigging, they were driven into 
Lapland. There they went ashore in order to careen 
and repair their ship, and take in provisions. While 
the ship was repairing by the Dutch, our islander 
made merry with the inhabitants, being the most 
inclined to their superstitious customs ; he there 
became acquainted with a very beautiful woman, 
who fell in love with him, and after a very short 
space of time he married her. About the time when 
the ship departed, his wife, who was very rich, was 
big with child of a son, namely, Mr. Duncan Camp- 
bell. He wrote a letter, by the master of the 
vessel, to his parents in Shetland, concerning the 
various adventures he had met with, which was de- 
livered the June following, about the time of fish- 

[8] 



STORY OF ADVENTURE 



ing, to his parents, and several persons had copies 
thereof ; and, for aught I know, some retain them to 
this very day ; sure I am, that many remember the 
particulars of this surprising affair, who are now 
living in that island. 

The letter being very remarkable and singular in 
all its circumstances, I shall present it the reader, 
word for word, as it was given into my hands, to- 
gether with some others which he wrote afterwards, 
in all which I am assured, by very credible persons 
and undoubted authorities, there are not the least 
alterations but what the version of it from the then 
Scotch manner of expression into a more modern 
English dress made absolutely necessary. 

My dearest Father, — The same odd variety of 
accident which put it out of my power to be per- 
sonally present with you for so long a time, put it 
likewise out of my power to write to you. At last 
fortune has so ordered it, that I can send a letter to 
you before I can come myself, and it is written ex- 
pressly to tell you the adventures I have met with, 
which have detained me this tedious space of time 
from my dear father, and because the same captain of 
a ship that brings you this, might as easily have 
brought your son to speak for himself. I shall in the 
next place lay before you the necessity there is for my 
stay a little longer among the strange natives of the 
country where I now inhabit, and where I am in a 
manner become naturalised. 

You have, no doubt of it, been informed by my 
companions, some of whom I hope got safe back 

[9] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



again, if not all, that I was lost where many a brave 
man has perished before me, by going over the high 
precipices of the mountain Brassah in a basket, slid- 
ing down by a rope. I must suppose I have given 
you the anguish of a father for a son, who you thought 
had lost his life by such a foolhardy attempt, and I 
implore your pardon with all the power of filial con- 
trition, penitence, and duty. You have always showed 
me such singular marks of paternal affection that I 
know your receipt of this letter will fill your heart 
with joy, and cause you to sign me an absolution and 
free pardon for all the errors I have committed, and 
think the sufferings I have undergone for my rash- 
ness and indiscretion a sufficient atonement for my 
crime of making you, by my undutifulness, a partner 
of my sorrows. To free you the more from this un- 
easiness, I know I need only tell you that every grief 
of mine is gone excepting one, which is, that I must 
still lose the pleasure of seeing you a little longer. 
There was never surely a more bitter night than that 
which must by me be for ever remembered, when I 
was lost in the mountain of Brassah, where I must, 
for aught I know, have lived for ever, a wild single 
inhabitant, but that the storm which made the night 
so uneasy to me, rendered the first approach of day- 
light beyond measure delightful. The first providen- 
tial glimpse of the morning gave me a view of a ship 
driven by the tempest into a creek of the rock that 
was by nature formed like a harbour ; a miraculous 
security of deliverance as I thought, both for the ship 1 s 
crew and myself. I made all the haste I could, you 
may be sure, to them, and I found them to be Dutch- 

[10] 



UMA LAPMARK 



men that were come for fish ; but in lieu of fish I in- 
structed them to load it with eggs and fowl, which 
we compassed very happily in a short space of time, 
and I was to be a sharer with the captain in the 
lading, and bargained to go for Holland to see the 
sale and nature of the traffic ; but when we were at 
sea, after much bad weather, we made towards Zea- 
land, but we were driven upon the coast of Finland 
by a new storm, and thence to Lapland, where I now 
am, and from whence I send you this letter. 

I could not come into a place so properly named 
for my reception. As I had been undutiful to you, 
and fortune seemed to make me an exile or a banished 
man, by way of punishment for the vices of my youth ; 
so Lapland (which is a word originally derived from 
the Finland word, lappi, that is, exiles, and from the 
Swedish word, lap, signifying banished, from which 
two kingdoms most of our inhabitants were banished 
hither for not embracing the Christian religion) was 
certainly the properest country in the world to receive 
me. 

When first I entered this country I thought I was 
got into quite another world. The men are all of 
them pigmies to our tall, brawny Highlanders ; they 
are, generally speaking, not above three cubits high, 
insomuch that though the whole country of Lapland 
is immensely large, and I have heard it reckoned by 
the inhabitants to be above a hundred German 
leagues in length, and fourscore and ten in breadth, 
yet I was the tallest man there, and looked upon as a 
giant. The district in which I live now is called Uma 
Lapmark. 

[in 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

You must understand, sir, that when I landed at 
North Cape, in Kimi Lapmark, another district of 
Lapland, there was at that time a most beautiful 
lady come to see a sick relation of her father's, who 
was prefect or governor of Uma Lapmark, which is a 
post of great distinction. This lady, by being fre- 
quently in the company of French merchants, who 
traffic now and then in that province of Uma Lap- 
mark, understood French, and having heard of a man 
six feet and a half high, desired to see me, and when 
I came she happened mightily to like my person ; 
and she talked French, which when I answered she 
made great signs of joy that she could communicate 
her sentiments to me, and she told me who she was, 
how rich, and that not one in the company besides 
could understand a syllable we said, and so I might 
speak my mind freely to her. She told me the cus- 
toms of the country, that it was divided into cantons, 
like our shires, and those cantons into rekars, or cer- 
tain grounds allotted to families that are just like 
our clans. As she was beyond measure beautiful, 
she was extremely good-humoured (a thing rarely to 
be met among Lapland women), of a better stature 
than her countrywomen, and very rich and of good 
birth. I thought it would be a prodigious turn of 
fortune for a man in my circumstances, if I could 
make any progress in her heart, which she seemed a 
little to open to me, in such a manner, for the begin- 
ning, as if such a successful event, if managed with 
prudence, might not be despaired of. Souls that are 
generous are apt to love, and compassion is the best 
introducer of love into a generous bosom, and that 

[12] 



COURTSHIP IN LAPLAND 

was the best stock I had to go upon in my courtship. 
I told her of all my calamities, my dangers, and my 
escapes ; the goodness of my birth, as being allied 
to one of the greatest nobles in our island ; and still 
she would ask me to tell it her over again, though 
every time I told it, just at such passages, she was 
forced to drop the tears from her eyes. In fine, I 
grew more in love with her, out of a sense of grati- 
tude now, than by the power of her charms before. 
The matter in a few days went so far that she owned 
to me I had her heart. As to marriage, I did not 
then know the custom of the nation ; I thought that 
if it proved only dangerous to me, I loved her so well 
that I intended to marry her, though the law was 
to pronounce me dead for it; but I did not know 
whether it might not be perilous for her too to en- 
gage in such a state with me, and I resolved in that 
case rather to be singly unhappy than to involve her 
in distress and make her the fair companion of my 
woes. I would not tell her so for fear she should, 
out of love, hide from me those dangers, and there- 
fore, using a kind sort of dissimulation, I conjured 
her to tell me the laws and customs of marriages in 
that country to a tittle, and that nothing should 
hinder us from happiness. She told me exactly as 
I find since. " Our marriage," said she, " will be 
very hard to compass, provided we follow the strict 
rule of the country ; for our women here are bound 
not to see the man who makes their addresses to 
them in some time. His way of courtship is to come 
to the parents, and his nearest friends and relations 
must make her father presents, and supplicate him 

[13] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

like a king to grant him his daughter. The court- 
ship often lasts two or three years, and sometimes 
has not its effect at last ; but if it has, the woman 
is dragged by her father and brother to church, as 
unwilling to go to be married, which is looked upon 
as a greater part of modesty in her according to the 
greater disinclination she shows. My father and 
brother,'" said she, " will both be against it ; you 
have no relations in this country to move your suit ; 
I cannot be so hypocritical as to be dragged unwil- 
lingly to him I own I desire for my lawful husband, 
and therefore, as I have an inclination to you, and I 
dare own I have, I will not follow those methods 
which I disapprove. I have talked with several 
Swedes and several polite Frenchmen about their 
manner of espousals, and I am told that when souls 
are naturally united by affection, the couple so mu- 
tually and reciprocally loving, though they had rather 
have their parents'* leave if likely to be got, yet, un- 
willing to be disappointed, only go to the next minis- 
ter's and marry for better for worse. This way I 
approve of, for where two persons naturally love each 
other, the rest is nothing but a modest restraint to 
their wishes, and since it is only custom, my own 
reason teaches me there is no error committed, nor any 
harm done in breaking through it, upon so commend- 
able an occasion. I have," added she, "a thousand 
reindeer belonging to me beyond my father's power 
of taking away, and a third share in a rekar or clan, 
that is ten leagues in compass, in the byar or canton 
of Uma Lapmark. This is at my own disposal, and 
it is all your own if vou please to accept of it with 

[14] 



MARRIAGE IN LAPLAND 



me. Our women are very coy when they are courted, 
though they have never so much an inclination to 
their suitor; but good reason and the commerce I 
have had with persons of politer nations than ours 
is, teach me that this proceeds entirely from vanity 
and affectation, and the greatest proof of a woman's 
modesty, chastity, and sincerity certainly consists (con- 
trary to the general corrupted opinion) in yielding up 
herself into the arms of the man she loves. For she 
that can dally with a heart she prizes, can give away 
her heart (when she is once baulked) to any man, even 
though she dislikes him." You must judge, my dear 
father, I must be touched with a woman that was 
exceeding beautiful beyond any of her nation, and 
who had thoughts as beautiful as her person. I there- 
fore was all in rapture, and longed for the matrimony, 
but still loved her enough to propose the question I 
resolved to her, viz., if it would not be in her nation 
accounted a clandestine marriage, and prove of great 
damage to her. 

To this she answered with all the wisdom which 
could be expected from a woman who had given such 
eminent tokens of her judgment on other points, 
amidst a nation so barbarous in its manners, and so 
corrupt in its principles, as Lapland is. " I am, 11 
said she, " answerable to my father for nothing by 
our laws, having no portion of him, but only what 
was presented me by my relations at my birth, 
according to custom, in lands and reindeer. My 
father is but deputy -governor ; it is a Swede who is 
the Governor of Uma, and if I pay to him at every 
mart and fair the due tribute, which must either 

[15]- 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



consist of fifty reindeer or one hundred and fifty rix- 
dollars, he will have the priest that marries us pres- 
ent at the court of justice, according to our custom, 
and keep us in possession of our rights, that we may 
be enabled to pay tribute to the crown of Sweden. 
Indeed, before the abolition of the birkarti, which 
were our native judges, we could not have married 
thus without danger to us both ; but now there is 
none at all." 

My dear father, you must easily imagine that I 
could not help embracing with all tenderness so dear 
and so lovely a woman. In fine, I am married to 
her. I have lived very happily hitherto, and am now 
grown more happy, for she is big with child ; and 
likely, before my letter comes to your hands, to 
make you a grandfather of a pretty boy. You will 
perhaps wonder that I name the sex of the child 
before it comes into the world ; but we have a way in 
Lapland of finding that out, which, though some judi- 
cious people call superstitious, I am really persuaded 
of by experience, and therefore I indulged my dear 
wife's curiosity when she signified to me she had a 
mind to make the usual trial whether the child she 
was going to be delivered of would be a boy or a 
girl. 

You must understand, my dear father, the people 
here judge of the sex of the child by the moon, unto 
which they compare a big-bellied woman. If they 
see a star appear just above the moon, it is a sign it 
will be a boy, but, if the star be just below the moon, 
they conjecture her to be big with a girl. This ob- 
servation and remark of Laplanders have, I know, 

[16] 



PROGNOSTICATIONS 



been accounted by some, and those wise and judicious 
men too, to be ridiculously superstitious ; but I have 
been led into an easy belief of this mystery by a 
mistress that is superior to wisdom itself, constant, 
and therefore probably infallible, experience. I there- 
fore indulged my wife in this her request, and went 
with her to the ceremony. The star appeared above 
the moon, which prognosticates a boy, which I wish 
may, and I scarce doubt will, prove true ; and when 
she is brought to bed I will send you word of it. 
It is remarkable, likewise, that a star was seen just 
before the moon, which we also count a very good 
omen ; for it is a custom likewise here in Lapland 
to consult the moon as an oracle about the health 
and vigour of the child. If a star be seen just 
before the moon we count it a sign of a lusty and 
well-grown child, without blemish ; if a star comes 
just after, we reckon it a token that the child will 
have some defect or deformity, or die soon after it 
is born. 

Having thus told you the manners of the country 
I live in at present, as much at large as the space of 
a letter will permit, and related to you my own 
happy circumstances, and the kindly promises of the 
heavens that are ushering in the birth of my child, 
I would not have you think that I addict myself to 
the superstitions of the country, which are very 
many and groundless, and arising partly from the 
remainder of Pagan worship, which is still cultivated 
among some of the more obstinate inhabitants. I 
have, on the contrary, since I married her, endeav- 
oured to repay my wife's temporal blessings to me 
* [17] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



with those that are endless, instructed her in all the 
points of religion, and made her perfectly a Christian ; 
and she, by her devotion and prayers for me, makes 
me such amends for it that I hope in us two St. 
Paul's saying will be verified, viz., that the woman 
shall be sanctified in her husband, and the husband 
■hall be sanctified in his wife. 

However, I must take notice in this place, with 
all due deference to Christianity, that though I am 
obliged to applaud the prudence and piety of Charles 
the Ninth of Swede n, who, constituting Swedish gov- 
ernors over this country, abrogated their practice 
of superstitions and art-magic upon pain of death, 
yet that king carried the point too far, and inter- 
mingled with these arts the pretensions to the gift 
of a second sight, which you know how frequent it 
is with us in Scotland, and which, 1 assure you, my 
wife (though she durst not publicly own it for fear 
of incurring the penalty of those Swedish laws) does, as 
it were, inherit (for all her ancestors before her have 
had it from time immemorial) to a greater degree than 
ever I knew any of our countrywomen or countrymen. 

One day this last week she distracted me between 
the extremes of joy and sorrow. She told me I 
should see you shortly, and that my coming son 
would giow to be one of the most remarkable men 
in England and Scotland for his power of foresight; 
but that I should speedily lose her, and meet with 
difficulties in my own country in the same manner 
as my father (meaning you, sir) had done before me, 
and on the same account, viz., of civil broils and 
intestine wars in Scotland. 

[18] 



A REMARKABLE CHILD 



These unfortunate parts of her relation I would 
not conceal from you, because the veracity of her 
notions should appear, if they are true, though you 
may be sure I much wish they all may prove false to 
the very last, excepting that wherein she tells me my 
son will be greatly remarkable, and that I shall 
shortly see my dear father, which I daily long for, 
and will endeavour to do, as soon as possible. Pray 
remember me to all friends ; being, honoured sir, 
your most dutiful and loving son, 

Archibald Campbell. 

The Second Letter. 

I am now the happiest man alive ; the prosperous 
part of my wife's predictions, which I mentioned to 
you in my last, is come in some measure to pass. 
The child she has brought me is a boy, and as fine a 
one as ever I beheld, if fondness for my own makes 
me not blind ; and sure it cannot be fondness, be- 
cause other plain circumstances joined at his birth to 
prove it more than an ordinary remarkable one. He 
was born with a caul upon his head, which we count 
one of the luckiest signs that can be in nature ; he 
had likewise three teeth ready cut through the gums, 
and we reckon that an undeniable testimony and 
promise given to the world by Nature that she in- 
tends such a person for her extraordinary favourite, 
and that he is born for great things, which I daily 
beg of Heaven may come to pass. 

Since I have known for some months what it is to 
be a father, it adds a considerable weight to those 

[19] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



affections which I had for my wife. I thought that 
my tenderness for her was at the height of perfection 
before ; which shows how little we know of those 
parts of nature that we have yet never tried, and of 
which we have not yet been allotted our share to act 
upon the stage of life. I find that I did love her 
then as well as a husband could love a wife, that is, 
a wife without a child ; but the love to a wife that 
has a child is a feeling wonderful and inexpressibly 
different. A child is the seal and pledge of love. 
Meditating upon this has likewise doubled my affec- 
tion for you. I loved you before as a son, and be- 
cause as such I felt your tenderness, but my love is 
much increased now, because I know the tenderness 
which you felt for me as a father. With these 
pleasing images of thought I often keep you nearer 
company at this vast distance than when I lived 
irregularly under your eye. These reflections render 
a solitary life dear to me ; and though I have no 
manner of acquaintance with her relations, who hate 
me, as I am told, nor indeed with almost any of the 
inhabitants but my own domestics and those I am 
forced to deal with, yet I have as much, methinks, 
as I wish for, unless I could come over to Shetland, 
and live with you, which I the more ardently desire, 
because I think I and my wife could be true com- 
forts to you in your advanced years, now I know 
what living truly is. I am daily persuading my wife 
to go with me, but she denies me with kind expres- 
sions, and says she owes too much to the place 
(however less pleasant in itself than other climates) 
where she had the happiness of first joining hands 

[20] 



HOPE AND GRIEF 



with me in wedlock, ever to part from it. But I 
must explain how I ask, and how she refuses. I re- 
solved never directly and downrightly to ask her, 
because I know she can refuse me nothing, and that 
would be bearing hard upon the goodness of her will ; 
but my way of persuading her consists in endeavour- 
ing to make her in love with the place by agreeable 
descriptions of it, and likewise of the humane temper 
of the people, so that I shortly shall induce her to 
signify to me that it is her own will to come with 
me, and then I shall seem rather to consent to her 
will than to have moved it over to my own. These 
hopes I have of seeing my dear father shortly, and I 
know such news would make this letter which I there- 
fore send more acceptable to him, to whom I will be 
a most dutiful and affectionate son till death. 

Archibald Campbell. 

P. S. — If I cannot bring my wife to change this 
country for another, I have brought her to that pitch 
of devotion that whenever Providence, which notwith- 
standing her predictions, I hope will be long yet, shall 
call her to change this world for another, it will be 
happy with her there. She joins with me in begging 
your blessing to me, herself, and our little Duncan, 
whom we christened so out of a respect to the name 
you bear. 

The Third Letter. 

My dear Father, — I am lost in grief : I had just 
brought my wife (her that was my wife, for I have 
none now, I have lost all joy) in the mind of coming 

[21]

MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



over to be a comfort to you. But now grief will let 
me say no more than that I am coming to beg com- 
fort from you, and by this I prepare you to receive, 
when he comes, a son in tears and mourning. 

Archibald Campbell. 

P. S. — I have a babe, not much above two years 
old, must bear the hardships of travelling over the ice, 
and all through Muscovy, for no ships can stir here 
for many months ; and I cannot bear to live in this 
inhospitable place, where she died that only could 
make it easy to me, one moment beyond the first op- 
portunity I have of leaving it. She is in heaven ; 
that should make me easy, but I cannot, I am not so 
good a Christian as she was — I am lost and ruined.

CHAPTER TWO 



AFTER THE DEATH OF MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL S MOTHER 
IN LAPLAND, HIS FATHER ARCHIBALD RETURNED 
WITH HIS SON TO SCOTLAND. HIS SECOND MAR- 
RIAGE, AND HOW HIS SON WAS TAUGHT TO WRITE 
AND READ. 

MR. ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL, hav- 
ing buried his Lapland lady, returned 
to Scotland, and brought over with 
him his son, Mr. Duncan Campbell. 
By that time he had been a year in his own country 
he married a second wife, a lady whom I had known 
very well for some years, and then I first saw the boy ; 
but as they went into the western islands, I saw them 
not again in three years. She being, quite contrary 
to the cruel way much in use among stepmothers, 
very fond of the boy, was accustomed to say she did 
and would always think him her own son. The child 
came to be about four years of age (as she has related 
to me the story since), and not able to speak one word, 
nor to hear any noise ; the father of him used to be 
mightily oppressed with grief, and complain heavily 
to his new wife, who was no less perplexed that a boy 
so pretty, the son of so particular a woman, whom he 
had made his wife, by strange accidents and adven- 
tures, and a child coming into the world with so many 

[ 23 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



amazing circumstances attending his birth, should 
lose those precious senses by which alone the social 
commerce of mankind is upheld and maintained, and 
that he should be deprived of all advantages of edu- 
cation which could raise him to the character of 
being the great man that so many concurring inci- 
dents at his nativity promised and betokened he 
would be. 

One day a learned divine, who was of the univer- 
sity of Glasgow, but had visited Oxford, and been 
acquainted with the chief men of science there, hap- 
pening to be in conversation with the mother-in-law 
of this child, she related to him her son's misfortunes, 
with so many marks of sorrow, that she moved the 
good old gentleman's compassion, and excited in him 
a desire to give her what relief and consolation he 
could, in this unhappy case. His particular inclina- 
tion to do her good offices made him recollect that at 
the time he was at Oxford he had been in company 
with one Dr. Wallis, a man famous for learning, who 
had told him that he had taught a man (born deaf 
and dumb) to write and to read, and even to utter some 
words articulately with his mouth ; and that he told 
him he was then going to commit to print the method 
he made use of in so instructing that person, that 
others in the like unfortunate condition might re- 
ceive the same benefits and advantages from other 
masters which his deaf and dumb pupil had received 
from him. A dumb man recovering his speech, or a 
blind man gaining his sight, or a deaf one getting his 
hearing, could not be more overjoyed than Mrs. Camp- 
bell was at these unexpected tidings, and she wept for 

[24] 



INSTINCTIVE REJOICING 



gladness when he told it. The good gentleman ani- 
mated and encouraged her with the kindest promises ; 
and to keep alive her hopes assured her he would 
send to one of the chief booksellers in London, to in- 
quire after the book, who would certainly procure it 
him, if it was to be got ; and that afterwards he would 
peruse it diligently, make himself master of Dr. 
Wallis's method, and though he had many great 
works upon his hands at that time, he would steal from 
his other studies leisure enough to complete so chari- 
table an object as teaching the dumb and deaf to read 
and to write, and give her son, who was by nature de- 
prived of them, the advantages of speech, as far as art 
would permit that natural defect to be supplied by 
her powerful interposition. 

When the mother came home, the child, who could 
hear no knocking, and therefore it must be by a 
strange and inexplicable instinct in nature, was the 
first that ran to the door, and falling in a great fit 
of laughter (a thing it was not much used to before, 
having on the contrary rather a melancholy cast of 
complexion), it clung round its mother's knees, in- 
cessantly embracing and kissing them, as if just at 
that time it had an insight into what the mother 
had been doing for it, and into its own approaching 
relief from its misery. 

When the mother came with the child in her hand 
to the father to tell him the welcome news, the child 
burst afresh into a great fit of laughter, which con- 
tinued for an unusual space of time ; and the scene 
of such reciprocal affection and joy between a wife 
and her own husband, on so signal an occasion, is a 

[25] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



thing easier to be felt by parents of a good dispo- 
sition, imagining themselves under the same circum- 
stance, with regard to a child they loved with 
fondness, than to be expressed or described by the 
pen of any writer. But it is certain, whenever they 
spoke of this affair, as anybody who knows the im- 
patience of parents for the welfare of an only child 
may guess they must be often discoursing it over, 
and wishing the time was come, the boy, who used 
seldom so much as to smile at other times, and who 
could never hear the greatest noise that could be 
made, would constantly look wishfully in their faces 
and laugh immoderately, which is a plain indication 
that there was then a wonderful instinct in nature, 
as I said before, which made him foretaste his good 
fortune ; and, if I may be allowed the expression, 
the dawnings, as it were, of the second-sight were 
then pregnant within him. 

To confirm this, the happy hour of his deliver- 
ance being come, and the doctor having procured 
Mr. Wallis's book, came with great joy, and desired 
to see his pupil. Scarce were the words out of his 
mouth, when the child happened to come into the 
room, and running towards the doctor, fell on his 
knees, kissed his hand eagerly, and laughed as before, 
which to me is a demonstration that he had an in- 
sight into the good which the doctor intended him. 

It is certain that several learned men, who have 
written concerning the second-sight, have demon- 
strated by incontestable proofs and undeniable argu- 
ments, that children, nay, even horses and cows, see 
the second-sight, as well as men and women ad- 

[26] 



PRECOCITY 



vanced in years. But of this I shall discourse at large 
in its proper place, having allotted a whole future 
chapter for that same subject of second-sightedness. 

In about half a year, the doctor taught his little 
dumb pupil, first to know his letters, then to name 
anything whatsoever, to leave off some savage 
motions which he had taken of his own accord before, 
to signify his mind by, and to impart his thoughts 
by his fingers and his pen, in a manner as intelligible, 
and almost as swift through the eyes, as that is of 
conveying our ideas to one another by our voices, 
through the conduits and port-holes of the ears. 
But in little more than two years, he could write 
and read as well as anybody. Because a great many 
people cannot conceive this, and others pretend it is 
not to be done in nature, I will a little discourse 
upon Dr. WalhVs foundation, and show, in a manner 
obvious to the most ignorant, how this hitherto 
mysterious help may be easily administered to the 
deaf and the dumb, which shall be the subject of 
the ensuing chapter. 

But I cannot conclude this without telling the 
handsome saying with which this child, when not 
quite six years old, as soon as he thought he could 
express himself well, paid his first acknowledgment 
to his master, and which promised how great his 
future genius was to be, when so witty a child 
ripened into man. The words he wrote to him were 
these, only altered into English from the Scotch : — 

" Sir, — It is no little work you have accom- 
plished. My thanks are too poor amends ; the 

[27] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



world, sir, shall give you thanks ; for as I could 
not have expressed myself without your teaching 
me, so those that can talk, though they have eyes, 
cannot see the things which I can see, and shall tell 
them ; so that in doing me this, you have done a 
general service to mankind." 



[28] 



CHAPTER THREE 



THE METHOD OF TEACHING DEAF AND DUMB PERSONS 
TO WRITE, READ, AND UNDERSTAND A LANGUAGE. 

IT is, I must confess, in some measure amazing 
to me, that men of any moderate share of 
learning should not naturally conceive of 
themselves a plain reason for this art, and 
know how to account for the practicability of it, the 
moment they hear the proposition advanced ; the 
reasons for it are so obvious to the very first consid- 
eration we can make about it. It will be likewise as 
amazing to me, that the most ignorant should not 
conceive it, after so plain a reason is given them for 
it as I am now going to set down. 

To begin. How are children at first taught a 
language that can hear ? Are they not taught by 
sounds ? And what are those sounds but tokens and 
signs to the ear, importing and signifying such and 
such a thing ? If, then, there can be signs made to 
the eye, agreed by the party teaching the child, that 
they signify such and such a thing, will not the eye 
of the child convey them to the mind, as well as the 
ear ? They are, indeed, different marks to different 
senses, but both the one and the other do equally 
signify the same things or notions, according to the 
will of the teacher, and consequently must have an 

[29] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



equal effect with the person who is to be instructed ; 
for though the manners of signifying are different, 
the things signified are the same. 

For example : If, after having invented an alpha- 
bet upon the fingers, a master always keeps company 
with a deaf child, and teaches it to call for whatso- 
ever it wants, by such motions of the fingers which, 
if put down by letters, according to each invented 
motion of each finger, would form in writing a word 
of a thing, which it wanted ; might not he by these 
regular motions teach its eye the same notions of 
things as sounds do to the ears of children that 
hear? The manner of teaching the alphabet by 
fingers is plainly set down in the following table. 1 

When the deaf child has learned by these motions 
a good stock of words, as children that hear first 
learn by sounds, we may methinks call not improp- 
erly the fingers of such a dumb infant its mouth, and 
the eye of such a deaf child its ear. When he has 
learned thus far, he must be taught to write the 
alphabet, according as it was adapted to the motions 
of his fingers. As for instance, the five vowels, a, e, 
i, o, m, by pointing to the top of the five fingers ; and 
the other letters, 6, c, (L &c, by such other place or 
posture of a finger, as in the above-mentioned table 
La sot forth or otherwise, as shall be agreed upon. 
When this is done, the marks B, R, E, A, D (and so 
of all other words), corresponding with such fingers, 
conveys through his eyes unto his head the same 
notion, viz., the things signified, as the sounds we

been reproduced in this edition. 

[30] 



DEAF-MUTES MAY BE TAUGHT 



give those same letters, making the word " Bread," 
do into our heads through the ears. 

This once done, he may be easily taught to under- 
stand the parts of speech, as the verb, the noun, 
pronoun, &c, and so by rules of grammar and syn- 
tax to compound ideas, and connect his words into 
a language. The method of which, since it is plainly 
set forth in Dr. Wallis's letter to Mr. Beverley, I 
shall set it down by way of extract, that people in 
the same circumstances with the person we treat of, 
and of the like genius, may not have their talents 
lost for want of the like assistance. 

When once a deaf person has learned so far as to 
understand the common discourse of others, and 
to express his mind tolerably well in writing, I see 
no room to doubt, but that (provided nature has 
endowed him with a proper strength of genius, as 
other men that hear) he may become capable, upon 
further improvement, of such further knowledge as 
is attainable by reading. For I must here join with 
the learned Dr. Wallis, in asserting (as the present 
case before us) that no reason can be assigned why 
such a deaf person may not attain the understanding 
of a language as perfectly as those that hear ; and 
with the same learned author I take upon me to lay 
down this proposition as certain, that allowing the 
deaf person the like time and exercise as to other 
men is requisite in order to attain the perfection of 
a language, and the elegance of it, he may under- 
stand as well, and write as good language as other 
men, and abating only what doth depend upon 
sound, as tones, cadences, and such punctilios, no 

[31] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



whit inferior to what he may attain to, if he had his 
hearing as others have. 

An Extract from Dr. Wallis, concerning the 
Method of teaching the Deaf and Dumb 
to read. 

It is most natural, as children learn the names of 
tilings, to furnish him, by degrees, with a nomen- 
clature, containing a competent number of names of 
things common and obvious to the eye, that you 
may show the thing answering to such a name, and 
these digested under convenient titles, and placed 
under them in such convenient order, in several 
columns, or other orderly situation in the paper, as 
by their position best to express to the eye their 
relation or respect to one another : as contraries, or 
correlatives, one against the other, subordinates or 
appurtenances under their principle, which may serve 
as a kind of local memory. 

Thus, in one paper, under the title "Mankind," 
may be placed, not confusedly, but in decent order, 
man, woman, child (boy, girl). 

In another paper, under the title " Body," may be 
written, in like convenient order, head (hair, skin, 
ear), face, forehead, eye (eyelid, eyebrow), cheek, 
nose (nostril), mouth (lip, chin), neck, throat, back, 
breast, side (right side, left side), belly, shoulders, 
arm (elbow, wrist, hand), back (palm), finger (thumb, 
knuckle, nail), thigh, knee, leg (shin, calf, ankle), 
foot (heel, sole), toe. 

And when he hath learned the import of words in 
each paper, let him write them in like manner in dis- 

[32] 



REMARKS OF DR. WALLIS 



tinct leaves or pages of a book prepared for that 
purpose, to confirm his memory, and to have recourse 
to it upon occasion. 

In a third paper you may give him the " Inward 
Parts," as skull (brain), throat (windpipe, gullet), 
stomach, guts, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, 
bladder (urine), vein (blood), bone (marrow), flesh, 
fat, &c. 

In another paper, under the title " Beast," may be 
placed horse (stone-horse, gelding, mare, colt), bull 
(ox), cow, calf. Sheep, ram (wether), ewe (lamb), 
hog, boar, sow, pig, dog (mastiff, hound, greyhound, 
spaniel), bitch (whelp, puppy), hare, rabbit, cat, 
mouse, rat, &c. 

Under the title " Bird " or " Fowl " put cock, 
capon, hen, chick, goose (gander), gosling, duck 
(drake), swan, crow, kite, lark, &c. 

Under the title " Fish " put pike, eel, plaice, sal- 
mon, lobster, crab, oyster, craw-fish, &c. 

You may then put " Plants w or " Vegetables " 
under several heads, or subdivisions of the same head ; 
as tree (root, body, bark, bough, leaf, fruit), oak, ash, 
apple-tree, pear-tree, vine, &c. " Fruit," apple, pear, 
plum, cherry, grape, nut, orange, lemon, flower, rose, 
tulip, gilliflower, herb (weed), grass, corn, wheat, bar- 
ley, rye, pea, bean. 

And the like of " Inanimates," as heaven, sun, 
moon, star, element, earth, water, air, fire ; and under 
the title " Earth," clay, sand, gravel, stone, metal, 
gold, silver, brass, copper, iron (steel), lead, tin, 
pewter, glass. Under the title " Water " put sea, 
pond, river, stream. Under that of M Air " put light, 
3 [33] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



dark, mist, fog, cloud, wind, rain, hail, snow, thunder, 
lightning, rainbow. Under that of "Fire," coal, 
flame, smoke, soot, ashes. 

Under the title " Clothes " put woollen (cloth, 
stuff), linen (Holland, lawn, lockarum), silk (satin, 
velvet), hat, cap, band, doublet, breeches, coat, cloak, 
stocking, shoe, boot, shirt, petticoat, gown, &c. 

Under the title " House," put wall, roof, door, 
window, casement, room. 

Under " Room " put shop, hall, parlour, dining- 
room, chamber, study, closet, kitchen, cellar, stable, 
&c. 

And under each of these, as distinct heads, the 
furniture or utensils belonging thereunto, with divi- 
sions and subdivisions, as there is occasion, which I 
forbear to mention, that I be not too prolix. 

And in like manner, from time to time, may be 
added more collections, or clauses of names or words, 
conveniently digested under distinct heads, and suit- 
able distributions ; to be written in distinct leaves 
or pages of his book, in such order as may seem 
convenient. 

When he is furnished with a competent number of 
names, though not so many as I have mentioned, it 
will be seasonable to teach him, under the titles 
singular and plural, the formation of plurals from 
singulars, by adding s or es ; as hand, hands ; face, 
faces ; fish, fishes, &c, with some few irregulars, as 
man, men ; woman, women ; foot, feet ; tooth, teeth ; 
mouse, mice ; louse, lice ; ox, oxen, &c. 

Which, except the irregulars, will serve for posscs- 
sives, to be after taught him, which are formed by 

[34] 



REMARKS OF DR. WALLIS 



their primitives by like addition of s or es, except 
some few irregulars, as my, mine ; thy, thine ; our, 
ours ; your, yours ; his ; her, hers ; their, theirs, &c. 

And in all those and other like cases it will be 
proper first to show him the particulars and then 
the general title. 

Then teach him in another page or paper the par- 
ticulars, a, an, the, this, that, these, those. 

And the pronouns, I, me, my, mine ; thou, thee, 
thy, thine ; we, us, our, ours ; ye, you, your, yours ; 
he, him, his ; she, her, hers ; it, its ; they, them, their, 
theirs ; who, whom, whose. 

Then, under the titles " Substantive, adjective," 
teach him to connect these, as my hand, your head ; 
his foot, his feet ; her arm, arms ; our hats ; their 
shoes, John's coat, William's band, &c. 

And in order to furnish him with more adjectives, 
under the title " Colours," you may place black, white, 
grey, green, blue, yellow, red, &c. ; and having showed 
the particulars, let him know that these are called 
colours. 

The like for taste and smell, as sweet, bitter, sour, 
stink ; and for hearing ; sound, noise, word. 

Then for touch or feeling ; hot, warm, cold, cool, 
wet, moist, dry, hard, soft, tough, brittle, heavy, 
light, &c. 

From whence you may furnish him with more 
examples of adjectives with substantives ; as white 
bread, brown bread, green grass, soft cheese, hard 
cheese, black hat, my black hat, &c. 

And then inverting the order, substantive, ad- 
jective, with the verb copulative between ; as, silver 

[35] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



is white, gold is yellow, lead is heavy, wood is light, 
snow is white, ink is black, flesh is soft, bone is hard, 
I am sick, I am not well, &c, which will begin to 
give him some notion of syntax. 

In like manner, when substantive and substantive 
are so connected ; as, gold is a metal, a rose is a 
flower, they are men, they are women, horses are 
beasts, geese are fowls, larks are birds, &c. 

Then, as those before relate to quality, you may 
give him some other words relating to quantity ; as 
long, short, broad, narrow, thick, thin, high, tall, 
low, deep, shallow, great, big, small (little), much, 
little, many, few, full, empty, whole, part, piece, all, 
some, none, strong, weak, quick, slow, equal, unequal, 
bigger, less. 

Then words of figure ; as straight, crooked, plain, 
bowed, concave, hollow, convex, round, square, three- 
square, sphere, globe, bowl, cube, die, upright, slop- 
ing, leaning forward, leaning backward, like, unlike. 

Of gesture ; as stand, lie, sit, kneel, sleep. 

Of motion ; as move, stir, rest, walk, go, come, 
run, leap, ride, fall, rise, swim, sink, drawn, slide, 
creep, crawl, fly, pull, draw, thrust, throw, bring, 
fetch, carry. 

Then words relating to time, place, number, weight, 
measure, money, &c., are in convenient time to 
be showed him distinctly ; for which the teacher, ac- 
cording to his discretion, may take a convenient 
season. 

As likewise the time of the day, the days of the 
week, the days of the month, the months of the year, 
and other things relating to the almanack, which 

[36] 



REMARKS OF DR. WALLIS 



he will quickly be capable to understand, if once 
methodically shown him. 

As likewise the names and situation of places and 
countries which are convenient for him to know, 
which may be orderly written in his book, and showed 
him in the map of London, England, Europe, the 
world, &c. 

But these mav be done at leisure, as likewise the 
practice of arithmetic, and other like pieces of learn- 
ing. 

In the meantime, after the concord of substantive 
and adjective, he is to be showed, by convenient 
examples, that of the nominative and verb ; as, for 
instance, I go, you see, he sits, they stand, the fire 
burns, the sun shines, the wind blows, the rain falls, 
the water runs, and the like, with the titles in the 
top nominative verb. 

After this (under the titles nominative verb, ac- 
cusative), give him examples of verbs transitive ; as, 
I see you, you see me, the fire burns the wood, the 
boy makes the fire, the cook roasts the meat, the 
butler lays the cloth, we eat our dinner. 

Or even with a double accusative ; as, you teach 
me writing or to write, John teacheth me to dance, 
Thomas tells me a tale, &c. 

After this, you may teach him the flexion or con- 
jugation of the verb, or what is equivalent thereunto ; 
for in our English tongue each verb hath but two 
tenses, the present and the preter ; two participles, 
the active and the passive : all the rest is performed 
by auxiliaries, which auxiliaries have no more tenses 
than the other verbs. 

[37] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



Those auxiliaries are, do, did, will, would, shall, 
should, may, might, can, could, must, ought to, have, 
had, am, be, was. And if by examples you can in- 
sinuate the signification of these few words, you have 
taught him the whole flexion of the verb. 

And here it will be convenient, once for all, to write 
him out a full paradigm of some one verb, suppose to 
see, through all those auxiliaries. 

The verb itself hath but these four words to be 
learned, see, saw, seeing, seen, save that after thou, in 
the second person singular, in both tenses, we add 
est, and in the third person singular, in the present 
tense, eth or es, or instead thereof, st, th, s, and so 
in all verbs. 

Then to the auxiliaries, do, did, will, would, shall, 
should, may, might, can, could, must, ought to, we 
join the indefinite see. And after have, had, am, 
be, was, the passive particle seen, and so for all other 
verbs. 

But the auxiliary, am or be, is somewhat irregular 
in a double form : 

Am, art, is ; plural are ; was, wast, was ; plural 
were. Be, beest, be ; plural were ; were, wert, were ; 
plural were ; 

Be, am, was, being, been ; 

Which, attended with the other auxiliaries, make 
us the whole passive voice. 

All verbs, without exceptions, in the active parti- 
ciple, are formed by adding ing, as see, seeing ; teach, 
teaching, &c. 

The preter tense and the participle are formed 
regularly, by adding ed, but are often subject to con- 

[38] 



REMARKS OF DR. WALLIS 



tractions and other irregularities, sometime the same 
in both, sometime different, and therefore it is con- 
venient here to give a table of verbs, especially the 
most usual, for those three cases, which may at once 
teach their signification and formation ; as boil, 
boiled ; roast, roasted, roasted ; bake, baked, baked, 
&c. ; teach, taught, taught ; bring, brought, brought ; 
buy, bought, bought, &c. ; see, saw, seen ; give, gave, 
given ; take, took, taken ; forsake, forsook, forsaken ; 
write, wrote, written, &c. ; with many more fit to be 
learned. 

The verbs being thus despatched, he is then to 
leam the prepositions, wherein lies the whole regimen 
of the noun. For diversity of cases we have none, 
the force of which is to be insinuated by convenient 
examples, suited to their different significations ; as 
for instance, of a piece of bread, a pint of wine, the 
colour of a pot, the colour of gold, a ring of gold, a 
cup of silver, the mayor of London, the longest of 
all, &c. 

And in like manner, for, off, on, upon, too, unto, 
till, until, from, at, in, within, out, without, into, 
out of, about, over, under, above, below, between, 
among, before, behind, after, for, by, with, through, 
against, concerning ; and by this time he will be 
pretty well enabled to understand a single sentence. 

In the last place, he is in like manner to be taught 
the conjunctions, which serve to connect not words 
only but sentences, as and, also, likewise, either, or, 
whether, neither, nor, if, then, why, wherefore, be- 
cause, therefore, but, though, yet, &c., and these 
illustrated by convenient examples in each case, as, 

[39] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



Because I am cold, therefore I go to the fire, that I 
may be warm, for it is cold weather ; 

If it were fair, then it would be good walking, but 
however, though it rain, yet I must go, because I 
promised ; with other like instances. 

And by this time his book, if well furnished with 
plenty of words, and those well digested under several 
heads, and in good order, and well recruited from 
time to time as new words occur, will serve him in 
the nature of a dictionary and grammar. 

And in case the deaf person be otherwise of a 
good natural capacity, and the teacher of a good 
sagacity, by this method, proceeding gradually step 
by step, you may, with diligence and due application 
of teacher and learner, in a year's time, or there- 
abouts, perceive a greater progress than you would 
expect, and a good foundation laid for further in- 
struction in matters of religion and other knowledge 
which may be taught by books. 

It will be convenient all along to have pen, ink, 
and paper, ready at hand, to write down in a word 
what you signify to him by signs, and cause him to 
write, or show how to write, what he signifies by 
signs, which way of signifying their mind by signs 
deaf persons are often very good at ; and we must 
endeavour to learn their language, if I may so call it, 
in order to teach them ours, by showing what words 
answer to their signs. 

It will be convenient, also, as you go along, after 
some convenient progress made, to express, in as 
plain language as may be, the import of some of the 
tables ; as, for instance, 

[40] 



ALEXANDER POPHAM 



The head is the highest part of the body, the feet 
the lowest part ; the face is the forepart of the head, 
the forehead is over the eyes, the cheeks are under the 
eyes, the nose is between the cheeks, the mouth is 
under the nose and above the chin, &c. 

And such plain discourse, put into writing, and 
particularly explained, will teach him by degrees to 
understand plain sentences ; and like advantages a 
sagacious teacher may take, as occasion offers itself 
from time to time. 

This extract is mostly taken out of the ingenious 
Dr. Wallis, and lying hid in that little book, which 
is but rarely inquired after and too scarcely known, 
died in a manner with that great man. And as he 
designed it for the general use of mankind that 
laboured under the misfortune of losing those two 
valuable talents of hearing and speaking, I thought 
it might not be amiss (in the life of so particular a 
dumb person as I am writing) to give them this small 
but particular fragment of grammar and syntax. 

It is exactly adjusted to the English tongue; be- 
cause such are the persons with whom the Doctor had 
to deal, and such the persons whose benefit alone I 
consult in this treatise. 

One of the chief persons who was taught by Dr. 
Wallis was Mr. Alexander Popham, brother-in-law 
(if I am not mistaken) to the present Earl of Oxford ; 
and he was a very great proficient in this way ; and 
though he was born deaf and dumb, understood the 
language so well as to give, under his hand, many rare 
indications of a masterly genius. 

[41], 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



The uncle of his present Sardinian Majesty, as I 
have been credibly informed, had the want of the same 
organs, and yet was a perfect statesman, and wrote in 
five or six different languages elegantly well. 

Bishop Burnet, in his book of travels, tells us a 
wonderful story, almost incredible ; but tells it as a 
passage that deserves our belief. It is concerning 
a young lady at Genoa, who was not only deaf and 
dumb, but blind, too, it seems, into the bargain ; and 
this lady, he assures us as a truth, could, by putting her 
hand on her sister's mouth, know everything she said. 

But to return back to England. We have many 
rare instances of our own countrymen, the principal 
of whom I shall mention, as their names occur to my 
memory. Sir John Gawdy, Sir Thomas Knotcliff, Sir 
[Edward] Gostwick, Sir Henry Lydall, and Mr. Rich- 
ard Lyns of Oxford, were all of this number, and yet 
eminent men in their several capacities, for under- 
standing many authors, and expressing themselves in 
writing with wonderful facility. 

In Hatton Garden, there now lives a miracle of wit 
and good nature, I mean the daughter of Mr. Loggin, 
who, though born deaf and dumb (and she has a 
brother who has the same impediments), yet writes 
her mind down upon any subject with such acuteness 
as would amaze learned men themselves, and put many 
students that have passed for wits to a blush, to see 
themselves so far surpassed by a woman amidst that 
deficiency of the common organs. If anybody speaks 
a word distinctly, this lady will, by observing narrowly 
the motion of the speaker's lips, pronounce the word 
afterwards very intelligibly. 

[42] 



ENCOURAGING EXAMPLES 

As there are a great many families in England and 
Ireland that have several, and some even have five or 
six dumb persons belonging to them, and as a great 
many more believe it impossible for persons born deaf 
and dumb to write and read, and have thence taken 
occasion to say and assert that Mr. Campbell could 
certainly speak, I could never think it a digression in 
the history of this man's life to set down the gram- 
mar by which he himself was taught, and which he 
has taught others (two of which scholars of his are 
boys of this town), partly to confute the slander made 
against him, and partly for the help of others dumb 
and deaf, whose parents may by these examples be 
encouraged to get them taught.

CHAPTER FOUR 



YOUNG DUNCAN CAMPBELL RETURNS WITH HIS MOTHER 
TO EDINBURGH. THE EARL OF ARGYLL'S OVER- 
THROW. THE RUIN OF MR. ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL, 
AND HIS DEATH. YOUNG DUNCAN^ PRACTICE IN 
PREDICTION AT EDINBURGH, WHILE YET A BOY. 

OUR young boy, now between six and seven 
i years of age, half a Highlander and half 
I a Laplander, delighted in wearing a little 
bonnet and plaid, thinking it looked 
very manly in his countrymen ; and his father, as 
soon as he was out of his hanging sleeves, and left off 
his boy's vest, indulged him with that kind of dress, 
which is truly antique and heroic. In this early part 
of his nonage he was brought to Edinburgh by his 
mother-in-law, where I myself grew afresh acquainted 
with her, his father being then but lately dead, just 
after the civil commotion, and off and on, I have 
known him ever since, and conversed with him very 
frequently during that space of time, which is now 
about three or four and thirty years ; so that what- 
ever I say concerning him in the future pages I shall 
relate to the reader from my own certain knowledge, 
which, as I resolved to continue anonymous, may not 
have so much weight and authority as if I had pre- 
fixed my name to the account. Be that as it will, 

[ 44 ] 



MONMOUTH AND ARGYLL 



there are hundreds of living witnesses that will justify 
each action I relate, and his own future actions while 
he lives will procure belief and credit to the precedent 
ones, which I am going to record ; so that if many do 
remain infidels to my relations, and will not allow 
them exact (the fate of many as credible and more 
important historians than myself), I can, however, 
venture to flatter myself that greater will be the num- 
ber of those who will have a faith in my writings than 
of those who will reject my accounts as incredible. 

Having just spoke of the decease of Mr. Archibald 
Campbell, the father of our young Duncan Camp- 
bell, it will not be amiss here to observe how true 
the predictions of his Lapland mother were, which 
arose from second sight, according to the notices 
given by the child's father, to his grandfather, in his 
letter from Lapland, even before it was born, which 
shows that the infant held this second -sighted power, 
or occult faculty of divination, even by inheritance. 

In the year 1685, the Duke of Monmouth and the 
Earl of Argyll sailed out of the ports of Holland 
without any obstruction, the Earl of Argyll in May, 
with three ships for Scotland, and Monmouth in 
June with the same number for England. 

The earl setting out first was also the first at 
landing. Argyll having attempted to land in the 
north of Scotland, and being disappointed by the 
vigilance of the Bishop of the Orcades, landed in 
the west, and encamped at Dunstaffhage Castle, 
in the province of Lorne, which had belonged to 
him. He omitted nothing that might draw over 
to him all the malcontents in the kingdom, whom 

[45] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



he thought more numerous than they afterwards 
appeared to be. He dispersed about his declara- 
tions, wherein, after protesting that he had taken 
up arms only in defence of religion and the laws, 
against an unjust usurper (so he styled James the 
Second), he invited all good Protestants, and such 
Scotch as would assert the liberty to join him 
against a prince, he said, who was got into the 
throne to ruin the Reformation, and to bring in 
Popery and arbitrary power. Next he sent letters 
to those he thought his friends, among whom was 
Mr. Archibald Campbell, who, according to the vast 
deference paid by the Scots to their chief, joined 
him, though in his heart of quite a different prin- 
ciple, to call them to his assistance. He detached 
two of his sons to make inroads in the neighbour- 
hood, and compel some by threats, others by mighty 
promises, to join him. All his contrivances could 
not raise him above three thousand men, with 
whom he encamped in the Isle of Bute, where he 
was soon, in a manner, besieged by the Earl of 
Dumbarton with the king's forces, and several 
other bodies, commanded by the Duke of Gordon, 
the Marquis of Athole, the Earl of Arran, and 
other great men, who came from all parts to quench 
the fire before it grew to a head. 

The Earl of Argyll being obliged to quit a post 
he could not make good, went over into a part of the 
country of his own name, where having hastily forti- 
fied a castle called Ellangreig, he put into it the arms 
and ammunition taken out of his ships, which lay at 
anchor under the cannon of a fort he erected near 

[46] 



FLIGHT OF ARGYLL 



that place. There his rout began, for going out from 
the castle with his forces to make an incursion, one 
of his parties was defeated by the Marquis of Athole, 
who slew four hundred of his men, and Captain 
Hamilton, who attacked his ships with some of the 
king's and took them without any resistance. 

The Earl of Dumbarton advancing towards him, 
at the same time, by long marches, while he en- 
deavoured to secure himself by rivers, surprised him 
passing the Clyde, in the village of Killern, as he 
was marching towards Lennox. Dumbarton coming 
upon them at night, would have stayed till the next 
day to attack the rebels, but they gave him not so 
much time, for they passed the river in the night, in 
such confusion, that being overcome with fear, they 
dispersed as soon as over. Argyll could scarcely 
rally so many as would make him a small guard, 
which was soon scattered again, Dumbarton having 
passed the river, and divided his forces to pursue 
those that fled. Argyll had taken guides to con- 
duct him to Galloway, but they mistaking their 
way, and leading him into a bog, most of those that 
still followed him quitted their horses, every man 
shifting for himself. 

Argyll himself was making back alone towards the 
Clyde, when two resolute servants, belonging to an 
officer in the king's army, meeting him, though they 
knew him not, bid him surrender. He fired at and 
missed them ; but they took better aim, and wounded 
him with a pistol ball. Then the earl, drawing his 
two pistols out of the holsters, quitted his horse, that 
was quite tired, and took the river. A country fellow, 

[47]

who came with those two that had first assaulted 
him, pursued him with a pistol in his hand. The 
earl would have fired one of his, but the flint failing, 
he was dangerously wounded in the head by the 
peasant. He discovered himself, as he fell senseless, 
crying out, u Unfortunate Argyll.'" This nobleman, 
how far soeVer he may be thought misled in principle, 
was certainly in his person a very brave and a very 
gallant hero. They made haste to draw him out 
and bring him to himself ; after which, being delivered 
up to the officers, the erring, unfortunate great man 
was conducted to Edinburgh and there beheaded. 

Many gentlemen that followed the fortunes of this 
great man, though not in his death, they shared in 
all the other calamities attending his overthrow. 
They most of them fled into the remotest isles and 
the obscurest cornel's of all Scotland ; contented 
with the saving of their lives, they grew exiles and 
banished men of their own making, and abdicated 
their estates before they were known to be forfeited, 
because, for fear of being informed against by the 
common fellows they commanded, they durst not 
appear to lay their claims. Of this number was Mr. 
Archibald Campbell, and this new disaster wounded 
him deeply into the very heart, after so many late 
misadventures, and sent him untimely to the grave. 
He perfectly pined away and wasted ; he was six 
months dying inch by inch, and the difference be- 
tween his last breath and his way of breathing dur- 
ing all that time, was only that he expired with a 
greater sigh than he ordinarily fetched every time 
when he drew his breath.

SECOND-SIGHT 



Everything the Lapland lady had predicted so 
long before being thus come to pass, we may the 
less admire at the wonders performed by her son, 
when we consider this faculty of divination to be so 
derived to him from her, and grown, as it were, 
hereditary. 

Our young prophet, who had taught most of his 
little companions to converse with him by finger, was 
the head at every little pastime and game they played 
at. Marbles (which he used to call children's play- 
ing at bowls) yielded him mighty diversion ; and he 
was so dexterous an artist at shooting that little 
alabaster globe from between the end of his fore- 
finger and the knuckle of his thumb, that he seldom 
missed hitting plumb (as the boys call it) the marble 
he aimed at, though at the distance of two or three 
yards. The boys always when they played coveted 
to have him on their side, and by hearing that he 
foretold other things, used to consult him when they 
made their little matches (which were things of great 
importance in their thoughts), who should get the 
victory. He used commonly to leave these trifles 
undecided ; but if ever he gave his opinion in these 
trivial affairs, the persons fared well by their con- 
sultation, for his judgment about them was like a 
petty oracle, and the end always answered his pre- 
diction. But I would have my reader imagine, that 
though our Duncan Campbell was himself but a 
boy, he was not consulted only by boys ; his pene- 
tration and insight into things of a high nature got 
air, and being attested by credible witnesses, won him 
the esteem of persons of mature years and discretion.

MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



If a beautiful young virgin languished for a hus- 
band, or a widow's mind was in labour to have a 
second venture of infants by another spouse; if a 
housekeeper had lost anything belonging to her mas- 
ter, still little Duncan Campbell was at hand. He 
was the oracle to be applied to ; and the little 
chalked circle, where he was diverting himself with 
his playfellows, near the cross at Edinburgh, was 
frequented with as much solicitation, and as much 
credit, as the Tripos of Apollo was at Delphos in 
ancient times. 

It was highly entertaining to see a young blooming 
beauty come and slyly pick up the boy from his com- 
pany, carry him home with as much eagerness as she 
would her gallant, because she knew she could get 
the name of her gallant out of him before he went, 
and bribe him with a sugar-plum to write down the 
name of a young Scotch peer in a green ribbon that 
her mouth watered after. 

How often, after he has been wallowing in the dust, 
have I myself seen nice squeamish widows help him 
up in their gilded chariots, and give him a pleasant 
ride with them, that he might tell them they should 
not long lie alone ! Little Duncan Campbell had aa 
much business upon his hands as the parsons of all 
the parishes in Edinburgh. He commonly was con- 
sulted, and named the couples before the minister 
joined them ; thus he grew a rare customer to the 
toy-shop, from whence he most usually received fees 
and rewards for his advices. If Lady Betty Such-a- 
one was foretold that she should certainly have Beau 
Such-a-one in marriage, then little Duncan was sure 

[50] 



DUNCANS PREDICTIONS 



to have a hobby-horse from the toy-shop, as a reward 
for the promised fop. If such a widow, that was 
ugly but very rich, was to be pushed hard for, as 
she pretended (though in reality easily won), little 
Duncan, upon ensuring her such a captain, or such a 
lieutenant-colonel, was sure to be presented from the 
same child's warehouse with a very handsome drum 
and a silvered trumpet. 

If a sempstress had an itching desire for a parson, 
she would, upon the first assurance of him, give this 
little Apollo a pasteboard temple or church, finely- 
painted, and a ring of bells into the bargain, from 
the same toy-office. 

If a housekeeper lost any plate, the thief was cer- 
tain to be catched, provided she took little master 
into the store-room, and asked him the question, 
after she had given him his bellyful of sweetmeats. 

Neither were the women only his consulters : the 
grave merchants, who were anxious for many ven- 
tures at sea, applied to the boy for his opinion of 
their security ; and they looked upon his opinion to 
be as safe as the insurance office for ships. If he 
but told them, though the ship was just set sail, and 
a tempest rose just after on the ocean, that it would 
have a successful voyage, gain the port designed, and 
return home safe laden with the exchange of traffic 
and merchandise, they dismissed all their fears, 
banished all their cares, set their hearts at ease, and 
safe in his opinion enjoyed a calm of mind amidst a 
storm of weather. 

I myself knew one Count Cog, an eminent game- 
ster, who was a person so far from being of a credu- 

[51] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

lous disposition, that he was an unbeliever in several 
points of religion, and the next door to an infidel. 
Yet as much as he was a stranger to faith, he was 
mastered and overpowered so far in his incredulity 
by the strange events which he had seen come fre- 
quently to pass, from the predictions of this child, 
that he had commonly daily access to this boy, to 
learn his more adverse and more prosperous hours 
of gaming. At first, indeed, he would try, when the 
child foretold him his ill fortune, whether it would 
prove true ; and, relying upon the mere hazard and 
turn of the dice, he had always (as he observed) a 
run of ill luck on those forbidden days, as he never 
failed of good if he chose the fortunate hours directed 
by the boy. One time, above all the rest, just before 
he was departing from Edinburgh, and when the 
season of gaming was almost over, most persons of 
wealth and distinction withdrawing for pleasure to 
their seats in the country, he came to young Duncan 
Campbell to consult, and was extremely solicitous to 
know how happily or unluckily he should end that 
term (as we may call it) of the gamester's weighty 
business, viz., play, there being a long vacation likely 
to ensue, when the gaming-table would be empty, 
and the box and dice lie idle and cease to rattle. 
The boy encouraged him so well with his predictions 
on this occasion, that Count Cog went to the toy- 
shop, brought him from thence a very fine ivory 
teetotum (as children call it), a pretty set of painted 
and gilded ninepins and a bowl, and a large bag of 
marbles and alloys. And what do you think the 
gamester got by this little present and the predic- 

[52] 



COUNT COG A WINNER 



tion of the boy ? Why, without telling the least 
tittle of falsehood, within the space of the last week's 
play, the gains of Count Cog really amounted to no 
less than twenty thousand pounds sterling, neat 
money. 

Having mentioned these persons of so many differ- 
ent professions by borrowed names, and perhaps in a 
manner seemingly ludicrous, I would not have my 
reader from hence take occasion of looking upon my 
account as fabulous. If I was not to make use of 
borrowed names, but to tell the real characters and 
names of the persons, I should do injury to those 
old friends of his who first gave credit to our young 
seer, while I am endeavouring to gain him the credit 
and esteem of new ones, in whose way it has not 
yet happened to consult him. For many persons 
are very willing to ask such questions as the fore- 
going ones, but few or none willing to have the 
public told they ask them, though they succeeded 
in their wish, and were amply satisfied in their curi- 
osity. I have represented them, perhaps, in a ludi- 
crous manner, because, though they are mysterious 
actions, they are still the actions of a boy ; and as 
the rewards he received for his advices did really and 
truly consist of such toys as I have mentioned, so 
could they not be treated of in a more serious man- 
ner, without the author's incurring a magisterial air 
of pedantry, and showing a mind, as it were, of 
being mighty grave and sententious about trifles. 
There are, however, some things of greater weight 
and importance done by him in a more advanced 
stage of life, which will be delivered to the public 

[53] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



-with that exactitude and gravity which becomes 
them ; and in some of those relations the names oi 
some persons that are concerned shall be printed, 
because it will not at all be injurious to them, or 
because I have their leave, and they are still living 
to testify what I shall relate. 

In the meantime, as the greatest part of his non- 
age was spent in predicting almost innumerable 
tilings, which are all, however, reduced to the general 
heads above-mentioned, I will not tire the reader 
with any particulars ; but instead of doing that, be- 
fore I come to show his power of divination in the 
more active parts of his life, and when, after removing 
from Edinburgh to London, he at last made it his 
public profession, I shall account how such divin- 
ations may be made, and divert the reader with 
many rare examples (taken from several faithful and 
undoubted historians) of persons who have done the 
like before him, some in one way, and some in 
another ; though in these he seems to be peculiar, 
and to be (if I may be allowed the expression) a 
species by himself, alone in the talent of prediction ; 
that he has collected within his own individual 
capacity all the methods which others severally used, 
and with which they were differently and singly 
gifted in their several ways of foreseeing and fore- 
telling. 

This art of prediction is not attainable any other- 
wise than by these three ways : First, it is done by 
the company of familiar spirits and genii, which are 
of two sorts, some good and some bad, who tell the 
gifted person the things of which he informs other 

[54] 



DIVINATION THREEFOLD 



people. Secondly, it is performed by the second- 
sight, which is very various, and differs in most of the 
possessors, it being but a very little in some, very 
extensive and constant in others ; beginning with 
some in their infancy, and leaving them before they 
come to years ; happening to others in a middle age ; 
to others again in an old age that never had it be- 
fore, and lasting only for a term of years, and now 
and then for a very short period of time ; and in 
some intermitting, like fits, as it were, of vision, that 
leave them for a time, and then return to be as 
strong in them as ever ; and it being in a manner 
hereditary to some families, whose children have it 
from their infancy, without intermission, to a great 
old age, and even to the time of their death, which 
they often foretold, before it came to pass, to a day, 
nay even to an hour. Thirdly, it is attained by the 
diligent study of the lawful part of the art of magic. 

Before I give the reader an account (as I shall do 
in three distinct discourses), first, concerning the 
intercourse which familiar spirits, viz., the good 
and bad genii, have had and continue to have, to a 
great degree, with some select parts of mankind ; 
secondly, concerning the wonderful and almost mi- 
raculous power of a second-sight, with which many, 
beyond all controversy, have been extraordinarily 
but visibly gifted ; and thirdly, concerning the 
pitch of perfection to which the magic science has 
been carried and promoted by some adepts in that 
mysterious art, I will premise a few particulars about 
the genii which attended our little Duncan Campbell, 
and about the second-sight which he had when yet 

[55] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



a child, and when we may much more easily believe 
that the wonders he performed and wrote of must have 
been rather brought about by the intervention of 
such genii and the mediation of such a sight than 
that he could have invented such fables concerning 
them, and compassed such predictions as seemed to 
want their assistance by the mere dint of a child's 
capacity. 

One day, I remember, when he was about nine 
years of age, going early to the house where he and 
his mother lived, and it being before his mother was 
stirring, I went into little Duncan Campbell's room, 
to divert myself with him. I found him sitting up 
in his bed, with his eyes broad open, but as motion- 
less as if he had been asleep, or even (if it had not 
been for a lively beautiful colour which the pretty 
fair silver-haired boy always had in his cheeks) as if 
he had been quite dead ; he did not seem so much 
as to breathe ; the eyelids of him were so fixed and 
immovable, that the eyelashes did not so much as 
once shake, which the least motion imaginable must 
agitate ; not to say that he was like a person in an 
ecstasy, he was at least in what we commonly call 
a brown study to the highest degree, and for the 
largest space of time I ever knew. I, who had been 
frequently informed by people who have been present 
at the operations of second-sighted persons, that, at 
the sight of a vision, the eyelids of the person are 
erected, and the eyes continue staring till the object 
vanishes, I, I say, sat myself softly down on his bedside, 
and with a quiet amazement observed him, avoiding 
diligently any motion that might give him the least 

[56] 



DUNCAN ENTRANCED 



disturbance, or cause in him any avocation or distrac- 
tion of mind from the business he was so intent upon. 
I remarked that he held his head sideways, with his 
mouth wide open and in a listening posture, and that 
after so lively a manner, as, at first general thought, 
made me forget his deafness, and plainly imagine he 
heard something, till the second thought of reflection 
brought into my mind the misfortune that shut up 
all passage for any sound through his ears. After 
a steadfast gaze, which lasted about seven minutes, 
he smiled, and stretched his arms, as one recovering 
from a fit of indolence, and rubbed his eyes ; then 
turning towards me, he made the sign of a salute, 
and hinted to me, upon his fingers, his desire for pen, 
ink, and paper, which I reached him from a little 
desk that stood at his bed's foot. 

Placing the paper upon his knees, he wrote me the 
following lines, which, together with my answers, I 
preserve by me, for their rarity, to this very day, and 
which I have transcribed word for word, as they form 
a little series of dialogue. 

Duncan Campbell — "I am sorry I cannot stay 
with you, but I shall see my pretty youth and my 
lamb by-and-by in the fields, near a little coppice, or 
grove, where I go often to play with them; and I 
would not lose their company for the whole world ; for 
they and I are mighty familiar together, and the boy 
tells me everything, that gets me my reputation among 
the ladies and nobility, and you must keep it secret. 1 "' 

My question — "I will be sure to keep it secret. 
But how do you know you are to meet them there 
to-day ? Did the little boy appoint you ? " 

[57] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



Duncan Campbell — " Yes, he did, and signified 
that he had several things to predict to me concern- 
ing people that he foreknew would come to me the 
week following to ask me questions." 

My question — " But what was you staring at when 
I came in ? " 

Duncan Campbell — " Why, at that little boy, 
that goes along with the lamb I speak of, and it was 
then he made me the appointment." 

My question — " How does he do it ? Does he 
write?" 

Duncan Campbell — " No, he writes sometimes ; 
but oftener he speaks with his fingers, and mighty 
swift ; no man can do it so quick, or write half so 
soon ; he has a little bell in his hand, like that which 
my mother makes me a sign to shake when she wants 
the servants ; with that he tickles my brain most 
strangely, and gives me an incredible delight in feel- 
ing in the inside of my head ; he usually wakes me 
with it in the morning, when he comes to make me 
an appointment. I fancy 't is what you call hearing, 
which makes me mighty desirous I could hear in your 
way ; 'tis sweeter to the feeling, methinks, than any- 
thing is to the taste ; it is just as if my head was 
tickled to death, as my nurse used to tickle my sides ; 
but it is a different feeling, for it makes things like 
little strings tremble in my temples, and behind my 
ears. Now I remember, I will tell you what 't is like, 
that makes me believe it is like your hearing, and that 
strange thing, which you that can speak call sound, or 
noise; because, when I was at church with my mother, 
who told me the bells could be heard ringing a mile 

[58] 



A BOY AND A LAMB 



off, as I was kneeling on the bench, and leaning over 
the top of the pew, and gnawing the board, every 
time the man pulled the rope, I thought all my head 
beat, as if it would come to pieces ; but yet it pleased 
me, methought, rather than pained me, and I would 
be always gnawing the board when the man pulled the 
rope, and I told my mother the reason. The feeling 
of that was something like the little bell, but only 
that made my head throb, as if it would break, and 
this tickles me, and makes, as it were, little strings 
on the back of my ears dance and tremble like any- 
thing ; is not that like your way of hearing ? If it 
be, it is a sweet thing to hear ; it is more pleasant 
than to see the finest colours in the world ; it is some- 
thing like being tickled in the nose with a feather till 
one sneezes ; or like the feeling after one strikes the 
leg when it has been numb, or asleep, only with this 
difference, that those two ways give a pain and the 
other a pleasure. I remember, too, when I had a great 
cold, for about two months, I had a feeling something 
like it, but that was blunt, dull, confused, and trouble- 
some. Is not this like what you call hearing ? " 

My question — u It is the finest kind of hearing, 
my dear ; it is what we call music. But what sort 
of a boy is that that meets you ? and what sort of 
a lamb?" 

Duncan Campbell — " Oh ! though they are like 
other boys and lambs which you see, they are a thou- 
sand times prettier and finer. You never saw such a 
boy nor such a lamb in your lifetime." 

My question — " How big is he ? As big as you 
are ? And what sort of a boy is he ? " 

[59] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

Duncan Campbell — " He is a little pretty boy, about 
as tall as my knee ; his face is as white as snow, and so 
are his little hands ; his cheeks are as red as a cherry, 
and so are his lips ; and, when he breathes, it makes 
the air more perfumed than my mother's sweet bags 
that she puts among the linen ; he has got a crown 
of roses, cowslips, and other flowers, upon his head, 
such as the maids gather in May ; his hair is like fine 
silver threads, and shine like the beams of the sun ; 
he wears a loose veil down to his feet, that is as blue 
as the sky in a clear day, and embroidered with 
spangles that look like the brightest stars in the 
night ; he carries a silver bell in one hand, and a book 
and pencil in the other ; and he and the little lamb 
will dance and leap about me in a ring as high as my 
head. The lamb has got a little silver collar, with 
nine little bells upon it ; and every little piece of wool 
upon its back, that is as white as milk, is tied up all 
round it in puffs like a little miss's hair, with ribbons 
of all colours ; and round its head, too, are little roses 
and violets stuck very thick in the wool that grows 
upon its forehead, and behind and between its ears, 
in the shape of a diadem. They first meet me danc- 
ing thus ; and after they have danced some time, the 
little boy writes down wonderful things in his book, 
which I write down in mine ; then they dance again, 
till he rings his bell, and then they are gone all of a 
sudden, I know not where ; but I feel the tickling in 
the inside of my head, caused by the bell, less and 
less, till I don't feel it at all ; and then I go home, 
read over my lesson in my book, and when I have it 
by heart, I burn the written leaves, according as the 

[60] 



THE AUTHOR PROTESTS 



little boy bids me, or he would let me have no more. 
But I hear the little bell again ; the little boy is 
angry with me, he pulled me twice by the ear, and I 
would not displease him for anything ; so I must get 
up and go immediately to the joy and delight of my 
life." 

I told him he might, if he would promise me to 
tell me further another time ; he said he would if I 
would keep it secret. I told him I would, and so we 
parted ; though just before he went, he said he 
smelt some venison, and he was sure they would 
shortly have some for dinner ; and nothing was so 
sure as that my man had my orders to bring a side 
of venison to me the next day to Mrs. Campbell's, 
for I had been hunting, and came thither from the 
death of a deer that morning, and intended, as 
usual, to make a stay there for two or three days. 

There are, I know, many men of severe principles, 
and who are more strict, grave, and formal in their 
manner of thinking than they are wise, who will be 
apt to judge of these relations as things merely 
fabulous and chimerical, and, not contented with 
being disbelievers themselves, will labour to insinuate 
into others this pernicious notion, that it is a sign of 
infirmity and weakness of the head to yield them 
credit. But though I could easily argue these Sir 
Gravities down — though a sentence or two would 
do their business, put them beyond the power of 
replying, and strike them dumb — yet do I not think 
it worth my while ; their greatest and most wonted 
objection to these Eudemons and Kakodemons being, 
that it arises all from the work of fancy, in persons 

[61] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



of a melancholic blood. If we consider the nature 
of this child's dialogue with me, will it not be more 
whimsically strange and miraculous to say that a 
child of nine years old had only a fancy of such 
things as these, of which it had never heard anybody 
give an account, and that it could, by the mere 
strength of imagination, predict such things as 
really after came to pass, than it is (when it does so 
strangely predict things) to believe the child does it 
in the manner itself owns it does, which is by the 
intervention of a good demon, or happy genius. 
Departing, therefore, from these singular wise men's 
opinions, who will believe nothing excellent can 
happen to others which it has not been their lot to 
enjoy a share of, I shall take my farewell hastily of 
them, without losing my own time or theirs, in the 
words of the ingenious and learned Monsieur Le 
Clerc : — " Acerbos homines non moror, indignos 
quippe, qui haec studia tractent, aut quorum judicii 
ulla ratio habeatur." 

I shall rather see how these things have lain open 
to the eyes of, and been explained by the ancient 
sages ; I will relate who among them were happy in 
their genii, and who among the moderns, whose 
examples may be authorities for our belief; I will 
set down, as clearly as I can, what perception men 
have had of genii, or spirits, by the sense of seeing ; 
what by the sense of hearing, what by the sense of 
feeling, touching, or tasting ; and, in fine, what percep- 
tion others have had of these genii by all the senses, 
what by dreams and what by magic, a thing rarely to 
be met with at once in any single man, and which 

[62] 



LOOKING BACKWARD 



seems particular to the child, who was the subject 
of our last little historical account. When I have 
brought examples, and the opinions of wise philos- 
ophers, and the evidence of undeniable witnesses, 
which one would think sufficient to evince persons 
of the commerce men have with spirits, if they were 
not past all sense of conviction, I shall, not so much 
to corroborate what I say as to shame some wise- 
acres, who would by their frail reason scan all 
things, and pretend to solve the mysteries ascribed 
to spirits as facts merely natural, and who would 
banish from the thoughts of men all belief of spirits 
whatsoever, — I shall, I say, in order to put to shame 
these wiseacres, if they have any shame left, produce 
the opinions of the fathers, as divines, show the 
doctrines of spirits in general to be consistent with 
Christianity, that they are delivered in the Scripture 
and by Christian tradition ; in which, if they will 
not acquiesce, I shall leave them to the labyrinth of 
their own wild opinions, which in the end will so 
perplex their judgments of things, that they will be 
never able to extricate themselves ; and these differ- 
ent heads will be the subject of the chapter ensuing, 
and will, or I am greatly mistaken, form both an 
instructive, edifying, and entertaining discourse, for 
a reader really and truly intelligent, and that has a 
good taste and relish for sublime things. 



[63] 



CHAPTER FIVE 



AN ARGUMENT PROVING THE PERCEPTION WHICH MEN 
HAVE, AND HAVE HAD, BY ALL THE SENSES, AS 
SEEING, HEARING, ETC., OF DEMONS, GENII, OR 
FAMILIAR SPIRITS. 

IT is said in the ninth book of the Morals of 
Aristotle, it is better to come at the probable 
knowledge of some things above us in the 
heavens, than to be capable of giving many 
demonstrations relating to things here below. This 
is no doubt an admirable proposition, and speaks 
the lofty aims of that sublime mind from whence it 
proceeded. Among all the disquisitions in this kind, 
none seem to me more excellent than those which 
treat concerning the genii that attend upon men, 
and guide them in the actions of life. A genius or 
demon of the good kind, is a sort of mediate being, 
between human and divine, which gives the mind of 
man a pleasant conjunction with the angelic and 
celestial faculties, and brings down to earth a faint 
participation of the joys of heaven. That there 
have been such fortunate attendants upon wise men 
we have many rare instances ; they have been as- 
cribed to Socrates, Aristotle, Plotinus, Porphyrius, 
Jamblicus, Chicus, Scaliger, and Cardan. The most 
celebrated of all these ancients was Socrates ; and 

164] 



THE DEMON OF SOCRATES 



as for his having a genius, or demon, we have the 
testimonies of Plato, Xenophon, and Antisthenes, 
his contemporaries, confirmed by Laertius, Plutarch, 
Maximus, Tyrius, Dion, Chrysostomus, Cicero, Apu- 
leius, Ficinus, and others, many of the moderns, 
besides Tertullian, Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus, 
Austin, and others ; and Socrates himself, in " Plato's 
Triage," says, " By some divine lot I have a certain 
demon, which has followed me from my childhood as 
an oracle," and in the same place intimates that the 
way he gained his instruction was by hearing the 
demon's voice. Nothing is certainly so easy as for 
men to be able to contradict things, though never so 
well attested with such an air of truth, as to make 
the truth of the history doubted by others as well 
as themselves, where no demonstrative proof can 
be brought to convince them. This has been the 
easy task of those who object against the demon of 
Socrates; but when no demonstrative proof is to 
be had on either side, does not wisdom incline us 
to lead to the most probable ? Let us then consider 
whether the evidences are not more credible, and 
witnesses of such a thing are not persons of more 
authority than these men are, who vouchsafe to give 
no reason but their own incredulity for maintaining 
the contrary, and whether those therefore, by the 
right rule of judging, ought not much sooner than 
these, to gain over our assent to their assertions. 

We will, however, laying aside the histories of 
those ancient times, the sense whereof, by various 
readings and interpretations being put upon the 
words, is rendered obscure and almost unintelligible,

descend to more modern relations, the facts whereof 
shall be placed beyond doubt, by reason of the 
evidences we will bring to attest them, and shall 
consequently prove the perception men have of 
spirits, or genii, by every sense. 

Section I. 

We will first begin as to the perception of spirits 
by the sight. 

Mr. Glanvil, in his collections of relations for prov- 
ing apparitions, spirits, &c, tells us of an Irishman 
that had like to have been carried away by spirits, 
and of the ghost of a man who had been seven years 
dead, that brought a medicine to his bedside. 

The relation is thus : 

A gentleman in Ireland, near to the Earl of 
Orrery^, sending his butler one afternoon to buy 
c ards ; as he passed a field, to his wonder, he espied 
a company of people sitting round a table, with a 
deal of good cheer before them, in the midst of the 
field ; and he going up towards them they all arose 
and saluted him, and desired him to sit down with 
them ; but one of them whispered these words into 
his ear: — "Do nothing this company invites you 
to.*" Hereupon he refused to sit down at the table, 
and immediately table and all that belonged to it 
were gone, and the company were now dancing and 
playing upon musical instruments ; and the butler 
being desired to join himself with them, but he re- 
fusing this also, they all fall to work, and he not 
being to be prevailed with, to accompany them in 
working, any more than in feasting or dancing, they 

[66] 



A BUTLER KIDNAPPED 



all disappeared, and the butler is now alone ; but 
instead of going forwards, home he returns, as fast 
as he could drive, in a great consternation, and was 
no sooner entered his master's door but he fell down, 
and lay some time senseless ; but coming again to 
himself, he related to his master what had passed. 

The night following there comes one of his com- 
pany to his bedside and tells him, that if he offered 
to stir out of doors the next day he would be carried 
away. Hereupon he kept within ; but towards the 
evening, having occasion to make water, he adven- 
tured to put one foot over the threshold, several 
standing by, which he had no sooner done, but they 
espied a rope cast about his middle ; and the poor 
man was hurried away with great swiftness, they 
following him as fast as they could, but could not 
overtake him. At length they espied a horseman 
coming towards him, and made signs to him to stop 
the man whom he saw coming near him, and both 
ends of the rope, but nobody drawing ; when they 
met, he laid hold of one end of the rope, and im- 
mediately had a smart blow given him over his arm 
with the other end ; but by this means the man was 
stopped, and the horseman brought him back with 
him. 

The Earl of Orrery, hearing of these strange pas- 
sages, sent to the master to desire him to send this 
man to his house, which he accordingly did ; and 
the morning following, or quickly after, he told the 
earl that his spectre had been with him again, and 
assured him that that day he should most certainly 
be carried away, and that no endeavours should avail 

[67] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



to the saving of him. Upon this he was kept in a 
large room, with a considerable number of persons 
to guard him, among whom was the famous stroker, 
Mr. Greatrix, who was a neighbour. There were, 
besides other persons of quality, two bishops in the 
house at the same time, who were consulted concern- 
ing the making use of a medicine the spectre, or 
ghost prescribed, of which mention will be made 
anon, but they determined on the negative. 

Till part of the afternoon was spent, all was quiet ; 
but at length he was perceived to rise from the ground, 
whereupon Mr. Greatrix, and another lusty man, 
clapt their arms over his shoulders, one of them be- 
fore him, the other behind him, and weighed him 
down with all their strength ; but he was forcibly 
taken up from them, and they were too weak to keep 
their hold, and for a considerable time he was carried 
into the air, to and fro over their heads, several of the 
company still running under him to prevent his re- 
ceiving hurt, if he should fall ; at length he fell, and 
was caught before he came to the ground, and he had 
by that means no hurt. 

All being quiet till bed-time, my lord ordered two 
of his servants to lie with him, and the next morning 
he told his lordship that his spectre was again with 
him, and brought a wooden dish, with grey liquor in 
it, and bid him drink it off. At the first sight of the 
spectre, he said that he endeavoured to awake his bed- 
fellows, but it told him that that endeavour should 
be in vain, and that he had no cause to fear him, he 
being his friend, and that he had at first given him 
the good advice in the field, which had he not fol- 

[68] 



A MEDICAL GHOST 



jowed, he had been before now perfectly in the power 
cf the company he saw there ; he added, that he con- 
cluded it was impossible but that he should have 
been carried away the day before, there being so 
strong a combination against him ; but now he could 
assure him, there would be more attempts of that 
nature ; but he being troubled with two sorts of sad 
fits, he had brought that liquor to cure him of them, 
and bid him drink it. He peremptorily refusing, the 
spectre was angry, and upbraided him with great dis- 
ingenuity, but told him, however, he had a kindness 
for him, and that if he would take plantain juice, he 
should be well of one sort of fits, but he should carry 
the other to his grave. The poor man having by 
this somewhat recovered himself, asked the spectre 
whether by the juice of plantain he meant that of 
the leaves or roots ; it replied, the roots. 

Then it asked him whether he did not know him. 
He answered, No. It replied, I am such a one. The 
man answered, he had been long dead. " I have been 
dead," said the spectre, or ghost, " seven years, and 
you know that I lived a loose life ; and ever since 
I have been hurried up and down in a restless con- 
dition with the company you saw, and shall be to the 
day of judgment. " Then he proceeded to tell him, 
that had he acknowledged God in his ways, he had 
not suffered such severe things by their means ; and 
further said, " You never prayed to God that day, 
before you met with this company in the fields.'' 1 

This relation was sent to Dr. Henry More by Mr. 
E. Fowler, who said Mr. Greatrix told it several 
persons. The Lord Orrery also owned the truth of 

[69] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



it ; and Mr. Greatrix told it to Dr. Henry More him- 
self, who particularly inquired of Mr. Greatrix about 
the man's being carried up into the air, above men's 
heads in the room, and he did expressly affirm that 
he was an eye-witness thereof. 

A vision which happened to the ingenious and 
learned Dr. Donne may not improperly be here in- 
serted. Mr. Isaac Walton, writing the life of the 
said doctor, tells us, that the doctor and his wife 
were living with Sir Robert Drury, who gave them 
a free entertainment at his house in Drury Lane. 
It happened that the Lord Haye was by King James 
sent in an embassy to the French king, Henry IV., 
whom Sir Robert resolved to accompany, and engaged 
Dr. Donne to go with them, whose wife was then with 
child at Sir Robert's house. Two days after their 
arrival at Paris, Dr. Donne was left alone in that 
room in which Sir Robert and he and some other 
friends had dined together. To this place Sir Robert 
returned within half-an-hour, and as he left so he 
found Dr. Donne, alone, but in such an ecstasy, and 
so altered in his looks, as amazed Sir Robert to be- 
hold him, insomuch that he earnestly desired Dr. 
Donne to declare what had befallen him in the short 
time of his absence, to which Dr. Donne was not able 
to make a present answer ; but after a long and per- 
plexed pause, did at last say, " I have seen a dreadful 
vision since I saw you ; I have seen my dear wife pass 
twice by me through this room, with her hair hang- 
ing about her shoulders, and a dead child in her arms ; 
this I have seen since I saw you." To which Sir Robert 
replied, " Sure, sir, you have slept since I saw you, 

[70] ^ 

# 



DR. DONNE'S VISION 

and this is the result of some melancholy dream, 
which I desire you to forget, for you are now awake." 
To which Dr. Donne's reply was, " I cannot be surer 
that I am now alive than that I have not slept since 
I saw you, and am as sure, at her second appearing, 
she stopped and looked at me in the face, and van- 
ished." Rest and sleep had not altered Dr. Donne's 
opinion on the next day ; for he then affirmed this 
vision with a more deliberate and so confirmed a con- 
fidence, that he inclined Sir Robert to a faint belief 
that the vision was true, who immediately sent a ser- 
vant to Drury House, with a charge to hasten back 
and bring him word whether Mrs. Donne were alive ; 
and if alive, what condition she was in as to her 
health. The twelfth day, the messenger returned 
with this account ; that he found and left Mrs. 
Donne very sad and sick in bed, and that after a 
long and dangerous labour, she had been delivered 
of a dead child ; and upon examination, the abortion 
proved to be the same day, and about the very hour, 
that Dr. Donne affirmed he saw her pass by in his 
chamber. Mr. Walton adds this as a relation which 
will beget some wonder, and well it may ; for most 
of our world are at present possessed with an opinion 
that visions and miracles are ceased ; and though it 
is most certain that two lutes being both strung and 
tuned to an equal pitch, and then one played upon, 
the other, that is not touched, being laid upon the 
table at a fit distance, will, like an echo to a trumpet, 
warble a faint audible harmony, in answer to the same 
tune, yet many will not believe that there is any such 
thing as a sympathy with souls, &c. 

[71] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



Section II. 

I shall next relate some little histories, to show 
what perception men have had of spirits by the sense 
of hearing ; for, as Wierus says, spirits appear some- 
times invisibly, so that only a sound, voice, or noise 
is perceived by men, viz., a stroke, knocking, whist- 
ling, sneezing, groaning, lamenting, or clapping of 
the hands, to make men attent to inquire or answer. 

In Luther's " Colloquia Mensalia," &c, set forth 
in Latin at Frankfort, anno 1557, it being a different 
collection from that of Aurifaber, which is translated 
from High Dutch into English, we have the follow- 
ing relation : — 

" It happened in Prussia, that as a certain boy was 
born, there presently came to him a genius, or what 
you please to call it (for I leave it to men's judg- 
ments), who had so faithful a care of the infant, that 
there was no need either of mother or servant ; and, 
as he grew up, he had a like care of him. He went 
to school with him, but so that he could never be 
seen, either by himself, or any others, in all his life. 
Afterwards, he travelled into Italy ; he accompanied 
him, and whensoever any evil was like to happen to 
him, either on the road or in the inn, he was per- 
ceived to foretell it by some touch or stroke ; he 
drew off his boots as a servant ; if he turned his 
journey another way, he continued with him, having 
the same care of him in foretelling evil. At length 
he was made a canon, and as, on a time, he was 
sitting and feasting with his friends, in much jollity, 
a vehement stroke was struck on a sudden on the 

[72] 



CASE OF CAPTAIN BELL 



table, so that they were all terrified. Presently the 
canon said to his friends, 1 Be not afraid ; some great 
evil hangs over my head.' The next day he fell into 
a great fever, and the fit continued on him for three 
whole days, till he died miserably." 

Captain Henry Bell, in his narrative prefixed to 
Luther's "Table," printed in English, anno 1652, 
having acquainted us how the German copy printed 
of it had been discovered underground, where it had 
lain fifty-two years, that edition having been sup- 
pressed by an edict of the Emperor Rudolphus II., 
so that it was death to keep a copy thereof ; and 
having told us that Casparus Van Spar, a German 
gentleman, with whom he was familiarly acquainted 
while he negotiated affairs in Germany for King 
James I., was the person who discovered it, anno 
1626, and transmitted it to England to him, and 
earnestly desired him to translate the said book into 
English, says, he accordingly set upon the translation 
of it many times, but was always hindered from pro- 
ceeding in it by some intervening business. About 
six weeks after he had received the copy, being in 
bed with his wife one night, between twelve and one 
o'clock, she being asleep, but himself awake, there 
appeared to him an ancient man, standing at his 
bedside arrayed all in white, having a long and broad 
white beard hanging down to his girdle, who, taking 
him by his right ear, said thus to him, " Sirrah ! 
will you not take time to translate that book, which 
is sent to you out of Germany ? I will shortly pro- 
vide for you both place and time to do it." And 
then he vanished. Hereupon, being much affrighted, 

[73] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



he fell into an extreme sweat, so that his wife, awak- 
ing and finding him all over wet, she asked him what 
he ailed ? He told her what he had seen and heard ; 
but he never regarded visions or dreams, and so the 
same fell out of his mind. But a fortnight after, 
being on a Sunday, at his lodgings in King Street, 
Westminster, at dinner with his wife, two messengers 
were sent from the whole council board, with a war- 
rant to carry him to the Gate-house, Westminster, 
there to be kept till further order from the lords of 
the council ; upon which warrant he was kept there 
ten whole years, close prisoner, where he spent five 
years of it in translating the said book, having good 
cause to be mindful of the old man's saying, " I will 
shortly provide for you both place and time to 
translate it." 

Though the perception of spirits chiefly affects 
the hearing and seeing faculties, yet are not the 
other senses without some participation of these 
genial objects, whether good or evil ; for, as St. 
Austin says, the evil work of the devil creeps 
through all the passages of the senses ; he presents 
himself in figures, applies himself to colours, adheres 
to sounds, introduces odours, infuses himself in 
savours, and fills all the passages of intelligence ; 
sometimes cruelly tormenting with grief and fear, 
sometimes sportingly diverting man, or taunting 
with mocks. And on the other hand, as the learned 
Walter Hilton, a great master of contemplative life, 
in his " Scale of Perfection," sets forth, that appear- 
ances or representations to the corporeal senses may 
be both good and evil. 

[74] 



A GHOSTLY WARNING 



But before I conclude upon this head, to give still 
more weight and authority to the perception we 
have had of these genii, both by the senses of hear- 
ing and seeing, I will relate two very remarkable 
fragments of history of this kind, told us by per- 
sons who demand our credit, and done within the 
memory of our grandfathers and fathers. 

The first is concerning that Duke of Buckingham 
who was stabbed by Felton, August the 23rd, 1628. 

Mr. Lilly, the astrologer, in his book entitled 
" Monarchy and no Monarchy in England," printed 
in quarto, 1651, having mentioned the Duke of 
Buckingham, writes as follows : — " Since I am upon 
the death of the Duke of Buckingham, I shall relate 
a true story of his being admonished often of the 
death he should die in this manner : 

" An aged gentleman, one Parker, as I now re- 
member, having formerly belonged unto the duke, or 
of great acquaintance with the duke's father, and 
now retired, had a demon appeared several times to 
him in the shape of Sir George Villiers, the duke's 
father. This demon walked many times in Parker's 
bed-chamber, without any action or terror, noise, 
hurt, or speech ; but, at last, one night broke out 
in these words : * Mr. Parker, I know you loved me 
formerly, and my son George at this time very well. 
I would have you go from me (you know me very 
well to be his father, old Sir George Villiers of 
Leicestershire), and acquaint him with these and 
these particulars, &c, and that he above all refrain 
the counsel and company of such and such (whom 
he then nominated), or else he will come to destruc- 

[W] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

tion, and that suddenly.' Parker, though a very 
discreet man, partly imagined himself in a dream 
all this time : and being unwilling to proceed upon 
no better grounds, forbore addressing himself to the 
duke ; for he conceived, if he should acquaint the 
duke with the words of his father, and the manner 
of his appearance to him (such apparitions being 
not usual), he should be laughed at, and thought to 
dote, in regard he was aged. Some few nights 
passed without further trouble to the old man ; but, 
not very many nights after, old Sir George Villiers 
appeared again, walked quick and furiously in the 
room, seemed angry with Parker, and at last said, 
6 Mr. Parker, I thought you had been my friend so 
much, and loved my son George so well, that you 
would have acquainted him with what I desired, but 
I know you have not done it ; by all the friendship 
that ever was betwixt you and me, and the great 
respect you bear my son, I desire you to deliver what 
I formerly commanded you to my son. 1 The old 
man, seeing himself thus solicited, promised the 
demon he would, but first argued it thus, that the 
duke was not easy to be spoken withal, and that he 
would account him a vain man to come with such a 
message from the dead ; nor did he conceive the 
duke would give any credit to him : to which the 
demon thus answered : 6 If he will not believe you 
have this discourse from me, tell him of such a secret 
(and named it) which he knows none in the world 
ever knew but myself and him."' Mr. Parker being 
now well satisfied that he was not asleep, and that 
the apparition was not a vain delusion, took a fit 

[76] 



WARNING DISREGARDED 

opportunity, and seriously acquainted the duke with 
his father's words, and the manner of his apparition. 
The duke laughed heartily at the relation, which put 
old Parker to a stand, but at last he assumed courage, 
and told the duke that he acquainted his fathers 
ghost with what he found now to be true, viz., scorn 
and derision : * But, my lord,' says he, ' your father 
bid me acquaint you by this token, and he said it 
was such as none in the world but your two selves 
did yet know.' Hereat the duke was amazed and 
much astonished, but took no warning or notice 
thereof, keeping the same company still, advising 
with such counsellors, and performing such actions 
as his father by Parker countermanded. Shortly 
after, old Sir George Villi ers, in a very quiet but 
sorrowful posture, appears again to Parker, and said, 
'Mr. Parker, I know you delivered my words to 
George my son ; I thank you for so doing, but he 
slighted them, and now I only request this more at 
your hands, that once again you repair to my son, 
and tell him that if he will not amend and follow 
the counsel I have given him, this knife or dagger 
(and with that he pulled a knife or dagger from un- 
der his gown) shall end him ; and do you, Mr. Parker, 
set your house in order, for you shall die at such a 
time."* Mr. Parker once more engaged, though very 
unwillingly, to acquaint the duke with the last mes- 
sage, and so did ; but the duke told him to trouble 
him no further with such messages and dreams, and 
told him he perceived he was now an old man and 
doted ; and within a month after, meeting Mr. Parker 
on Lambeth Bridge, said, 'Now, Mr. Parker, what 

[77] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



say you of your dream ?' who only returned, 'Sir, I 
wish it may never have success, 1 &c. ; but, within six 
weeks after, he was stabbed with a knife, according 
to his father's admonition beforehand, and Mr. Par- 
ker died soon after he had seen the dream or vision 
performed." 

This relation is inserted also in the great Lord 
Clarendon's History, and in Sir Richard Baker's 
Chronicle. The Lord Clarendon, in his history, vol. 
LI. 1, having given some relations, says that, amongst 
others, there was one (meaning this of Parker) which 
was upon a better foundation of credit than usually 
such discourses are founded upon ; and he tells us 
that Parker was an officer in the king's wardrobe in 
Windsor Castle, of a good reputation for honesty and 
discretion, and then about the age of fifty years or 
more. This man had in his youth been bred in a 
school in the parish where Sir George Villiers, the 
father of the duke, lived, and had been much cher- 
ished and obliged in that season of his age by the said 
Sir George, whom afterwards he never saw. About 
six months before the miserable end of the Duke of 
Buckingham the apparition was seen ; after the third 
appearance he made a journey to London, where the 
court then was ; he was very well known to Sir Ralph 
Freeman, one of the masters of the requests, who had 
married a lady that was nearly allied to the duke, and 
was himself well received by him. He informed the 
duke with the reputation and honesty of the man, 
and Sir Ralph Freeman carried the man the next 
morning, by five of the clock, to Lambeth, according 
to the duke's appointment, and there presented him 

[78] 



AN AUTHENTIC RELATION 



to the duke, who received him courteously at his 
landing, and walked in conference near an hour with 
him, and Sir Ralph's and the duke's servants at such 
a distance that they heard not a word ; but Sir Ralph 
always fixed his eyes on the duke, who sometimes 
spoke with great commotion and disorder ; and the 
man told Sir Ralph in their return over the water, 
that when he mentioned those particulars that were 
to gain him credit, the duke's colour changed, and he 
swore he could come to that knowledge only by the 
devil ; for that those particulars were known only 
to himself and to one person more, who he was 
sure would never speak of them. So far the Lord 
Clarendon. 

I will now subjoin an authentic relation which Mr. 
Beaumont tells us at the end of his book of genii or 
familiar spirits, printed in the year 1705, he had just 
before received from the mouth of the then Bishop 
of Gloucester himself. It is as follows, word for 
word : — 

" Sir Charles Lee, by his first lady, had only one 
daughter, of which she died in childbirth ; and when 
she died, her sister, the Lady Everard, desired to have 
the education of the child ; and she was by her very 
well educated till she was marriageable, and a match 
was concluded for her with Sir William Perkins, but 
was then prevented in an extraordinary manner. Upon 
a Thursday night, she, thinking she saw a light in her 
chamber after she was in bed, knocked for her maid, 
who presently came to her, and she asked why she left 
a candle burning in her chamber? The maid said 
she left none, and there was none but what she 

[79] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

brought with her at that time. Then she said it was 
the fire ; but that the maid told her was quite out, 
and said she believed it was only a dream ; whereupon 
she said it might toe so, and composed herself again to 
sleep ; but about two of the clock she was awakened 
again, and saw the apparition of a little woman be- 
tween her curtain and her pillow, who told her she 
was her mother, and that she was happy, and that by 
twelve of the clock that day she should be with her ; 
whereupon she knocked again for her maid, called for 
her clothes, and when she was dressed, went into her 
closet, and came not out again till nine, and then 
brought out with her a letter sealed to her father ; 
brought it to her aunt, the Lady Everard ; told her 
what had happened, and desired that, as soon as she 
was dead, it might be sent to him. But the lady 
thought she was suddenly fallen mad, and thereupon 
sent presently away to Chelmsford for a physician 
and surgeon, who both came immediately, but the 
physician could discern no indication of what the 
lady imagined, or of any indisposition of her body ; 
notwithstanding the lady would needs have her let 
blood, which was done accordingly ; and when the 
young woman had patiently let them do what they 
would with her, she desired that the chaplain might 
be called to read prayers, and when prayers were 
ended she took her guitar and psalm-book and sat 
down upon a chair without arms, and played and sung 
so melodiously and admirably, that her music-master, 
who was then there, admired at it ; and near the 
stroke of twelve she rose and sat herself down in a 
great chair with arms, and presently fetching a strong 

[80] 



THE POINT OF VERACITY 



breathing or two, immediately expired, and was so 
suddenly cold as was much wondered at by the phy- 
sician and surgeon. She died at Waltham, in Essex, 
three miles from Chelmsford, and the letter was sent 
to Sir Charles at his house in Warwickshire ; but he 
was so afflicted with the death of his daughter, that 
he came not till she was buried ; but when he came, 
he caused her to be taken up, and to be buried by 
her mother at Edmonton, as she desired in her letter." 
This was about the year one thousand six hundred 
and sixty-two or sixty-three ; and this relation the 
Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Gloucester had 
from Sir Charles Lee himself ; and Mr. Beaumont 
printed it in his book above-mentioned, from the 
bishop's own mouth. 

The relations which I have given above are not 
like the trifling accounts too often given of these 
things, and therefore causing grave ones to be ridi- 
culed in common with them. They are of that 
nature that, whoever attempts to ridicule them, 
will, instead of turning them into jest, become the 
object of ridicule himself. 

The first story, which has in it such amazing cir- 
cumstances, and such uncommon and dreadful inci- 
dents concerning the butler in Ireland, is (as the 
reader sees) attested by no less a personage than an 
Earl of Orrery, two bishops, and many other noble- 
men and gentlemen, being present and eye-witnesses 
of what the earl said. What greater testimony 
would the most incredulous have ? They say such 
things are told for interest ; what interest could an 
earl and many noblemen have in promoting such 

[81] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



an imposture ? The incredulous say likewise, great 
and learned men delight sometimes in putting frauds 
upon the world, and after laugh at their credulity ; 
would a number of noble laymen choose two prelates 
to carry on such a fraud ? And would two pious 
bishops probably combine with several, and some 
servants there present, in spreading such a deceit ? 
It is past believing, and it demands the strictest of 
moral faith that can be given, to the most unques- 
tioned history that the pen of man ever wrote. 

The second story is founded, first, upon the ex- 
perience of one of the most ingenious men of that 
age, Dr. Donne, and then upon the proof made by 
his friend, Sir Robert Drury, who could at first 
scarce believe it ; and shall we doubt the credit of 
men whose company (for their credit be it spoken) a 
British ambassador was proud of gaining ? 

The third story is told by Luther himself, who 
began the great work of the Reformation. 

The fourth is told by one that was a king's public 
minister, and told from his own trial of the matter, 
where he could have no interest in the telling it. 

The fifth is related by those great historians the 
Lord Clarendon and Sir Richard Baker, as a truth 
relied upon by themselves, and fit to be credited by 
their readers. 

The sixth and last was related to Mr. Beaumont 
by the Lord Bishop of Gloucester, who received the 
account from Sir Charles Lee himself, to whose 
granddaughter the matter happened. 

Men who will not believe such things as these, so 
well attested to us, and given us by such authorities, 

[82] 



FANTASTICAL INCREDULITY 

because they did not see them themselves, nor any- 
thing of the like nature, ought not only to deny the 
demon of Socrates, but that there was such a man as 
Socrates himself; they should not dispute the genii 
of Caesar, Cicero, Brutus, Mark Antony, but avow 
that there were never any such men existing upon 
earth, and overthrow all credible history whatsoever. 
Meanwhile all men, but those who run such lengths 
in their fantastical incredulity, will, from the facts 
above-mentioned, rest satisfied that there are such 
things as evil and good genii, and that men have 
sometimes a commerce with them by all their senses, 
particularly those of seeing and hearing, and will not 
therefore be startled at the strange fragments of 
histories which I am going to relate of our young 
Duncan Campbell, and look upon some wonderful 
adventures which he performed by the intervention 
of his familiar demon or genius, as falsehoods, only 
because they are uncommon and surprising ; more 
especially since they were not done in a corner, but 
by an open way of profession of a predictor of things, 
in the face of the metropolis of London, where he 
settled young, as will appear in the progress of his 
life. However, some people, notwithstanding all this, 
may allege that though a man may have a genius 
appear to him so as to convey into his mind, through 
his senses, the knowledge of things that are to come 
to pass, yet this happens but on very eminent and 
extraordinary occasions. The murder, for example, 
of a prime minister, and the favourite of a monarch, 
in such a manner as it was performed on the great 
Buckingham by Felton, was a thing so uncommon 

[83] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



that it might perhaps deserve, by the permission of 
heaven, an uncommon prediction. The others like- 
wise are instances eminent in their way, particularly 
that of the Lady Everard's niece ; for that young 
lady being then marriageable, and a treaty for that 
end being on foot with Sir William Perkins, the 
divine Providence foreseeing that such a state might 
call away her thoughts, hitherto bent on Him and 
spiritual affairs, and fix them on the trifles of this 
world, might perhaps permit her to be called by a 
holy mother to a state of happiness she before her 
enjoyed, lest her daughter's mind should change, and 
she go into the ways of a sinner. But if these super- 
eminent, these scarce and rare examples, may be ad- 
mitted of man's holding a conversation with the 
spiritualised beings of another world, it will, how- 
ever, be far below the dignity of human reasons, 
me thinks, to make such large concessions to people 
who pretend to converse that wonderful way, as to 
allow them the credit of being able to do it upon 
every slight occasion, and every indifferent occur- 
rence of human life. 

I cannot help acknowledging that a man of wisdom 
may, at first thought, make such an objection ; but 
reflection will presently retract it, and the same good 
sense that taught him to make an objection so well 
upon the first thought, will teach him, upon second 
thoughts, to acquiesce in the answer. 

Infants may have, no doubt, the benefit of such an 
attending genius, as well as people more advanced in 
years ; as may be seen in one of the instances, which 
is a very famous one, relating to the boy born in 

[84] 



PREDICTIONS OF DEATH 

Prussia, who was attended by one constantly from 
the time of his birth to his death. Besides, it is a 
mistake in the understanding to imagine that death, 
which is the determination and end of life, is of more 
consequence to be known than the manner of regulat- 
ing that life ; for in reality, according to the right 
way of considering, death, or the determination of a 
man's life, derives its importance from the steps 
which he took in the due regulation of it ; and 
therefore every the least step proper to be taken for 
the due regulation of life, is of more consequence to 
be known than the death of a person, though this at 
first sight carries the face of significance, and the 
other nothing better than the look of a trifle. Mar- 
riage, for example, is a step in life of the utmost 
importance, whether we consider that estate with 
regard to this or the next world. Death is but the 
finishing of one person, but marriage may be the in- 
troducing of many into the world with happiness ; 
it is therefore a thing of more importance to be 
known beforehand, and consequently more worthy 
of the communication of a genius to the man with 
whom he conversed. Possidonius tells us that a cer- 
tain Rhodian dying, nominated six of his equals, 
and said who should die first, who next, and so on, 
and the event answered the prediction ; why then 
(though some people are apt to make a jest of it) may 
not a man, by the intervention of his good genius, 
tell a woman that is to have six husbands who she 
shall have first, who next, and so on, and the event 
answer the prediction ? If men of learning may ac- 
quire such knowledge as to attain to extraordinary 

[85] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



things by their ordinary faculties, why may not 
ordinary things be taught others in this extraor- 
dinary way ? For will anybody say that it is easier 
for a man to accommodate himself to the knowledge 
of a demon or genius than for a demon or genius to 
accommodate himself to the knowledge of a man ? 
Certain it is, indeed, that if this good genius (that 
induces a man with a prophetic kind of science) be 
anything resembling a good angel, the primary end 
of his being permitted to direct mankind, must con- 
sist in things relating more to their welfare hereafter ; 
yet I know not why they may not sometimes inspire 
or openly direct them in human knowledge and in 
things relating to human life, so they are of a good 
tendency, more especially since a good inspiration 
may be a counterbalance to the bad knowledge 
which some have been inspired with by evil spirits. 
I would not be thought to go too far in a point of 
this nature, and have therefore (though perhaps I 
could say much more if I followed entirely my own 
private opinion, and would venture to introduce it 
here, in order to communicate it to others, and make 
it a public one) said no more on this head than 
what divines generally teach. 

But the most unexceptionable mistress that teaches 
these things to be in Nature is experience. If we 
had very many people gifted this way, the extraor- 
dinarv thing would have become ordinary, and there- 
fore I cannot help wondering that it should be so 
ordinary a thing for wise men themselves to wonder 
too much at things because they are extraordinary, 
and suspect them as frauds because they are uncommon. 

[86 J 



LEGERDEMAIN 

There has scarce been any period of time in which 
some person of this prophetic class has not existed, 
and has not been consulted by the greatest of men, 
and their predictions found at the long run to come 
true. Ignorant men always rise to their belief of 
them by experience, and the most learned men submit 
their great opinions to experience ; but your men of 
middling talents, who make up their want of reason 
with bustling obstinacy and noisy contradiction, 
have been and still continue to be their own op- 
posers ; and without discovering the reason for what 
they say, they content themselves with having the 
laugh on their sides, and barely affirming without 
proving that it is a kind of ideal juggle, and intel- 
lectual legerdemain, by which these modern predictors 
impose things upon the eye and reason, as the corpo- 
real eye is imposed upon by sleight of hand ; but it 
is a strange thing that men of such quick reason 
cannot give us a sample of the frauds. Thus I re- 
member to have read, I cannot tell where, a story of 
some courtiers, who, when a great artist of legerde- 
main was to act before the king, pretended to be so 
quick-sighted, that nothing he did should escape 
their discovery, were left by his nimble fingers in 
the dark, and forced at last, with blushes, to own 
they had no better eyes than other people. In a 
word, if people will be led by suspicions and remote 
possibilities of fraud and contrivance of such men, 
all historical truth shall be ended, when it consists 
not with a man's private humour or prejudice to 
admit it. Now, therefore, to prove by experience 
and undeniable testimonies, that these kind of genii 

[87] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



will submit to little offices in order to bring men to 
greater good, I will give the reader three or four 
c urious passages that will set the reasonable reader 
at ease and prepare him for reading the passages of 
Mr. Campbell's life with pleasure, and as a fine 
history of wonderful facts, that though they seem 
to surpass belief yet ought to have his credit. 

What in nature can be more trivial than for a 
spirit to employ himself in knocking on a morning 
at the wainscot by the bed's head of a man who got 
drunk over night, according to the way that such 
things are ordinarily explained ? And yet I shall 
give you such a relation of this, that not even the 
most devout and precise Presbyterian will offer to 
call in question, for Mr. Baxter, in his historical 
discourse of apparitions, writes thus: — 

" There is now in London an understanding, sober, 
pious man, oft one of my hearers, who has an elder 
brother, a gentleman of considerable rank, who, hav- 
ing formerly seemed pious, of late years does often 
fall into the sin of drunkenness. He often lodges 
long together here in his brother's house ; and when- 
soever he is drunk and has slept himself sober, some- 
thing knocks at his bed's head, as if one knocked on 
a wainscot ; when they remove his bed it follows him ; 
besides other loud noises, on other parts where he 
is, that all the house hears, they have often watched 
him, and kept his hands lest he should do it himself. 
His brother has often told it me, and brought his 
wife, a discreet woman, to attest it ; who avers, 
moreover, that as she watched him, she has seen his 
shoes under the bed taken up, and nothing visible to 

[88] 



BAXTER'S TESTIMONY 



touch them. They brought the man himself to me, 
and when we asked him how he dare sin again after 
such a warning, he had no excuse ; but being persons 
of quality, for some special reason of worldly interest 
I must not name him. 

"Two things are remarkable in this instance," says 
Mr. Baxter; "first, what a powerful thing tempta- 
tion and fleshly concupiscence is, and what an hard- 
ened heart sin brings men to ; if one rose from the 
dead to warn such sinners, it would not of itself 
persuade them. 1 '' 

" Secondly," says Mr. Baxter, " it poses me to 
think what kind of spirit this is, that has such a 
care of this man's soul, which makes me hope he will 
recover. Do good spirits dwell so near us, or are 
they sent on such messages ? or is it his guardian 
angel ? or is it the soul of some dead friend that 
suffers, and yet retaining love to him, as Dives to his 
brethren, would have him saved ? God yet keeps 
such things from us in the dark." 

So far we have the authority of the renowned and 
famous Mr. Baxter, who makes this knocking of the 
spirit at the bed's head (though what we commonly 
call frivolous) an important errand. 

Another relation of this kind was sent to Mr. John 
Beaumont (whom I myself personally know), and 
which he has inserted in his account of genii, or 
familiar spirits, in a letter by an ingenious and 
learned clergyman of Wiltshire, who had given him 
the relation likewise before by word of mouth. It 
is as follows : — 

" Near eighty years since, in the parish of Wilcot 

[89] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

(which is by the Devizes), in the vicar's house, there 
was heard for a considerable time the sound of a bell 
constantly tolling every night ; the occasion was this. 
A debauched person who lived in the parish came 
one night very late and demanded the keys of the 
church of the vicar, that he might ring a peal, 
which the vicar refused to let him have, alleging the 
unseasonableness of the time, and that he should, by 
granting his desires, give a disturbance to Sir George 
Wroughton and his family, whose house adjoined to 
the churchyard. Upon this refusal the fellow went 
away in a rage, threatening to be revenged of the 
vicar, and going some time after to the Devizes, met 
with one Cantle or Cantlow, a person noted in those 
days for a wizard, and he tells him how the vicar 
had served him, and begs his help to be even with 
him. The reply Cantlow made him was this : * Does 
he not love ringing? He shall have enough of it.' 
And from that time a bell began to toll in his house, 
and continued so to do till Cantlow's death, who 
confessed at Fisherton Gaol in Sarum (where he was 
confined by King James during his life), that he 
caused that sound, and that it should be heard in 
that place during life. The thing was so notorious 
that persons came from all parts to hear it, and 
King James sent a gentleman from London on pur- 
pose to give him satisfaction concerning the truth of 
the report." Mr. Beaumont had likewise this story, 
as he tells, from the mouth of Sir George Wrough- 
ton \s own son, with this remarkable circumstance, 
that if any in the house put their heads out of the 
window they could not hear the sound, but heard 

[90] 



A PROPHETIC SPIRIT 



it immediately again as soon as they stood in the 
room. 

The reader here sees that good and bad genii 
exercise themselves upon very little functions, knock- 
ing at beds'-heads and ringing of bells. For proof 
of this we have the testimonies of two divines, of a 
man of quality and probity, and the same satisfac- 
tion that a learned king had, who sent to inquire 
into the matter ; and after this there can be, I think, 
no room for doubt. 

But to carry the point still nearer home, inasmuch 
as I know some will leave no stone unturned to make 
the extraordinary actions which the person whose 
life I write has performed appear impostures, and 
inasmuch as for this end they may say that though 
many people may have been gifted in this extraor- 
dinary manner, yet not so as to make a profession of 
it, and therefore from thence they take their suspi- 
cions, I shall in this place, to remove every nicest 
scruple they can have touching this affair, give the 
reader one instance of this kind likewise before I 
proceed with my history. 

There lived not many years since a very aged 
gentlewoman, in London, in Water Lane, by Fleet 
Street, whose name was Pight, who was endowed with 
a prophetic spirit. And the ingenious Mr. Beau- 
mont, whom I personally knew, and who had a 
familiar genius himself, gives the world this account 
of her. " She was very well known," says he, " to 
many persons of my acquaintance now living in Lon- 
don. Among others, a gentleman, whose candour I 
can no way suspect, has told me that he often re- 

[91] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



sorted to her, as to an oracle ; and that as soon as he 
came into her presence, she would usually tell him 
that she knew what he was coming for, for that she 
had seen his spirit for some time before. And with- 
out his saying anything to her, she would commonly 
tell him what the business was which he came to con- 
sult her about, and what the event of it would be, 
which he always found to fall out as she said ; and 
many other persons now living can testify the like 
experience of her as to themselves. ,, 

Before I conclude this chapter, I am willing to give 
the public one further little history of the like kind 
with the foregoing ones, with this only difference, that 
if it be valued according to the worth the world has 
always attributed to the very ingenious person whom 
it concerns, it will be far the most famous of them 
all, and therefore fittest to finish this chapter, and to 
crown this part of the work, in which we are showing 
that persons have had a perception of genii or spirits, 
not visible at the same time to others. 

The famous Torquatus Tasso, prince of the Italian 
poets, and scarce inferior to the immortal Virgil him- 
self, and who seems to enjoy the intermingled gifts of 
the most accurate judgment of this Latin poet, and 
the more fertile and copious invention and fancy 
of the Greek one, Homer, strongly asserted his own 
experience in this kind. His life was written and pub- 
lished in French, anno 1692, by D. C. D. D. V., who, 
in his preface, tells us, that in what he writ, he has 
followed chiefly the history given us in Italian by 
John Baptista Manso, a Neapolitan gentleman, who 
had been a very intimate friend to Tasso. In his life, 

[92] 



TORQUATUS TASSO 



among other things, he acquaints us that Tasso was 
naturally of that melancholic temperament which has 
always made the greatest men, and that this tempera- 
ment being aggravated by many hardships he had un- 
dergone, it made him sometimes beside himself, and 
that those melancholy vapours being despatched, he 
came again to himself, like those that return from 
fits of the falling sickness, his spirit being as free as 
before. That near his latter end he retired from the 
city of Naples to his friend Manso, at Bisaccia, a small 
town in the kingdom of Naples, where Manso had a 
considerable estate, and passed an autumn there in the 
diversions of the season. 

And here the French author gives us an account 
of Tasso's sensible perception of a genius as follows : — 
As after these amusements he usually retired to his 
chamber to enteilain himself there with his friend 
Manso, the latter had the opportunity to inquire into 
one of the most singular effects of Tasso's melancholy 
(of this heroic melancholy, as I may call it), which 
raised and brightened his spirit, so far it was from 
depressing or rendering it obscure, and which among 
the ancients would have reasonably caused them to 
have ascribed a familiar demon to him, as to Socrates. 
They were often in a warm debate concerning this 
spirit, with which Tasso pretended to have so free a 
communication. "I am too much your friend, 1 '' said 
Manso to him one day, " not to let you know what 
the world thinks of you concerning this thing, and 
what I think of it myself. Is it possible that, being 
enlightened as you are, you should be fallen into so 
great a weakness as to think you have a familiar 

[93] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



spirit ? and will you give your enemies that advantage 
to be able to prove, by your own acknowledgment, 
what they have already published to the world ? You 
know they say you did not publish your 1 Dialogue of 
the Messenger 1 as a fiction ; but you would have men 
believe that the spirit which you make to speak there 
was a real and true spirit ; hence men have drawn 
this injurious consequence, that your studies have em- 
broiled your imagination, so that there is made in it 
a confused mixture of the fictions of the poets, the 
inventions of the philosophers, and the doctrine of 
religion." 

" I am not ignorant," answered Tasso, " of all that 
is spread abroad in the world on the account of my 
1 Dialogue. 1 I have taken care divers times to dis- 
abuse my friends, both by letter and word of mouth. 
I prevented even the malignity of my enemies, as you 
know, at the time I published my ' Dialogue. 1 Men 
could not be ignorant that I composed it for the 
young Prince of Mantua, to whom I would explain, 
after an agreeable manner, the principal mysteries 
of the Platonic philosophy. It was at Mantua itself, 
after my second flight from Ferrara, that I formed 
the idea of it, and I committed it to paper a little 
after my unfortunate return. I addressed it to this 
prince, and all men might have read in the epistle 
dedicatory the protestation I there make that this 
' Dialogue 1 being written according to the doctrine 
of the Platonics, which is not always conformable to 
revealed truths, men must not confound what I ex- 
pose there as a philosopher with what I believe as a 
Christian. This distinction is by so much the more 

[94] 



DEMON OR SPIRIT? 



reasonable, that at that time nothing extraordinary 
had happened to me, and I spake not of any appari- 
tion. This can be attested by all those with whom 
I lodged, or whom I frequented in this voyage, and 
therefore there is no reason for confounding the fiction 
of my i Dialogue 1 with what has happened to me 
since.'" — "I am persuaded of all you say to me," 
replied Manso, " but truly I cannot be of what you 
believe at present concerning yourself. Will you 
imagine that you are in commerce with a spirit ? 
And I ask you of what order is that spirit ? Shall 
we place him in the number of the rebels, whom 
their pride precipitated into the abyss? or of the 
intelligences, who continued firm in faith and sub- 
mission to their Creator ? For there is no mean to 
take in the true religion, and we must not fall into 
the extravagances of the gnomes and sylphs of the 
Cabalists. 

" Now, the spirit in question cannot be a demon. 
You own that, instead of inspiring you with anything 
contrary to piety and religion, he often fortifies in you 
the maxims of Christianity ; he strengthens your faith 
by profound reasonings, and has the same respect with 
you for sacred names and things. Neither can you 
say that it is an angel, for though you have always 
led a regular life, and far from all dissoluteness, 
though for some years past you have applied your- 
self, after a particular manner, to the duties of a true 
Christian, you will agree with me that these sorts of 
favours are not common, that a man must have at- 
tained to a high degree of sanctity, and not be far from 
the pureness of celestial spirits, to merit a familiar 

[95] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

converse and bear a harmony with them. Believe 
me, there is* nothing in all these discourses which 
you imagine you have with this spirit. You know 
better than any man those symptoms which the black 
humours wherewith you are tormented causes in you. 
Your vapours are the source of your visions, and your- 
self would not judge otherwise of another person to 
whom a like thing should happen, and you will come 
to this in your own respect also, if you will make a 
mature reflection, and apply yourself to blot out, by 
an effort of reason, these imaginations which the 
violence of your evil effect causes in you." — " You 
may have reason,"" replied Tasso, "to think so of the 
things that pass in me ; but as to myself, who have 
a sensible perception of them, I am forced to reason 
after another manner. If it were true that the spirit 
did not show himself to me but in the violent assault 
of my vapours; if he offered to my imagination but 
wandering and confused species, without connection 
or due sequel; if he used to me frivolous reasonings 
which ended in nothing; or if, having begun some 
solid reasoning, he broke it off on a sudden and left 
me in darkness, I should believe with you that all 
things that pass are but mere dreams and phantoms ; 
but it is quite otherwise : this spirit is a spirit of 
truth and reason, and of a truth so distinct, of a 
reason so sublime, that he raises me often to knowl- 
edges that are above all my reasonings, though they 
appear to me no less clear ; that he teaches me things 
which, in my most profound meditations, never came 
into my spirit, and which I never heard of any man, 
nor read in any book. This spirit, therefore, is some- 

[96] 



OCULAR EVIDENCE 



what of real ; of whatsoever order he be I hear and 
see him, nevertheless for its being impossible for me 
to comprehend and define him." Manso did not yield 
to these facts which Tasso would have passed for 
proofs. He pressed him with new questions, which 
were not without answers. " Since you will not be- 
lieve me on my word, ,, said Tasso to him another day, 
after having well disputed, " I must convince you by 
your own eyes that these things are not pure imagi- 
nations. " And the next day, conversing together 
in the same chamber, Manso perceived that on 
a sudden he fixed his eyes towards the window, 
and that he stood as it were immovable; he called 
to him and jogged him many times, but instead 
of answering him — 44 See there the spirit," says 
Tasso at last, 44 that has been pleased to come and 
visit me, and to entertain himself with me ; look on 
him, and you will acknowledge the truth of what I 
say." 

Manso, somewhat surprised, cast his eyes towards 
the place he showed him, and perceived nothing but 
the rays of the sun passing through the glass, nor did 
he see anything in all the chamber, though he cast 
his eyes round it with curiosity, and he desired him 
to show him the spirit, which he looked for in vain, 
while he heard Tasso speak with much vehemency. 
He declares in a letter which he wrote concerning 
this to the Admiral of Naples, that he really heard 
no other voice but Tasso's own ; but they were some- 
times questions made by him to the pretended spirit, 
sometimes answers that he made to the pretended 
questions of the spirit, and which were couched in 
7 [97] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



such admirable terms, so efficacious concerning sub- 
jects so elevated and so extraordinary, that he was 
ravished with admiration, and dared not to interrupt 
him. He hearkened therefore attentively, and being 
quite beside himself at this mysterious conversation, 
which ended at last by a recess of the spirit, as he 
found by the last words of Tasso ; after which Tasso, 
turning himself to him, " Well, 1 ' said he, " are your 
doubts at last dissipated?" — "On the contrary, 1 ' 
answered Manso, " I am more embroiled than ever. 
I have truly heard wonderful things, but you have 
not showed me what you promised me." — " You 
have seen and heard, 1 ' resumed Tasso, " perhaps more 

than " He stopped here, and Manso, who 

could not recover himself of his surprise, and had 
his head filled with the ideas of this extraordinary 
entertainment, found himself not in a condition to 
press him farther. Meanwhile he engaged himself 
not to speak a word to any man of these things he 
had heard, with a design to make them public, though 
he should have liberty granted him. They had 
many other conversations concerning this matter, 
after which Manso owned he was brought to that 
pass that he knew not what to think or say, only 
that if it were a weakness in his friend to believe 
these visions, he much feared it would prove con- 
tagious to him, and that he should become at last 
aa credulous as himself. 

Dr. Beaumont, who is still living, and with whom 
I have had formerly some acquaintance myself, has 
set down among the others this relation at large 
concerning Tasso, ;md gives this reason for it : — 

[98] 



A SHORT EULOGIUM 



u Because,"' 1 says the doctor, £< I think it contains a 
sufficient answer to what many learned friends have 
said to myself on the like occasion. 1 ' 

Perhaps it may not be ungrateful to the reader if 
I subjoin here the short eulogium written on Tasso 
by the famous Thuanus, which is as follows : — 

" Torquatus Tasso died about the forty-fifth year 
of his age, a man of a wonderful and prodigious wit, 
who was seized with an incurable fury in his youth, 
when he lived at the court of Ferrara, and neverthe- 
less, in lucid intervals, he wrote many things both in 
verse and prose with so much judgment, elegance, 
and extreme correctness of style, that he turned at 
length that pity which many men had conceived for 
him, into an amazement; while by that fury which 
in others makes their minds outrageous, or dulls 
them after it was over, his understanding became as 
it were more purified, more ready in inventing things, 
more acute in aptly disposing them after they were 
invented, and more copious in adorning them with 
choice words and weight of sentences ; and that 
which a man of the soundest sense would scarce 
excogitate at his leisure, with the greatest labour 
and care imaginable, he, after a violent agitation 
of the mind set beside itself, naturally performed 
with a wonderful felicity, so that he did not seem 
struck with an alienation of mind, but with a divine 
fury. He that knows not these things, which all 
men know that have been in Italy, and concerning 
which himself sometimes complains, though modestly, 
in his writings, let him read his divine works, and he 
must necessarily conclude either that I speak of an- 

[99] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



other man than Tasso, or that these things were 
written by another man than Tasso." 

After having given my readers so many memorable 
accounts concerning the perception men have had in 
all ages, and still continue to have, of genii or fa- 
miliar spirits, by all the senses, as seeing, hearing, 
&c, which accounts have been attested by men of 
the greatest learning and quality, if any of them 
still remain dissatisfied I am contented, and desire 
them for their punishment to lay down the book 
before they arrive at the more pleasant parts of it, 
which are yet to come, and not to read one tittle 
farther. These unbelieving gentlemen shall then be 
at liberty, according as their different spirits dictate, 
to ridicule me in the same manner as many more 
learned and greater men than I have been satirised 
before my time by persons of a like infidel temper, 
who would fain pass incredulity upon the world as 
wisdom ; and they may, with all the freedom in 
nature, bestow upon me those merry appellations 
which I very well know such extraordinary free- 
thinkers imagine to belong of right to any author 
that either believes himself, or would possess the 
world with an opinion and belief that there is such a 
thing as the holding commerce and conversation, in 
this habitable world, with genii and familiar spirits. 
I shall only first tell them all I have to say to ter- 
minate the dispute between them and me. 

Those who, to give themselves the air and appear- 
ance of men of solid wisdom and gravity, load other 
men, who believe in spirits, with the titles of being 
men of folly, levity, or melancholy, are desired to 

[100 1 



AUTHORITIES MENTIONED 



learn, that the same folly (as they are pleased to 
term it) of opinion is to be found in the greatest 
men of learning that ever existed in the universe. 
Let them, in order to be convinced of this, read 
Apuleius's book, "De Deo Socrat. Censorinus^ 
book, " De Die Nat.," c. 3 ; Porphyrius, in his book 
" De Abstinentia ; " Agrippa, in his treatise " De 
Occult. Phil." L 3, c 22, and also c. 21 ; Natalis 
Comes in his " Myth.," 1. 4, c. 3 ; Maraviglia, in 
his " Pseudomantia," Dissertation 9 and 11, and 
Animadversion 10 ; Plato, in his " Timaeus " and 
" Cratylus ; " Ammianus Marcellinus's " History," 
book 21 ; Hieronimus Cardanus, in his book " De 
Vita Propria," c. 47 ; the great Kircher, in his 
" (Edipus ^Egyptiacus," vol. 3, p. 474 ; Pausanias, 
in " Cliac. Poster. ; " that immortal orator, Cicero, 
lib. 1, "De Divinatione;" lib. 2, "De Natura 
Deorum ; " the " Histoire Prodigieuse," written by 
Pere Arnault ; and a book entitled " Lux e Tene- 
bris," which is a collection of modern visions and 
prophecies in Germany, by several persons ; trans- 
lated into Latin by Jo. Amos. Comenius, printed at 
Amsterdam, 1655. And if they will be at the pains 
of having due recourse to these quotations, they will 
find, that all these men, whose learning is unques- 
tionable, and most of whom have been in firm and 
undisputed possession of fame for many centuries, 
have all unanimously agreed in this opinion (how 
foolish soever they may think it), that there ever was 
and ever would be a communication held between 
some select men and genii or familiar spirits. I must 
therefore desire their pardon if I rejoice to see them

remain wise by themselves, and that I continue to 
be esteemed by them a fool among so much good 
company. 

Others, out of a mere contempt of religion, or 
cowardly, for fear of being thought pusillanimous 
by men, turn bravoes to Heaven, and laugh at every 
notion of spirits as imbibed from the nurse or im- 
posed upon us by priests, and may top these lines 
upon us with an elegant and a convincing magisterial 
sneer, though the divine Socrates was of our opinion, 
and even experienced it to be true, having a genius 
himself. 

The priests but finish what the nurse began 
And thus the child imposes on the man. 

These bring into my mind a saying of Sir Roger 
TEstrange on Seneca, which I must apply to Socrates : 
I join in opinion with a Christian heathen, while 
they remain heathen Christians. 

The third sort, out of a pretended veneration to 
religion and divinity, may call me superstitious and 
chimerical. To them I answer, I will continue 
chimerical and superstitious with St. Austin, who 
gives the same opinion in his "Civitate Dei" with 
Ludovicus Vives ; let them be solider and more re- 
ligious divines than St. Austin in disowning it. 
Thus I bid these austere critics heartily farewell ; but 
let my better-natured readers go on and find a new 
example of this conversation, being held with the 
genii by our Duncan Campbell.

CHAPTER SIX 



A NARRATIVE OF MR. CAMPBELLS COMING TO LONDON 
AND TAKING UPON HIM THE PROFESSION OF A PRE- 
DICTOR ; TOGETHER WITH AN ACCOUNT OF MANY 
STRANGE THINGS THAT CAME TO PASS JUST AS HE 
FORETOLD. 

TO proceed on regularly with the life of 
young Duncan Campbell, I must let the 
reader know that he continued thus con- 
versing with his little genius, as is set 
forth above in the dialogue he had with me, and pre- 
dicting many things of the like nature, as I have de- 
scribed, till the year 1694, when he was just fourteen 
years of age, and then he left Scotland. 

But before I come to speak of the manner of his 
departure from thence, his half-native country, inas- 
much as his father was of that country, and he had 
his education there (what education he could have, 
being deaf and dumb) ; I must let the reader know 
that in the year 1692, my very good friend Mrs. Camp- 
bell, his mother-in-law, died, and left him there at 
Edinburgh, an orphan of twelve years of age. He 
was, I may venture to say, the most beautiful boy of 
that age I ever knew ; and the sensible reader, who 
considers a child of good birth, with the misfortunes 
of being deaf and dumb, left fatherless and mother- 

[ 103 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



less in the wide world, at twelve years old, without 
any competency for his maintenance and support, 
without any relations, in a manner, that knew him 
or assisted him, all the little fortune his father had 
having been lost in the civil commotions in Scot- 
land, as I have related above, need not hear me de- 
scribe the compassion I and many more had for him, 
because such a reader must certainly feel in his own 
bosom the same lively acts of pity and commisera- 
tion, at the hearing of such a mishap, as I had at the 
seeing it, or at least as I have now revived afresh 
within me at the relating it. 

However, it came so to pass, that a person of the 
name of Campbell, and who was a distant relation of 
the boy, though he himself was but in indifferent cir- 
cumstances, was resolved to see him provided for one 
way or another, in a manner somewhat suitable to his 
condition, and till that time to take the best care of 
him himself that he was able. 

Several ladies of quality, who had known his per- 
fections, coveted to make the boy one of their domes- 
tics, as a page, or a playfellow to their children ; for 
though he could not speak, he had such a vivacity 
in all his actions, such a sprightliness of behaviour, 
and such a merriment accompanying all his gestures, 
that he afforded more entertainment than the pret- 
tiest and wittiest little prattlers at those years are 
wont to do. Mr. Campbell had certainly accepted 
of some of these fortunate offers for his little cousin, 
which were many of them likely to prove very advan- 
tageous, if it had not been put in his head by some 
friends, particularly myself, that if he had a mind 

[ 104 ] 



ARRIVAL IN LONDON 



to dispose of the boy in that manner, the best way 
he could take would be to present him to the late 
Earl of Argyll, who for his name's sake, and his 
father's sake, as well as the qualifications and endow- 
ments of the boy, would more naturally (according 
to all probability) take a greater pleasure and de- 
light in him, and consequently provide better for 
him, and with a more lasting care, than any other 
person of quality that had a sudden liking to him, 
which might change, and took him as a stranger out 
of a bare curiosity. Mr. Campbell was by these rea- 
sons overruled in the disposal of his little dumb pro- 
phetical cousin, as he called him, and resolved that 
an offer should be made of him to the present illus- 
trious Duke of Argyll's most noble father. But it so 
unfortunately happened, that the earl making very 
much a longer stay at London than was expected, 
Mr. Campbell, the uncle, sent our young Duncan 
Campbell, his nephew, handsomely accoutred, and 
with a handsome sum of money in his pocket, by sea, 
with Captain Meek, of Kirkcaldy, to London, with 
letters of recommendation to the earl's favour, and 
just a few days before young Duncan arrived in Lon- 
don the earl was set out on his journey to his seat in 
Scotland. 

I had now left him for near three years, not hav- 
ing seen him since about a year after his mother's 
death ; and then coming to London, I had, by mere 
accident, an appointment to meet some Scotch gen- 
tlemen at the Buffalo, in Charing Cross. There 
happened at that time to be a great concourse of 
Scotch nobility there at an entertainment, and one 

[ 105 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



of the ladies and gentlemen passing by and seeing 
one of my friends, desired him to come in, and told 
him both he and his companions should be very 
welcome to partake of the diversion. The lady told 
him they had got a lovely youth, a Scotch miracle, 
among them, that would give us exquisite delight, 
and write down to us all the occurrences of our 
future lives, and tell us our names upon our first 
appearance. The moment I heard of it, Duncan 
Campbell came into my head ; but as it is a thing 
not rare to be met with in Scotland for second- 
sighted persons to tell such things, and as the Earl 
of Argyll was in the north, I thought little Duncan 
had been under his protection and with him, and 
did not dream of meeting with him there, and ac- 
cordingly told my friend, before I went in, that 
I believed I knew a lad in Scotland would exceed 
this in foresight, let him be as dexterous in his art 
as he would. 

As soon as I entered the room I was surprised to 
find myself encom passed and surrounded by a circle 
of the most beautiful females that ever my eyes be- 
held. In the centre of this angelic tribe was seated 
a heavenly youth, with the most winning comeliness 
of aspect that ever pleased the sight of any beholder 
of either sex ; his face was divinely fair, and tinged 
only with such a sprightly blush, as a painter would 
use to colour the picture of health with, and the 
complexion was varnished over by a blooming, like 
that of flourishing fruit, which had not yet felt the 
first Dippings of an unkind and an uncivil air; with 
this beauty was joined such a smiling draught of all 

[106 J 



CENTRE OF ATTRACTION 

the features, as is the result of pleasantry and good 
humour. His eyes were large, full of lustre, majestic, 
well-set, and the soul shone so in them, as told the 
spectators plainly how great was the inward vivacity 
of his genius. The hair of his head was thick, and 
reclined far below his shoulders ; it was of a fine 
silver colour, and hung down in ringlets like the 
curling tendrils of a copious vine. He was by the 
women entertained, according to the claim which so 
many perfections, joining in a youth just ripening into 
manhood, might lay to the benevolent dispositions 
of the tender sex. One was holding the basin of 
water, another washing a hand, a third, with a towel, 
drying his face, which another fair had greedily 
snatched the pleasure of washing before, while a 
fourth was disposing into order his silver hairs with 
an ivory comb, in a hand as white, and which a 
monarch might have been proud to have had so 
employed in adjusting the crown upon his head ; 
a fifth was setting into order his cravat ; a sixth stole 
a kiss, and blushed at the innocent pleasure, and 
mistook her own thoughts as if she kissed the angel 
and not the man ; and they all rather seemed to adore 
than to love him, as if they had taken him not for 
a person that enjoyed the frequent gift of the 
second-sight, but as if he had been some little 
prophet peculiarly inspired ; and while they all thus 
admired and wondered, they all consulted him as an 
oracle. The surprise of seeing a young man so 
happy amidst the general concurring favours of the 
fair, made me for awhile lost in a kind of delightful 
amazement, and the consideration of what bliss he 

[ 107] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



was possessed, made me scarce believe my own eyes 
when they told me it was Duncan Campbell, who I had 
left an unhappy orphan at Edinburgh. But so it was, 
though be was much altered in stature, being now 
shot up pretty fast in his growth since I had seen 
him, and having gained a kind of a fixed comport- 
ment, such as we may daily observe in those who 
are taking leave of their minority and stepping into 
a stage of maturer life. 

The first remarkable thing I knew him do in 
London, being in this splendid company, where there 
were so many undoubted witnesses of quality too 
that had ocular proof of his predictions at that 
public tavern. I choose to record it here in the 
first place according to its due order. It was in the 
year 1698. 

Among this angelical class of beauties were Dr. 
W[e]lw[oo]d's lady and daughter. Upon earth there 
was not sure a more beautiful creature than the 
daughter was ; she was the leading light of all the 
sparkling tribe ; and Ot way's character suits her 
exactly, for she was among ten thousand eminently 
fair. One would imagine prosperous and lucky 
fortune was written upon her face, and that nothing 
unhappy could be read in so fair a book ; and it 
was, therefore, the unanimous consent of all, that, 
by way of good omen to the rest, his predictions 
should begin to be opened luckily that day, and that 
therefore he should first of all be consulted about 
her. 

Accordingly the mother, to be satisfied of his 
talent before she proceeded to any other questions, 

[ 108] 



A RELUCTANT PROPHET 



asked him in writing if he knew the young lady, her 
name, and who she was. After a little ruminating 
and pondering upon the matter, and taking an exact 
view of the beauty, he wrote down her name, told 
Mrs. W[e]lw[oo]d she was her daughter, and that 
her father was a doctor. Convinced, by his so read- 
ily telling the name and quality of persons he had 
never seen in his lifetime, that fame had not given a 
false character of his capacity, she proceeded in her 
questions as to her future fortune. He gazed afresh 
at her very eagerly for some time, and his coun- 
tenance during that time of viewing her seemed to be 
ruffled with abundance of disturbance and perplexity. 
We all imagined that the youth was a little touched 
at the heart himself with what he saw, and that 
instead of telling hers, he had met in her bright 
eyes, with his own destiny, the destiny of being for 
ever made a slave and a captive to so many power- 
ful and almost irresistible charms. 

At length, after having a long debate within him- 
self, which we thought proceeded from the strugglings 
of love and passion, he, fetching a great sigh, which 
still convinced us more, took the pen and wrote to 
Mrs. W[e]lw[oo]d, that he begged to be excused, 
and that his pen might remain as dumb and silent 
as his tongue on that affair. By this answer we 
concluded, one and all, that our former conjectures 
were true, and we joined in pressing him the more 
earnestly to deliver his real and sincere opinion con- 
cerning the accidents upon which the future fortunes 
of her life were to turn and depend. He showed 
many mighty reluctances in the doing it ; and I 

[ 109] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

have often since considered him in the same anguish 
as the late great Dr. Radcliffe, who was endeavour- 
ing by study to save a certain fair one, whom he 
loved with a vehemence of temper, and who was (as 
his reason told him) got far away beyond the reach 
of the art of physic to recover. At last, he wrote in 
plain terms that his backwardness and unwillingness 
to tell it arose from his wishes that her fortune 
would be better than his certain foreknowledge of it 
told him it would be, and begged that we would rest 
satisfied with that general answer, since it was in so 
particular a case where he himself was a well-wisher, 
in vain, to the lady about whom he was consulted. 
The young lady herself thinking that, if she knew 
any disasters that were to befall her, she might, by 
knowing the nature of them beforehand and the time 
when they were likely to happen, be able, by timely 
prudence and forecast, to avert those evils, with 
many beseeching* urged him to reveal the fatal secret. 
After many struggles to avoid it, and as many in- 
stances made to him both by mother and daughter 
for the discovery of his prescience on that point, he 
complied with very great difficulty, and, blotting the 
paper with tears that trickled fast from his eyes, he 
gave her the lamentable scroll containing the words 
that follow, viz. : — "I wish it had not fallen to my 
lot to tell this lady, whom everybody that but once 
looks at her must admire, though they must not 
have leave to love, that she is not much longer to 
be possessor of that lovely face, which gains her such 
a number of adorers. The small-pox will too soon 
turn a ravisher, and rifle all those sweets and charms 

[110] 



A DIRE PREDICTION 



that might be able to vanquish a king and to subdue 
a conqueror of mighty battles. Her reign is doomed, 
alas ! to be as short as it is now great and universal. 
I believe she has internal beauties of the mind not 
the least inferior to those external excellences of the 
body, and she might perhaps, by the power of her 
mind alone, be absolute queen of the affections of 
men, if the small-pox threatened not too surely to 
be her further enemy, and, not contented to destroy 
the face, was not perversely bent to destroy the 
whole woman. But I want words to express my 
sorrow. I would not tell it if you did not extort the 
baneful secret from my bosom. This fair creature, 
whose beauty would make one wish her immortal, 
will, by the cruel means of the small-pox, give us too 
sudden a proof of her mortality. But neither the 
mother nor herself ought too much to repine at 
this, seeing it appears to be the decree of Providence, 
which is always to be interpreted as meant for our 
good, and seeing it may be the means of translating 
her the sooner only to her kindred angels, whose 
beauty she so much resembles here on earth, and to 
be among the lowest class of whom is better than 
being the greatest beauty of the world here below, 
and wearing an imperial crown. While I comfort 
you I cannot help the force of nature, which makes 
me grieve myself, and I only give you, because you 
compel me to it, so particular and so exact an answer 
to so particular and so exacting a question." 

The mother, who took the paper, was prudent 
enough to conceal from the daughter what he said, 
but nature would force its way, and bubbled from 

[in] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



her eyes ; and the daughter perceiving that, pressed 
hard to see it, and wept at the consideration that 
hard fate (though she knew not particularly what 
way) was to befall her. Never surely was anything 
so beautiful in tears, and I obtained of the mother 
to see the writing. At last, in general terms, to free 
her from suspense of mind, it was told her that some 
trouble should happen to her that would diminish 
her beauty. She had courage enough to hear that 
misfortune with disdain, and crying, " If that be all, 
I am armed, I don't place much pride in that, which 
I know age must shortly after destroy, if trouble did 
not do it before and she dried up her tears, and 
(if what Mr. Bruyere says be true, viz., that the last 
thing a celebrated woman thinks of when she dies is 
the loss of her beauty) she showed an admirable pat- 
tern of female philosophy in bearing such a cruel 
prediction with such unspeakable magnanimity as 
exceeded even the patience of stern stoicism, con- 
sidering she was a woman, to whom beauty is more 
dear than life. 

If any evil that is impending over people's heads 
could be evaded by foreknowledge, or eluded by art, 
she had the fairest opportunity of having this predic- 
tion annulled (which would have been more to the 
satisfaction of the predictor than knowing it verified) 
than ever any woman had. Her mother was specif- 
ically told that the fatal distemper should be the 
small-pox. Her father was, and is still, a very emi- 
nent physician ; and distempers of that kind especially 
are much more easily prevented by care than cured 
by art, and bv art more easilv set aside when there is a

timely warning given to a physician to prepare the 
body against the danger of the poison, than when the 
distemper has once caught hold of a body at una- 
wares, when it is unpurged of any gross humours 
that may accompany it. But neither the foreknowl- 
edge and caution of the mother, nor the skill and 
wisdom of the great physician her father, were suffi- 
cient to ward off the approaching harm that was 
written in the books of fate. Not many suns had 
finished their yearly courses before she was forced to 
submit to the inevitable stroke of death, after the 
infectious and malicious malady had first ravaged 
her beauty, rioted in all her sweets, and made an 
odious deformed spectacle of the charmer of mankind. 
The death of the daughter worked hard upon the 
mother's bowels, and dragged her speedily after her 
with a broken heart to the grave. 

This lady, whose fortune so great and so dis- 
tinguished an assembly had chosen to hear as a 
happy forerunner and lucky omen of all their own, 
which were to be asked afterwards in their turns, 
proving, so contrary to their expectations, already 
unfortunate in the prediction, and having been in 
tears about the matter, disheartened all the rest of 
the beauties from consulting him further that day. 
The person who kept the tavern, by name Mrs. Irwin, 
alleged that as some people were very fortunate and 
others unfortunate upon the same day, so one lady 
might be before told a mishap one minute, and 
another lady all the prosperity in nature the very 
next minute following, and therefore that what the 
unfortunate lady had heard was not to be taken as 
8 [113] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



ominous, or as what could malignantly influence 
the day, neither ought it to be the least hindrance 
to any who had the curiosity of being let into the 
secrets of time beforehand. However, whether the 
ladies were convinced or no, if she prevailed over 
their belief in that point she could not prevail over 
their humour, which (though they might not believe 
the former prediction ominous to themselves) was 
naturally awed for fear of the like, peradventure, for 
a time ; and so it was agreed, nemine contradicente> 
as a witty lady wrote it down, that no more petitions 
should for that day be presented by any of that 
company to his dumb, yet oracular, majesty. Mrs. 
Irwin, however, would have her way ; said she did 
not presume to such honour as to call herself of that 
company, and that therefore she might consult him 
without breaking through the votes of the assembly. 
Many endeavoured to dissuade her, but as she was 
passionately fond of knowing future events, and had 
a mighty itch to be very inquisitive with the oracle, 
about what might happen, not only to herself but 
her posterity ; it was agreed that he should have the 
liberty of satisfying her curiosity, since she presumed 
her fortune was sure to be so good, and was so for- 
ward and eager for the knowledge of it. But, alas, 
such is too often the fantastical impulse of nature 
unluckily depraved, that it carries often into wishes 
of knowing what when known we would be glad to 
unknow again, and then our memory will not let us 
be untaught. 

Mrs. Irw in was at that time in a pretty commodious 
way of business, everything in plenty round about her, 

[114] 



A PROUD MOTHER 

and lived more like a person of distinction, that kept 
such a cellar of wine, open house, and a free table, 
than like one who kept a tavern. She brought in 
her three pretty children, that were then almost 
babies, the youngest having not long been out of the 
nurse's arms, or trusted to the use of its own legs. 
These children she loved as a mother should love 
children ; they were the delight of her eyes all day, 
and the dream of her imagination all night. All the 
passions of her soul were confined to them ; she was 
never pleased but when they were so, and always angry 
if they were crossed ; her whole pride was centred in 
them, and they were clothed and were attended more 
like the infants of a princess than of a vintner's relict. 
The fortune of these was what she had near at heart, 
and of which she was so eager of being apprised. 
Her impatience was proportionate to the love she 
had for them, and which made her wish to foreknow 
all the happiness that was like to attend them. She 
sat cheerfully down, presented one to him, and smiling, 
wrote the question in general terms, viz., " Is this boy 
to be happy or unhappy ? " A melancholy look once 
more spread itself all over the face of the predictor, 
when he read the two inquisitive words, and he seemed 
mightily to regret being asked a question to which he 
was, by his talent of foreseeing, compelled to give so 
unwelcome an answer. The colour of the poor woman 
flushed and vanished alternately, and very quick, and 
she looked not quite like the picture of despair, but 
a disconsolate woman, with little hopes on one hand, 
and great doubts and dismal fears on the other. She 
confessed she read great evil in the troubles of his 

[115] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



face, thanked him for his good nature, told him that 
they all knew, that though he could foretell, he could 
not alter the acts and decretals of fate, and therefore 
desired him to tell her the worst, for that the mis- 
fortunes, were they never so great, would be less 
dreadful to her than remaining in the state of fear 
and suspension. He at last wrote down to her that 
great and unexpected and even unavoidable accidents 
would involve the whole family in new calamities, 
that the son she asked him about would have the 
bitterest task of hardship to go through withal, while 
he lived, and that to finish all more unhappily, he 
would be basely and maliciously brought to an un- 
timely end, by some mortal enemy or other ; but that 
she should not trouble herself so much on that head, 
she would never see it, for it would happen some 
years after she was departed from the world. This 
melancholy account closed up the book of predictions 
for that day, and put a sad stop to all the projected 
mirth and curiosity. Now I must tell the reader 
how and when the event answered the prediction, 
and in a few words, it was thus : poor Mrs. Irwin, by 
strange accidents, decayed in the world, and dying 
poor, her sons were forced to be put apprentices to 
small trades ; and the son whom the above-mentioned 
prediction concerned was, for stealing one cheese from 
a man in the Haymarket, severely prosecuted at the 
Old Bailey, and on Wednesday, the twenty-third of 
December, 1713, hanged at Tyburn, with several 
other criminals. 

The two foregoing passages are of so tragical a 
nature that it is time I should relieve the minds of 

[116] 



TWO FAIR WOMEN 



my readers with some histories of ladies who con- 
sulted him with more success and advantage, to whom 
his predictions were very entertaining, when they came 
to pass in their favour, the relation whereof will con- 
sequently be agreeable to all readers who have within 
them a mixture of happy curiosity and good-nature. 

Two ladies, who were the most remarkable beauties 
in London, and the most courted, turned at the same 
time their thoughts to matrimony, and being satiated, 
I may say wearied, with the pleasure of having con- 
tinually after them a great number and variety of 
adorers, resolved each, about the same time, to make 
a choice of their several men, to whom they thought 
they could give most happiness, and from whom they 
might receive most. Their names (for they are both 
persons of distinction) shall be Christallina and Ur- 
bana. Christallina was a virgin, and Urbana a young 
widow. Christallina engrossed the eyes, the hearts, 
and the sighs of the whole court, and wherever she 
appeared put any court lady out of her place that 
had one before in the heart of any youth, and was 
the celebrated toast among the beau monde. Ur- 
bana's beauty made as terrible a havoc in the city ; 
all the citizens' 1 daughters that had many admirers, 
and were in fair hopes of having husbands when they 
pleased themselves, as soon as Urbana had lost her 
old husband, found that they every day lost their 
lovers, and it was a great fear among the pretti- 
est maids that they should remain maids still, as 
long as Urbana remained a widow. She was the 
monopoliser of city affection, and made many girls 
that had large stocks of suitors bankrupts in the 

[117] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



trade of courtship, and broke some of their hearts 
when her charms broke off their amours. Well, 
but the day was near at hand when both the belles 
of the court and the city damsels were to be freed 
from the ravages which these two tyrants, trium- 
phant in beauty, and insolent in charms, made among 
the harvest of love. Each had seen her proper man, 
to whom the enjoyment of her person was to be 
dedicated for life. But it being an affair of so last- 
ing importance, each had a mind to be let into the 
knowledge of the consequences of such a choice, as 
far as possible, before they stepped into the irrevo- 
cable state of matrimony. Both of them happened to 
take it into their heads that the best way to be en- 
tirely satisfied in their curiosity was to have recourse 
to the great predictor of future occurrences, Mr. Dun- 
can Campbell, whose fame was at that time spread 
pretty largely about the town. Christallina and 
Urbana were not acquainted with each other, only 
by the report which fame had made of beauty. They 
came to Mr. Campbell's on the same day, and both 
with the same resolution of keeping themselves con- 
cealed, and under masks, that none of the company 
of consulters who happened to be there might know 
who they were. It happened that on that very day, 
just when they came, Mr. Campbell's rooms were 
more than ordinarily crowded with curious clients of 
the fair sex, so that he was obliged to desire these 
two ladies, who expressed so much precaution against 
and fear of having their persons discovered, to be 
contented with only one room between them, and 
with much ado they complied with the request, and 

[118] 



AN EFFECTIVE SNEEZE 



condescended to sit together incog. Distant com- 
pliments of gesture passed between them, the dress 
and comportment of each making them appear to be 
persons of figure and breeding, and after three or 
four modish curtsies, down they sat, without so much 
as once opening their lips, or intending so to do. 
The silence between them was very formal and pro- 
found for near half-an-hour, and nothing was heard 
but the snapping of fans, which they both did very 
tunably, and with great harmony, and played, as it 
were, in concert. 

At last one of the civil well-bred mutes happen- 
ing to sneeze, the other very gracefully bowed, and 
before she was well aware out popped the words, 
" Bless you, madam.'" The fair sneezer returned the 
bow with an " I thank you, madam.'" They found 
they did not know one another's voices, and they 
began to talk very merrily together, with pretty great 
confidence, and they taking a mutual liking from con- 
versation, so much familiarity grew thereupon in- 
stantly between them, that they began not only to 
unmask, but to unbosom themselves to one another, 
and confess alternately all their secrets. Christallina 
owned who she was, and told Urbana the beau and 
courtier that had her heart. Urbana as frankly de- 
clared that she was a widow, that she would not be- 
come the lady's rival, that she had pitched upon a 
second husband, an alderman of the city. Just by 
that time they had had their chat out, and wished 
one another the pleasure of a successful prediction, 
it came to Cristallina's turn to visit the dumb gentle- 
man, and receive from his pen oracular answers to 

[119] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



all the questions she had to propose. Well, he ac- 
cordingly satisfied her in every point she asked him 
about ; but while she was about this, one of Mr. 
Campbell's family going with Urbana to divert her 
a little, the widow railed at the virgin as a fool, to 
imagine that she should ever make a conquest of the 
brightest spark about the court, and then let fly 
some random bolts of malice to wound her reputa- 
tion for chastity. Now it became the widow's turn 
to go and consult, and the same person of Mr. Camp- 
bell's family in the meantime entertained Christallina. 
The maid was not behindhand with the widow ; she 
railed against the widow, represented her as sometimes 
a coquette, sometimes a lady of pleasure, sometimes 
a jilt, and lifted up her hands in wonder and amaze- 
ment that Urbana should imagine so rich a man as 
an alderman such-a-one should fall to her lot. Thus 
Urbana swore and protested that Christallina could 
never arrive at the honour of being the wife to the 
courtly Secretarius, let Mr. Campbell flatter her as 
he would ; and Christallina vowed that Campbell 
must be a downright wizard if he foretold that such 
a one as Urbana would get Alderman Stiffrump for 
a husband, provided a thing so improbable should 
come to pass. 

However, it seems Duncan had told them their 
own names and the names of their suitors, and told 
them further, how soon they were both to be mar- 
ried, and that, too, directly to their hearts' content, 
as they said rejoicingly to themselves, and made 
their mutual gratulations. 

They went away each satisfied that she should

MUTUAL DETRACTION 



have her own lover, but Christallina laughed at Mr. 
Campbell for assigning the alderman to Urbana, and 
Urbana laughed at him for promising the courtier 
to the arms of Christallina. 

This is a pretty good figure of the tempers of two 
reigning toasts with regard to one another. 

First, their curiosity made them, from resolving to 
be concealed, discover one another wilfully, from utter 
strangers grow as familiar as old friends in a moment, 
swear one another to secrecy, and exchange the sen- 
timents of their hearts together, and from being 
friends become envious of each other's enjoying a 
similitude of happiness ; the compliments made on 
either side face to face were, upon the turning of the 
back, turned into reflections, detraction, and ridi- 
cule ; each was a self-lover and admirer of her own 
beauty and merit, and a despiser of the other's. 

However, Duncan Campbell proved at last to be 
in the right. Urbana was wrong in her opinion of 
Christallina 1 s want of power over Secretarius, and 
Christallina was as much out in her opinion that 
Urbana vould miss in her aim of obtaining Stiff- 
rump; for they both proved in the right of what 
they thought with regard to their own dear single 
persons, and were made happy according to their 
expectations, just at the time foretold by Mr. 
Campbell. 

Christallina 1 s ill wishes did not hinder Urbana 
from being mistress of Alderman StifFrump , s person 
and stock, nor did Urbana's hinder Christallina from 
showing herself a shining bride at the ring in Sec- 
retary's gilded chariot, drawn by six prancers of 

[121 J 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



the proud Belgian kind, with her half-dozen of liveries, 
with favours in their hats, waiting her return at the 
gate of Hyde Park. Both loved and both envied, but 
both allowed of Mr. Campbell's foreknowledge. 

Having told you two very sorrowful passages, and 
one tolerably successful and entertaining, I shall now 
relate to you another of my own knowledge, that is 
mixed up with the grievous and the pleasant, and 
chequered, as it were, with the shade and the sun- 
shine of fortune. 

Though there are vicissitudes in every stage of 
life under the sun, and not one ever ran continually 
on with the same series of prosperity, yet those con- 
ditions which are the most liable to the signal alter- 
ations of fortune, are the conditions of merchants, 
for professed gamesters I reckon in a manner as men 
of no condition of life at all, but what comes under 
the statute of vagabonds. 

It was, indeed, as the reader would guess, a worthy 
and a wealthy merchant, who was to run through 
these different circumstances of being. He came and 
visited our Mr. Campbell in the year 1707 ; he found 
him amidst a crowd of consulters, and being very 
eager and solicitous to know his own fortune just at 
that critical juncture of time, he begged of him (if 
possible) to adjourn his other clients to the day fol- 
lowing, and sacrifice that one wholly to his use, 
which, as it was probably more important than all 
the others together, so he wrote down that he would 
render the time spent about it more advantageous 
to Mr. Campbell, and by way of previous encourage- 
ment, threw him down ten guineas as a retaining fee. 

[ 122 J 



AN IMPORTANT CASE 



Mr. Campbell, who held money in very little 
esteem, and valued it so much too little that he has 
often had my reprehensions on that head, paused a 
little, and after looking earnestly in the gentleman's 
face, and reading there, as I suppose, in that little 
space of time in general, according to the power of 
the second-sight, that what concerned him was highly 
momentous, wrote him this answer, that he would 
comply with his request, adjourn his other clients 
to the day following, and set apart all the rem- 
nant of that, till night, for inspecting the future 
occurrences of which he had a mind to be made a 
master. 

There is certainly a very keen appetite in curiosity. 
It cannot stay for satisfaction ; it is pressing for its 
necessary repast, and is without all patience. Hunger 
and thirst are not appetites more vehement and 
more hard and difficult to be repressed than that of 
curiosity ; nothing but the present now is able to 
allay it. A more expressive picture of this I never 
beheld than in the faces of some, and the murmurs 
and complaints of others in that little inquisitive 
company, when the unwelcome note was given about 
signifying an adjournment for only twenty-four 
hours. 

The colour of a young woman there came and 
went a hundred times (if possible) in the space of 
two minutes ; she blushed like a red rose this moment, 
and in the switch of an eyelash she was all over as 
pale as a white one. The suitor, whose name her 
heart had gone pit-a-pat for the space of an hour to 
be informed of from the pen of a seer, was now de- 

[123] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



ferred a whole day longer ; she was once or twice 
within an ace of swooning away, but he comforted 
her in particular by telling her (though he said it 
only by way of jest) that the day following would be 
a more lucky day to consult about husbands than 
the present that she came on. The answer was a 
kind of cordial to her hopes, and brought her a little 
better to herself. 

Two others, I remember, sisters and old maids, 
that it seems were misers, women ordinarily dressed, 
and in blue aprons, and yet by relation worth no less 
than two thousand pounds each, were in a peck of 
troubles about his going and leaving them unsatis- 
fied. They came upon an inquiry after goods that 
were stolen, and they complained that by next morn- 
ing at that time, the thief might be got far enough 
off, and creep into so remote a corner, that he would 
put it beyond the power of the devil, and the art of 
conjuration, to find him out, and bring him back 
again. The disturbance and anxiety that was to be 
seen in their countenances was just like that which 
is to be beheld in the face of a great losing game- 
ster, when his all, his last great stake, lies upon the 
table, and is just sweeping off by another winning 
hand into his own hat. 

The next was a widow, who bounced because, as 
she pretended, he would not tell her what was best 
to do with her sons, and what profession it would be 
most happy for them to be put to ; but in reality 
all the cause of the widow's fuming and fretting was, 
not that she wanted to provide for her sons, but for 
herself ; she wanted a second husband, and was not 

[ 124 ] 



A WIDOW EXPECTANT 



half so solicitous about being put in a way of edu- 
cating those children she had already, as of knowing 
when she should be in a likelihood of getting more. 
This was certainly in her thoughts, or else she would 
never have flounced about in her weeds, from one 
end of the room to the other, and all the while of 
her passion smile by fits upon the merchant, and 
leer upon a young pretty Irish fellow that was 
there. The young Irishman made use of a little eye- 
language ; she grew appeased, went away in quite 
a good humour, scuttled too airily downstairs for a 
woman in her clothes, and the reason was certainly 
that she knew the matter before, which we took 
notice of presently after; the Irishman went pre- 
cipitately after her downstairs without taking his 
leave. 

But neither were the two misers for their gold, 
the virgin for a first husband, nor the widow for a 
second, half so eager, as another married woman 
there, was for the death of her spouse. She had put 
the question in so expecting a manner for a lucky 
answer, and with so much keen desire appearing 
plainly in her looks, that no big-bellied woman was 
ever more eager for devouring fruit ; no young hasty 
bridegroom, just married to a beauty, more impa- 
tient for night and enjoyment, than she was to know 
(what she thought a more happy moment), the mo- 
ment of her husband's last agonising gasp. As her 
expectation was the greatest, so was her disappoint- 
ment too, and consequently her disorder, upon his 
going and leaving her unresolved. She was frantic, 
raging, and implacable ; she was in such a fury at the 

[125] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

delay of putting off her answer to the day following, 
that in her fury she acted as if she would have given 
herself an answer, which of the two should die first, by 
choking herself upon the spot, with the indignation 
that swelled in her stomach and rose into her throat 
on that occasion. It may look like a romance to say 
it, but indeed they were forced to cut her lace, and 
then she threw out of the room with great passion ; 
but yet had so much of the enraged wife left (beyond 
the enraged woman) as to return instantly upstairs, 
and signify very calmly, she would be certain to be 
there next day, and beseeched earnestly that she 
might not meet with a second disappointment. 

All this hurry and bustle created a stay a little 
too tedious for the merchant, who began to be impa- 
tient himself, especially when word was brought up 
that a fresh company was come in : but Mr. Camp- 
bell was denied to them ; and to put a stop to 
any more interruptions, the merchant and the dumb 
gentleman agreed to slip into a coach, drive to a 
tavern in the city, and settle matters of futurity over 
a bottle of French claret. 

The first thing done at the tavern was Mr. Camp- 
bell's saluting him upon a piece of paper by his name, 
and drinking his health. The next paper held a 
discourse of condolence for a disaster that was passed 
long since, namely, a great and considerable loss that 
happened to his family in the dreadful conflagration 
of the city of London. In the third little dialogue 
which they had together, he told the merchant that 
losses and advantages were general topics, which a 
person, unskilled in that art, might venture to assign 

[ 126 ] 



SUSPENSE OF MIND 



to any man of his profession, it being next to impos- 
sible that persons who traffic should not sometimes 
gain and sometimes lose. — " But," said Mr. Camp- 
bell, " I will sketch out particularly and specify to 
you some future misfortunes, with which you will 
unavoidably meet ; 't is in your stars, it is in destiny, 
that you should have some trials, and therefore, 
when you are forewarned, take a prudent care to be 
forearmed with patience, and by longanimity, and 
meekly and resignedly enduring your lot, render it 
more easy, since impatience can't avert it, and will 
only render it more burthensome and heavy." He 
gave these words to the merchant, who pressed for 
his opinion that moment. " By your leave," resum- 
ing the pen, said the dumb gentleman in writing, 
f* we will have this bottle out first and tap a fresh 
one, that you may be warmed with courage enough 
to receive the first speculative onset of ill fortune 
that I shall predict to you, with a good grace, and 
that may perhaps enable you to meet it, when it 
comes to reduce itself into action, with a manful 
purpose and all becoming resolution." The merchant 
agreed to the proposal, and put on an air of the 
careless and indifferent as well as he could, to signify 
that he had no need to raise up an artificial courage 
from the auxiliary forces of the grape. But nature, 
when hard pressed, will break through all disguises, 
and not only notwithstanding the air of pleasantry 
he gave himself, which appeared forced and con- 
strained, but in spite of two or three sparkling and 
enlivening bumpers, a cloud of care would ever and 
anon gather and shoot heavily across his brow, 

[127] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



though he laboured all he could to dispel it as 
quickly, and to keep fair weather in his countenance. 

Well, they had cracked the first bottle and the 
second succeeded upon the table, and they called to 
blow a pipe together. This pipe Mr. Campbell 
found had a very ill effect ; it is certainly a pensive 
kind of instrument, and fills a mind anything so dis- 
posed with disturbing thoughts, black fumes, and 
melancholy vapours, as certainly as it doth the mouth 
with smoke. It plainly took away even the little 
sparks of vivacity which the wine had given before ; 
so he wrote for a truce of firing those sort of noxious 
guns any longer, and they laid down their arms by 
consent, and drank off the second bottle. A third 
immediately supplied its place, and at the first glass 
of the opening of the bottle Mr. Campbell began to 
open to him his future case in the following words : 
— " Sir, you have now some ventures at sea from 
such and such a place, to such a value. Do not be 
discomforted at the news which you certainly will 
have within three months (but "'twill be false at last), 
that they are, by three different tempests, made the 
prey of the great ocean, and enrich the bottom of 
the sea, the palace of Neptune. A worse storm than 
all these attends you at home, a wife who is and will 
be more the tempest of the house wherein she lives. 
The high and lofty winds of her vanity will blow 
down the pillars of your house and family ; the high 
tide of her extravagance will roll on like a resistless 
torrent, and leave you at low water, and the ebb of 
all your fortunes. This is the highest and the most 
cutting disaster that is to befall you ; your real ship- 

[ 128 ] 



A GLOOMY OUTLOOK 



wreck is not foreign but domestic ; your bosom friend 
is to be your greatest foe, and even your powerful 
undoer for a time ; mark what I say, and take cour- 
age ; it shall be but for a time provided you take 
courage ; it will, upon that condition, be only a short 
and wholesome taste of adversity given to you, that 
you may relish returning prosperity with virtue, and 
with a greater return of thanks to Him that dis- 
penses it at pleasure to mankind. Remember, 
courage and resignation is what I advise you to ; use 
it, as becomes you, in your adversity, and believe 
that as I foretold that adversity, so I can foretell 
a prosperity will again be the consequence of those 
virtues ; and the more you feel the one ought not to 
cast you down, but raise your hopes the more, that 
he who foretold you that so exactly could likewise 
foretell you the other. " The merchant was by this 
put into a great suspense of mind, but somewhat 
easier, by the second prediction being annexed so 
kindly to the first fatal one. They crowned the 
night with a flask of Burgundy, and then parting, 
each went to their respective homes. 

The reader may perchance wonder how I, who 
make no mention of my being there (as in truth I 
was not at the tavern), should be able to relate this 
as of my own knowledge ; but if he pleases to have 
patience to the end of the story, he will have entire 
satisfaction in that point. 

About half a year after the merchant came again, 
told him that his prediction was too far verified, to 
his very dear cost, and that he was now utterly un- 
done and beyond any visible means of a future 
9 [ 129 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



recovery, and doubting lest the other fortunate part 
of the prediction was only told him by way of en- 
couragement (for groundless doubts and fears always 
attend a mind implunged in melancholy), besought 
him very earnestly to tell him candidly and sincerely 
if there was no real prospect of good, and rid him at 
once of the uneasiness of such a suspension of thought ; 
" but pray do," said he, with all the vehemence of 
repeated expostulation, 44 satisfy me if there are any 
further hopes on this side the grave ? " 

To this Duncan Campbell made a short but a very 
significant reply in writing. 44 May the heavens 
preserve you from a threatening danger of life. Take 
care only of yourself, great and mighty care, and if 
you outlive Friday next, you will yet be great and 
more fortunate than ever you was in all the height 
of your former most flourishing space of life." He 
coloured inordinately when Duncan Campbell said 
Friday, and conjured him to tell him as particularly 
as he could what he meant by Friday. He told 
him he could not particularise any further, but that 
great danger threatened him that day ; and that 
without extraordinary precaution it would prove 
fatal to him, even to death. He shook his head, and 
w ent away in a very sorrowful plight. Friday passed, 
Saturday came, and on that very Saturday morning 
came likewise the joyful tidings that what ventures 
of his were given over for lost at sea were all come 
safe into the harbour. He came the moment he re- 
ceived those despatches from his agent to Mr. Duncan 
Campbell's apartment, embraced him tenderly, and 
saluted him with much gladness of heart, before a 

[130] 



A FAMOUS ORACLE 



great room full of ladies, where I happened to be 
present at the time ; crying out in a loud voice, be- 
fore he knew what he said, that Mr. Campbell had 
saved his life ; that Friday was his birthday, and he 
had intended with a pistol to shoot himself that very 
day. The ladies thought him mad ; and he, recov- 
ered from his ecstasy, said no more, but sat down till 
Mr. Campbell dismissed all his clients •, and then we 
three went to the tavern together, where he told me 
the whole little history or narrative just as is above 
related. 

The fame which Mr. Duncan Campbell got by the 
foregoing and several other predictions of the like kind, 
was become very large and extensive, and had spread 
itself into the remotest corners of this metropolis. 
The squares rung with it ; it was whispered from one 
house to another through the more magnificent streets, 
where persons of quality and distinction reside ; it 
catched every house in the city, like the news of stock 
from Exchange Alley ; it run noisily through the lanes 
and little thoroughfares where the poor inhabit ; it 
was the chat of the tea-table, and the babble of the 
streets, and the whole town, from the top to the bot- 
tom, was full of it. Whenever any reputation rises 
to a degree like this, let it be for what art or accom- 
plishment, or on what account soever it will, malice, 
envy, and detraction are sure to be the immediate 
pursuers of it with full mouth and to hunt it down, 
if possible, with full cry. Even the great Nostrada- 
mus, though favoured by kings and queens (which 
always without any other reason creates enemies), 
was not more pursued by envy and detraction for his 

[131] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



predictions in Paris and throughout France, than our 
Duncan Campbell was in London, and even through- 
out England. Various, different, and many were the 
objections raised to blot his character and extenuate 
his fame, that, when one was confuted, another might 
not be wanting to supply its place, and so to main- 
tain a course and series of backbiting according to 
the known maxim — " Throw dirt, and if it does 
not stick, throw dirt continually, and some will 
stick." 

Neither is there any wonder ; for a man, that has 
got applauders of all sorts and conditions, must ex- 
pect condemners and detractors of all sorts and 
conditions likewise. If a lady of high degree, for 
example, should say, smiling (though really thinking 
absolutely what she says), for fear of being thought 
over-credulous, " Well, I vow some things Mr. Camp- 
bell does are surprising, after all ; they would be apt 
to incline one to a belief that he is a wonder of a 
man, for one would imagine the things he does im- 
possible," why, then, a prude, with an assumed 
supercilious air and a scornful "tihee," would, in 
order to seem more wise than she was, reply, " Lard, 
madam, it is more a wonder to me that you can be 
imposed upon so. I vow to Gad, madam, I would 
as soon consult an almanac-maker, and pin my faith 
upon what he pricks down ; or believe, like my creed, 
in the cross which I make upon the hand of a gipsy. 
Lard, madam, I assure your laship he knows no more 
than I do of you. I assure you so, and therefore 
believe me. He has it all by hearsay." If the lady 
that believed it should reply, that if he had notice of 

[ 132] 



MALICE AND FOLLY 



every stranger by hearsay, he must be a greater man 
than she suspected, and must keep more spies in pay 
than a prime minister, the prude's answer would be 
with a loud laugh, and giggling out these words, 
" Lard, madam, I assure you nothing can be more 
easy ; and so take it for granted." Because she was 
inclined to say so, and had the act of wisdom on her 
side, forsooth, that she appeared hard of belief (which 
some call hard to be put upon), and the other lady 
credulous (which some, though believing upon good 
grounds, are called) and so thought foolish ; the 
prude's answer would be thought sufficient and con- 
vincing. 

Thus malice and folly, by dint of noise and impu- 
dence, and strong though empty assertions, often run 
down modesty and good sense. Among the common 
people it is the same, but only done in a different man- 
ner. For example, an ordinary person that had con- 
sulted might say (as he walked along), "There goes 
the dumb gentleman, who writes down any name of a 
stranger at first sight ; " up steps a blunt fellow, that 
takes stubbornness for sense, and. says, " That is a 
confounded lie ; he is a cheat and an impostor, and 
you are one of his accomplices. Hell tell me my 
name, I suppose, if you tell it him first. He is no 
more dumb than I am ; he can speak and hear as 
well as us, I have been with those that say they have 
heard him. I wish I and two or three more had him 
in our stable, and I warrant you with our cart- whips 
we would lick some words out of his chops, as dumb 
as you call him. I tell you 't is all a lie and all a bite." 
If the other desires to be convinced for himself by 

[133] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



his own experience, the rougher rogue, who perhaps 
has stronger sinews than the other, answers, " If you 
lie any further I will knock you down ; " and so he is 
the vulgar wit, and the mouth of the rabble-rout, and 
thus the detraction spreads below with very good suc- 
cess, as it does above in another kind. 

As there are two comical adventures in his life 
which directly suit and correspond with the fore- 
going reflections, this seems the most proper place 
to insert them in. The first consists of a kind of 
mob- way of usage he met with from a fellow, who got 
to be an officer in the army, but by the following be- 
haviour will be found unworthy of the name and the 
commission. 

In the year 1701 a lady of good quality came and 
addressed herself to him much after the following 
manner. She told him she had choice of lovers, but 
preferred one above the rest, but desired to know his 
name, and if she made him her choice what would 
be the subsequent fate of such a matrimony. Mr. 
Duncan Campbell very readily gave her down in 
writing this plain and honest reply : — That of all 
her suitors she was most inclined to a captain, a dis- 
tinguished officer and a great beau (naming his name), 
and one that had a great many outward engaging 
charms sufficient to blind the eyes of any lady that 
was not thoroughly acquainted with his manner of 
living. He therefore assured her (and thought him- 
self bound, being conjured so to do, having recei ved 
his fee, though there was danger in such plain and 
open predictions) that he was a villain and a rogue in 
his heart, a profligate gamester, and that if she took 

[ 134 ] 



TREACHERY AND REVENGE 

him to her bed she would only embrace her own ruin. 
The lady's woman, who was present, being in fee with 
the captain, resolving to give intelligence for fear the 
officer, her so good friend, should be disappointed in 
the siege, slily shuffled the papers into her pocket, 
and made a present of them to the military spark. 
Fired with indignation at the contents, he vowed re- 
venge, and in order to compass it conspires with his 
female spy about the means. In fine, for fear of 
losing the lady though he quarrelled with Duncan 
Campbell, a method was to be found out how to se- 
cure her by the very act of revenge. At last it was 
resolved to discover to her that he had found out 
what she had been told by Mr. Campbell, but the 
way how he had been informed was to remain a 
secret. He did do so, and ended his discovery with 
these words : — "I desire, madam, that if I prove 
him an impostor you would not believe a word he 
says."' 1 The lady agreed to so fair a proposal. Then 
the captain swore that he himself would never eat a 
piece of bread more till he had made Mr. Campbell 
eat his words ; nay, he insisted upon it that he would 
bring him to his tongue, and make him own by word 
of mouth that what he had written before was false 
and calumnious. To which the lady answered again, 
that if he performed what he said she would be con- 
vinced. This brave military man, however, not re- 
lying upon his own single valour and prowess to 
bring about so miraculous a thing as the making a 
person that was dumb to speak, he took with him 
for this end three lusty assistants to combine with 
him in the assassination. The ambuscade was settled 

[135] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

to be at the Five Bells tavern in Wych Street in the 
Strand. After the ambush was settled with so much 
false courage, the business of decoying Mr. Campbell 
into it was not practicable any other way than by 
sending out false colours. The lady's woman, who 
was by her own interest tied fast to the interest of 
the beau, was to play the trick of Dalilah, and betray 
this deaf and dumb Samson (as he will appear to be 
a kind of one in the sequel of the story) into the 
hands of these Philistines. She smooths her face 
over with a complimenting lie from her mistress to 
Mr. Campbell, and acted her part of deceit so well 
that he promised to follow her to the Five Bells with 
all haste, and so she scuttled back to prepare the 
captain, and to tell him how lucky she was in mis- 
chief, and how she drew him out by smiles into per- 
dition. The short of the story is, when they got him 
in among them they endeavoured to assassinate him, 
but they missed of their aim ; yet it is certain they 
left him in a very terrible and bloody condition, and 
the captain went away in as bad a plight as the per- 
son was left in whom he assaulted so cowardly with 
numbers, and to such disadvantage. I was sent for 
to him upon this disaster, and the story was delivered 
to me thus by one of the drawers of the tavern when 
I inquired into it : — They began to banter him, and 
speaking to him as if he heard, asked him if he knew 
hia own fortune; they told him it was to be beaten 
to death. This was an odd way of addressing a deaf 
and dumb man. They added they would make him 
speak before they had done. The boy seeing he 
made no reply, but only smiled, thought what passed 

[ 136 ] 



A MURDEROUS ATTACK 



between them was a jest with an old acquaintance, 
and withdrew about his business. The door being 
fastened, however, before they began the honourable 
attack, they vouchsafed to write down their intent in 
the words above mentioned, which they had uttered 
before, to make sure that he should understand their 
meaning, and what this odd way of correction was for. 
All the while, the maid who had brought him into it, 
was peeping through a hole, and watching the event, 
as appears afterwards. Mr. Campbell wrote them the 
following answer, viz., that he hoped for fair play ; 
that he understood bear-garden as well as they ; but 
if a gentleman was amongst them he would expect 
gentlemanly usage. 

The rejoinder they made to this consisted, it 
seems, not of words, but of action. The officer, in 
conjunction with another ruffian, one of the strong- 
est of the three he had brought, commenced the 
assault. As good luck would have it, he warded off 
their first blows, it seems, with tolerable success, and 
a wine quart pot standing upon the table, Duncan 
took to his arms, and at two or three quick blows, 
well managed, and close laid in upon the assailants, 
felled them both to the ground. Here it was that 
the maid discovered her knowledge of it and privity 
to the plot to the whole house; for she no sooner 
sees the famous leader, the valiant captain, lie sprawl- 
ing on the floor with bleeding temples, but she 
shrieked out with all the voice she could exert, 
" Murder, murder, murder ! " Alarmed at this out- 
cry, the master and all the attendants of the tavern 
scampered upstairs, burst into the room, and found

MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

Duncan Campbell struggling with the other two, 
and the quart pot still fast clenched in his hand, 
which they were endeavouring to wrench from him. 
The drawers rescued him out of their hands, and 
inquired into the matter. The maid in a fright 
confessed the whole thing. The officer and his asso- 
ciate rubbed their eyes as recovering from a stun- 
ning sleep, reeled as they went to rise, paid the 
reckoning, and slunk pitifully away, or, as the rake^ 
term for it is, — they brushed off, and for all their 
odds had the worst of the lay. I, who had some 
authority with Mr. Campbell, by reason of my years 
and the strict acquaintance I had with his mother, 
when I came and found him in that pickle, and had 
the whole relation told me by the people of the 
house, though I could not forbear pitying him 
within my own mind, took upon me to reprehend him, 
and told him that these hardships would by Prov- 
idence be daily permitted to fall upon him (for he 
met with them twenty times) while he continued in 
that irregular way of living and spending his time, 
that might be so precious to himself and many others, 
in drunkenness and debauchery ; and I think the 
lessons I wrote down to him upon that head, though 
a little severe just at that juncture, were, notwith- 
standing, well timed, and did, as I guessed they 
would, make a more solid impression on him than at 
any other. In all these scuffles (whether it is that 
being deaf and dumb an affront works deeper upon 
a man, and so renders him far more fierce and res- 
olute) it must be said that, though nature has been 
very kind in making him very strong, robust, and 

[138] 



A LADY OF DISTINCTION 



active withal, yet he has bore some shocks one would 
imagine beyond the strength of a man, having some- 
times got the better of five or six ruffians in ren- 
counters of the like kind. 

The next banter he met with was in a gentler 
way from an unbelieving lady, and yet she came off 
with very ill success, and the banter turned all upon 
herself in the end. 

A lady of distinction, whose name shall therefore 
be concealed in this place, came with two or three 
of her special friends, who took her for the most 
merry, innocent, spotless virgin upon earth, and whose 
modesty was never suspected in the least by her rela- 
tions or servants that were nearest about her ; after 
having rallied Mr. Campbell with several frivolous 
questions, doubting his capacity, and vexing and teas- 
ing him with gay impertinences beyond all patience, 
was by him told that he did not take fees in his pro- 
fession to be made a jest of like a common fortune- 
teller, but to do real good to those who consulted him, 
as far as he was able by his predictions ; that he was 
treated with more respect by persons of a higher con- 
dition, though her own was very good, and so offered 
her guinea back again with a bow and a smile. She 
had a little more generosity of spirit than not to be 
a little nettled at the proffer she had caused by so 
coarse an usage. She affected appearing grave a little, 
and told him she would be serious for the future, and 
asked him to set down her name, which she had neg- 
lected before, to ask other questions that were nothing 
to the purpose. He promised to write it down, but 
pausing a little longer than ordinary about it, she 

[ 139 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

returned to her former way of uncivil merriment and 
ungallant raillery. She repeated to him, in three or 
four little scraps of paper, one after another, as 
fast as she could write them, the same words, viz., 
that he could not tell her name, nor whether she 
was maid, wife, or widow ; and laughed as if she 
would split her sides, triumphing to the rest of her 
companions over his ignorance and her own wit, as 
if she had posed him and put him to an entire 
stand. But see what this overweening opinion of 
security ended in : the man of the second-sight was 
not to be so easily baffled. Vexed at being so dis- 
turbed, and coming out of his brown study, he reaches 
the paper and begins to write. Now it was the lady's 
turn to suffer ; she had deserved hearty punishment, 
and it came into her hands with the note to a degree 
of severity (as you will perceive by the contents of it 
just now). She read it, and swooning away, dropped 
from her chair. The whole room being in a bustle, I 
that was in the outward chamber ran in. While Mr. 
Campbell was sprinkling water in her face, a lady 
snatched up the note to read it, at which he seemed 
mightily displeased. I therefore, who understood his 
signs, recovered it out of her hands by stratagem, and 
ran to burn it, which I did so quick that I was not 
discovered in the curiosity, which I must own I satis- 
fied myself in by reading it first ; a curiosity raised 
too high by so particular an adventure, to be over- 
come in so little a time of thought, as I was to keep 
it in my hands ; and so I came by the knowledge of 
it myself without being informed by Mr. Campbell. 
Tin's shows how a sudden curiosity, when there is not 

[ 140 ] 



A QUICK CONVERSION 



time given to think and correct it, may overcome a 
man as well as a woman ; for I was never over curi- 
ous in my life, and though I was pleased with the 
oddness of the adventure, I often blushed to myself 
since for the unmanly weakness of not being able to 
step with a note from one room to another, to the 
fireside, without peeping into the contents of it. 
The contents of it were these. 44 Madam, since you 

provoke me, your name is . You are no widow, 

you are no wife, and yet you are no maid ; you have 
a child at nurse at such a place, by such a gentleman, 
and you were brought to bed in Leicestershire." The 
lady, convinced by this answer of his strange and 
mystical power, and pleased with his civility in en- 
deavouring to conceal from others the secret, after 
so many repeated provocations, though she showed 
great disorder for that day, became one of his con- 
stant attenders some time after, and would not take 
any step in her affairs without his advice, which, she 
often has said since, she found very much to her ad- 
vantage. She was as serious in her dealings with 
him afterwards, and improved by being so, as she was 
gay and turbulent with him before, and smarted for 
it. In fine, she was a thorough convert, and a votary 
of his ; and the only jest she used afterwards to make 
concerning him was a civil witticism to his wife, to 
whom she was wont, every now and then, smiling, to 
address herself after this manner — 44 Your husband, 
madam, is a devil, but he is a very handsome and a 
very civil one."" 

Not long after this came another lady with a like 
intent to impose upon him, and was resolved, as she 

[141] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

owned, to have laughed him to scorn if she had suc- 
ceeded in her attempt. She had very dexterously 
dressed herself in her woman^ habit, and her woman 
in her own ; her footman squired the new-made lady 
in a very gentlemanly dress, hired, for the purpose of 
a disguise, from Monmouth Street. The strange and 
unknown masqueraders entered Mr. Campbell's room 
with much art. The fellow was by nature of a clean 
make and had a good look, and from following a 
genteel master when he was young, copied his gait a 
little, and had some appearance of a mien, and a tol- 
erable good air about him. But this being the first 
time of his being so fine, and he a little vain in his 
temper, he over-acted his part : he strutted too much ; 
he was as fond of his ruffles, his watch, his sword, his 
cane, and his snuff-box, as a boy of being newly 
breeched ; and viewed them all too often to be thought 
the possessor of any such things long. The affectation 
of the chambermaid was insufferable ; she had the 
toss of the head, the jut of the bum, the sidelong 
leer of the eye, the imperious look upon her lady, now 
degraded into her woman, that she was intolerable, 
and a person without the gift of the second-sight 
would have guessed her to have been a pragmatical 
upstart, though it is very probable that during that 
time she fancied herself really better than her mis- 
tress. The mistress acted her part of maid the b(^t, 
for it is easier for genteel modesty to act a low part 
than for affected vanity to act a high one. She 
kept her distance like a servant, but would, to dis- 
guise things the better, be every now and then pert, 
according to their way, and give occasion to be chid. 

[ 142 ] 



TRANSFORMATIONS 



But there is an air of gentility inborn and inbred to 
some people, and even when they aim to be awkward, 
a certain grace will attend all their minutest actions 
and gestures, and command love, respect, and vener- 
ation. I must therefore own that there was not need 
of a man's being a conjurer to guess who ought to be 
the lady and who the maid ; but to know absolutely 
who was the lady and who was the maid did require 
that skill. For how many such real ladies have we 
that are made so from such upstarts, and how many 
genteel waiting-women of great descent, that are 
born with a grace about them, and are bred to good 
manners. Mr. Campbell's art made him positive in 
the case ; he took the patches from the face of the 
maid and placed them on the mistress's ; he pulled 
off her hood and scarf and gave it to the lady, and 
taking from the lady her riding-hood, gave it the 
maid in exchange ; for ladies at that time of day 
were not entered into that fashion of cloaking them- 
selves. Then he wrote down that he should go out, 
and ought to send his maid in to undress them quite, 
and give the mistress her own clothes and the maid 
hers, and with a smile wrote down both their names 
and commended her contrivance ; but after that it 
was remarked by the lady that he paid her less re- 
spect than she expected, and more to her footman, 
who was in gentleman's habit, whom he took by his 
side, and told a great many fine things ; whereas he 
would tell the lady nothing further. The lady, 
nettled at this, wrote to him that she had vanity 
enough to believe that she might be distinguished 
from her maid in any dress ; but that he had shown 

[ 143 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



his want of skill in not knowing who that gentleman 
was. Mr. Campbell told her her mistake in sharp 
terms ; and begging her pardon, assured her he knew 
several chambermaids as genteel and as well-born as 
her, and many mistresses more awkward and worse 
born than her maid ; that he did not go, therefore, 
by the rule of guess and judging what ought to be, 
but by the rule of certainty, and the knowledge of 
what actually was. She, however, unsatisfied with 
that answer, perplexed him mightily to know who 
the man was. He answered, he would be a great 
man. The lady laughed scornfully, and said she 
wanted to know who he was, not what he would be. 
He answered again, he was her footman, but that she 
would have a worse. She grew warm, and desired to 
be informed why, since he knew the fellow's condition, 
he respected her so little and hiin so much ; and ac - 
cused him of want of practising manners if he had 
not want of knowledge. He answered, "Madam, 
since you will be asking questions too far, this foot- 
man will advance himself to the degree of a gentle- 
man, and have a woman of distinction to his wife ; 
while you will degrade yourself by a marriage to be 
the wife of a footman. His ambition is laudable, 
your condescension mean, therefore I give him the 
preference ; I have given you fair warning and whole- 
some advice, you may avoid your lot by prudence, 
but his will certainly be what I tell you." 

This coming afterwards to pass exactly as was pre- 
dicted, and his disappointing so many that had a 
mind to impose upon him, has rendered him pretty 
free from such wily contrivances since, though now 

[ 144 ] 



LOOKING FORWARD 



and then they have happened, but still to the morti- 
fication and disappointment of the contrivers. But 
as we have not pretended to say, with regard to these 
things, that he has his genius always at his elbow or 
his back, to whisper in his ear the names of persons, 
and such little constant events as these ; so, that we 
may not be deemed to give a fabulous account of his 
life and adventures, we think ourselves bound to give 
the reader an insight into the particular power and 
capacity which he has for bringing about these par- 
ticular performances, especially that of writing down 
names of strangers at first sight, which I do not doubt 
will be done to the satisfaction of all persons who 
shall read the succeeding chapter concerning the gift 
of the second-sight.

CHAPTER SEVEN 



CONCERNING THE SECOND-SIGHT. 

MR. MARTIN lately published a book, 
entitled " A Description of the West- 
ern Isles of Scotland, called by the 
ancient geographers, Hebrides." It 
contains many curious particulars relating to the 
natural and civil history of those islands, with a map 
of them ; and in his preface he tells us, that perhaps 
it is peculiar to those isles that they have never been 
described till now bv any man that was a native of 
the country, or had travelled them as himself has 
done ; and in the conclusion of the said preface he 
tells us he has given here such an account of the 
second-sight as the nature of the thing will bear, 
which has always been reckoned sufficient among the 
unbiassed part of mankind ; but for those that will 
not be satisfied they ought to oblige us with a new 
scheme by which we may judge of matters of fact. 
The chief particulars he has given us concerning the 
second-sight are here set down, by way of abstract 
or epitome, that they may not be too tedious to the 
reader. 

1. In the second-sight the vision makes such a 
lively impression on the seers, that they neither see 
nor think of anything else but the vision as long as 

[ 146 ] 



DIVERSE OPINIONS 



it continues ; and then they appear pensive or jovia\. 
according to the object which was presented to 
them. 

2. At the sight of a vision the eyelids of the per- 
son are erected, and the eyes continue staring till the 
object vanish, as has often been observed by the 
author and others present. 

3. There is one in Skye, an acquaintance of whom 
observed, that when he sees a vision the inner part 
of his eyelids turn so far upwards, that, after the 
object disappears, he must draw them down with his 
fingers, and sometimes employs others to draw them 
down, which he finds to be much the easier way. 

4. The faculty of the second-sight does not lineally 
descend in a family, as some imagine, for he knows 
several parents that are endowed with it, but not 
their children, and so on the contrary. Neither is 
it acquired by any previous compact ; and after a 
strict inquiry he could never learn from any among 
them that this faculty was communicable any way 
whatsoever. 

Note, that this account is differing from the ac- 
count that is given by Mr. Aubrey, a gentleman of 
the Royal Society ; and I think Mr. Martin's reason 
here against the descent of this faculty from parents 
to children is not generally conclusive. For, though 
he may know parents endowed with it, and not 
children, and so vice versa, yet ther» may be parents 
who are endowed with it, being qualified, as Mr. 
Aubrey has said (viz., both being second-sighted, or 
even one to an extraordinary degree), whose children 
may have it by descent. And as to this faculty 

[147] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



being any other way communicable, since the accounts 
differ, I must leave it to a further examination. 

5. The seer knows neither the object, time, nor 
place of a vision before it appears, and the same 
object is often seen by different persons living at a 
considerable distance from one another. The true 
way of judging as to the time and circumstance of 
an object is by observation ; for several persons of 
judgment without this faculty are more capable to 
judge of the design of a vision than a novice that is 
a seer. As an object appears in the day or night 
it will come to pass sooner or later accordingly. 

6. If an object be seen early in the morning, 
which is not frequent, it will be accomplished in a 
few hours afterwards. If at noon, it will commonly 
be accomplished that very day ; if in the evening, 
perhaps that night ; if after candles be lighted, it 
will be accomplished that night. It's later always 
in accomplishment by weeks, months, and sometimes 
years, according to the time of the night the vision 
is seen. 

7. When a shroud is perceived about one, it is a 
sure prognostic of death ; the time is judged accord- 
ing to the height of it about the person ; for if it 
be not seen above the middle, death is not to be 
expected for the space of a year, and perhaps some 
months longer ; and as it is frequently seen to ascend 
higher towards the head, death is concluded to be at 
hand in a few days, if not hours, as daily experience 
confirms. Examples of this kind were shown the 
author, when the persons of whom the observations 
were made enjoyed perfect health. 

[ 148 ] 



SEEING AFAR 



There was one instance lately of a prediction of 
this kind, by a seer that was a novice, concerning 
the death of one of the author's acquaintance ; this 
was communicated to a few only, and with great 
confidence. The author being one of the number, 
did not in the least regard it till the death of the 
person, about the time foretold, confirmed to him the 
certainty of the prediction. The aforesaid novice is 
now a skilful seer, as appears from many late in- 
stances. He lives in the parish of St. Mary's, the 
most northern in Skye. 

8. If a woman be seen standing at a man's left 
hand, it is a presage that she will be his wife, 
whether they are married to others or unmarried at 
the time of the apparition. If two or three women 
are seen at once standing near a man's left hand, she 
that is next him will undoubtedly be his wife first, 
and so on, whether all three, or the man, be single or 
married at the time of the vision, of which there are 
several late instances of the author's acquaintance. 
It is an ordinary thing for them to see a man that is 
to come to the house shortly after, and though he be 
not of the seer's acquaintance, yet he not only tells 
his name, but gives such a lively description of his 
stature, complexion, habit, &c, that upon his arrival 
he answers the character given of him in all respects. 
If the person so appearing be one of the seer's ac- 
quaintance, he can tell by his countenance whether 
he comes in good or bad humour. The author 
has been seen thus, by seers of both sexes, at some 
hundreds of miles' distance. Some that saw him 
in this manner had never seen him personally, and 

[ 149 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



it happened according to their visions, without any 
previous design of his to go to those places, his 
coming there being purely accidental; and in the 
nineteenth page of his book, he tells us that Mr. 
Daniel Morrison, a minister, told him, that upon 
his landing in the island Rona, the natives received 
him very affectionately, and addressed themselves to 
him with this salutation — " God save you, pilgrim ! 
You are heartily welcome here, for we have had re- 
peated apparitions of your person amongst us ; " viz., 
after the manner of the second-sight. 

9. 'T is ordinary with them to see houses, gardens, 
and trees, in places void of all three, and this in 
process of time used to be accomplished ; of which 
he gives an instance in the Island of Skye. 

10. To see a spark of fire fall upon one's arm or 
breast, is a forerunner of a dead child to be seen in 
the arms of those persons, of which there are several 
fresh instances. 

To see a seat empty at the time of one's sitting 
in it, is a presage of that person's death quickly 
after. 

When a novice, or one that has lately obtained the 
second-sight, sees a vision in the night-time without 
doors, and comes near a fire, he presently falls into a 
swoon. 

Some find themselves, as it were, in a crowd of 
people having a corpse which they carry along with 
them ; and after such visions the seers come in 
sweating, and describe the people that appeared ; if 
there are any of their acquaintance among them, 
they give an account of their names and also of the 

[ 150 j 



DOMESTIC ANIMALS 



bearers, but they know nothing concerning the 
corpse. 

All those that have the second-sight do not always 
see these visions at once, though they are together 
at the time ; but if one who has this faculty design- 
edly touch his fellow-seer at the instant of a 
vision's appearing, then the second sees it as well as 
the first. 

11. There is the way of foretelling death by a cry 
that they call Taisk, which some call a Wraith in 
the lowland. They hear a loud cry without doors, 
exactly resembling the voice of some particular per- 
son, whose death is foretold by it, of which he gives 
a late instance, which happened in the village Rigg, 
in Skye Isle. 

12. Things are also foretold by smelling some- 
times, as follows : — Fish or flesh is frequently smelt 
in the fire, when at the same time neither of the two 
are in the house, or, in any probability, likely to be 
had in it for some weeks or months. This smell 
several persons have who are endued with the second- 
sight, and it is always accomplished soon after. 

13. Children, horses, and cows, have the second- 
sight, as well as men and women advanced in years. 

That children see it, it is plain from their crying 
aloud at the very instant that a corpse or any 
other vision appears to an ordinary seer ; of which 
he gives an instance in a child when himself was 
present. 

That horses likewise see it 's very plain, from their 
violent and sudden starting when the rider or seer in 
company with them sees a vision of any kind by night 

[151 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



or day. It is observable of a horse that he will not 
go forward that way till he be led about at some 
distance from the common road, and then he is in a 
sweat. He gives an instance of this in a horse in the 
Isle of Skye. 

That cows have the second-sight appears from 
this ; that if a woman milking a cow happens to see 
a vision by the second-sight, the cow runs away in a 
great fright at the same time, and will not be paci- 
fied for some time after. 

In reference to this, Paracelsus, torn. 9, 1. " De arte 
presaga," writes thus, " Horses also have their augu- 
ries, who perceive by their sight and smell wandering 
spirits, witches, and spectres and the like things, and 
dogs both see and hear the same. ,, 

Here in the next place the author answers objec- 
tions that have lately been made against the reality 
of the second-sight. 

First, it's objected that these seers are visionary 
and melancholy people, who fancy they see things 
that do not appear to them or anybody else. 

He answers, the people of these isles, and particu- 
larly the seers, are very temperate, and their diet is 
simple and moderate in quantity and quality ; so that 
their brains are not, in all probability, disordered by 
undigested fumes of meat or drink. Both sexes are 
free from hysteric fits, convulsions, and several other 
distempers of that sort. There are no madmen 
among them, nor any instance of self-murder. It 'a 
observed among them that a man drunk never has 
a vision of the second-sight, and he that is a vision- 
ary would discover himself in other things as well 

[152] 



OBJECTIONS ANSWERED 



as in that ; nor are such as have the second-sight 
judged to be visionaries by any of their friends or 
acquaintance. 

Secondly, it is objected that there are none among 
the learned able to oblige the world with a satis- 
factory account of these visions ; therefore they are 
not to be believed. 

He answers, if everything of which the learned are 
not able to give a satisfactory account shall be con- 
demned as false and impossible, we shall find many 
other things, generally believed, which must be 
rejected as such. 

Thirdly, it 's objected that the seers are impostors, 
and the people who believe them are credulous, and 
easy to be imposed upon. 

He answers, the seers are generally illiterate and 
well-meaning people, and altogether void of design ; 
nor could he ever learn that any of them made the 
least gain of it ; neither is it reputable among them 
to have that faculty ; besides, the people of the isles 
are not so credulous as to believe an impossibility 
before the thing foretold be accomplished : but when 
it actually comes to pass, afterwards, it is not in 
their power to deny it without offering violence to 
their senses and reason. Besides, if the seers were 
deceivers, can it be reasonable to imagine that all 
the islanders who have not the second-sight should 
combine together and offer violence to their under- 
standings and senses to force themselves to believe a 
lie from age to age? There are several persons 
among them whose birth and education raise them 
above the suspicion of concurring with an imposture, 

[153] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



merely to gratify an illiterate and contemptible sort 
of persons. Nor can a reasonable man believe that 
children, horses, and cows could be engaged in a 
combination to persuade the world of the reality of 
a second-sight. 

Every vision that is seen comes exactly to pass, 
according to the rules of observation, though novices 
and heedless persons do not always judge by those 
rules, concerning which he gives instances. 

There are visions seen by several persons in whose 
days they are not accomplished ; and this is one of 
the reasons why some things have been seen that are 
said never to have come to pass, and there are also 
several visions seen which are not understood till 
they are accomplished. 

The second-sight is not a late discovery seen by 
one or two in a corner or a remote isle, but it is 
seen by many persons of both sexes in several isles, 
separated about forty or fifty leagues from one 
another. The inhabitants of many of these isles 
never had the least converse by word or writing, and 
this faculty of seeing visions having continued, as we 
are informed by tradition, ever since the plantation 
of these isles, without being disproved by the nicest 
sceptic after the strictest inquiry, seems to be a clear 
proof of its reality. 

It's observable that it was much more common 
twenty or thirty years ago than at present ; for one 
in ten does not see it now that saw it then. 

The second-sight is not confined to the Western 
Isles alone, the author having an account that it is 
In several parts of Holland, but particularly in Bom- 

[ 154 ] 



IN THE ISLE OF MAN 



mel, where a woman has it, for which she is courted 
by some and dreaded by others. She sees a smoke 
about one's face, which is the forerunner of the 
death of a person so seen, and she actually foretold 
the deaths of several that lived there. She was living 
in that town a few winters ago. 

The second-sight is likewise in the Isle of Man, 
as appears by this instance. Captain Leathes, the 
chief commander of Belfast, in his voyage, 1690, 
lost thirteen men by a violent storm, and upon his 
landing in the Isle of Man, an ancient man, clerk to 
a parish there, told him immediately that he had lost 
thirteen men there ; the captain inquired how he 
came to the knowledge of that ; he answered, that it 
was by thirteen lights which he had seen come into 
the churchyard, as Mr. Sacheverell tells us in his late 
description of the Isle of Man. Note — that this is 
like the sight of the corpse-candles in Wales, which 
is also well attested. 

Here the author adds many other instances con- 
cerning the second-sight, of which I shall set down 
only a few. 

A man in Knockow, in the parish of St. Mary's, the 
northernmost part of Skye, being in perfect health, 
and sitting with his fellow servants at night, was on 
a sudden taken ill, dropped from his seat backward, 
and then fell a-vomiting ; at which the family was 
much concerned, he having never been subject to the 
like before ; but he came to himself soon after, and 
had no sort of pain about him. One of the family, 
who was accustomed to see the second-sight, told 
them that the man's illness proceeded from a very 

[ 155 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



strange cause, which was thus : — An ill-natured 
woman (whom he named) who lives in the next 
adjacent village of Bornskittag, came before him in 
a very angry and furious manner, her countenance 
full of passion and her mouth full of reproaches, and 
threatened him with her head and hands till he fell 
over, as you have seen him. This woman had a 
fancy for the man, but was like to be disappointed 
as to her marrying of him. This instance was told 
the author by the master of the family and others 
who were present when it happened. 

Sir Norman Macleod and some others playing at 
tables, at a game called in Irish " falmermore,"" wherein 
there are three of a side, and each of them throw the 
dice by turns, there happened to be one difficult point 
in the disposing of one of the table-men. This obliged 
the gamester to deliberate before he was to change 
his man, since upon the disposing of it the winning 
or losing of the game depended ; at length the butler, 
who stood behind, advised the player where to place 
the man, with which he complied and won the game. 
This being thought extraordinary, and Sir Norman 
hearing one whisper him in the ear, asked who advised 
him so skilfully ? He answered, it was the butler, but 
this seemed more strange, for it was generally thought 
he could not play at tables. Upon this Sir Norman 
asked him how long it was since he had learned to 
play ? And the fellow owned that he had never 
played in his life, but that he saw the spirit Brownie 
(a spirit usually seen in that country) reaching his 
arm over the player's head, and touching the part 
with his finger where the table-man was to be placed 

[156] 



IN THE ISLE OF SKYE 



This was told the author by Sir Norman, and others 
who happened to be present at the time. 

Daniel Bow, alias Black, an inhabitant of Born- 
skittag, who is one of the precisest seers in the isles, 
foretold the death of a young woman in Minginis 
within less than twenty-four hours before the time, 
and accordingly she died suddenly in the fields, though 
at the time of the prediction she was in perfect health, 
but the shroud appearing close about her head was 
the ground of his confidence that her death was at 
hand. 

The same person foretold the death of a child in 
his master's arms by seeing a spark of fire fall on 
his left arm, and this was likewise accomplished soon 
after the prediction. 

Some of the inhabitants of Harris, sailing round the 
Isle of Skye with a design to go to the opposite main- 
land, were strangely surprised with an apparition of 
two men hanging down by the ropes that secured the 
mast, but could not conjecture what it meant ; they 
pursued their voyage, but the wind turning contrary 
they were forced into Broadford, in the Isle of Skye, 
where they found Sir Donald Macdonald keeping a 
sheriff's court, and two criminals receiving sentence 
of death there. The ropes and mast of that very 
boat were made use of to hang those criminals. This 
was told the author by several who had this instance 
related to them by the boat's crew. 

Several persons living in a certain family told the 
author that they had frequently seen two men stand- 
ing at a gentlewoman's left hand, who was their 
master's daughter ; they told the men's names, and 

[157] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



being her equals, it was not doubted but she would 
be married to one of them, and perhaps to the other 
after the death of the first. Some time after a third 
man appeared, who seemed always to stand nearest 
to her of the three, but the seers did not know him, 
though they could describe him exactly ; and within 
some months after, this man, who was seen last, 
actually came to the house, and fully answered the 
description given of him by those who never saw him 
but in a vision, and he married the woman shortly 
after. They live in the Isle of Skye, and both them- 
selves and others confirmed the truth of this instance 
when the author saw them. 

Archibald Macdonald, of the parish of St. Mary's, 
in the Isle of Skye, being reputed famous in his skill 
of foretelling things to come by the second-sight, 
happening to be in the village Knockow, one night, 
and before supper told the family that he had just 
then seen the strangest thing he ever saw in his life, 
viz., a man with an ugly long cap always shaking 
his head, but that the strangest of all was a little 
kind of a harp which he had with four strings only, 
and that it had two hart's horns fixed in the front 
of it. All that heard this odd vision fell a-laughing 
at Archibald, telling him that he was dreaming, or 
had not his wits about him, since he pretended to 
see a thing which had no being, and was not so much 
as heard of in any part of the world. All this could 
not alter Archibald's opinion, who told them that 
they must excuse him if he laughed at them after 
the accomplishment of the vision. Archibald re- 
burned to his own house, and within three or four 

[158] 



1 



A GRUESOME APPARITION 



days after a man with a cap, harp, &c, came to the 
house, and the harp, strings, horns, and cap answered 
the description of them at first view, and he shook 
his head when he played, for he had two bells fixed 
to his cap. This harper was a poor man, who made 
himself a buffoon for his bread, and was never seen 
before in those parts, and at the time of the predic- 
tion he was in the Isle of Barray, which is about 
twenty leagues distant from that part of Skye. 
This relation is vouched by Mr. Daniel Martin, and 
all his family, and such as were then present, and 
they live in the village where this happened. 

One Daniel Nicholson, minister of St. Mary's, in 
Skye, the parish in which Mr. Archibald Macdonald 
lived, told the author that one Sunday, after sermon, 
at the Chapel Uig, he took an occasion to inquire of 
Archibald if he still retained that unhappy faculty 
of seeing the second-sight, and wished him to get 
rid of it, if possible ; for, said he, it 's no true char- 
acter of a good man. Archibald was highly dis- 
pleased, and answered that he hoped he was no more 
unhappy than his neighbours, for seeing what they 
could not perceive. " I had," said he, " as serious 
thoughts as my neighbours in time of hearing a 
sermon to-day, and even then I saw a corpse laid on 
the ground close to the pulpit ; and I assure you it 
will be accomplished shortly, for it was in the day- 
time. 1 ' There were none in the parish then sick, 
and few are buried at that little chapel, nay, some- 
times, not one in a year. Yet when Mr. Nicholson 
returned to preach in the said chapel, a fortnight or 
three weeks after, he found one buried in the very 

[159 J 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



spot named by Archibald. This story is vouched 
by Mr. Nicholson, the minister, and several of the 
parishioners still living. 

Note, that it 's counted by many an argument of 
somewhat evil attending this faculty of the second- 
si o-ht, because there are instances given of some 
persons who have been freed of it, upon using some 
Christian practices. But I shall hereafter show that 
this opinion cannot be entirely true. 

Sir Norman Macleod, who has his residence in the 
Isle of Bernera, which lies between the Isles of N. 
Uist and Harris, went to the Isle of Skye about 
business, without appointing any time for his return ; 
his servants, in his absence, being all together in the 
large hall at night, one of them, who had the second- 
sight, told the rest they must remove, for there 
would be abundance of company in the hall that 
night. One of his fellow servants answered, that 
there was very little likelihood of that, because of 
the darkness of the night, and the danger of coming 
through the rocks that lay round the isle ; but 
within an hour after one of Sir Norman's men came 
to the house, bidding them provide lights, &c, for 
his master had newly landed. 

Sir Norman being told of this, called for the Beef 
and examined him about it. He answered, that he 
had seen the spirit Brownie, in human shape, come 
several times and make a show of carrying an old 
woman, that sat by the fire, to the door, and at last 
seemed to carry her out by neck and heels; which 
made him laugh heartily, and gave occasion to the 
rest to conclude him mad, to laugh so much without 

[160] 



INVISIBLE SINGERS 



any reason. This instance was told the author by 
Sir Norman himself. 

Four men, from the Isle of Skye and Harris, went 
to Barbadoes, and stayed there some years ; who, 
though they had wont to see the second-sight in 
their native country, never saw it in Barbadoes, but 
upon their return to England, the first night after 
their landing they saw the second-sight, as the author 
was told by several of their acquaintance. 

John Morrison, who lives in Bernera of Harris, 
wears the plant called fuga dcemonum sewed in the 
neck of his coat, to prevent his seeing visions, and 
says he never saw any since he first carried that plant 
about him. 

A spirit, by the country people called Brownie, 
was frequently seen in all the most considerable 
families in the isles and north of Scotland, in the 
shape of a tall man, having very long brown hair. 
But within these twenty years past he has been seen 
but rarely. 

There were spirits also that appeared in the shape 
of women, horses, swine, cats, and some like fiery 
balls, which would follow men in the fields ; but there 
have been but few instances of these for upwards of 
forty years past. 

These spirits used also to form sounds in the air, 
resembling those of a harp, pipes, crowing of a cock 
and of the grinding of hand-mills. And sometimes 
voices have been heard in the air at night, singing 
Irish songs, the words of which songs some of the 
author's acquaintances still retain ; one of them 
resembled the voice of a woman, who died some time 
11 [ 161 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



before, and the song related to her state in the other 
world. All these accounts, the author says, he had 
from persons of as great integrity as any in the 
world. 

So far Mr. Martin, whose account is so long that 
I have given the reader only a short abridgment 
thereof ; and shall therefore satisfy myself, without 
relating any further passages, by directing the reader 
to others also, learned men, who have written on the 
same subject. Laurentius Ananias printed a volume 
in Latin, at Venice, anno 1571, about the nature of 
Demons, where, in the third book, he writes concern- 
ing the second-sight. The learned Camerarius does 
the like, and names a person of his own acquaintance, 
whom he testifies to have had that gift. St. Austin 
himself testifies something (not very different from 
what we now call the gift of the second-sight) of 
one Curina, who lived in the country of Hippo in 
Africa. Bonaysteau tells us something like it in his 
" Disc, de Excell. et Dig. Hominis," concerning the 
spirit of Hermotimus. So do likewise Herodotus 
and Maximus Tyrius about the spirit of Aristaeus. 
Cardan does the same in his "De rerum variet.," 
1. 8, c. 84, of his kinsman Baptista Cardan, a student 
at Pavia. Baptista Fulgosus tells us of what we call 
the second-sight, in other words, in his 1. 1, "Fact, 
et diet. memorab.," c. 6. Among our own country- 
men, the Lord Henry Howard, in the book he wrote 
against the supposed prophecies, in his seventeenth 
chapter, tells us a wonderful story of this kind of 
sight ; and sure that noble lord may be looked upon 
as an unexceptionable testimony in a story he relates 

[ 162 ] 



CHARLES I. OF ENGLAND 



of his own knowledge, he having otherwise little 
faith in things of this kind. Mr. Cotton Mather, 
a minister of New England, in his relation of the 
wonders of the invisible world, inserted in his " Ec- 
clesiastical History " of that country, printed in 
London, anno 1702, in folio, has given us several 
instances of this kind, as also of many other dia- 
bolical operations. Mr. Baxter's book concerning 
the "Certainty of the World of Spirits, 11 has the 
like proofs in it. Mr. Aubrey, Fellow of the Royal 
Society, has written largely concerning second- 
sighted persons ; so has Mr. Beaumont, in his book 
of genii and familiar spirits, who has collected almost 
all the other accounts together, and many others 
whose very names it would be tedious to recite. 
However, as there are a few more passages very 
curious in themselves, I will venture so far upon the 
reader's patience as not only to recite the names of 
the authors, but the accounts themselves, in as suc- 
cinct and brief a manner as it is possible for any one 
to do. 

Mr. Th. May, in his History, lib. 8, writes, that an 
old man (like an hermit) second-sighted, took his 
leave of King James I. when he came into England. 
He took little notice of Prince Henry, but address- 
ing himself to the Duke of York (since King Charles 
I.), fell a-weeping to think what misfortunes he 
should undergo, and that he should be one of the 
most miserable and most unhappy princes that ever 
was. 

A Scotch nobleman sent for one of these second - 
sighted men out of the Highlands, to give his judg- 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



ment of the then great George Villiers, Duke of 
Buckingham. As soon as ever he saw him, " Pish," 
said he, " he will come to nothing, I see a dagger in 
his breast ; " and he was stabbed in the breast by 
Captain Felton, as has been at large recounted 
in some of the foregoing pages. 

Sir James Melvil hath several the like passages in 
his History. 

A certain old man, in South Wales, told a great 
man there, of the fortune of his family, and that 
there should not be a third male generation. It 
has fallen out accordingly. 

Sir William Dugdale, with his own mouth, in- 
formed several gentlemen, that Major-General Mid- 
dleton (since lord) went into the Highlands of 
Scotland, to endeavour to make a party for King 
Charles I. An old gentleman (that was second- 
sighted) came and told him that his endeavour was 
good, but he would be unsuccessful ; and moreover, 
that they would put the king to death, and that 
several other attempts would be made, but all in 
vain ; but that his son would come in, but not reign 
a long time, but would at last be restored. This 
Lord Middleton had a great friendship with the 
Laird Bocconi, and they made an agreement, that 
the first of them that died should appear to the 
other in extremity. The Lord Middleton was taken 
prisoner at Worcester fight, and was prisoner in the 
Tower of London, under three locks. Lying in his 
bed, pensive, Bocconi appeared to him ; my Lord 
Middleton asked him if he were dead or alive? He 
said, dead, and that he was a ghost ; and told him 

[ 164 ] 



CONSENSUS OF SCHOLARS 



that within three days he should escape, and he did 
so, in his wife's clothes. When he had done his mes- 
sage he gave a frisk, and said — 

" Givanni, Givanni, 't is very strange 
In the world to see so sudden a change. 

And then gathered up and vanished. This account 
Sir William Dugdale had from the Bishop of Edin- 
burgh. And this account he hath written in a book 
of Miscellanies, which is now deposited (with other 
books of his) in the Museum at Oxford. 

Thus the reader sees what great authorities may 
be produced to prove that wonderful and true pre- 
dictions have been delivered by many persons gifted 
with the second-sight. The most learned men in 
almost all nations, who are not in all likelihood 
deceived themselves ; the most celebrated and au- 
thentic historians, and some divines, in England, 
who, it is not to be thought, have combined together 
and made it their business to obtrude upon us false- 
hoods ; persons of all ranks, from the highest to the 
lowest, in Scotland, who it would be even madness 
to think, would join in a confederacy to impose 
tricks upon us, and to persuade us to the greatest of 
impostures as solemn truths delivered from their own 
mouths ; all these, I say, have unanimously and (as 
it were) with one voice asserted, repeated, and con- 
firmed to us, that there have been at all times, and in 
many different nations, and that still there are per- 
sons who, possessed with the gift of a second-sight, 
predict things that wonderfully come to pass ; and 
seem to merit very little less than the name of 

[165] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



prophets, for their miraculous discoveries. Now if 
any man should come, and without giving the least 
manner of reason for it (for there is no reason to be 
given against such assertions) declare his disbelief 
of all these authentic, though strange accounts ; can 
he with reason imagine that his incredulity shall 
pass for a token of wisdom ? Shall his obstinacy 
confute the learned ? Shall his want of faith be 
thought justly to give the lie to so many persons 
of the highest honour and quality, and of the most 
undoubted integrity ? In fine, shall his infidelity, 
by a reverse kind of power to that which is attributed 
to the philosopher's stone, be able to change the 
nature of things, turn and transmute truth into 
falsehood, and make a downright plain matter of 
fact to be no more than a chimera or an ens rationis ? 
And shall a manifest experience be so easily exploded ? 

Taking it therefore for granted that no modest 
man whatsoever, though never so hard of belief, 
which is certainly as great a weakness as that of too 
much credulity, will make bold openly to declare his 
disbelief of things so well attested ; and taking it 
much more for granted still, that it is impossible for 
any man of common sense to have the front of declar- 
ing his disbelief of them in such a manner as to urge 
it for an argument and a reason why others should dis- 
believe them too ; taking this, I say, as I think I 
very well may, for granted, I think there remains 
nothing further for me to offer, before I conclude 
this chapter, except a few remarks as to the similitude 
there is between those actions, which I have related 
above to have been performed by Mr. Campbell, and 

[166 j 



A GAMBLING BROWNIE 



these actions, which so many learned, ingenious, and 
noble authors, as I have just now quoted, have 
asserted to have been performed by persons whom 
they knew to be gifted with the second-sight. 

As to what is said (several pages above) concerning 
Duncan Campbell, when a boy at Edinburgh, that 
he even told his little companions who would have 
success at their little matches when they played at 
marbles ; and that he informed a great gamester 
there, whose name I have disguised under that of 
Count Cog, what times he should choose to play if 
he would win ; as ludicrous as it may have appeared 
to be, and as much as it may have seemed to my 
readers to carry with it nothing better than the face 
of invention and the air of fiction, yet if they will be 
at the pains of comparing that passage of Duncan 
Campbell's with the account given in this chapter 
from the mouth of Sir Norman Macleod, concerning 
a man who, though he never played at tables in his 
life, instructed a skilful gamester, when he was at a 
stand, to place one of his men right, upon which the 
whole game depended, which the ignorant fellow, 
when asked how he came to do it, said he was 
directed to by the spirit Brownie ; whoever, I say, 
frill be at the pains of comparing these passages to- 
gether, will find they bear a very near resemblance, 
and that the way we may most reasonably account 
for Duncan Campbell's prediction, when he was a 
boy, must be that he was at that time directed by 
his little genius or familiar spirit, which I described 
in the precedent pages, as this fellow was by the 
spirit Brownie, according to Sir Norman Macleod's 

[ 1W] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



assertion, which spirit Brownie, as Mr. Martin, a 
very good and credited writer, assures us in his 
v< History of the Western Islands," dedicated to the 
late Prince George of Denmark, is a spirit usually 
seen all over that country. 

If the reader recollects, he will remember likewise 
that in the little discourse which I mentioned to 
have been held between me and this Duncan Camp- 
bell when a boy concerning his little genius, I there 
say the boy signified to me, that he smelt venison, 
and was sure that some would come to his mother's 
house shortly after ; accordingly I came thither that 
morning from the death of a deer, and ordered a 
part of it to be brought after me to her house. Now 
Mr. Martin's twelfth observation about the second- 
sight in this chapter clears it plainly up that this 
knowledge in the boy proceeded from the gift of 
second-sight. Not to give the reader too often the 
trouble of looking back in order to judge of the 
truth of what I say, I will here repeat that observa- 
tion, which is as follows : things are also foretold 
by smelling sometimes ; for example, fish or flesh is 
frequently smelt in the fire, when at the same time 
neither of the two are in the house or in any prob- 
ability like to be had in it for some weeks or months. 
This smell several persons have who are endued with 
the second-sight, and it is always accomplished soon 
after. 

But I will here omit any further remarks by way 
of accounting how he compassed his predictions 
when a boy, either by the intervention of his genius 
or the gift of a second-sight ; and examine how 

[168] 



A PROBLEM SOLVED 



nearly those things which I have related have been 
done by him in his more advanced years, when he 
took up the profession of a predictor in London, 
correspond with the accounts given in this chapter 
about a second-sight, and how near a resemblance the 
things done by him bear to those things that are so well 
attested to have been performed by others, through 
the efficacious power of this wonderful faculty. 

First, then, if we have a mind to make a tolerable 
guess which way Mr. Campbell came acquainted that 
the death of the beautiful young lady, Mrs. W[e]l- 
w[oo]d, was so near at hand, and that, though she 
was so universally admired, she would die unmarried ; 
the accounts given of other second-sighted persons 
in the like cases, will put us in the most probable 
way of guessing right. This is explained by the 
seventh observation in this chapter, where it is said 
from Mr. Martin that when a shroud is perceived 
about one, it is a sure prognostic of death ; the time 
is judged according to the height of it about the 
person, for if it be not seen above the middle, death 
is not to be expected for the space of a year or 
longer, but as it comes nearer to the head it is ex- 
pected sooner ; if to the very head, it is concluded 
to be at hand within a few days, if not hours. Of 
this we have an example, of which Mr. Martin was 
an eye-witness, concerning the death of his own 
acquaintance ; but he did not in the least regard it 
till the death of the person, about the time foretold, 
confirmed to him the certainty of the prediction. 

Secondly, as to the ignominious death that Irwin 
came to, and which he predicted to his mother so 

[169] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



long before when she was in flourishing circumstances, 
and when there was no appearance that any of her 
children should be brought to a beggarly condition, 
and learn among base gangs of company to thieve 
and be carried to the gallows. The story told in this 
chapter of some of the inhabitants of Harris sailing 
round the Isle of Skye, and seeing the apparition of 
two men hanging by the ropes on the mast of their 
vessel, and when they came to the opposite mainland 
finding two criminals just sentenced to death by Sir 
Donald Macdonald, and seeing their own very masts 
and ropes made choice of for their execution, clears 
up the manner how Mr. Campbell might predict this 
of Irwin likewise by the force of the second-sight. 

Thirdly, as to Mr. Campbell's telling Christallina, 
the belle and chief toast of the court, and Urbana, 
the reigning beauty of the city, that they should 
shortly be married, and who were to be their hus- 
bands ; it is a thing he has done almost every day 
in his life to one woman or other that comes to con- 
sult him about the man she is to be married to ; the 
manner he probably takes in doing this, may be like- 
wise explained by the foregoing story in this chapter 
about the servants who said they saw three men 
standing by the left hand of their master's daughter, 
and that he that was nearest would marry her first, 
whom they plainly and exactly described, though 
they had never seen him but in their vision, as ap- 
peared afterwards. For within some months after 
the very man described did come to the house and 
did marry her. Vide the eighth observation of the 
second-sight. 

[170] 



PREDICTIONS EXPLAINED 

Fourthly, as to the predictions delivered by Mr. 
Campbell to the merchant, which are set down at 
length in the foregoing chapter, I know no better 
way at guessing the manner how the second-sight 
operated in him at that time, than by comparing 
them to these two instances, which I briefly repeat, 
because they are set down at length before in this 
chapter. And first it may be asked how did the 
second-sight operate in Mr. Campbell when it gave 
him to know that the merchant's ships, which repeated 
intelligences had in appearance confirmed to be lost, 
were at that time safe, and would return securely 
home into the harbour designed ? The best way of 
accounting for it that I know, is by the story that 
Sir Norman Macleod is above affirmed to have told 
with his own mouth concerning a servant of his who 
rightly foretold his returning home and landing on 
the isle of Bernera one night, where his residence 
was, when there was very little or no likelihood of it, 
because of the darkness of the night and the danger 
of coming through the rocks that lie round the isle. 
When Sir Norman examined him about it, he an- 
swered that he knew it by a vision of the spirit 
Brownie ; and hence it may be the most probably 
conjectured that Mr. Campbell's knowledge of the 
merchant's ships being safe, came from a vision of his 
particular genius or familiar spirit, which we spoke 
of before. What I have already instanced in, is, I 
think, sufficient with regard to the wonderful things 
which Mr. Campbell has performed, either by the 
intervention of a genius or the power of a second- 
sight. But as he has frequently done a great many 

[171] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



amazing performances, which seem to be of such a 
nature that they can't be well and clearly explained 
to have been done either by the intervention of his 
familiar spirit and genius, or by the power of the 
second-sighted faculty, we must have recourse to the 
third means, by which only such predictions and 
practices can be compassed, before we expound these 
new mysteries, which appear like incredible riddles 
and enigmas at the first ; and this third means which 
we must have recourse to for expounding these 
strange acts of his, is a due consideration of the 
force and power of natural magic, which, together 
with a narrative of the acts which he seems magic- 
ally to bring about, will be the subject of the follow- 
ing chapter.

CHAPTER EIGHT 



A DISSERTATION UPON MAGIC. 

BUT before we proceed to our disquisitions 
concerning the power and efficacy of nat- 
| ural magic, and examine what mysterious 
operations may be brought about and com- 
passed by magical practices, and before we take a 
further survey of what Mr. Campbell has performed 
in this kind, that relates to his profession and the 
public part of his life, which concerns other people 
as well as himself, I shall here relate some singular 
adventures that he passed through in his private life, 
and which regard only his own person. In order to 
this, I must return back to the year 1702, about 
which time some unaccountable turns of fortune at- 
tended him in his own private capacity, which must 
be very surprising and entertaining to my readers, 
when they find a man, whose foresight was always so 
great a help and assistance to others who consulted 
him in their own future affairs, helpless (as it has 
been an observation concerning all such men in the 
account of the second-sight), and blind in his own 
future affairs, tossed up and down by inevitable and 
spiteful accidents of fortune, and made the May-game 
of chance and hazard ; as if that wayward and incon- 
stant goddess was resolved to punish him, when she 

[ ™] 



Mil. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



catched him on the blind side, for having such a quick 
insight and penetrating faculty in other peopled mat- 
ters, and scrutinising too narrowly into her mysteries, 
and so sometimes preventing those fatal intentions 
of hers, into which she would fain lead many mortals 
hoodwinked, and before they knew where they were. 
In this light, these mighty and famous seers seem to 
be born for the benefit and felicity of others, but at 
the same time to be born to unhappiness themselves. 
And certainly, inasmuch as we consider them as useful 
and beneficial, often, but always satisfactory, to per- 
sons who are curious in their inquiries about their 
fortunes, it will be natural to those of us, who have 
the least share of generosity in our minds, to yield 
our pity and compassion to them, when they are 
remarkably unfortunate themselves, especially when 
that calamity seems more particularly to light upon 
them for their ability and endeavour to consult the 
good fortune of other folks. 

About the above-mentioned year 1702, Duncan 
Campbell grew a little tired of his profession. Such 
a multitude of followers troubled him, several of 
whom were wild youths and came to banter him, and 
many more too inquisitive females, to tease him with 
endless impertinences, and who, the more he told 
them, had still the more to ask, and whose curiositj 
was never to be satisfied ; and besides this he was so 
much envied, and had so many malicious artifices 
daily practised against him, that he resolved to leave 
off' his profession. He had, I know, followed it 
pretty closely, from the time I first saw him in Lon- 
don, which was, I think, in the beginning of the 

[174] 



PERPLEXITIES 

year 1698, till the year 1702, with very good success ; 
and in those few years, he had got together a pretty 
round sum of money. Our young seer was now at 
man's estate, and had learned the notion that he was 
to be his own governor, so far as to be his own coun- 
sellor too in what road of life he was to take ; and 
this consideration, no doubt, worked with deeper 
impression on his mind than it usually does on others 
that are in the same blossoming pride of manhood, 
because it might appear more natural for him to be- 
lieve that he had a sufficient ability to be his own 
proper adviser, who had given so many others, and 
some more aged than himself, counsel with very good 
success. Now every experienced person knows that 
when manhood is yet green it is still in the same 
dangerous condition as a young plant, which is liable 
to be warped by a thousand cross fortuitous accidents 
if good measures be not taken to support it against 
all the contingent shocks it may meet with from the 
weather or otherwise. Now, it was his misfortune to 
be made averse to business which he loved before by 
having too much of it, and to be so soured by meet- 
ing with numerous perplexities and malicious rubs 
laid in his way by invidious people (who are the use- 
less and injurious busybodies, that always repine at 
the good of others, and rejoice to do harm to the 
diligent and assiduous, though they reap no profit 
by it themselves), that he was disgusted and deterred 
entirely from the prosecution of a profession, by 
which he got not only a competent but a copious and 
plentiful subsistence. Nay, indeed, this was another 
mischief arising to him from his having so much 

[ !? 5 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



business that he had got money enough to leave it 
off, when the perplexities of it had made him willing 
to do so, and to live very comfortably and hand- 
somely like a gentleman without it for a time ; and 
we know the youngest men are not wont to look the 
furthest before them in matters that concern their 
own welfare. Now, inasmuch as he had thus taken 
a disgust to business and application, and was sur- 
feited (as I may say) with the perplexities of it, it 
must be as natural for him, we know, to search for 
repose in the contrary extreme, viz., recreation and 
idleness, as it is for a man to seek rest after toil, to 
sleep after a day's labour, or to sit down after a long 
and tiresome walk. 

But there are two very distinct sorts of idleness, 
and two very different kinds of recreations ; there is 
a shameful idleness which is no better than down- 
right sloth ; and there is a splendid kind of indolence 
where a man, having taken an aversion to the weari- 
someness of a business which properly belongs to him, 
neglects not, however, to employ his thoughts, when 
they are vacant from what they ought more chiefly 
to be about, in other matters not entirely unprofit- 
able in life, the exercise of which he finds he can 
follow with more abundant ease and satisfaction. 
There are some sorts of recreations too that are mean, 
sordid and base ; others that are very innocent, 
though very diverting, and that will give one the 
very next most valuable qualifications of a gentleman 
after those which are obtained by a more serious 
application of the mind. 

The idea which I have already given my readers of 

[ 176 ] 



DOOM OF THE IDLER 



our Duncan Campbell will easily make them judge 
before I tell them, which way, in these two ways, his; 
genius would naturally lead him ; and that when he 
grew an idle man he would rather indulge himself 
with applying his mind to the shining trifles of life 
than be wholly slothful and inactive ; and that when 
he diverted himself he would not do it after a sordid 
base manner, as having a better taste and a relish for 
good company, but that his recreations would still be 
the recreations of a gentleman. And just accordingly 
as my readers would naturally judge beforehand in his 
case, so it really happened. The moment he shook off 
business, and dismissed the thoughts of it, his genius 
led him to a very gallant way of life ; in his lodgings, 
in his entertainments, in paying and receiving visits, 
in coffee-houses, in taverns, in fencing-schools, in balls, 
and other public assemblies, in all ways, in fine, both 
at home and abroad, Duncan Campbell was a well- 
comported and civil gentleman ; he was a man of 
pleasure, and nothing of the man of business ap- 
peared about him. But a gentleman's life without 
a gentleman^ estate, however shining and pleasant it 
may be for a time, will certainly end in sorrow, if not 
in infamy ; and, comparing life, as moralists do, to a 
day, one may safely pronounce this truth to all the 
splendid idlers I have mentioned, that if they have 
sunshiny weather till noon, yet the afternoon of their 
life will be very stormy, rainy, and uncomfortable ; and 
perhaps just at the end of their journey, to carry on 
the metaphor throughout, close in the darkest kind 
of night. Of this, as I was a man of years, and more 
experienced in the world than he, I took upon me to 
12 [177] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



forewarn Mr. Campbell, as soon as I perceived the 
first dangerous fit of this elegant idleness had seized 
him. But when will young men, by so much the 
more headstrong as they have less of the beard, be 
guided and brought to learn, and when shall we see 
that happy age, in which the grey heads of old men 
shall be clapped upon the shoulders of youth ? I told 
him, that in this one thing he ought to consult me, 
and acknowledge me to be a true prophet, if I told 
him the end of the seeming merry steps in life he was 
now taking would infallibly bring him to a labyrinth of 
difficulties, out of which, if he extricated himself at all, 
he would at least find it a laborious piece of work. 

His taste had been already vitiated with the sweets 
which lay at the top of the bitter draught of fortune, 
and my honest rugged counsel came too late to pre- 
vail, when his fancy had decoyed and debauched his 
judgment, and carried it over into another interest. 
I remember I writ down to him the moral story, where 
vicious pleasure and virtue are pictured by the phi- 
losopher to appear before Hercules, to court him into 
two several paths. I told him more particularly, 
since he had not an estate to go through with the 
gentlemanly life, as he called it, that if he followed 
the alluring pleasures, which endeavoured to tempt 
Hercules, he would involve himself at last in a whole 
heap of miseries, out of which it would be more than 
an Herculean labour for him to disentangle himself 
again. If he had been a man that could have ever 
heard with either, I would have told the reader, in a 
very familiar idiom, that he turned the deaf ear to 
me ; for he did not mind one syllable nor tittle of 

[178] 



A DOWNRIGHT FOOL 



the prescriptions I had set down for him, no more 
than if he had never read them ; but varying the 
phrase a little, I may say at least, when he should 
have looked upon my counsel with all the eyes he 
had, he turned the blind side upon it. I was resolved 
to make use of the revenge natural to a man of years, 
and therefore applied that reproachful proverb to 
him, which we ancients delight much in making use 
of to youths that follow their own false and hot im- 
aginations, and will not heed the cooler dictates of age, 
experience, and wisdom. Accordingly I wrote down 
to him these words, and left him in a seeming pas- 
sion — "I am very well assured, young man, you 
think me that am old to be a fool ; but I, that am 
old, absolutely know you who are a young fellow, to 
be a downright fool ; and so I leave you to follow 
your own ways, till sad and woeful experience teaches 
you to know it your own self, and makes you come 
to me to own it of your own accord." 

As I was going away after this tart admonition 
and severe reprimand, I had a mind to observe his 
countenance, and I saw him smile, which I rightly 
construed to be done in contempt of the advice of 
age, and in the gaiety and fulness of conceit which 
youth entertains of its own fond opinions and hair- 
brained rash resolves. He was got into the company 
of*a very pretty set of gentlemen, whose fortunes 
were superior to his ; but he followed the same gen- 
teel exercises, as fencing, &c, and made one at all 
their public entertainments ; and so being at an 
equal expense with those who could well afford 
to spend what they did out of their estates, he went 

[ 179] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

on very pleasantly for a time, still spending and 
never getting, without ever considering that it must, 
by inevitable consequence, fall to his lot at last to 
be entirely reduced to a state of indigence and 
want. And what commonly heightens the misfor- 
tune of such men (and so of all gentlemen's younger 
brothers), who live upon the ready money that is 
given them for their portions, is, that the prosperity 
they live in for a time gains them credit enough 
just to bring them in debt, and render them more 
miserable than those very wretches who never had 
either any money or credit at all. They run them- 
selves into debt out of shame, and to put off the 
evil day of appearing ruined men as long as they 
can, and then, when their tempers are soured by 
adversity, they grow tired of their own lives, and 
then, in a quarrel, they or some other gentleman, 
perhaps, is run through, or else, being hunted by 
bailiffs, they exercise their swords upon those pur- 
suers. Thus, where gentlemen will not consider 
their circumstances, their very prosperity is a cause 
of and aggravates their misery ; their very pride 
(which was a decent pride at first), in keeping up 
and maintaining their credit, subjects them too 
often to the lowest and the meanest acts, and their 
courage, which was of a laudable kind, turns into a 
brutish and savage rage ; and all the fine, esteemed, 
flourishing, and happy gentleman ends and is lost in 
the contemned poor and miserable desperado, whose 
portion at last is confinement and a gaol, and some- 
times even worse, and what I shall not so much as 
name here. 

[180] 



DUNCAN AT BAY 

Into many of these calamities Mr. Campbell had 
brought himself, before it was long, by his heedless- 
ness, and running, according to the wild dictates of 
youth, counter to all sound and wholesome advice. 
He had, it seems, run himself into debt, and one 
day, as he was at a coffee-house, the sign of the 
Three Crowns, in Great Queen Street, in rushed 
four bailiffs upon him, who, being directed by the 
creditor's wife, had watched him into that house, 
and told him they had a warrant against him, and 
upon his not answering, they being unacquainted 
with his being deaf and dumb, offered to seize his 
sword. He started at their offering of violence, and 
taking them for ruffians (which he had often met 
with), repelled his assaulters, and drawing his sword, 
as one man more bold than the rest closed in with 
him, he shortened his blade, and in the fall, pinned 
the fellow through the shoulder, and himself through 
the leg, to the floor. After that he stood at bay 
with all the four officers, when the most mischievous 
assailant of them all, the creditor's wife, ventured to 
step into the fray, and very barbarously took hold 
of that nameless part of the man, for which, as she 
was a married woman, nature methinks should have 
taught her to have a greater tenderness, and almost 
squeezed and crushed those vitals to death. But at 
last he got free from them all, and was going away 
as fast as he could, not knowing what consequences 
might ensue. But the woman, who aimed herself at 
committing murder in the most savage and inhuman 
manner, ran out after him, crying out "Murder! 
murder ! " as loud as she could, and alarmed the 

[181] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

whole street. The bailiffs following the woman, 
and being bloody from head to foot, by means of 
the wound he received, gave credit to the outcry. 
The late Earl Rivera's footmen happening to be at 
the door, ran immediately to stop the supposed 
murderer, and they indeed did take him at last, but 
perceived their mistake, and discovered that, instead 
of being assistants in taking a man whom they 
thought to be a murderer endeavouring to make his 
escape from the hands of justice, they had only been 
tricked in, by that false cry, to be adjutants to a 
bailiff in retaking a gentleman, who by so gallant 
a defence, had rescued himself from the dangers of 
a prison ; and when they had discovered this their 
mistake, they were mighty sorry for what they had 
done. The most active and busy among the earl's 
footmen was a Dutchman, and the earl happening 
to be in a room next the streets and hearing the 
outcry of murder, stepped to the window, and seeing 
his own servants in the midst of a bustle, examined 
the Dutchman how the matter stood, and being told 
it, chid the man for being concerned in stopping a 
gentleman that was getting free from such trouble- 
some companions. But the Dutchman excused 
himself like a Dutchman, by making a very merry 
blunder for a reply. " Sacramente," said he, to hi> 
lord, " if I had thought they were bailiffs, I would 
have fought for the poor dumb gentleman, but then 
why had not he told me they were bailiffs, my lord ? * 
In short, Duncan Campbell was carried off as their 
prisoner; but the bailiff that was wounded was led 
back to the coffee-house, where he pretended the 

[ 182 ] 



IMPRISONMENT 



wound was mortal, and that he despaired of living an 
hour. The proverb, however, was of the fellow's 
side, and he recovered sooner than other people ex- 
pected he could. As soon as all danger was over, an 
action for damages and smart money, as their term 
is, was brought against Mr. Campbell ; the damages 
were exaggerated, and the demand was so extrav- 
agant, that Duncan Campbell was neither able, just 
at that time, nor willing, had he been able, to pay 
so much, as he thought, in his own wrong ; and 
having no bail, and being ashamed to make his 
case known to his better sort of friends, who were 
both able and willing to help him at a dead lift, he 
was hurried away to gaol by the bailiffs, who showed 
such a malignant and insolent pleasure as commonly 
attends powerful revenge, when they put him into 
the Marshalsea. There he lay in confinement six 
weeks, till at last four or five of his chief friends 
came by mere chance to hear of it : immediately 
they consulted about his deliverance, and unanimously 
resolved to contribute for his enlargement, and they 
accordingly went across the water together, and 
procured it out of hand. 

Two of his benefactors were officers, and were just 
then going over to Flanders. Duncan Campbell, to 
whom they communicated their design, was resolved 
to try his fortune in a military way, out of a roving 
kind of humour, raised in him partly by his having 
taken a sort of aversion to his own profession in 
town, and partly by his finding that he could not 
live, without following a profession as he had done, 
any longer. He, over a bottle, frankly imparted his 

[ 183 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



mind to them at large ; he signified to them that 
he hoped, since they had lately done him so great a 
favour in freeing him from one captivity, they would 
not think him too urgent, if he pressed for one favour 
further, upon natures so generous as theirs, by whom 
he took as great a pleasure in being obliged, as he 
could receive, in being capable of obliging others. 
He wrote to them that the favour he meant was to 
redeem him from another captivity, almost as irk- 
some to him as that out of which they had lately 
ransomed him. "This captivity," continued he, "is, 
being either forced to follow my old profession, 
which I have taken an entire disgust to, for a main- 
tenance, or being forced to live in a narrower way 
than suits with my genius, and the better taste I 
have of higher life. Such a state, gentlemen, you 
know, is more unpalatable than half-pay ; it is like, 
either being forced to go upon the forlorn hope, or 
else, like a mans being an entirely cashiered and 
broken officer, that had no younger brother's fortune, 
and no other support but his commission. Thus, 
though you have set my body at liberty, my soul is 
still under an imprisonment, and will be till I leave 
England, and can find means of visiting Flanders, 
which I can do no otherwise than by the advantage 
of having you for my convoy. I have a mighty 
longing to experience some part of a military life, 
and I fancy, if you will grant me your interest, and 
introduce me to the valiant young Lome, and be 
spokesman for a dumb man, I shall meet with a 
favourable reception ; and as for you, gentlemen, 
after having named that great patron and pattern 

[ 184 ] 



IN ROTTERDAM 



of courage and conduct in the field, I cannot doubt 
but the very name I bear, if you had not known me, 
would have made you take me for a person of a 
military genius, and that I should do nothing but 
what would become a British soldier and a gentle- 
man ; nothing, in fine, that should make you repent 
the recommendation. ,, 

These generous and gallant friends of his, it seems, 
complied with his request, and promised they would 
make application for him to the Lord Lorne, and 
Duncan Campbell had nothing to do but to get his 
bag and baggage ready and provide himself with a 
pass. His baggage was not very long a getting to- 
gether, and he had it in tolerable good order, and 
as for his pass, a brother of the Lord Forbes was 
so kind as to procure him one, upon the first appli- 
cation Duncan made to him. 

Accordingly, in a few days afterwards they went 
on board, and having a speedy and easy passage, 
arrived soon at Rotterdam. Duncan met with some 
of his English acquaintance in that town, and his 
mind being pretty much bent upon rambling, and 
seeing all the curiosities, customs, and humours he 
could in all the foreign places he was to pass through, 
he went, out of a frolic, with some gentlemen next 
day, in a boat, to an adjacent village, to make 
merry over a homely Dutch entertainment, the in- 
tended repast being to consist of what the boors 
there count a great delicacy, brown bread and white 
beer. He walked out of sight from his company, 
and they lost one another ; and strolling about by 
himself at an unseasonable hour, as they call it 

[185] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



there, after the bell has tolled, Duncan Campbell, 
who neither knew their laws, nor, if he had, was 
capable of being guided by the notice which their 
laws ordain, was taken into custody in the village 
for that night, and carried away the next day to 
Willemstad, where he was taken for a spy, and 
put into a close imprisonment for three or four 
days. 

But some Scotch gentlemen, who had been in com- 
pany with Mr. Campbell at Mr. Cloy ster man's, a 
painter in Covent Garden, made their application to 
the magistrate and got him released. He knew his 
friends, the officers that carried him over, were gone 
forward to the camp, and that there was no hope of 
finding them at Rotterdam, if he should go thither; 
and so lie resolved, since he had had so many days 1 
punishment in Willemstad, to have three or four 
days 1 pleasure there too, by way of amends, before 
he would set out on his journey after his friends. 
But on the third night he got very much in drink ; 
and as he went very boisterously and disorderly 
along, a sentry challenged him, and the want of the 
sense of hearing had like to have occasioned the loss 
of his life. The sentry fired at him and narrowly 
missed him; he was taken prisoner, not without 
some resistance, which was so far innocent as that 
he knew not any reason why he should be seized, 
but very troublesome and unwarrantable in so orderly 
a town ; so the governor's secretary, after the matter 
was examined into, judging it better for the un- 
happy gentleman's future safety, advised him to 
return home to his own country, and accordingly 

[186] 



CAPTURE AT SEA 



bespoke him a place in a Dutch ship called " Yowfrow 
Catherine," for his passage to England. 

Duncan Campbell had taken up this humour of 
rambling, first of his own accord, and the troubles 
which he had run himself into by it, we may reason- 
ably suppose, had pretty well cured him of that 
extravagant itch ; and there is very little doubt to 
be made, but that he rejoiced very heartily when he 
was got on board the ship to return to England ; 
and that, in his new resolutions, he had reconciled 
himself to the prosecution of his former profession, 
and intended to set up for a predictor again as soon 
as he could arrive at London. But now fortune had 
not a mind to let him go off so : he had had his own 
fancy for rambling, and now she was resolved to have 
hers, and to give him his bellyful of caprice. Ac- 
cordingly, when the Dutch ship called " Yowfrow 
Catherine M was making the best of her road for 
London, and each person in the vessel was making 
merry, filled with the hopes of a quick and prosper- 
ous passage, a French privateer appeared in sight, 
crowding all the sails she could, and bearing towards 
them with all haste and diligence. The privateer 
was double-manned, and carried thirty guns ; the 
Dutch vessel was defenceless in comparison ; and the 
people on board had scarce time to think, and to 
deplore that they should be made a prey of, before 
they actually were so, and had reason enough given 
them for their sorrow. All the passengers, to a 
single man, were stripped, and had French seamen's 
jackets in exchange for their clothes. Duncan Camp- 
bell had now a taste given him of the fate of war, as 

[187] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



well as of humour of travelling, and wished himself 
again, I warrant him, among his greatest crowd of 
consul ters, as tiresome as he thought things to be, 
instead of being in the middle of a crew of sea- 
savages. The town where the dumb prisoner was at 
last confined was Denain. There happened to be 
some English friars there, who were told by the 
others who he was, and to them he applied him- 
self in writing, and received from them a great deal 
of civil treatment. But a certain man of the Order 
of Recollects, happening to see him there, who had 
known him in England, and what profession he fol- 
lowed, caused him to be called to question as a man 
that made use of ill means to tell fortunes. When 
he was questioned by a whole society of these reli- 
gious men, he made them such pertinent and satis- 
factory answers in writing, that he convinced them 
he had done nothing for which he deserved their 
reprimand; and they unanimously acquitted him. 
The heads of his defence, as I have been informed, 
were these : — 

First, he alleged that the second-sight was inborn 
and inbred in some men ; and that every country had 
had examples of it more or less ; but that the country 
of Scotland, in which he was educated from an infant, 
abounded the most of any with those sort of people ; 
and from thence, he said, he thought he might very 
naturally draw this conclusion, that a faculty that 
was inborn and inbred to men, and grown almost a 
national faculty among a people, who were remark- 
ably honest, upright, and well-meaning people, could 
not, without some impiety, be imputed to the 

1188] 



A COMMON ERROR 



possessors of it as a sin ; and when one of the fathers 
rejoined, that it was remarked by several writers, of 
the second-sight, that it must be therefore sinful, be- 
cause it remained no longer among the people when 
the doctrines of Christianity were fully propagated, 
and the light of the gospel increased among them, 
and that afterwards it affected none but persons of 
vicious lives and an ill character, to this objection 
Mr. Campbell replied, that he knew most, even 
ingenious writers, had made that remark concerning 
the second-sight, but begged leave to be excused if 
he ventured to declare that it was no better than a 
vulgar and common error ; and the reasons were 
these, which he alleged in his own behalf, and to 
confirm his assertion, he told them that men of un- 
doubted probity, virtue, and learning, both of their 
own religion (viz., the Roman Catholic), and also of 
the reformed religion, and in several nations, had 
been affected, and continued all their lives to be af- 
fected with this second-sighted power, and that there 
could be, therefore, no room to fix upon it the odious 
character of being a sinful and vicious (not to say 
that some called it still worse, a diabolical) talent. 
He said he would content himself with making but 
two instances, because he believed those two would 
be enough to give content to them, his judges too, in 
that case. 

In his first instance he told them that they might 
find somewhat relating to this in Nicholaus Hemin- 
gius, who, in his tracts " De Superstitionibus Magicis," 
printed at Copenhagen, anno 1575, informs the world 
that Petrus Palladius, a bishop of Zealand and pro- 

[189] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



fessor of divinity at Copenhagen, could, from a part 
of his body affected, foretell from what part of the 
heave ns tempests would come, and was seldom de- 
ceived. One of the fathers immediately asked him 
if he understood Latin ? To this Duncan Campbell 
replied no. " Oh ! " said the friar then, " I do 
not remember that book was ever translated into 
English that you mention." " But," rejoined Dun- 
can Campbell, "the passage I mentioned to you I 
have read in an English book, and word for word, 
according to the best of my memory, as I have writ- 
ten it down to you." " In what English book ? " 
said the friar. " I do not remember the name of the 
book,' 1 Duncan Campbell answered, "but very well 
remember the passages, and that it was in a book of 
authority, and which bore a credit and good repute 
in the world ; and you, being scholars, may, if you 
please, have recourse to the learned original, and I 
doubt not but you w ill find what I say to be a truth." 
For the second instance, he told them that in Spain 
there are those called Saludadores that have this kind 
of gift. " There was," continued he in writing, " one 
of youi own religion, venerable fathers, and of a re- 
ligious order, nay, a friar too, that had this gift ; he 
was a noted Dominican," said he, "and though I 
forget his name, you may, by writing a letter to 
England, learn his name. He was a devout Portu- 
guese, belonging to Queen Catherine Dowagers 
Chapel, and had the second-sight to a great degree, 
and was famous and eminent for it." They then asked 
him what was the full power he had to do by the 
second-sight. He answered, that as they had inti- 

[190 j 



OCCULT KNOWLEDGE 



mated that they had perused some of the skilful 
writers concerning the second-sight, he did not doubt 
but they found, as well as he could tell them, that 
as to the extent of people's knowledge in that secret 
way, it reached both present, past, and future events. 
" They foresee murders, drownings, weddings, burials, 
combats, manslaughters, &c, all of which there are 
many instances to be given. They commonly foresee 
sad events a little while before they happen ; for in- 
stance, if a man's fatal end be hanging, they will see 
a gibbet, or rope about his neck ; if beheading, they 
will see a man without a head ; if drowning, they will 
see water up to his throat ; if stabbing, they will see 
a dagger in his breast ; if unexpected death in his bed, 
they will see a winding-sheet about his head ; they 
foretell, not only marriages, but of good children, 
what kind of life men shall lead, and in what condi- 
tion they shall die, also riches, honours, preferments, 
peace, plenty, and good weather. It is likewise 
usual with persons that have lost anything to go 
to some of these men, by whom they are directed, 
how, with what persons, and in what place they shall 
find their goods. It is also to be noted, that these 
gifts bear a latitude, so that some have it in a far 
more eminent degree than others ; and what I have 
here written down to you, you need not take as a 
truth from me, but as it concerned me so nearly, I 
remember the passage by heart, and you will find it 
very near word for word in Dr. Beaumont's book of 
Familiar Spirits." — " Ay," said the friars, " but you 
have a genius too that attends you, as we are in- 
formed." — " So," replied Duncan Campbell, " have 

[191] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



all persons that have the second-sight in any eminent 
degree ; and to prove this I will bring no less a wit- 
ness than King James, who, in his * Demonology, , 
book the third and chapter the second, mentions also 
a spirit called Brownie, that was wont formerly to 
haunt divers houses, without doing any evil, but do- 
ing, as it were, necessary turns up and down the 
house ; he appeared like a rough man, nay, some 
believed that their house was all the sonsier, as they 
called it, that is, the more lucky or fortunate that 
such spirits resorted there.' 1 

With these replies the friars began to own they 
were very well satisfied, and acquiesced in the ac- 
count he had given of himself, as a very good, true, 
and honest account; but they told him they had 
still a further accusation against him, and that was, 
that he practised magic arts, and that he used, as 
they had been informed, unlawful incantations. To 
this he made answer that there were two kinds of 
magic, of which he knew they, that were men of 
learning, could not be ignorant. " The art magic, 
which is wicked and impious," continued he, " is that 
which is professed, and has been professed at all 
times in the world, by witches, magicians, diviners, 
enchanters, and such-like notorious profligates, who, 
by having an unnatural commerce with the devil, do 
many strange, prodigious, and preternatural acts 
above and beyond all human wisdom; and all the 
arguments I ever did or ever will deduce,'" continued 
he, " from that black art, is a good and a shining 
argument ; it is this, O fathers, I draw a reason from 
these prodigious practices of wizards, magicians, 

[ 192 ] 



THE MAGIC ART 



enchanters, &c, and from all the heathen idolatry 
and superstition, to prove that there is a deity ; for, 
from these acts of theirs being preternatural and 
above human wisdom, we may consequently infer 
that they proceed from a supernatural and im- 
material cause, such as demons are. And this is all 
the knowledge I ever did or ever will draw from that 
black hellish art. But, fathers, there is another kind 
of art magic, called natural magic, which is directly op- 
posite to theirs, and the object of which art is to do 
spiritual good to mankind, as the object of theirs is 
to torment them and induce them to evil. They afflict 
people with torments, and my art relieves them from 
the torments they cause. The public profession of 
these magical arts has (as you know, fathers, it is a 
common distinction between black and white magic) 
been tolerated in some of the most famous univer- 
sities in Christendom, though afterwards, for a very 
good reason in politics, making it a public study to 
such a degree was very wisely retrenched by a pro- 
hibition. If this, therefore, be a fault in your 
own opinions, hear my accusers, but if not, you will 
not only excuse but commend me. 11 

The friars were extremely well pleased with his de- 
fence : but one of them had a mind to frighten him 
a little if he could, and asked him what he would 
say, if he could produce some witches, lately seized, 
that would swear he had been frequently at their 
unlawful assemblies, where they were making their 
waxen images and other odd mischievous inventions 
in black magic to torment folks : " What if I can 
produce such evidence against you,™ wrote the father 
13 [ 193 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



to him by way of strengthening the question ; " will 
you not own that we have convicted you then ? 11 
And when he had written the note, he gave it Dun- 
can Campbell, with a look that seemed to express 
his warmth and earnestness in the expostulation. 
Duncan Campbell took the paper and read it, and 
far from being startled, returned this answer, with a 
smile continuing in his face while he wrote it. 
" No," said he, " fathers, by your leave, they will 
only prove me a good magician by that oath, and 
themselves more plainly witches. They will prove 
their love to torment good folks, and only show 
their hatred to me, an innocent man, but wise 
enough to torment them by hindering them from 
tormenting others." The fathers were well pleased 
with the shrewdness of the answer : but Duncan 
Campbell had a mind to exert his genius a little 
farther with the good friar, who thought likewise he 
had put him a very shrewd question, so taking up 
another sheet of paper : " Fathers," said he, " shall 
I entertain you with a story of what passed, upon 
this head, between two religious fathers (as you all 
of you are) and a Prince of Germany, in which 
you will find that mine ought to be reputed a full 
answer to the question the last learned father 
was pleased to propose me ? The story is somewhat 
long, but very much to the purpose, and enter- 
taining : I remember it perfectly by heart, and if 
you will have patience while I am writing it, I don't 
doubt but that I shall not only satisfy you, but 
please you and oblige you with the relation. The 
author I found it in quotes it from Fromanus (I 

[ !94] 



A TALE OF WITCHCRAFT 



think the man's name was so, and I am sure my 
author calls him a very learned man), in his third 
book of ' Magical Incantation,'' and, though I do not 
understand the language the original is written in, 
yet, I dare venture to say, upon the credit of my 
English author, from whom I got the story by 
heart, that you will find me right, whenever you 
shall be pleased to search. " 

The friars were earnest for the story, and expressed 
a desire that he would write it down for them to 
read, which he did in the following words. — Note, 
that I have since compared Mr. Duncan Campbell's 
manuscript with the author's page, out of which he 
took it, and find it word for word the same ; which 
shows how incomparable a memory this deaf and 
dumb gentleman has got, besides his other extraor- 
dinary qualifications. — The story is this. 

"A Prince of Germany invited two religious 
fathers, of eminent virtue and learning, to a dinner. 
The prince, at table, said to one of them : ' Father ! 
think you we do right in hanging persons, who are 
accused by ten or twelve witches to have appeared 
at their meetings or sabbaths ? I somewhat fear we 
are imposed on by the devil, and that it is not a safe 
way to truth, that we walk in by these accusations ; 
especially, since many great and learned men every- 
where begin to cry out against it, and to charge our 
consciences with it ; tell me therefore your opinion.' 
To whom the fathers being somewhat of an eager 
spirit, said, ' What should make us doubtful in this 
case ? or what should touch our consciences, being 
convicted by so many testimonies ? Can we make it 

[195] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



a scruple, whether God will permit innocent persons 
should be so traduced ? There is no cause for a judge 
to stick at such a number of accusations, but he may 
proceed with safety.' To which, when the prince 
had replied, and much had been said pro and con on 
both sides about it, and the father seemed wholly 
to carry the point, the prince at length concluded 
the dispute, saying, 4 1 am sorry for you, father, that 
in a capital cause you have condemned yourself, and 
you cannot complain if I commit you to custody ; 
for no less than fifteen witches have deposed that 
they have seen you — ay, start not : you, your own 
self, at their meetings ; and to show you that I am 
not in jest, I will presently cause the public acts to 
be brought for you to read them.' The father stood 
in amaze, and with a dejected countenance had 
nothing here to oppose but confusion and silence 
for all his learned eloquence/ 1 

As soon as Mr. Campbell had written down the 
story, the fathers perused it, and seemed mightily 
entertained with it. It put an end to all further 
questions, and the man, whom they had been trying 
for a conjurer, they joined in desiring, upon distinct 
pieces of paper, under their several hands, to come 
frequently and visit them, as being not only a harm- 
less and innocent but an extraordinary well-meaning, 
good, and diverting companion. They treated him 
for some time afterwards during his stay, with the 
friendship due to a countryman, with the civility 
that is owing to gentlemen, and with the assistance 
and support which belonged to a person of merit in 
distress. Money they had none themselves, it seems,

to give him, being mendicants by their own profes- 
sion ; but they had interest enough to get him quite 
free from being prisoner ; he participated of their 
eleemosynary table, had a cell allowed him among 
them in what they called their dormitory ; he had an 
odd coat and a pair of trousers made out of some of 
their brown coarse habits, by the poor unfashionable 
tailor or botcher belonging to the convent ; and at 
last they found means of recommending him to a 
master of a French vessel, that was ready to set sail, to 
give him a cast over the Channel to England, and 
to provide him with the necessaries of life till he got 
to the port. This French vessel was luckier than the 
Dutch one had been before to our dumb gentleman ; 
it had a quick and prosperous passage, and arrived at 
Portsmouth ; and as soon as he had landed there, he 
having experienced the misfortunes and casualties 
that a man in his condition, wanting both speech and 
hearing, was liable to, in places where he was an utter 
stranger to everybody, resolved to make no stay, but 
to move on as fast as he could towards London. 
When he came to Hampton Town, considering the 
indifferent figure he made in those odd kind of clothes 
which the poor friars had equipped him with, and that 
his long beard and uncombed wig added much to the 
disguise, he was resolved to put on the best face he 
could in those awkward circumstances, and stepped 
into the first barber's shop he came at, to be trimmed 
and get his wig combed and powdered. 

This proved a very lucky thought to him ; for, as 
soon as he stepped into the first barber's shop, who 
should prove to be the master of it, but one Tobit 

[ 197 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



Yeats, who had served him in the same capacity at 
London, and was but newly set up in the trade of a 
barber-surgeon at Hampton Town, and followed like- 
wise the profession of schoolmaster. This Tobit 
Yeats had shaved him quite, before he knew him in 
that disguise ; and Mr. Campbell, though he knew 
him presently, had a mind to try if he should be 
known himself first. At length, the barber, finding 
him to be a dumb man, by his ordering everything 
with motions of the hand and gestures of the body, 
looked at him very earnestly, remembered him, and 
in a great surprise called for pen, ink, and paper, 
and begged to know how he came in that disguise ; 
whether he was under any misfortune and appre- 
hension of being discovered, that made him go in so 
poor and so clownish a habit, and tendered him any 
services, as far as his little capacity would reach, and 
desired him to be free, and command him, if he was 
able to assist him in anything. These were the most 
comfortable words that Duncan Campbell had read a 
great while. He took the pen and paper in his turn ; 
related to him his whole story, gave the poor barber 
thanks for his good-natured offer, and said he would 
make so much use of it as to be indebted to him for 
so much money as would pay the stage-coach, and 
bear him in his travelling expenses up to London, 
from whence he would speedily return the favour with 
interest. The poor honest fellow, out of gratitude to 
a master whose liberality he had formerly experienced, 
immediately furnished Mr. Duncan Campbell with that 
little supply, expressing the gladness of his heart that 
it lay in his power ; and the stage-coach being to set 

[198] 



DUNCAN IN LONDON 



out within but a few hours, he ran instantly to the 
inn to see if he could get him a place. By good luck 
there was room, and but just room for one more, 
which pleased Duncan Campbell mightily when he 
was acquainted with it by his true and trusty servant 
the barber ; for he was as impatient to see London 
again, it seems, as he had been before to quit it. Well, 
he had his wish : and when he came to London, he 
had one wish more for fortune to bestow upon him, 
which appeared to begin to grow kind again, after 
her fickle fit of cruelty was over ; and this wish was, 
that he might find his former lodgings empty, and 
live in the same house as when he followed his pro- 
fession. This too succeeded according to his desire, 
and he was happily fixed once more to his heart's 
content in his old residence, with the same people of 
the house round about him, who bore him all that 
respect and affection, and showed all that readiness 
and willingness to serve him on every occasion, and 
at every turn, which could be expected from persons 
that let lodgings in town to a gentleman whom they 
esteemed the best tenant they ever had in their lives, 
or ever could have. 

Immediately the tidings of the dumb gentleman's 
being returned home from beyond sea spread through- 
out all the neighbourhood ; and it was noised about 
from one neighbourhood to another, till it went 
through all ranks and conditions, and was known as 
well in a day or two's time all the town over, as if 
he had been some great man belonging to the state, 
and his arrival had been notified to the public in the 
Gazette as a person of the last importance. And such 

[199 J 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



a person he appeared indeed to be taken for, especially 
among the fair sex, who thronged to his doors, crowd 
after crowd, to consult with him about their future 

occurrences in life. 

These curious tribes of people were as various in 
their persons, sex, age, quality, profession, art, trade, 
as they were in the curiosity of their minds, and the 
questions they had intended to propound to this dumb 
predictor of strange events, that lay yet as embryos 
in the womb of time, and were not to come, some of 
them, to a maturity for birth for very many years after, 
just as porcelain clay is stored up in the earth by good 
artificers, which their heirs make china of half a cen- 
tury, and sometimes more than an age afterwards. 

These shoals of customers, who were to fee him 
well for his advice, as we may suppose, now he stood 
in need of raising a fresh stock, were, unquestionably, 
as welcome and acceptable to him as they appeared 
too troublesome to him before, when he was in a 
state of wealth and plenty. 

Fortune, that does nothing moderately, seemed 
now resolved, as she had been extremely cruel before, 
to be extremely kind to him. He had nothing to 
do from early in the morning till late at night, 
but to read questions, and resolve them as fast as 
much-frequented doctors write their prescriptions 
and recipes ; and like them also, to receive fees as 
fast. Fortune was, indeed, mightily indulgent to 
the wants she had so suddenly reduced him to ; and 
relieved him as suddenly by these knots of curiosos, 
who brought him a glut of money. But one single 
fair lady, that was one of his very best consul ten 

[ 200 ] 



GENEROUS SYMPATHY 



after his return, and who had received satisfactory 
answers from him in other points, before he went 
abroad, proved (so good fortune would have it) 
worth all the rest of his customers together, as 
numerous as they were, and as I have accordingly 
represented them. 

This lady was the relict or widow of a gentleman 
of a good estate, and of a very good family, whose 
name was Digby ; and a handsome jointure she had 
out of the estate. This lady, it seems, having been 
with him in former days, and seen him in a more 
shining way of life (for he had taken a humour to 
appear before all his company in that coarse, odd 
dress, made out of the friar's habit, and would not 
be persuaded by the people of the house to put on 
a night-gown till he could provide himself with a 
new suit), was so curious, among other questions, 
as to ask him whether he had met with any misfor- 
tunes, and how he came to be in so slovenly and 
wretched a habit ? Here Mr. Campbell related the 
whole story of his travels to her, and the crosses 
and disappointments he had met with abroad. The 
tears, he observed, would start every now and then 
into her eyes when she came to any doleful passage, 
and she appeared to have a mighty compassionate 
kind of feeling when she read of any hardship more 
than ordinarily melancholy that had befallen him. 
Mr. Campbell, it is certain, had then a very good 
presence, and was a handsome and portly young 
man ; and, as a great many young gentlemen derive 
the seeming agreeableness of their persons from the 
tailor and peruke-maker, the shoemaker and hosier, 

[ 201 ] 



MH. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



so Mr. Campbell's person, on the other hand, gave 
a good air and a good look to the awkward garb he 
had on; and I believe, it was from seeing him in 
this odd trim (as they call it) the ladies first took 
up the humour of calling him the handsome sloven ; 
add to this, that he looked his misfortune in the 
face with a jolly countenance, and smiled even while 
he was penning the relation of his calamities, all 
which are certainly circumstances that first soothe 
a generous mind into a state of compassion, and 
afterwards heighten it in the breast wherein it is 
conceived. Hence it came that this pretty and 
good-natured widow, Mrs. Digby, when she had 
expressed her commiseration of him by her looks, 
began to take the pen and express it in very tender 
terms : neither did she think that expression in 
words a sufficient testimony of the compassion she 
bore to him; the generosity of her mind did Lead 
her to express it in a more substantial manner still, 
and that was, to show it plainly by a very benevo- 
lent action. She laid a purse of twenty guineas 
before the table, and at the same time smiling, 
pointed to the table, as signifying her desire that he 
would accept it; and, running to the door, dropped 
a curtsey, and scuttled away ; and, by the same civil 
act as she obliged him, she put it out of his power 
to refuse being so obliged ; so that, though the 
present was very handsome, the manner of giving 
it was still handsomer. 

If being a handsome young man of merit in dis- 
tress, and bearing his misfortunes with an equal 
mind, are powerful motives to excite compassion in 

[ 202 ] 



COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE 



the mind of a generous lady, so the generosity of a 
young agreeable widow, expressed in so kind and so 
benevolent a way to a young gentleman, when he 
had been tasting nothing but the bitter draughts of 
fortune before, must stir up an affection in a mind 
that had any sense of gratitude : and truly, j ust such 
was the effect that this lady's civility had upon Mr. 
Duncan Campbell. He conceived from that moment 
a very great affection for her, and resolved to try 
whether he could gain her ; which he had no small 
grounds to hope, from the esteem which she appeared 
to bear towards him already. I remember Mr. 
Dryden makes a very beautiful observation of the 
near alliance there is between the two passions of 
pity and love in a woman's breast, in one of his 
plays. His words are these : 44 For pity still fore- 
runs approaching love as lightning does the thunder." 
Mr. Bruyere, a most ingenious member of the French 
Academy, has made another remark, which comes 
home to our present purpose. He says, that many 
women love their money better than their friends ; 
but yet value their lovers more than their money. 
According to the two reflections of these fine writers 
upon the tempers of the pair, Mr. Campbell had 
hopes enough to ground his courtship upon ; and it 
appeared so in the end by his proving successful. 
She, from being a very liberal and friendly client, 
became at last a most affectionate wife. He then 
began to be a housekeeper, and accordingly took a 
little neat one, and very commodious for his profes- 
sion, in Monmouth Court. Here I must take leave 
to make this observation, that if Mr. Campbell in- 

[ 203 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



herited the talents of his second-sighted mother, he 
seemed likewise to be an heir to his father, Mr. 
Archibald Campbell, both in his strange and acci- 
dental sufferings by sea, and likewise in his being 
relieved from them, after as accidental and strange a 
manner, by an unexpected marriage, just like his 
father's. 

And here we return again to take a new survey of 
him in the course of his public practice as a predictor. 
The accounts I shall give of his actions here, will be 
very various in their nature from any I have yet 
presented to the reader : they are more mysterious 
in themselves, and yet I shall endeavour to make the 
manner of his operating in this kind as plain as, I 
think, I have the following ones; and then, I flatter 
myself, they must afford a fresh entertainment for 
every reader that has any curiosity and a good taste 
for things of so extraordinary a kind ; for what I 
have all along propounded to myself from the be- 
ginning, and in the progress, and to the end of this 
history, is to interweave entertaining and surprising 
narratives of what Mr. Campbell has done, with 
curious and instructive inquiries into the nature of 
those actions, for which he has rendered himself bo 
singularly famous. It was not, therefore, suitable 
to my purpose to clog the reader with numerous 
adventures, almost all of the same kind ; but out of 
a vast number of them to single some few of those 
that were most remarkable and that were mysteries, 
but mysteries of very different sorts. I leave that 
method of swelling distorted and commented trifles 
into volumes, to the writers of fable and romance: 

[ 204 ] 



THE SEER' IN ACTION 



if I was to tell his adventures with regard, for in- 
stance, to women that came to consult him, I might, 
perhaps, have not only written the stories of eleven 
thousand virgins that died maids, but have had rela- 
tions to give of as many married women and widows, 
and the work would have been endless. All that I 
bhall do, therefore, is to pick out one particular, 
each of a different kind, that there may be variety 
in the entertainment. 

Upon application to this dumb man, one is told, 
in the middle of her health, that she shall die at 
such a time ; another, that she shall sicken, and 
upon the moment of her recovery, have a suitor and 
a husband ; a third, who is a celebrated beauty, 
with a multitude of admirers round about her, that 
she shall never become a wife ; a fourth, that is 
married, when she shall get rid of an uneasy hus- 
band ; a fifth, that hath lost her goods, who stole 
them, where and when they shall be restored ; a 
sixth, that is a merchant, when he shall be undone, 
and how and when he shall recover his losses, and 
be as great on the Exchange as ever ; a seventh, 
that is a gamester, which will be his winning and his 
losing hour ; an eighth, how he shall be involved in 
a lawsuit, and whether the suit will have a prosper- 
ous issue ; a ninth, that is a woman with choice of 
lovers, which she shall be most happy with for life ; 
and so on to many others, where every prediction is 
perfectly new and surprising, and differs from the 
other in almost every circumstance. When a man 
has so extensive a genius as this at foretelling the 
future occurrences of life, one narrative of a sort is 

[ 205 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



enough in conscience to present the reader with ; 
and several of each kind would not, methinks, be 
entertaining but tiresome ; for he that can do one 
thing in these kinds by the power of prediction, can 
do ten thousand ; and those who are obstinate in 
extenuating his talents, and calling his capacity in 
question, and that will not be convinced by one 
instance of his judgment, would not own the con- 
viction if ten thousand instances were given them. 
The best passages I can recommend to their perusal, 
are those where persons, who came purposely (o 
banter him under the colour of consulting him, and 
covered over their sly intentions with borrowed 
disguises, and came in masquerades, found all the 
jest turned upon themselves in the end, which they 
meant to our famous predictor ; and had the dis- 
couragement of seeing their most-concealed and 
deepest-laid plots discovered, and all their most witty 
fetches and wily contrivances defeated, till they were 
compelled universally to acknowledge, that endeavour- 
ing to impose upon the judgment of our seer by any 
hidden artifice and cunning whatsoever was effectually 
imposing upon their own. His unusual talent in 
this kind was so openly known and so generally con- 
fessed, that his knowledge was celebrated in some of 
the most witty weekly papers that ever appeared in 
public. Isaac Bickerstaff, who diverted all the beau- 
monde for a long space of time with his lucubrations, 
takes occasion in several of his papers to applaud 
the speculations of this dumb gentleman, in an ad- 
mirable vein of pleasantry and humour, peculiar to 
the writer, and to the subject he wrote upon ; and 

[ 206 ] 



A LETTER OF INQUIRY 



when that bright author, who joined the uttermost 
facetiousness with the most solid improvements of 
morality and learning in his works, laid aside the 
title of a Tatler, and assumed the name of a Spectator 
and censor of men's actions, he still every now and 
then thought our Duncan Campbell a subject worthy 
enough to employ his farther consideration upon. 
I must take notice of one letter sent concerning him 
to the Spectator, in the year 1712, which was at a 
time when a lady w r anted him, after he had removed 
from Monmouth Street to Drury Lane. 

" Mr. Spectator, — About two years ago, I was 
called upon by the younger part of a country family, 
by my mother's side related to me, to visit Mr. 
Campbell, the dumb man ; for they told me that was 
chiefly what brought them to town, having heard 
wonders of him in Essex. I, who always wanted 
faith in such matters, was not easily prevailed on to 
go ; but lest they should take it ill, I went with them, 
when, to my own surprise, Mr. Campbell related all 
their past life (in short, had he not been prevented, 
such a discovery would have come out as would have 
ruined their next design of coming to town, viz., 
buying wedding clothes). Our names, though he 
never heard of us before, and endeavoured to conceal, 
were as familiar to him as to ourselves. To be sure, 
Mr. Spectator, he is a very learned and wise man. 
Being impatient to know my fortune, having paid 
my respects in a family Jacobus, he told me, after 
his manner, among several other things, that in a 
\ car and nine months I should fall ill of a new fever,

be given over by my physicians, but should with much 
difficulty recover ; that the first time I took the air 
afterwards, I should be addressed to by a young 
gentleman of a plentiful fortune, good sense, and a 
generous spirit. Mr. Spectator, he is the purest 
man in the world ; for all he said is come to pass, 
and I am the happiest woman in Kent. I have been 
in quest of Mr. Campbell these three months, and 
cannot find him out : now, hearing you are a dumb 
man too, I thought you might correspond and be 
able to tell me something; for I think myself highly 
obliged to make his fortune, as he has mine. T is 
very possible your worship, who has spies all over 
this town, can inform me how to send to him ; if 
you can, I beseech you be as speedy as possible, and 
you will highly oblige your constant reader and 
admirer, " Dulcibella Thankley."

the most surprising of all, during the time that he 
enjoyed this reputation, and when he proved that he

of him while he is wonderfully curing persons labour- 
ing under the misfortune of witchcraft, of which the

SUSANNA JOHNSON 



following story will be an eminent instance, and like- 
wise clear up how he came by his reputation in Essex, 
as mentioned in the above-mentioned letter to the 
Spectator. 

In the year 1709, Susanna Johnson, daughter to 
one Captain Johnson, who lived at a place adjacent 
to Romford, in Essex, going one morning to that 
town to buy butter at the market, was met there by 
an old miserable-looking woman, just as she had 
taken some of her change of the market-woman in 
copper, and this old woman rather demanded than 
begged the gentlewoman to give her a penny. Mrs. 
Johnson, reputing her to be one of those hateful 
people that are called sturdy beggars, refused it her, 
as thinking it to be no act of charity, and that it 
would be rather gratifying and indulging her im- 
pudence than supplying or satisfying her indigence. 
Upon the refusal, the old hag, with a face more 
wrinkled still, if possible, by anger than it was by 
age, took upon her to storm at young Mrs. Johnson 
very loudly, and to threaten and menace her ; but 
when she found her common threats and menaces of 
no avail, she swore she would be revenged of the 
young creature in so signal a manner, that she should 
repent the denial of that penny from her heart be- 
fore she got home, and that it should cost her many 
pounds to get rid of the consequences of that denial 
and her anger. The poor innocent creature despised 
these last words likewise, and getting up on horse- 
back, returned homewards ; but just as she got about 
half way her horse stopped, and no means that she 
could use would make him advance one single step ; 
1* [ 209 1 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



but she stayed a while, to see if that would humour 
him to go on. At last the beast began to grow un- 
ruly, and snorted and trembled as if he had seen or 
Smelt something that frighted him, and so fell 
a kicking desperately till he threw the girl from the 
saddle, not being able to cling to it any longer, though 
a pretty good horsewoman of her years ; so much 
were the horse's motions and plungings more than 
ordinarily violent. 

As Providence would have it, she got not much 
harm by the fall, receiving only a little bruise in 
the right shoulder; but she was dreadfully frighted. 
This fear added wings to her feet, and brought her 
home as speedily of herself as she usually came on 
horseback. She immediately, without any other sign 
of illness than the pallid colour with which fear had 
disordered the complexion of her face, alarmed all 
the family at home with the story, took her bed 
upon it, complained of inward rackings of the belly, 
and was never at ease unless she lay doubled up 
together, her head to her knees, and her heels to her 
l ump, just like a figure of 8. She could not be a 
single moment out of that posture without shrieking 
out with the violence of anxious torments and rack- 
ing pains. 

In this condition of misery, amidst this agony of 
suffering, and in this double posture, was the poor 
wretched young gentlewoman brought to town. 
Physicians were consulted about her, but in vain. 
She was earned to different hospitals for assistance, 
but their endeavours likewise proved ineffectual. At 
last she was conducted to the College of Physicians ; 

[210] 



A LAST RESORT 



and even the collective wisdom of the greatest sages 
and adepts in the science of physic was posed to give 
her any prescription that would do her service, and 
relieve her from the inexplicable malady she laboured 
under. The poor incurable creature was one con- 
stant subject of her complaining mother's discourse 
in every company she came into. It happened at 
last, and very providentially, truly, that the mother 
was thus condoling the misfortune of her child among 
five or six ladies, and telling them, among other 
things, that by the most skilful persons she was 
looked upon to be bewitched, and that it was not 
within the power of physic to compass her recovery. 
They all having been acquainted with our Mr. Dun- 
can Campbell, unanimously advised her to carry her 
daughter to his house, and consult with him about 
her. The mother was overjoyed at these tidings, 
and purposed to let no time slip where her child's 
health was so deeply concerned. She got the ladies 
to go with her and her child, to be eye-witnesses of 
so extraordinary a piece of practice, and so eminent 
a trial of skill. 

As soon as this dismal object was brought into his 
room Mr. Duncan Campbell lifted up her head and 
looked earnestly in her face, and in less than a minute's 
time signified to the company that she was not only 
bewitched, but in as dreadful a condition almost as 
the man that had a legion of fiends within him. 

At the reading of these words, the unhappy creat- 
ure raised up her head, turned her eyes upwards, 
and a smile (a thing she had been a stranger to for 
many months) overspread her whole face, and such a 

[211] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



kind of colour as is the flushing of joy and gladness, 
and with an innocent tone of voice she said she now 
had a firm belief she should shortly be delivered. 
The mother and the rest of the company were all in 
tears, but Mr. Campbell wrote to them that they 
should be of good heart, be easy and quiet for a few 
moments, and they should be convinced that it 
was witchcraft, but happily convinced, by seeing her 
so suddenly well again. This brought the com- 
pany into pretty good temper ; and a little after, 
Mr. Campbell desired she might be led upstairs to his 
chamber, and left there alone with him for a little 
while. This occasioned some small female specula- 
tion, and as much mirth as their late sorrow, allevi- 
ated with the hopes of her cure, would permit. 

This, you may be sure, was but a snatch of mirth, 
just as the nature of the thing would allow of; and 
all sorts of waggery being laid instantly aside, and 
removed almost as soon as conceived, the poor young 
thing was carried in that double posture upstairs. 
She had not been much above half-an-hour there, 
when, by the help only of Mr. Campbell's arm, she 
was led downstairs, and descended into that room 
full of com pan v, as a miracle appearing in a ma- 
chine from above; she was led backward and forward 
through the room, while all gazed at her for a while 
with joyful astonishment, for no arrow was more 
straight than she. Mr. Campbell then prevailed 
with her to drink a glass of wine, and immediately 
after she evacuated wind, which she had not done 
some months before, and found herself still more 
amended and easy ; and then the mother, making 

[ 212 ] 



THE SCIENCE OF MAGIC 



Mr. Campbell some small acknowledgment at that 
time, with the promise of more, and her daughter 
giving thanks, and all the company commending his 
skill, took their leave and departed with great dem- 
onstrations of joy. I shall here, to cut the story 
short, signify that she came frequently afterwards to 
make her testimonials of gratitude to him, and con- 
tinues to enjoy her health to this very day at Green- 
wich, where she now lives, and will at any time, if 
called upon, make oath of the truth of this little 
history, as she told me herself with her own mouth. 

The next thing, therefore, it behoves me to do in 
this chapter is, to give some satisfactory account of 
magic, by which such seeming mysterious cures and 
operations are brought about. 

This task I would perform in the most perspicuous 
and most convincing manner I can ; for magic, I 
know, is held to be a very hard and difficult study 
by those learned, and universally unlawful and dia- 
bolical by those unlearned, who believe there is such 
a science attainable by human genius. On the other 
hand, by some learned men, who believe there is no 
such science, it is represented as an inconsistent sys- 
tem of superstitions and chimeras ; and again laughed 
at as such by the unlearned, who are of an incredulous 
temper. What I would therefore undertake to do in 
this place is to show the learned men, who believe 
there is such an art, that the attainment to a toler- 
able knowledge of the manner how magical practices 
may be brought about is no such difficult matter as 
they have represented it to themselves ; and by doing 
this I shall make the system of it so plain, that while 

[ 213 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

the learned approve of it, the unlearned, too, who are 
not of an unbelieving kind, may understand clearly 
what I say ; and the learned men who have rejected 
this science as chimerical, may be clearly convinced 
it is real ; and then there is nothing left but obsti- 
nate, unbelieving ignorance, which I shall not here 
pretend by arguments to lead into sense, but leave it 
to the work of time. In fine, I will endeavour to 
induce men of sense to say, that what has been ac- 
counted mysterious is delivered in a plain, easy, and 
convincing manner, and to own that they approve ; 
while men of the lower class of understanding shall 
confess and acknowledge that they themselves under- 
stand it, and that what has hitherto been represented 
as arduous and difficult to a great genius is adapted 
and rendered not only clear but familiar to persons 
of middling talents. In this work, therefore, I shall 
follow the strictest order I can (which of all things 
renders a discourse upon any subject the most clear) ; 
and that it may be plain to the commonest capacity, 
I will first set down what order I intend to follow. 

First, I will speak of magic in general. 

Secondly, of magic under its several divisions and 
subdivisions. 

Thirdly, concerning the object of art, as it is 
good or bad. 

Fourthly, of the persons exercising that art in 
either capacity of good or bad, and by what means 
they become capacitated to exercise it. 

In the fifth place I shall come to the several ob- 
jections against the art of magic, and the refutation 
of those objections. 

[ 214] 



MAGIC IN GENERAL 



The first objection shall be against the existence 
of good and bad spirits ; the refutation of which 
will consist in my proving the existences of spirits 
both good and bad, by reason, and by experience. 

The second objection that will be brought, is to 
contain an allegation that there are no such persons 
as witches now, and an argument to support that 
allegation, drawn from the incapacity and impossi- 
bility of anything making (while itself is incarnate) 
a contract with a spirit. This objection will be an- 
swered by proving the reality of witches from almost 
universal experience, and by explaining rationally 
the manner how the devils hold commerce with 
witches ; which explication is backed and authorised 
by the opinion of the most eminent divines and the 
most learned physicians. 

From hence, sixthly and lastly, we shall conclude 
on the side of the good magic, that as there are 
witches on the one hand that may afflict and torment 
persons with demons, so on the other hand there are 
lawful and good magicians that may cast out 
demons from people that are possessed with them. 

And, first, as to magic in general. Magic con- 
sists in the spirit by faith, for faith is that magnet 
of the magicians by which they draw spirits to them, 
and by which spirits they do great things, and ap- 
pear like miracles. 

Secondly, magic is divided into three sorts, viz., 
divine, natural, and diabolical ; and natural magic 
is again subdivided into two kinds, simple and com- 
pound ; and natural compound magic is again like- 
wise divided into two kinds, viz., natural divine 

[816] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



magic and natural diabolical magic. Now, to give 
the reader a clear and distinct notion of each several 
species of magic here mentioned, I set down the fol- 
lowing definitions : — Divine magic is a celestial 
science, in which all operations that are wonderfully 
brought about are performed by the Spirit of God. 
Natural magic is a science in which all the myste- 
rious acts that are wrought are compassed by natural 
spirits ; but this natural magic may be exercised 
about things either in a manner indifferent in them- 
selves, or mere morally good, and then it is mere 
natural magic, or else about things theologically 
good and transcendently bad, and then it is not 
merely and natural magic but mixed and compound. 
If natural magic be exercised about the most holy 
operations, it is then mixed with the divine, and 
may then be called, not improperly, natural divine 
magic ; but if natural magic troubles itself about 
compassing the wickedest practices, then is it pro- 
miscuous with the demoniacal, and may not improp- 
erly be called natural diabolical magic. 

Thirdly, the object of this art is doing wonders 
out of the ordinary appearing course of nature, which 
tend either to great good or bad, by the help and 
mediation of spirits good and bad. 

Fourthly, as to the persons exercising that art in 
cither way, whether good or bad, and by what means 
they become capacitated to act it, the notion of this 
may be easily deduced from the notions of the art 
itself, as considered above in its each different species : 
for as all magic consists in a spirit, every magician 
acts by a spirit. 

[ 



PRO AND CON 



Divine magicians that are of God are spoken of in 
the sacred book, and therefore I shall not mention 
the passages here, but pass them over, as I ought to 
do in a book like this, with a profound and reveren- 
tial silence, as well as the other passages, which speak 
of natural and demoniacal magicians ; and in all I 
shall speak of them in this place, I shall only speak 
of them with regard to human reason and experience, 
and conclude this head with saying, that natural 
magicians work all things by the natural spirits of 
the elements ; but that witches and demoniacal 
magicians, as Jannes and Jambres in Egypt were, 
work their magical performances by the spirit of 
demons, and it is by the means of these different 
spirits that these different magicians perform their 
different operations. 

These things thus distinctly settled and explained, 
it is now we must come and ground the dispute, 
between those who believe there are no such things 
as magicians of any kind, and those who assert there 
are of all the kinds above specified. 

Those who contend there are, have recourse to 
experience, and relate many well- witnessed narra- 
tives, to prove that there have been at all times, 
and that there are still, magicians of all these kinds ; 
but those who contend that there are no such per- 
sons, will give no ear to what the others call plain 
experience ; they call the stories, let whatever wit- 
nesses appear to justify them, either fabulous legends 
invented by the authors, or else tricks of intellectual 
legerdemain imposed by the actors upon the relaters 
of those actions. Since, therefore, they say, though 

[ 217 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 

the believers in magic brag of experience never so 
much, it may be but a fallible experience ; they 
reasonably desire to know whether these gentlemen 
that stand for magic can answer the objections which 
they propose, to prove that the practice of magic, 
according to the system laid down, is inconsistent 
with reason, before they will yield their assent. Let 
the stories be never so numerous, appear never so 
credible, these unbelieving gentlemen desire to be 
tried by reason, and aver, till that reason is given, 
they will not be convinced by the number of stories, 
because, though numerous, they are stories still, 
neither will they believe them because they appear 
credible ; because seeming so is not being so, and 
appearances, though never so fair, when they con- 
tradict reason, are not to be swallowed down with 
an implicit faith as so many realities. And thus far, 
no doubt, the gentlemen who are on the unbelieving 
side, are very much in the right on it. The learned 
gentlemen, on the other hand, who are persuaded of 
this mighty mysterious power being lodged in the 
hands of magicians, answer, that they will take upon 
them to refute the most subtle objections brought 
by the learned unbelievers, and to reconcile the 
practicability of magical mysteries, by the capacity 
of men who study that art to right rules and laws of 
reasoning, and to show that some stories, though 
never so prodigious, which are told of magicians, 
demand the belief of wise men on two accounts ; 
because, as experience backs reason on the one hand, 
reason backs experience on the other, and so the issue 
of the whole argument (whether there are magicians 

[ 218 ] 



FIRST OBJECTION 



or not) is thrown upon both experience and reason. 
These arguments on each side I shall draw up fairly, 
pro and con, for I do not pretend to be the inventor 
of them myself, they belong to other authors many 
years ago ; be it enough for me to boast of, if I can 
draw them up in a better and closer form together 
than they have yet appeared in : in that I take upon 
myself a very great task ; I erect myself as it were 
into a kind of a judge ; I will sum up the evidences 
on both sides, and I shall, wherever I see occasion, 
intimate which side of the argument bears the most 
weight with me ; but when I have enforced my 
opinion as far as I think needful, my readers, like a 
jury, are still at liberty to bring in their verdict just 
as they themselves shall see fit ; and this naturally 
leads me where I promised to come to in the fifth 
part of this discourse, to the several objections 
against the power of art magic and refutation of those 
objections. 



The First Objections being against the Existence 
of Spirits, and the Refutations thereof. 

The first objection, which they who reject magic 
make use of, is, denying that there are any such 
things as spirits, about which, since those who de- 
fend the art say it entirely exerciseth itself, the 
objectors contend, that if they can make out that 
there are no such beings as spirits, all pretensions 
to the art must be entirely groundless, and for the 
future exploded. 

To make this part out, that there are no spirits, 
[219] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMrBELL 



the first man they produce on their side is un- 
doubtedly one of very great credit and authority, 
inasmuch as he has justly borne for many centuries 
the title of a prince of philosophers. They say that, 
Aristotle, in his book " De Mundo," reasons thus 
against the existence of spirits, viz., That since God 
can do all things of Himself, He doth not stand in 
need of ministering angels and demons; a multitude 
of servants showing the weakness of a prince. 

The gentlemen who defend the science make this 
reply : they allow the credit and authority of Aris- 
totle as much as the objectors ; but as the objectors 
themselves deny all the authorities for the spirits, 
and desire that reason may be the only ground they 
go upon, so the refuters, on their parts, desire that 
Aristotle's ipse dixit may not be absolutely passed 
upon them for argument, but that his words may be 
brought to the same touchstone of reason, and 
proved if they are standard. If this argument, say 
they, will hold good, Aristotle should not suppose 
intelligences moving the celestial spheres, for God 
sufficeth to move all without ministering spirits; nor 
would there be need of a sun in the world, for God 
can enlighten all things by Himself, and so all 
second causes would be taken away ; therefore there 
are angels and ministering spirits in the world, for 
the majesty of God, not for His want of them, and 
for order, not for His omnipotency. And here, if 
the objectors return and say, Who told you that 
there are spirits ? Is not yours a precarious hypoth- 
esis? may not we have leave to recriminate in this 
place, Pray who told Aristotle that there were in- 

[ 220 ] 



SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCE 



telligences that moved the celestial spheres ? Is not 
this hypothesis as precarious as any man may pretend 
that of spirits to be ? and we believe there are few 
philosophers at present who agree with Aristotle in 
that opinion ; and we dare pronounce this to be 
ours, that Aristotle took his intelligences from 
the Hebrews, who went according to the same whim- 
sical though pretty notion, which first gave rise to 
the fiction of the nine Muses ; but more than all this, 
it is a very great doubt among learned men, whether 
this book " De Mundo," be Aristotle's or no. 

The next thing the objectors bring against the 
existence of spirits, is, that it is nonsense for men to 
say that there are such beings of which it is impos- 
sible for a man to have any notion, and they insist 
upon it that it is impossible for any man to form 
an idea of a spiritual substance. As to this part, the 
defendants rejoin, that they think our late most 
judicious Mr. Locke, in his elaborate and finished 
" Essay on Human Understanding," has fairly made 
out, that men have as clear a notion of a spiritual 
substance as they have of any corporeal substance, 
matter, or body ; and that there is as much reason 
for admitting the existence of the one as of the other ; 
for that if they admit the latter, it is but humour in 
them to deny the former. It is in book the second, 
chapter 29, where he reasons thus : " If a man will ex- 
amine himself, concerning his notion of pure substance 
in general, he will find he has no other idea of it, but 
only a supposition of he knows not what support of 
such quality which are capable of producing simple 
ideas in us, which qualities are commonly called ac- 

[ 221 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



cidents. Thus if we talk or think of any particular 
sort of corporeal substance, as horse, stone, &c, 
though the idea we have of either of them be but 
the complication or collection of those several simple 
ideas, or sensible qualities, which we use to find 
united in the thing called horse or stone ; yet be- 
cause we cannot conceive how they should subsist 
alone, not one in another, we suppose them to exist 
in and be supported by some common subject, which 
support we denote by the name of substance, though 
it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of that 
thing we suppose a support. The same happens 
concerning the operations of our mind, viz., think- 
ing, reasoning, and fearing, &c, which we concluding 
not to subsist of themselves, and not apprehending 
how they can belong to body, we are apt to think 
these the actions of some substance which we call 
spirit. Whereby it is evident, that having no other 
notion of matter, but something wherein those many 
sensible qualities, which affect our senses, do subsist 
by supposing a substance wherein thinking, knowing, 
doubting, and a power of moving, &c, do subsist, 
we have as clear a notion of the nature or substance 
of spirit, as we have of body ; the one being supposed 
to be, without knowing what is the substratum to those 
simple ideas which we have, from without, and the 
other supposed, with a like ignorance of what it is, to 
be the substratum of the operations which we exper- 
iment in ourselves within. "T is plain then, tlmt the 
idea of corporeal substance in matter, is as remote 
from our conceptions and apprehensions as that of 
spiritual substance ; and therefore from our not hav- 

[ 222 J 



LOCKE AND LE CLERC 



ing any notion of the substance of spirit we can no 
more conclude its non-existence, than we can for the 
same reason deny the existence of body ; it being as 
rational to affirm there is no body, because we can- 
not know its essence, as it 's called, or have the idea 
of the substance of matter, as to say, there is no 
spirit, because we know not its essence, or have 
no idea of a spiritual substance." Mr. Locke, also 
comparing our idea of spirit with our idea of body, 
thinks there may seem rather less obscurity in the 
former than the latter. Our idea of body, he takes 
to be an extended solid substance, capable of com- 
municating motion by impulse ; and our idea of soul 
is a substance that thinks, and has a power of ex- 
citing motion in body by will or thought. Now, 
some perhaps will say, they comprehend a thinking 
thing, which perhaps is true ; but, he says, if they 
consider it well, they can no more comprehend an 
extended thing ; and if they say they know not what 
it is thinks in them, they mean they know not what 
the substance is of that thinking thing ; no more, 
says he, do they know what the substance is of that 
solid thing; and if they say, they know not how 
they think, he says, neither do they know how they 
are extended, how the solid parts are united, or 
where to make extension, &c. 

The learned Monsieur Le Clerc, who generally 
knows how far human reason can bear, argues con- 
sonantly to what is before delivered by Mr. Locke, 
in his " Coronis w added to the end of the fourth 
volume of his philosophical works, in the third 
edition of them, where he writes as followeth • 

[ 223 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



" When we contemplate the corporeal nature, we 
can see nothing in it but extension, divisibility, 
solidity, mobility, and various determinations of 
quantity, or figures ; which being so, it were a rash 
thing, and contrary to the laws of right reasoning, 
to affirm other things of bodies ; and consequently 
from mere body, nothing can be deduced by us, 
which is not joined in a necessary connection with 
the said properties. Therefore those, who have 
thought the properties of perceiving by sense, of 
understanding, willing, imagining, remembering, and 
others the like, which have no affinity with corporeal 
things, to have risen from the body, have greatly 
transgressed in the method of right reasoning and 
philosophising, which hath been done by Epicurus, 
and those who have thought as he did, having affirmed 
our minds to be composed of corporeal atoms. But 
whence shall we say they have had their rise? truly, 
they do not owe their rise to matter, which is wholly 
destitute of sense and thought, nor are they spon- 
taneously sprung up from nothing, it being an onto- 
logical maxim of most evident truth, that nothing 
springs from nothing." 

Having thus given the reader the first objections 
made against the existence of spirits, and the refu- 
tations thereof, I must now frankly own on which side 
my opinion leans ; and for my part, it seems manifest 
to me that there are two beings we conceive very 
plainly and distinctly, viz., body and spirit, and 
that it would be as absurd and ridiculous to deny 
the existence of the one, as of the other : and really, 
if the refuters have got the better in their way of 

[ 224 ] 



SPIRITS MAY BE SEEN 



reasoning, they have still a much greater advantage 
over the objectors, when they come to back these 
reasons with fresh arguments drawn from experience. 
Of this, there having been many undoubted narra- 
tives given in the foregoing pages, concerning the 
apparitions of spirits, I shall refer the reader back 
again to them, and only subjoin here one or two 
instances, which may, if required, be proved upon 
oath, of spirits seen by two persons of our Duncan 
Campbell's own acquaintance. In the year 1711, 
one Mrs. Stephens and her daughter were, together 
with Mr. Campbell, at the house of Mr. RamelPs, a 
very great and noted weaver at Haggerstone, where 
the rainy weather detained them till late at night. 
Just after the clock struck twelve, they all of them 
went to the door to see if the rain had ceased, being 
extremely desirous to get home. As soon as ever 
they had opened the door and were all got together, 
there appeared before them a thing all in white ; 
the face seemed of a dismal pallid hue, but the eyes 
thereof fiery and flaming like beacons, and of a 
saucer size. It made its approaches to them, till it 
came up within the space of about three yards of 
them ; there it fixed and stood like a figure agaze, 
for some minutes ; and they all stood likewise stiff* 
like the figure, frozen with fear, motionless, and 
speechless : when all of a sudden it vanished from 
their eyes ; and that apparition to the sight was 
succeeded by a noise, or the appearance of a noise, 
like that which is occasioned by the fighting of 
twenty mastiff dogs. 

Not long after, Mrs. Anne Stephens, who lived in 
15 [ 225 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



Spitalfields, a woman well known by her great dealings 
with mercers upon Ludgate Hill, sitting in her house 
alone, and musing upon business, happened by accident 
to look behind her, and saw a dead corpse, to her 
thinking, lie extended upon the floor just as a dead 
corpse should be, excepting that the foot of one leg 
was fixed on the ground as it is in a bed, when one 
lies with one knee up ; she looked at it a long while, 
and by degrees at last stole her eyes from so unpleas- 
ing and unexpected an object. However, a strange 
kind of a curiosity overcame her fears, and she ven- 
tured a second time to turn her head that way, and 
saw it, as before, fixed for a considerable time longer, 
but durst not stir from her seat ; she again withdrew 
her eyes from the horrible and melancholy spectacle, 
and resumed the courage, after a little reflection, of 
viewing it again, and resolving to ascertain herself 
if the vision was real, by getting up from her seat 
and going to it, but upon this third retrospection 
she found it vanished. This relation she writ down 
to Mr. Duncan Campbell, and has told it before Mrs. 
Ramell, her own sister, and many other very credit- 
able persons. Now as to these arguments from ex- 
perience, I shall also deliver my opinion ; I dispute 
not but that learned men, who have obstinate prepos- 
sessions, may produce plausible arguments, why all 
things should be thought to be done by imposture 
which seem strange to them, and interfere with their 
belief ; and truly thus far their humour may be in- 
dulged, that if only one person relates a very strange 
and surprising story, a man may be more apt to think 
it is possible for that person to lie, than that so strange 

[ 226 ] 



SECOND OBJECTION 



a relation should be true ; but if a considerable num- 
ber of persons of several countries, several religions, 
several professions, several ages, and those persons 
looked upon to be of as great sagacity as any the 
country afford, agree in relations of the same kind, 
though very strange, and are ready to vouch the truth 
of them upon oath after having well considered cir- 
cumstances, I think it a violation of the law of nature 
to reject all these relations as fabulous, merely upon 
a self-presuming conceit, unless a man can fairly 
show the things to be impossible, or can demonstrate 
wherein those persons were imposed on ; for from 
hence I form the following conclusive argument : 
What is possible according to reason grows probable 
according to belief, where the possibility is attested 
to have reduced itself into action by persons of known 
credit and integrity. Now, not only the possibility 
of the existence of spirits, but the actual existence 
thereof, is proved above by logical demonstration ; 
therefore are we to believe both by the course of 
logical reason, and moral faith, that those existences 
have appeared to men of credit, who have attested 
the reality thereof upon oath. 



Second Objection against the Existence of 
W itches. 

These objections go on to say that, provided they 
should allow there is an existence of spirits, yet that 
would be still no argument how magic should subsist, 
because they deny that it is possible for a man in his 
body to have a commerce, much less make a contract 

[ 227 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



with spirits ; but here again the refuters allege they 
have both experience and reason on their sides. As 
a joint argument of reason and experience, they tell 
you that the numerous witches which have in all 
countries been arraigned and condemned upon this 
occasion, are evident testimonies of this commerce 
and contract being held and made with spirits. They 
pretend to say that these objectors call not their, the 
refuters', judgment so much in question, who contend 
that there is a magic art, as they call in question the 
judgment of all the wisest legislative powers in Chris- 
tendom, who have universally agreed in enacting penal 
laws against such capital offenders. 

But here the objectors return and say that it be- 
ing impossible for us to show the manner how such a 
contract should be made, we can never, but without 
reason, believe a thing to be of which we can form 
no perfect idea. The refuters, on the other hand, 
reply with the learned Father le Brune : it's manifest, 
that we can see but two sorts of beings, spirits and 
bodies ; and that since we can reason but according 
to our own ideas, we ought to ascribe to spirits what 
cannot be produced by bodies. Indeed, the author 
of the " Republic of Learning," in the month of 
August, anno 1686, has given us a rough draft for 
writing a good tract of witchcraft, which he looks 
upon as a desideratum, where among other things 
he writes thus : " Since this age is the true time of 
systems, one should be contrived concerning the 
commerce that may be betwixt demons and men." 

On this passage, Father le Brune writes thus : 
" Doubtless here the author complies with the lan- 

[ 228 ] 



SYSTEM IN MAGIC 

guage of a great many persons, who for want of 
attention and light, would have us put all religion 
in systems. Whatever regard I ought to have for 
many of those persons, I must not be afraid to say 
that there is no system to be made of those truths, 
which we ought to learn distinctly by faith, because 
we must advance nothing here but what we receive 
from the oracle. We must make a system to explain 
the effects of the loadstone, the ebbing and flowing 
of the sea, the motion of the planets ; for that the 
cause of these effects is not evidently signified to us, 
and many may be conceived by us ; and to determine 
us, we have need of a great number of observations, 
which by an exact induction, may lead us to a cause 
that may satisfy all the phenomena. It \s not the 
same in the truths of religion, we come not at them 
by groping ; it were to be wished men spoke not of 
them, but after a decisive and infallible authority. 
It's thus we should speak of the power of demons, 
and of the commerce they have with men; it's of 
faith that they have power, and that they attack 
men, and try to seduce them divers ways. It is true 
indeed, they are sometimes permitted to have it 
over the just, though they have it not ordinarily but 
over those that want faith, or fear not to partake of 
their works ; and that to the last particularly, the 
disordered intelligences try to make exactly succeed 
what they wish ; inspiring them to have recourse to 
certain practices by which those seducing spirits 
enter into commerce with men. 11 Thus far Father le 
Brune. But still these objectors demand to know by 
what means this commerce may be held between 

[ 229 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



demons and men, and urge us to describe the man- 
ner ; or pretend that they have still reason to refuse 
coming into the belief of a thing which we would 
impose upon them, though wholly ignorant of it 
ourselves. To that, the refuters answer thus : That 
both Christian divines, and physicians agree (as to 
the manner how, which they are so curious in inquir- 
ing after), that demons stir up raptures and ecstasies 
in men, binding or loosing the exterior senses, and 
that either by stopping the pores of the brain, so 
that the spirits cannot pass forth (as it's done natu- 
rally by sleep), or by recalling the sensitive spirits 
from the outward senses to the inward organs, which 
he there retains. So the devil renders women witches 
ecstatical and magicians, who, while they lie (asi 
asleep in one place, think they have been in divers 
places and done many things. This the learned 
objectors say proceeds from no demon, but from the 
disease called an epilepsy ; but, on the other hand, 
the more learned refuters insist upon it that these 
ecstasies are not epileptic seizures. This, say they, 
appeal's from Bodin, in his " Theatre of Universal 
Nature," where he says that " those that are wrapt 
by the devil feel neither stripes nor cuttings, nor no 
wresting of their limbs, nor burning tortures, nor 
the application of a red-hot iron ; nay, nor is the beat 
of the pulse, nor the motion of the heart perceived 
in them ; but afterwards, returning to themselves, 
they feel most bitter pains of the wounds recei ved, 
and tell of things done at 600 miles distance, and 
affirm themselves to have seen them done." The 
ingenious Dr. Ader makes an admirable physical 

[ 230 J 



NATURAL MAGIC 



distinction between this kind of ecstasy and a syncope 
or stupor caused by narcotic medicines. Sennertus, 
in his " Institutio Medica," writes of the demoniacal 
sopor of witches, who think they are carried through 
the air, dance, feast, and have copulation with the 
devil, and do other things in their sleep, and after- 
wards believe the same things waking. Now he says, 
" Whether they are really so carried in the air, &e., 
or being in a profound sleep, only dream they are so 
carried, and persist in that opinion after they are 
awake, these facts or dreams cannot be natural ; for 
it cannot be that there should be so great an agree- 
ment in dreams, of persons differing in place, tem- 
perament, age, sex, and studies, that in one night, 
and at the same hour, they should, in concert, dream 
of one and the same such meeting, and should agree 
as to the place, number, and quality of the persons 
and the like circumstances. But such dreams are 
suggested from a preternatural cause ; viz., from 
the devil to his confederate, by the divine permission 
of an Almighty power, where punishments are to 
be permitted to be inflicted upon reprobate sinners." 

Whence also, to those witches sincerely converted, 
and refusing to be any more present at those dia- 
bolical meetings, those dreams no longer happen, 
which is a proof that they proceeded not, before, 
from a natural cause. 

Here begins the great point of the dispute as to 
that branch of magic which we call natural magic. 
The objectors may tell us that they will freely own 
that there may be an existence of spirits, that there 
may be an existence of witches, that by a divine 

[ 231 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



power men may be influenced so far as to have a 
communication with good spirits, and that from 
thence they may become spiritual, divine magicians. 
They will likewise, perhaps, as freely grant that, by 
the intervention of a demon, things preternatural 
may be brought about by persons who have studied 
the demoniacal magic, but then what they principally 
insist upon is, that it must be contradictory to all 
human reason to imagine that there can be such a 
thing as natural magicians, and thus far they may 
form their argument. They say that the persons 
who contend for the magic art own that all that is 
brought about by magic is by the assistance and 
help of a spirit, and that consequently what is effected 
by it must be preternatural. Now they say it is a 
thing inconsistent by a natural power to bring about 
a preternatural effect ; therefore there can be no such 
thing as natural magic, which has within itself the 
efficacy of destroying those acts done by magicians 
in the diabolical. 

To this the refuters take leave to reply, that the 
foundation upon which the argument is built is 
wrongly grounded ; they have admitted that, in 
diabolical magic art, there may be a commerce held 
between men and spirits, by which several preter- 
natural effects may be brought about ; and the reason 
they assign for it there is, because there is a preter- 
natural agent concerned therein, the devil ; but then, 
say they, in natural magic you can pretend to no 
such agent, and therefore to no such preternatural 
effect. This argument contains within it two falla- 
cies ; first, as to the commerce held between a man 

[ 232 ] 



PRETERNATURAL MAGIC 



and a demon, there is nothing preternatural in get- 
ting the acquaintance ; the will of the man is entirely 
natural, either naturally good or naturally corrupted. 
The black spirit that converseth with him, it is 
acknowledged is not so, but it is from the will of the 
man, not from the power vested in the devil that the 
acquaintance first grows, therefore the acquaintance 
itself is natural, though it arises from the last corrup- 
tion and depravations of nature ; but being made 
with a preternatural existence, though the cause of 
the acquaintance be corruptedly natural, yet the 
intermediate cause or means after that acquaintance 
is not so, and therefore the effect of that intermediate 
cause may be wonderful, and seem to be out of the 
ordinary course of nature. Now, since it is generally 
allowed that there are natural spirits of the elements 
as well as divine and infernal, what we have to prove 
is only this, that man, by natural magic, may have 
a commerce with natural spirits of their elements, as 
witches may have with the spirits or demons. Now, 
as we said before, the commerce itself depends upon 
the will of the person, and is therefore natural, and 
consequently may as well subsist between the one as 
the other ; for the devil cannot force a man to hold 
a commerce with him whether he will or no. The 
second fallacy is calling the effect preternatural, no 
otherwise than as it connotates the agent that 
brought it about, which is a spiritual agent ; for the 
effect is (in itself considered) natural, and brought 
about by second causes that are natural, by the 
devil's penetration, who is subtle enough to make use 
of them for such and such ends. Now men, by 

[ 233 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



natural spirits, which are of a faculty thoroughly 
subtle, may as well, with natural second causes, 
compass the remedy of an evil spirit as the devil is 
able to infect men with it. From these speculations 
a farther plain consequence may be deduced, how a 
man may, by the pure force of natural magic, cure a 
person that is infested witli evils by a demon ; for 
how is it that a demon infests any body with his evil 
motions ? "Tis true he is a preternatural agent, but 
the evil effect he does is brought about by natural 
causes. For how does a demon stir up raptures or 
ecstasies in men? Why, he does it (as we are told 
above) by binding or loosing the exterior senses, by 
stopping the pores of the brain, so that the spirits 
cannot pass forth ; and this the art of physic can 
compass by its di ngs, and sleep causes the same thing 
very naturally of itself ; therefore as the evil itself is 
natural, the remedy that is natural will certainly 
overcome it. But then, say you, why cannot those 
persons be cured by physicians ? I answer, not be- 
cause their remedies are not in themselves sufficient 
to cure the evils themselves, but because generally 
physicians do not administer their di ngs as Christians 
but as physicians ; and when they prescribe them to 
the sick they generally prescribe to them only purely 
considered as patients, not as Christians, and therein 
they come to fail ; because the agent, the devil, is a 
subtle spirit that brings the evil, and alters its situ- 
ation before the remedy, which would master it 
otherwise, can take any effect; which agent, the 
devil, is employed by the horrible and impious faith 
of the anti-physician, viz., the black magician. But 

[ 234 ] 



MAGIC IN SCRIPTURE 



if the physician would act the Christian at the same 
time, so far as to have a faith that things ordained 
in the course of nature, for the good of man, would 
have its effects in spite of a devil, if taken with a 
good faith by the patient ; that all good things 
ordained to be for the natural recovery of men, if 
they took it with thankfulness to the sender, would 
have due effect ; why then the natural spirits of the 
elements would resist the farther agency of the de- 
moniacal spirit, and then nothing but the natural 
evil (caused at first by the demon) remaining in the 
person without the farther superintendency of the 
demon, might demonstratively be taken away by 
the mere natural remedy or medicine ; and thus good 
and pious physicians, making use of such proper 
remedies as their skill teaches them, and having an 
honest faith that the goods of nature intended for 
the use and benefit of man, if received by the patient 
with the same good faith, is above the power of the 
devil to frustrate, may not improperly be called 
natural magicians. These arguments of mine I shall 
now take leave to back by experience. 

Besides what we have urged from reason, concern- 
ing the power of natural magic, we shall only subjoin, 
that divines themselves hold that natural magic, and 
also natural divinations and prophecies, are proved 
by quotations from that venerable writ which is their 
guide ; and bring proofs from the same also, that by 
natural magic demons are also cast forth, but not all 
kinds of demons, and so many works of efficacy are 
wrought by natural magic. They tell you such was 
the Pythonissa that raised the apparition to Saul, 

[ 235 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



which appeared in a body of wind and air. Thus if a 
person, by natural magic, should cast out demons, it 
does not follow that this was also from divine magic ; 
and if demons are cast out by natural magic by one 
that is in the fear of God, it does not follow that he 
is a true magician of God, but if it exorbitates to 
demoniacal, then it is condemned ; and when natural 
magic keeps within its bounds, the divines tell us it 
is not condemned in the venerable book, which is the 
Christian's sure guide ; but, inasmuch as the lawful- 
ness even of natural magic has been called in question 
by others, I shall, in an Appendix joined to this 
treatise, examine that matter both according to the 
reasons of our English laws, and according to the best 
stated rules of casuistry that I am master of; still 
submitting my judgment to the superior judgment 
of those who are professed divines and lawyers; and 
if my opinions prove erroneous I am willing to retract 
them. And therefore, in this place, there remains 
nothing farther for me to do, but only, as I have 
shown on the one hand, how natural magic and its 
powerful operations are proved by reason ; to show, 
on the other hand, how far reason in these cases is 
likewise backed and supported by well-evidenced 
practice and notorious experience ; and to do this, 
after having mentioned one memorable instance, which 
I refer the reader to in the body of the book, con- 
cerning the performances of Mr. Great rix, to which a 
Lord Orrery was a witness in Ireland ; I shall, to avoid 
prolixity, bring the other testimonials of practice, 
from the success which our Duncan Campbell him- 
self has had in this wav on other occasions. 

[ 236 ] 



THE CASE OF MR. COATES 



In the year 1713, lived in Fenchurch Street one 
Mr. Coates, a tobacco merchant, who had been for 
many years sorely tormented in his body, and had had 
recourse for a cure to all the most eminent physicians 
of the age, even up to the great Dr. Radcliffe himself ; 
but all this mighty application for relief was still in 
vain. Each doctor owned him a wonder and a mystery 
to physic, and left him as much a wonder as they found 
him. Neither could the professors of surgery guess 
at his ailment, or resolve the riddle of his distemper ; 
and after having spent from first to last above a 
thousand pounds in search of proper remedies, they 
found the search ineffectual. The learned all agreed 
that it could proceed from nothing else but witch- 
craft ; they had now, indeed, guessed the source of 
his illness, but it was an illness of such a kind that, 
when they had found it out, they thought themselves 
not the proper persons to prescribe to him any reme- 
dies. That task was reserved, it seems, for our Duncan 
Campbell, who,upon somebody's information or other, 
was sent for to the bewitched patient, Mr. Coates, who 
found him the wonder that the others had left him, 
but did wonders in undertaking and compassing his 
cure. I remember one of the ingredients made use 
of was boiling his own water, but I cannot tell how 
it was used; and, upon turning over the books of 
some great physician since, I have found that they 
themselves have formerly delivered that as one part 
of the prescriptions for the cure of patients in like 
cases. But as there are other things which Mr. 
Campbell performs that seem to require a mixture 
of the second-sight and of this natural magic before 

[ 237 ] 



M R. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



they can be brought about, I will entertain the 
reader with one or two passages of that sort likewise, 
and so conclude the history of this so singular a man's 
life and adventures. 

In the year 1710 a gentlewoman lost about six 
pounds'' worth of Flanders lace, and inasmuch as it 
was a present made to her husband, she was con- 
cerned 'as muc h as if it had been of twenty times the 
value ; and a lady of her acquaintance coming to 
visit her, to whom she unfolded, among other things 
in discourse, this little disaster; the lady, smiling, 
replied with this question, " Did you never hear, 
madam, of Mr. Duncan Campbell ? It is but making 
your application to him, things that are lost are 
immediately found : the power of his knowledge- 
exceeds even the power of laws: they but restrain 
and frighten, and punish robbers, but he makes 
thieves expiate their guilt, by the more virtuous way 
of turning restorers of the goods they have stolen. ' 
" Madam," rejoined the losing gentlewoman, " you 
smile when you tell me this, but really, as much a 
trifle as it is, since 'twas a present to my husband, I 
can't help being sensibly concerned at it ; a moment's 
disappointment to him in the least thing in nature 
creates in me a greater uneasiness than the greatest 
disappointment to my single self could do in things 
of moment and importance."' 1 "What makes mc 
smile, 11 said the lady, " when I speak of it or think 
of it, is the oddness and peculiarity of this man's 
talent in helping one to such tilings; but without 
the least jest, I assure you that I know by experience 
these things come within the compass of his knowl- 

[ 238 J 



AN EAGER CLIENT 



edge ; and I must seriously tell you, for your farther 
satisfaction, that he has helped me and several of 
my friends to the finding again things lost, which 
were of great value."" " And is this, without laugh- 
ing, true ? * said the losing fair, very gravely and 
demurely, like a person half believing, and desirous 
to be fully confirmed in such a belief. The lady 
she advised with did then ascertain her of the truth 
of the matter, alleging that for a single half-guinea 
he would inform her of her things, and describe the 
person that conveyed them away. No sooner was 
this gentlewoman convinced, but she was eager for 
the trial, solicited her friend to conduct her to Mr. 
Campbell ; and upon the first word of consent, she 
was hooded and scarfed immediately, and they 
coached it away in a trice to Mr. Campbell's house, 
whom they luckily found within. 

The ladies had not been long seated before he 
wrote down the name of this new client of his, ex- 
actly as it was, viz., Mrs. Saxon. Then she was in 
good hopes, and with much confidence, propounded 
to him the question about the lace. He paused but 
a very little while upon the matter before he described 
the person that took it, and satisfied her that in two 
or three days she would be mistress of her lace again, 
and find it in some book or corner of her room. 
She presented him a half-guinea, and was very con- 
tentedly going away ; but Mr. Campbell very kindly 
stopped her, and signified to her that if she had no 
more to offer to him, he had something of more im- 
portance to reveal to her. She sat full of expecta- 
tion while he wrote this new matter ; and the paper 

[239] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



he delivered to her contained the following account : 
" As for the loss of a little bit of lace, it is a mere 
trifle ; you have lost a great many hundreds of 
pounds, which your aunt (naming her name) left you, 
but you are bubbled out of that large sum. For 
while you was artfully required downstairs, about 
some pretended business or other, one Mr. H — tt — n 
conveyed your aunt's will out of the desk, and several 
other things of value : " and writing down the names 
of all the persons concerned, which put Mrs. Saxon 
in a great consternation, he concluded this paper 
with bidding her go home with a contented mind ; 
she should find her lace in a few days, and as she 
found that prediction prove true, she should after- 
wards come and consult about the rest. 

When she came home, it seems, big at first with 
the thoughts of what she had been told, she rifled 
and ransacked every corner, but no lace was to be 
met with. All the next day she hunted in the like 
manner, but frightened the whole time, as if she 
thought the devil was the only person could bring 
it, but all to no purpose ; the third day her curiosity 
abated, she gave over the hopes of it, and took the 
prediction as a vain delusion, and that what she gave 
for it was only more money thrown away after what 
had been lost before. That very day, as it commonly 
happens in such cases, when she least dreamt of it, 
she lighted on it by accident and surprise. She ran 
with it in her hand immediately to her husband, and 
now she had recovered it again, told him of the loss 
of it, and the whole story of her having been at Mr. 
Campbell's about it ; and then amplifying the dis- 

f 240 ] 



A WELCOME DISCLOSURE 



course about what he had told her besides, as to more 
considerable affairs, she said she resolved to go and 
consult him a little farther about them, and begged 
her husband to accompany her. He would fain have 
laughed her out of that opinion and intent, but the 
end was she persuaded him into it, and prevailed 
upon him to seem at least very serious about the 
matter, and go with her to the oracle, assuring him 
there was no room for doubting the same success. 

Well, to Mr. Campbell's they accordingly came, 
and after Mr. Saxon, in deference to his wife's desire, 
had paid our predictor a handsome compliment of 
gold, Mr. Duncan Campbell saluted him in as grate- 
ful a manner, with the assurance that there was in 
Kent a little country house with some lands apper- 
taining to it, that was his in right of his wife ; that 
he had the house, as it were, before his eyes, that 
though he had never substantially seen it, nor been 
near the place where it stood, he had seen it figura- 
tively, as if in exact painting and sculpture ; that 
particularly it had four green trees before the door, 
from whence he was positive, that if Mr. Saxon went 
with him in quest of it, he should find it out, and 
know it as well the moment he came near it, as if he 
had been an inhabitant in it all his life. 

Mr. Saxon, though somewhat of an unbeliever, yet 
must naturally wish to find it true, you may be sure ; 
and yet partly doubting the event, and partly pleased 
with the visionary promise of a fortune he never ex- 
pected, laughed very heartily at the oddness of the 
adventure, and said, he would consider whether it 
would not savour too much of Quixotism to be at the 
16 [ 241 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



expense of a journey on such frolics, and on such a 
chimerical foundation of airy hopes, and that then he 
would call again and let Mr. Campbell know his 
mind upon that point. 

In every company he came into, it served for 
laughter and diversion; they all, however, agreed 't was 
worth his while, since the journey would not be very 
expensive, to go it by way of frolic. His wife, one 
morning, saying that she did remember some talk of 
a house, and such things as Mr. Campbell had 
described, put him forward upon the adventure j 
and upon Mr. Saxon's proposing it to his brother 
Barnard, Mr. Barnard favoured the proposal as a 
joke, and agreed upon the country ramble. They 
came on horseback to Mr. Campbell's, with a third 
horse, on which the dumb predictor was mounted, 
and so on they jogged into Kent towards Sevenoaks, 
being the place which he described. The first day 
they set out was on a Saturday morning in June, and 
about five that afternoon they arrived at the Black 
Bull at Sevenoaks in Kent. It being a delicate 
evening, they took an agreeable walk up a fine hill, 
gracefully adorned with woods, to an old seat of the 
Earl of Dorset's. Meeting, by the way, with an old 
servant of the earl's, one Perkin, he offered Mr. 
Barnard, who, it seems, was his old acquaintance, 
to give them all a sight of that fine ancient seat. 

After they had pleased themselves with viewing 
the antique nobility of that stately structure, this 
Perkin went back with them to their inn, the Bull 
at Sevenoaks. Thev that could talk were very 
merrj in chat ; and the dumb gentleman, who saw 

[ 242 j 



SCENTING A JACOBITE 

them laugh, and wear all the signs of alacrity in 
their countenances, was resolved not to be behind 
with their tongues, and by dint of pen, ink, and 
paper, that he made signs should be brought in, was 
resolved (if one might be said to crack without 
noise) to crack his jest as well as the best of them ; 
for it may be truly said of him, that he seldom 
comes into any even diverting company where he is 
not the most diverting man there, and the head, 
though we can't call him the mouth, of the cheerful 
society. After having eyed this Perkin a little, and 
being grown, by his art, as we may suppose, as 
familiar with the man's humour, as if he had known 
him as many years as Mr. Barnard — " Pray, Mr. 
Barnard," quoth he, in writing, " how comes it you, 
that are so staunch and so stiff a Whig, should be so 
acquainted, and so particularly familiar with such 
an old Papist, and so violent a Jacobite as I know 
that Mr. Perkin, whom I never saw nor had any 
notice of in my life, to be?" "And pray," replied 
Mr. Barnard, " what reason have you beyond a pun, 
to take him for a Jacobite? Must he be so because 
his name is Perkin ? I do assure you in this, you 
show yourself but little of a conjurer; if you can 
tell no more of houses than you do of men, we may 
give over our search after the house you spoke of " 
(here the reader must understand they discoursed 
on their fingers, and wrote by turns). Mr. Camp- 
bell replied, seriously, " Laying a wager is no argu- 
ment in other tilings, I own, but in this I know it 
is, because I am sure, after we have laid the wager, 
he will fairly confess it among friends, since it will 

[ 243 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



go no farther, and I," said Mr. Campbell, " will lay 
what wager you will apiece with you all round.'" 
Hereupon Mr. Barnard, who had known him a great 
many years, was the first that laid, and many more, 
to the number of five or six followed his example. 
The decision of the matter was deferred till next 
day at the return of the old man to the inn ; they 
being about to break up that night, and go to bed. 

The next day being Sunday, the landlord carried 
his guests to see the country, and after a handsome 
walk, they came through the churchyard. They were 
poring upon the tombs ; no delight can be greater 
to Mr. Campbell than that ; and really, by the fre- 
quent walks he usually takes in Westminster Abbey, 
and the churchyards adjacent to this metropolis, one 
would imagine he takes delight to stalk along by 
himself on that dumb silent ground, where the char- 
acters of the persons are only to be known as his 
own meaning is, by writings and inscriptions on 
the marble. When they had sufficiently surveyed 
the churchyard, it grew near dinner-time, and they 
went homewards ; but before they had got many 
yards out of the churchyard, Mr. Campbell makes a 
full stop, pointing up to a house; and stopping his 
friends a little, he pulls out of his pocket a pencil 
and paper, and notes down the following : — " That, 
that is the house my vision presented to me, I could 
swear it to be the same, I know it to be the same, 
I am certain of it." 1 The gentlemen with him re- 
marked it, but would not take any further notice 
at that time, intending to inquire into it with 
secrecy, and so went on to the inn to dinner. 

[ 244 ] 



JOCULAR TRAVELLERS 



As merry as they had been the night before after 
supper, they were still more innocently cheerful this 
day after dinner till the time of service begun. 
When the duty of the day was performed and over, 
they returned to divert and unbend their minds with 
pleasant but harmless conversation. I suppose 
nobody but a set of very great formalists will be 
offended with scandal or scruples that, to travellers 
just ready to depart the town, Mr. Perkin came on 
that good day and decided the wagers by owning 
to all the company (secrecy being first enjoined) that 
he was a Roman Catholic, though nobody of the 
family knew it in so many years as he had lived 
there, which was before Mr. Campbell was born. 
This and other innocent speeches afforded as 
much cheerfulness as the Lord's Day would allow of. 

On the next day, being Monday, they sent for one 
Mr. Toland Toler, an attorney of the place, to find 
out to whom that house belonged ; but by all the 
inquiry that could possibly be made with convenient 
secrecy, nobody could find it out for a longtime, but 
at last it came to light, and appeared to be justly to 
a tittle as Mr. Campbell had predicted. 

Being now satisfied, the next day our three travel- 
lers returned for London ; and the two vocal men 
were very jocular upon their adventure, and by their 
outward gesticulations gave the prophetical mute 
his share of diversion. Mr. Barnard, as they passed 
into a farmhouse yard, remarked that all the hogs 
fell a grunting and squeaking more and more ; and 
as Mr. Campbell came nearer (who, poor man ! could 
know nothing of the jest, nor the cause of it, till 

[ 245 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



they alighted and told it him by signs and writing), 
said to Mr. Saxon, laughing, " Now we have found 
out our house, we shall have only Mr. Campbell 
home again by himself, we have no further need of 
the devil that accompanied him to the country 
up to town with us ; there are other devils enow 
to be met with there he knows, and so this, accord- 
ing to the fashion of his predecessor devils, is entered 
into the herd of swine." 

However, the event of this journey, to cut the 
story short, procured Mr. Saxon a great insight, 
upon inquiry, into several affairs belonging to him, 
of which he would otherwise have had no knowledge ; 
and he is now engaged in a Chancery suit to do him- 
self justice, and in a fair way of recovering great 
sums of money, which, without the consultation he 
had had with this dumb gentleman, he had in all 
likelihood never dreamt of. 

In the year 1711 a gentleman, whose name shall be, 
in this place, Amandus, famed for his exquisite talents 
in all arts and sciences, but particularly for his gentle- 
manlike and entertaining manner of conversation, 
whose company was affected by all men of wit, who grew 
his friends, and courted by all ladies of an elegant taste, 
who grew his admirers ; — this accomplished gentle- 
man, I say, came to Mr. Campbell, in order to pro- 
pound a question to him, which was so very intricate, 
and so difficult to answer, that if he did answer it, it 
might administer to himself and the ladies he brought 
with him, the pleasure of admiration in seeing a thing 
so wonderful in itself performed ; or, on the other hand, 
if he did not make a satisfactory reply to it, then it 

[ 246 ] 



A SECRET DISCOVERED 

might afford him and the ladies a very great delight 
in being the first that puzzled a man who had had 
the reputation for so many years of being capable of 
baffling all the wittiest devices and shrewd stratagems 
that had been, from time to time, invented to baffle 
his skill, and explode his penetration in the second- 
sight and the arts which he pretended to. The per- 
sons whom Amandus brought with him were the 
illustrious Lady Delphina, distinguished for her great 
quality, but still more celebrated for her beauty ; his 
own lady, the admired Amabella; and a young, bloom- 
ing, pretty virgin, whom we will call by the name of 
Adeodata, about which last lady the question was to 
be put to Mr. Campbell. Adeodata, it seems, was 
the natural daughter of this very fine gentleman, who 
had never let her into the knowledge of her own birth, 
but had bred her up from her infancy, under a bor- 
rowed name, in the notion that she was a relation's 
daughter, and recommended to his care in her in- 
fancy. Now the man that had the second-sight was 
to be tried. It was now to be put to the proof 
whether he could tell names or no. Amandus was 
so much an unbeliever as to be willing to hazard the 
discovery. Amabella and Delphina were strangers 
to her real name, and asked Duncan Campbell, not 
doubting but he would set down that which she ordi- 
narily went by. Amabella had indeed been told by 
Amandus that Adeodata was the natural daughter 
of a near friend of his ; but who this near friend was 
remained a secret. That was the point which lay 
upon our Duncan Campbell to discover. When the 
question was proposed to him what her name was, he 

[247 ] 



MR. DUNCAN CAMPBELL 



looked at her very steadfastly and shook his head, and 
after some time he wrote down that it would be a very 
difficult name for him to fix upon ; and truly so it 
proved : he toiled for every letter till he sweated ; 
and the ladies laughed incontinently, imagining that 
he was in an agony of shame and confusion at find- 
ing himself posed. He desired Amandus to withdraw 
a little, for that he could not so well take a full and 
proper survey of ladies'* faces when a gentleman was 
by. This disturbance and perplexity of his afforded 
them still more subject of mirth; and that excuse 
was taken as a pretence and a put-off to cover his 
shame the better, and hide from one at least, that he 
was but a downright bungler in what he pretended 
to be so wonderful an artist. However, after two 
hours' hard sweat and labour, and viewing the face 
in different shades and lights (for I must observe to 
the reader that there is a vast deal of difference; 
some he can tell in a minute or two, with ease, some 
not in less than four or five hours, and that with 
great trouble), he undeceived them with regard to 
his capacity. He wrote down that Adeodata's real 
name was Amanda, as being the natural daughter of 
Amandus. Delphina and Amabella were surpri; <ed 
at the discovery ; and Amandus, when he was called 
in, owning it a truth, his wife Amabella applauded 
the curious way of her coming by such a discovery, 
when Adeodata was just marriageable ; took a liking 
to her as if her own daughter; and everything ended 
with profit, mirth, and cheerfulness. 

I could add a thousand more adventures of Mr. 
Campbell's life, but that would prove tedious ; and 

[ 248 ] 



CONCLUSION 



as the town has made a great demand for the book 
it was thought more proper to conclude it here. 
The most diverting of all are to be found best to 
the life in original letters that passed between Mr. 
Campbell and his correspondents, some select ones 
of which will be shortly published in a little pocket 
volume for the further entertainment of such readers 
as shall relish this treatise ; in which the author hopes 
he shall be esteemed to have endeavoured at the in- 
termingling of some curious disquisitions of learning, 
with entertaining passages, and to have ended all the 
merriest passages with a sober, instructive, and edify- 
ing moral, which even to those who are not willing 
to believe the stories, is reckoned sufficient to recom- 
mend even fables themselves.

APPENDIX 



APPENDIX 



IT is not that Mr. Duncan Campbell stands in 
need of my arguments to prove that he is in 
no respect liable to the Acts of Parliament 
made against fortune-tellers, &c, that I under- 
take the writing of this appendix, the true reason 
thereof being the more completely to finish this 
undertaking. For having in the body of the book 
itself fully proved a second-sight, and that the same 
frequently happens to persons, some of them emi- 
nently remarkable for piety and learning, and have 
from thence accounted for the manner of Mr. Camp- 
bell's performing those things he professes, to the 
great surprise, and no less satisfaction of all the 
curious who are pleased to consult him ; and at 
the same time proved the lawfulness of such his per- 
formances from the opinions of some of the most 
learned in holy science ; I thought it not improper 
to add the following short appendix (being a sum- 
mary of several Acts of Parliament made against 
fortune-tellers, conjurers, Egyptians, sorcerers, pre- 
tenders to prophesy, &c, with some proper remarks, 
suited to our present purpose), as well to satisfy 
them who are fantastically wise, and obstinately 
shut their eyes against the most refulgent reason, 
and are wilfully deaf to the most convincing and 

[ 253 ] 



APPENDIX 



persuasive arguments, and thereupon cry out that 
Mr. Campbell is either an impostor and a cheat, or 
at least a person who acts by the assistance of 
unlawful powers; as also to put to silence the no 
less waspish curs, who are always snarling at such, 
whom Providence has distinguished by more excel- 
lent talents than their neighbours. True merit is 
always the mark against which traducers level their 
keenest darts ; and wit and invention oftentimes 
join hands with ignorance and malice to foil those 
who excel. Art has no greater enemy than igno- 
rance, and were there no such thing as vice, virtue 
would not shine with half its lustre. Did Mr. 
Campbell perform those wonderful things he is so 
deservedly famous for, as these cavillers say, by 
holding intelligence with infernal powers, or by any 
unjustifiable means, I am of opinion he would find 
very few in this atheistical age who would open 
their mouths against him, since none love to act 
counter to the interest of that master they industri- 
ously serve. And did he, on the other hand, put 
the cheat upon the world, as they maliciously assert, 
I fancy he woidd then be more generally admired, 
especially in a country where the game is so univer- 
sally, artfully, and no less profitably played, and 
that with applause, since those pretenders to wisdom 
merrily divide the whole species of mankind into 
the two classes of knaves and fools, fixing the appel- 
lation of folly only upon those whom they think not 
wise, that is, wicked enough to have a share with 
them in the profitable guilt. 

Our laws are as well intended by their wise makers 

[ 254 ] 



APPENDIX 



to screen the innocent as to punish the guilty ; and 
where their penalties are remarkably severe, the 
guilt they punish is of a proportionable size. Art, 
which is a man's property when acquired, claims 
a protection from those very laws which false pre- 
tenders thereto are to be tried and punished by, or 
else all science would soon have an end ; for no man 
would dare make use of any talent Providence had 
lent him, and his own industrious application had 
improved, should he be immediately tried and con- 
demned by those statutes which are made to suppress 
villains by every conceited and half-learned pedant. 

'Tis true, indeed, those excellent statutes which 
are made against a sort of people who pretend to 
fortune-telling, and the like, are such as are well 
warranted, as being built upon the best foundation, 
viz., religion and policy ; and were Mr. Campbell 
guilty of any such practice as those are made to 
punish, I openly declare that I should be so far from 
endeavouring to defend his cause that I would be 
one of the first that should aggravate his crime, 
thereby to enforce the speedier execution of those 
laws upon him which are made against such offenders. 
But when he is so far from acting that he doth not 
even pretend to any such practice, or for counte- 
nancing the same in others, as is manifest from the 
many detections he has made of that sort of villainy 
which the book furnishes us with, I think myself 
sufficiently justified for thus pleading in his defence. 

I cannot but take notice, in reading the statutes 
made against such offenders, our wise legislature 
hath not in any part of them seemed so much as 

[ 255 ] 



APPENDIX 

to imply that there are in reality any such wicked 
persons as they are made against, to wit, conjurers, 
but that they are only pretenders to those 
infernal arts, as may reasonably be inferred from 
the nature of the penalties they inflict; for our 
first laws of that sort only inflicted a penalty which 
affected the goods and liberty of the guilty, and 
not their lives, though indeed they were afterwards 
forced to heighten the punishment with a halter ; 
not that they were better convinced, as I humbly 
conceive, but because the criminals were most com- 
monly persons who had no goods to forfeit, and to 
whom their liberty was no otherwise valuable, but 
as it gave them the opportunity of doing mischief. 
Indeed, our law-books do furnish us with many 
instances of persons who have been tried and exe- 
cuted for witchcraft and sorcery, but then the wiser 
pail of mankind have taken the liberty to condemn 
the magistrate at that time of day of too much 
inconsideration, and the juries of an equal share of 
credulity. And those who have suffered for such 
crimes have been commonly persons of the lowest 
rank, whose poverty might occasion a dislike of 
them in their fellow creatures, and their too artless 
defence subject them to their mistaken justice; so 
that upon the whole I take the liberty to conclude, 
and I hope not without good grounds, that those 
laws were made to deter men from an idle pretence 
to mysterious and unjustifiable arts, which, if too 
closely pursued, commonly lead them into the dark- 
est villainy, not only that of deceiving others, but, 
as far as in them lie, making themselves slaves to 

[ 256 ] 



APPENDIX 



the devil ; and not to prevent and hinder men from 
useful inquiries, and from the practice of such arts 
which, though they are in themselves mysterious, 
yet are and may be lawful. 

I would not, however, be thought in contradic- 
tion to my former arguments, to assert that there 
never were, or that there now are, no persons such 
as wizards, sorcerers, &c. ; for by so doing I should 
be as liable to be censured for my incredulity as 
those who defame Mr. Campbell on that account 
are, for their want of reason and common honesty. 
Holy and profane writ, I confess, furnishes us with 
many instances of such persons ; but we must not 
from thence hastily infer, that all those men are 
such, who are spitefully branded with the odious 
guilt ; for were it in the devil's power to make every 
wicked man a wizard, and woman a witch, he soon 
would have agents enough to shake this lower world 
to atoms ; but the Almighty, who restrains him, 
likewise restrains those. 

Having premised thus much, I shall now proceed 
to consider some of the Acts of Parliament them- 
selves, the persons against whom they were made, 
and the necessity of making the same ; and some of 
the first Acts we meet with were those which were 
made against a sort of people called Egyptians ; per- 
sons who, if in reality such, might, if any, be sus- 
pected of practising what we call the black art, the 
same having been for many ages encouraged in their 
country ; nay, so much has it been by them favoured, 
that it was introduced into their superstitious re- 
ligion (if I may, without an absurdity, call it so), 
" [ 257 ] 



APPENDIX 

and made an essential part thereof ; and, I believe, 
Mahometanism has not much mended the matter 
since it has imperiously reigned there, or in any 
respect reformed that idolatrous nation. Now the 
mischief these persons might do (being so much in 
the devil's power), among the unwary, was thought 
too considerable not to be provided against ; and 
therefore our wise legislature, the more effectually to 
prevent the same by striking at the very foundation, 
made an Act in the 22 lien. VIII., 8, that if any, 
calling themselves Egyptians, do come into this 
realm, they shall forfeit all their goods; and being 
demanded, shall depart the realm within fifteen days, 
upon pain of imprisonment ; and the importers of 
them, by another Act, were made liable to heavy 
penalty. This Act was continued by the 1 Phil, and 
Mary ; conjuration, witchcraft, enchantment and 
sorcery, to get money, or consume any person in his 
body, members, or goods, or to provoke any person 
to unlawful love, was by the 33 Hen. VIII., 14, the 
5 Eliz., 16, and the 1 Jac. I., 12, made felony ; and 
by the same 33 Hen. VIII., 14, it was made felony 
to declare to another any false prophecies upon arms, 
&c. ; but this Act was repealed by the 1 Edw. VI., 
12 ; but by another Act of the 3 & 4 Edw. VI., 15, 
it was again enacted, that all such persons who should 
pretend to prophecies, &c, should, upon conviction, 
for the first offence forfeit ten pounds, and one years 
imprisonment; and for the second offence all his 
goods, and imprisonment for life. And by the 
7 Edw. VI., 11, the same was made to continue but 
till the then next session of Parliament. And by 

[ 258 ] 



APPENDIX 



the 5 Eliz., 15, the same Act was again renewed 
against fantastical prophesiers, &c. ; but both those 
Acts were repealed by the 1 Jac. I., 12. 

Thus far we find, that for reasons of state, and for 
the punishment of particular persons, those Acts were 
made and repealed, as occasion required, and not 
kept on foot, or indeed were they ever made use of, 
as I can remember in my reading, against any per- 
sons whose studies led them into a useful inquiry into 
the nature of things, or a lawful search into the 
workings of nature itself, by which means many 
things are foretold long before they come to pass, as 
eclipses, and the like ; which astrologers successfully 
do, whose art has been in all ages held in so great 
esteem, that the first monarchs of the east made it 
their peculiar study, by which means they deservedly 
acquired to themselves the name of Magi, or wise 
men ; but, on the contrary, were provided against 
persons profligate and loose, who, under a pretence 
and mask of science, commit vile and roguish cheats. 
And this will the more plainly appear, if we consider 
the letter and express meaning of the following Acts, 
wherein the persons I am speaking of are described 
by such characters, which sufficiently prove the 
assertion ; for in the 39 of Eliz., 4, it was enacted, 
"That all persons calling themselves scholars, going 
about begging, seafaring men, pretending losses of 
their ships and goods at sea, and going about the 
country begging, or using any subtile craft, feigning 
themselves to have knowledge in physiognomy, palm- 
istry, or any other the like crafty science, or pretend- 
ing that they can tell destinies, fortunes, or such like 

[ 259 ] 



APPENDIX 



fantastical imaginations, shall be taken and deemed 
rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars ; and shall be 
stripped naked from the middle upwards, and 
whipped till his or her body be bloody. 11 And by 
the 1 Jac. I., 12, for the better restraining of the 
said offences, and for the further punishing the same, 
it was further enacted, " That any person or persons 
using witchcraft, sorcery, &c, and all their aiders, 
abettors, and counsellors, being convicted, and at- 
tainted of the same offences, shall suffer pain of death, 
as felons, without the benefit of clergy ; or to tell 
and declare in what place any treasure of gold and 
silver should or might be found in the earth, or other 
secret places ; or where goods or things lost or stolen 
should be found or become ; or to provoke any per- 
son to unlawful love ; such offender to suffer im- 
prisonment for one whole year, without bail or 
mainprize, and once in every quarter of the said 
year, shall in some market town, or upon the market 
day, or at any such time as any fair shall be kept 
there, stand openly in the pillory by the space of six 
hours, and there shall openly confess his or their 
offence ; and for the second offence shall suffer death 
as felons without the benefit of clergy. 1 '' 

That these laws were made against a set of villains, 
whose natural antipathy to honesty and labour fur- 
nished them with pretensions to an uncommon skill, 
thereby the more easily to gull and cheat the super- 
stitiously credulous, and by that means discover from 
them some such secrets that might further them in 
perpetrating the more consummate villainy, is plain, 
from the very words and expressions of the very Acts 

[260] 



APPENDIX 



themselves, and the description of the persons they 
are made against ; and not, as I before observed, to 
prevent and hinder men from the lawful inquiry after 
useful, delightful, and profitable knowledge. 

Mr. Campbell, who has been long a settled and 
reputable inhabitant in many eminent parts of the 
city of London, cannot, I am sure, be looked upon 
as one of those these Acts of Parliament were made 
against, unless we first strip the Acts themselves of 
their own natural, express, and plain meaning, and 
clothe them with that which is more obscure, un- 
natural, forced, and constrained ; a practice which, 
if allowed, would make them wound the innocent 
and clear the guilty, and render them not our de- 
fence, but our greatest evil. They would, by that 
means, become a perfect enigma, and be so far from 
being admired for their plainness, that they would 
be even exploded, like the oracles of the heathen, for 
their double meaning. 

If Mr. Campbell has the second-sight, as is un- 
questionable from the allowed maxim, that what has 
been may be again, and by that means can take a 
view of contingencies and future events ; so long as 
he confines these notices of approaching occurrences 
to a good purpose, and makes use of them only in- 
nocently and charitably to warn persons from doing 
such things that, according to his conceptions, 
would lead them into misfortune, or else in putting 
them upon such arts that may be of use and benefit 
to themselves and posterity, always having a strict 
regard to morality and religion, to which he truly 
adheres : certainly, I think he ought so much the 

[ 261 ] 



APPENDIX 



more to be admired for the same, by how much the 
more this his excellent knowledge is surpassing that 
of other men, and not be therefore unjustly upbraided 
with the injurious character of a cheat, or an ill man. 
However, this I will presume to affirm, and I doubt 
not but to have my opinion confirmed by the learned 
sages of the law, that this his innocent practice, and 
I venture to add honest one too, doth by no means 
entitle him to the penalties of the before-mentioned 
laws made against fortune-tellers, and such sort of 
profligate wretches ; which it is as great an absurdity 
to decry as it would be to call him, who is a settled 
and reputable inhabitant, a stroller, or wandering 
beggar. 

Again, it is true that Mr. Campbell has relieved 
many that have been supposed to have been be- 
witched, as is related and well attested in the book 
of his life ; but will any one from thence argue that 
he himself is a real conjurer or wizard, because he 
breaks the chains by which those unhappy wretches 
were bound ? No, surely, for if that were the case, 
we might then as well indict the physician who drives 
away a malignant distemper, and roots out its latent 
cause by his mysterious skill in plants and drugs ; or 
conclude that the judge who condemns a criminal is, 
for the same reason, guilty of the self-same crime for 
which the offender is so by him condemned. Persons 
who delight in such unnatural conclusions must cer- 
tainly be in love with the greatest absurdities, and must 
entirely abandon their natural reason, before they can 
be brought to conclude that the prince of darkness 
would assist men in destroying his own power. 

[ 262 ] 



APPENDIX 



The best answer I can afford those men is silence ; 
for if they will not argue upon the principles of 
reason, or be guided by her dictates, I think them 
no more fit to be contended with in a rational and 
decent manner than bedlamites, and such who are 
bereft of all understanding. A rod is the best argu- 
ment for the back of a fool, and contempt the best 
usage that ought to be shown to every headstrong 
and ignorant opponent. 

In a word, I know of no branch of Mr. Campbell's 
practice that bears the least resemblance to those 
crimes mentioned in the foregoing Acts. That he 
can and doth tell people's names at first sight, though 
perfect strangers to him, is confessed by all who have 
made the curious inquiry at his hands ; but what 
part of the Acts, I would fain know, is that against ? 
Knowledge, and a clear sight into things not com- 
mon, is not only an allowable, but a commendable 
qualification ; and whether this knowledge in him be 
inherent, accidental, or the result of a long study, 
the case is still the same, since we are assured he 
doth it by no unlawful intelligence, or makes use 
of the same to any ill purpose, and therefore is 
undoubtedly as lawful as to draw natural conclu- 
sions from right premises. Hard is the fate of 
any man to be ignorant, but much harder would 
his lot be, if he were to be punished for being 
wise, and, like Mr. Campbell, excelling others in 
this kind of knowledge. 

Much more might be said in defence of Mr. Camp- 
bell and the art he professeth, but as the arguments 
which are brought against him by his enemies, on 

[ 263 ] 



APPENDIX 



the one hand, are trivial and ill-grounded, I there- 
fore think they deserve no farther refutation ; so, on 
the other, his innocency is too clear to require it. 

After having thus taken a survey of Mr. Camp- 
bell's acts, with regard to their legality according to 
the statutes and the laws of the nation wherein he 
lives, we will consider next, whether, according to 
the stated rules of casuistry among the great divines 
eminent for their authority, it may be lawful for Mr. 
Campbell to predict, or for good Christian persons 
to visit his house, and consult him about his predic- 
tions. I have, upon this head, examined all the 
learnedest casuists I could meet with in ancient 
times ; for I cannot meet, in my reading, with any 
moderns that treat thoroughly upon this case, or I 
should rather have chosen them, because, perhaps, 
the second-sight was less known in those ancient days 
than it has been since, and so might escape their 
notice. 

My design is first to give the reader a distinct sum-

These divines have generally written upon impious 
arts of magic, which they call by the name of divina- 
tion ; and this divination (as they term it) they divide 
into two kinds, the one in which the devil is expressly 
invoked to teach hidden and occult things, the other, 
in which he is tacitly called upon to do the same. An 
express invocation is by word or deed, by which a real 
pact is actually made with the devil ; and that is a 
sin that affects the death of the soul, according to 
the laws of theology, and ought to affect the death 
of the body, according to civil and political laws. 
The tacit invocation of demons is then only, when a 
man busies himself so far with such persons, that it 
is meet and just that the devil should be permitted 
to have to do with him, though it was opposite to 
the intention of the man.

APPENDIX 



But then this express invocation again is subdivided 
into several species, according to the diverse manners 
by which the devil instructs these men. 

The first is enchantment, which I need not describe, 
and of which I will speak no more, because it is what 
everybody knows to be detestable, and nobody ought 
to know the art thereof. 

The second is divination by dreams, when any in- 
structions are expected from the devil by way of 
dream, which is a capital crime. 

The third is called necromancy, which is, when by 
the use of blood and writing, or speaking certain 
verses, the dead seem to rise again, and speak and 
teach future things. For though the devil cannot 
recall a soul departed, yet he can (as some have 
thought) take the shape of the dead corpse, himself 
actuate it by his subtlety, as if it was informed with 
a soul. And some affirm, that by the divine per- 
mission the devil can do this, and spake so in the 
case of Samuel and Saul. But divines of a more 
solid genius attribute that power only to the Deity, 
and say, with reason, that it is beyond the devil's 
capacity. But it is certain this was a divination 
done in dead animals by the use of their blood, and 
therefore the word is derived from the Greek veicpov, 
which signifies dead, and Mavrr/a, which signifies 
divination. 

The fourth species is called divination by the 
Pythians, which was taken from Apollo, the first 
diviner, as Thomas Aquinas says in his "Secunda 
secunda?," qu. 95, artic. 3. 

The fifth is called geomancy, which is when the 

[266 ] 



APPENDIX 



devil teaches anything by certain signs appearing in 
the earthly bodies, as in wood, iron, or polished 
stones, beryls, or glass. 

The sixth is named hydromancy, as when a demon 
teaches anything by appearances in the water. 

The seventh is styled aeromancy ; and it is when 
he informs people of such things by figures in the 
air. 

The eighth is intituled pyromancy ; that is, when 
it instructs people by forms appearing in the fire. 

The ninth is termed aruspicy ; which is, when by 
signs appearing in the bowels of sacrificed animals 
the demon predicts at altars. 

Thus far as to express divination or invocation of 
the devil, which is detestable, and the very consult- 
ing of persons that use such unlawful means, is, ac- 
cording to the judgment of all casuists, the high 
road to eternal damnation. 

Now as to tacit divination or invocation of the 
devil, that is divided into two subaltern kinds. 
The first kind is, when, for the sake of knowing hid- 
den things, they make use of a vain and superstitious 
disposition existing in things to judge from ; which 
disposition is not of a sufficient virtue to lead them 
to any real judgment. The second kind of tacit 
divination is, when that knowledge is sought by the 
disposition of those things, which men effect on 
purpose and of their own accord, in order to come 
by and acquire that knowledge. 

Both these kinds of tacit divination are again sub- 
divided into several species, as are particularly men- 
tioned by St. Thomas, " Secunda secundae," quaest. 

[ 267 ] 



APPENDIX 



95, artic. 3 ; Gregory de Valentine, torn. 3, disput. 
6, quaest. 12, puncto 2; Toletus, in "Summa," lib. 
4, cap. 15, and Michael Medina, lib. 2, " De recta in 
Deum fide : post sanctum Augustinum," lib. 2, " De 
Doct. Christ. cap. 19, et sequen. 

The first of these kinds of tacit divination con- 
tains under it the following several species. 

The first species is called genethliacal, which is 
when, from the movement or situation of the stars, 
men's nativities are calculated and inquired into so 
far, as that from such a search, they pretend to 
deduce the knowledge of human effects, and the con- 
tingent events that are to attend them. This Thomas 
Aquinas and Sixtus Quintus condemn ; but I shall, 
with humility and submission to greater judgments, 
inquire hereafter into their reasons, and give my 
opinion why I think this no evil art ; but I submit my 
opinion, if, after it is given, it is thought erroneous. 

The second is augury, when anything is predicted 
from the chattering of birds, or the voice of ani- 
mals, and this may be either lawful or unlawful. If 
it comes from natural instinct (for brutes, having 
only a sensitive soul, have their organs subject to 
the disposition of the greater bodies in which they 
are contained, and principally of all to the celestial 
bodies) his augury is not amiss. For if when crows 
are remarked to caw (as the vulgar phrase is) more 
than ordinary, it is, judging according to the instinct 
of their nature, if we expect rain, and we may reason- 
ably depend upon it we shall be right if we foretell 
rain to be at hand. But sometimes the devils actuate 
those brute animals to excite vain ideas in men, con- 

[ 268 ] 



APPENDIX 



trary to what the instinct of their nature compels 
them to. This is superstitious and unlawful, and 
forbid in holy writ. 

The third is aruspicy, when, from the flight of 
birds or any other motion of any animals whatsoever, 
persons pretend to have an insight and a penetrative 
knowledge into occult and hidden matters. 

The fourth consists in omens, when, for example, 
a man, from any words which others may have spoken 
on purpose or by accident, pretends to gather a way 
of looking into and knowing anything of futurity. 

The fifth is chiromancy, which consists in making 
a pretence to the knowledge of future things by the 
figures and the lines of the hands : and if it be by con- 
sulting the shoulder-bones of any beast, it goes by 
the name of spatulamancy. 

As the first kind of divination, bv a tacit invoca- 
tion of the devil, is divided into five species above 
mentioned ; so also is the second kind of tacit divina- 
tion, or invocation of the devil, divided into two 
species by St. Thomas of Aquin, " Secunda secundae, 
quaestione nonagesima quinta articulo tertio," and 
too tedious to insert here. 

Now all these ways are by these divines counted 
wicked, and I set them down that people may avoid 
them. For how many gipsies and pretenders to 
chiromancy have we in London and in the country ? 
How many that are for hydromancy, that pretend 
in water to show men mighty mysteries ? And how 
many in geomancy, with their beryls and their 
glasses, that, if they are not under the instigation of 
the devil, propagate the scandal at least by being 

[269] 



APPENDIX 



cheats, and who ought to be punished to the ut- 
most severity, as our English laws enact? Mr. 
Campbell, who hates, contemns, and abhors these 
ways, ought, methinks, to be encouraged by their 
being restrained ; and people of curious tempers, 
who always receive from him moral and good in- 
structions, which make them happy in the conduct 
of life, should be animated in a public manner to 
consult him, in order to divert the curious itch of 
their humours from consulting such wicked impostors 
or diabolical practisers, as too frequently abound in 
this nation, by reason of the inquisitive vulgar, who 
are more numerous in our climate than any I ever 
read of. 

But now to argue the case of conscience with re- 
gard to his particular practice by way of the second- 
sight, whether hi foro conscientice, it is lawful for 
him to follow it, or others to consult him? The 
divines above-mentioned having never had any 
notice of that faculty, in all likelihood, or if they 
had, never mentioning it, makes it a point more 
difficult for me to discuss ; but I think they have 
stated some cases, by the making of which my 
premises, I can deduce from all the learned men I 
have above quoted a conclusion in favour of our Mr. 
Duncan Campbell, and of those who consult him ; 
but my opinion shall be always coiTected by those 
who are wiser than myself, and to whom I owe 
entire submission. I take leave to fix these premises 
from them first, and to form my argument from 
them afterwards in the following manner. 

First, it is allowed by all these divines, that a 

[ 270 ] 



APPENDIX 



knowledge which one may have of future things 
within the order of nature is, and may be lawful. 

Secondly, they imply that where justice is not vio- 
lated, it is lawful both to predict and to consult. 

Thirdly, many of them, but particularly Aureolus, 
put this question : — "Is it lawful to go to one that 
deals in the black art, to persuade them to cure any 
innocent body that another necromancer or dealer in 
the black art may have maliciously afflicted and tor- 
mented with pains ? " And some of these casuists, 
particularly Aureolus, say, it is lawful on such occa- 
sion to go to such a conjurer, because the end is not 
conjuration, but freeing a person from it. 

But I take leave to dissent from these great men, 
and think they are in a double mistake ; first, in stat- 
ing the question, and then in making such an answer, 
provided the question had been stated right. 

The question is founded upon this supposition 
(which is passed by as granted), viz., that one necro- 
mancer could release a person bewitched by another, 
which is absolutely false ; for it is against the nature 
of the devil to be made an instrument to undo his 
own works of impiety. But admitting and not 
granting this to be possible, and the question to be 
rightly stated, why, still these casuists are out in 
their answer. " It is lawful," reply they, " because 
the end of going to the conjurers is not conjuration, 
but freeing a good person from it." But the end is 
not the point here to be considered, it is the medium 
which is bad that is to be considered. It is by con- 
juration (according to their hypothesis) the other 
conjuration is to be dissolved ; and does not the 

[ 271 ] 



APPENDIX 



common rule, that a man must not do evil that good 
may come of it, forbid this practice ? And to speak 
my opinion plainly in that case, the friend that 
should consult a conjurer for that end would be only 
so kind to put his own soul in danger of being guilty 
of hell-torments to relieve his afflicted friend from 
some bodily pains, which "t would be a virtue in him 
to suffer with patience and resignation. 

Others, almost all divines indeed, agree, that it is 
and may be lawful to go to a conjurer that torments 
another, and give him money not to afflict the patient 
any longer; because that ""s only feeing him to desist 
from acting after his conjuring manner. 

These premises thus settled, if we allow the second- 
sight to be inborn and inbred, and natural and 
common to some families, which is proved in the 
book ; and if all that Mr. Campbell has predicted in 
that second-sighted way terminates with moral ad- 
vice, and the profit of the consulter, and without the 
violation of justice to others, as the book shows all 
throughout ; if he can relieve from witchcraft, as it 
seems oath is to be had he can, which no one that 
deals in black art can do, why then I need not draw 
the conclusion ; every reader will do it naturally ; 
they will avow all the stricter laws of casuistry and 
morality to be in favour of Mr. Campbell and his 
con suiters.

A REMARKABLE PASSAGE OF 
AN APPARITION 




A REMARKABLE PASSAGE 

of AN APPARITION 



RELATED BY THE REV. DR. RUDDLE, OF 
LAUNCESTON IN CORNWALL, 
IN THE YEAR 1665 



IN the beginning of this year, a disease happened 
in this town of Launceston, and some of my 
scholars died of it. Among others who fell 
under the malignity then triumphing, was 
John Elliot, the eldest son of Edward Elliot of Tre- 
herse, Esq., a stripling of about sixteen years of age, 
but of more than common parts and ingenuity. At 
his own particular request, I preached at the funeral, 
which happened on the 20th day of June 1665. In 
my discourse (ut mos reique locique postulabat), I 
spoke some words in commendation of the young 
gentleman ; such as might endear his memory to 
those that knew him, and, withal, tended to preserve 
his example to the fry which went to school with 
him, and were to continue there after him. An 
ancient gentleman, who was then in the church, was 
much affected with the discourse, and was often heard 
to repeat, the same evening, an expression I then 
used out of Virgil : — 

" Et puer ipse fuit cantari dignus." 

The reason why this grave gentleman was so con- 
cerned at the character, was a reflection he made 

[ 275 ] 



A REMARKABLE PASSAGE 



upon a son of his own, who being about the same 
age, and, but a few months before, not unworthy of 
the like character I gave of the young Mr. Elliot, 
was now, by a strange accident, quite lost as to his 
parenfs hopes and all expectation of any further 
comfort by him. 

The funeral rites being over, I was no sooner 
come out of the church, but I found myself most 
courteously accosted by this old gentleman ; and 
with an unusual importunity, almost forced against 
my humour to see his house that night ; nor could I 
have rescued myself from his kindness, had not Mr. 
Elliot interposed and pleaded title to me for the 
whole of the day, which, as he said, he would resign 
to no man. Hereupon I got loose for that time, but 
was constrained to leave a promise behind me to wait 
upon him at his own house the Monday following. 
This then seemed to satisfy, but before Monday 
came I had a new message to request me that, if it 
were possible, I would be there on the Sunday. 
The second attempt I resisted, by answering that it 
was against my convenience, and the duty which 
mine own people expected from me. Yet was not 
the gentleman at rest, for he sent me another letter 
on the Sunday, by no means to fail on the Monday, 
and so to order my business as to spend with him 
two or three days at least. I was indeed startled at 
so much eagerness, and so many dunnings for a visit, 
without any business ; and began to suspect that 
there must needs be some design in the bottom of all 
this excess of courtesy. For I had no familiarity, 
scarce common acquaintance with the gentleman or 

[276] 



OF AN APPARITION 



his family ; nor could I imagine whence should arise 
such a flush of friendship on the sudden. 

On the Monday I went, and paid my promised 
devoir, and met with entertainment as free and 
plentiful as the invitation was importunate. There 
also I found a neighbouring minister who pretended 
to call in accidentally, but by the sequel I suppose 
it otherwise. After dinner this brother of the coat 
undertook to show me the gardens, where, as we 
were walking, he gave me the first discovery of what 
was mainly intended in all this treat and compliment. 

First he began to tell the infortunity of the family 
in general, and then gave an instance in the youngest 
son. He related what a hopeful, sprightly lad he 
lately was, and how melancholic and sottish he was 
now grown. Then did he with much passion lament, 
that his ill-humour should so incredibly subdue his 
reason ; for, says he, the poor boy believes himself to 
be haunted with ghosts, and is confident that he meets 
with an evil spirit in a certain field about half a mile 
from this place, as often as he goes that way to school. 

In the midst of our twaddle, the old gentleman and 
his lady (as observing their cue exactly) came up to us. 
Upon their approach, and pointing me to the arbour, 
the parson renews the relation to me ; and they (the 
parents of the youth) confirmed what he said, and 
added many minute circumstances, in a long narra- 
tive of the whole. In fine, they all three desired my 
thoughts and advice in the affair. 

I was not able to collect thoughts enough on the 
sudden to frame a judgment upon what they had said, 
only I answered, that the thing which the youth re- 

[ 277 ] 



A REMARKABLE PASSAGE 



ported to them was strange, yet not incredible, and 
that I knew not then what to think or say of it ; but 
if the lad would be free to me in talk, and trust me 
with his counsels, I had hopes to give them a better 
account of my opinion the next day. 

I had no sooner spoken so much, but I perceived 
myself in the springe their courtship had laid for me ; 
for the old lady was not able to hide her impatience, 
but her son must be called immediately. This I was 
forced to comply with and consent to, so that draw- 
ing off from the company to an orchard near by, she 
went herself and brought him to me, and left him 
with me. 

It was the main drift of all these three to persuade 
me that either the boy was lazy, and glad of any ex- 
cuse to keep from the school, or that he was in love 
with some wench and ashamed to confess it ; or that 
he had a fetch upon his father to get money and new 
clothes, that he might range to London after a brother 
he had there ; and therefore they begged of me to 
discover the root of the matter, and accordingly to 
dissuade, advise, or reprove him, but chiefly, by all 
means, to undeceive him as to the fancy of ghosts 
and spirits. 

I soon entered into a close conference with the 
youth, and at first was very cautious not to displease 
him, but by smooth words to ingratiate myself and 
get within him, for I doubted he would be too dis- 
trustful or too reserved. But we had scarcely passed 
the first situation, and begun to speak to the business, 
before I found that there needed no policy to screw 
myself into his breast ; for he most openly, and with 

[278] 



OF AN APPARITION 



all obliging candour did aver, that he loved his book, 
and desired nothing more than to be bred a scholar ; 
that he had not the least respect for any of woman- 
kind, as his mother gave out ; and that the only 
request he would make to his parents was, that they 
would but believe his constant assertions concerning 
the woman he was disturbed with, in the field called 
the Higher-Broom Quartils. He told me with all 
naked freedom, and a flood of tears, that his friends 
were unkind and unjust to him, neither to believe nor 
pity him ; and that if any man (making a bow to me) 
would but go with him to the place, he might be con- 
vinced that the thing was real, &c. 

By this time he found me apt to compassionate his 
condition, and to be attentive to his relation of it, and 
therefore he went on in this way : — 

"This woman which appears to me," saith he, 
"lived a neighbour here to my father, and died 
about eight years since ; her name, Dorothy Ding- 
ley, of such a stature, such age, and such complexion. 
She never speaks to me, but passeth by hastily, and 
always leaves the footpath to me, and she commonly 
meets me twice or three times in the breadth of the 
field. 

" It was about two months before I took any 
notice of it, and though the shape of the face was in 
my memory, yet I did not recall the name of the 
person, but without more thoughtfulness, I did sup- 
pose it was some woman who lived thereabout, 
and had frequent occasion that way. Nor did I 
imagine anything to the contrary before she began 
to meet me constantly, morning and evening, and 

[ 279 ] 



A REMARKABLE PASSAGE 



always in the same field, and sometimes twice or 
thrice in the breadth of it. 

" The first time I took notice of her was about a 
year since, and when I first began to suspect and 
believe it to be a ghost, I had courage enough not to 
be afraid, but kept it to myself a good while, and 
only wondered very much about it. I did often 
speak to it, but never had a word in answer. Then 
I changed my way, and went to school the Under 
Horse Road, and then she always met me in the 
narrow lane, between the Quarry Park and the Nur- 
sery, which was worse. 

" At length I began to be terrified at it, and 
prayed continually that God would either free me 
from it or let me know the meaning of it. Night 
and day, sleeping and waking, the shape was ever 
running in my mind, and I often did repeat these 
places of Scripture (with that he takes a small Bible 
out of his pocket), Job vii. 14 : 4 Thou scarest me 
with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions.' 
And Deuteronomy xxviii. 67 : 'In the morning, 
thou shalt say, Would God it were even ; and at 
even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning ; 
for the fear of thine heart, wherewith thou shalt 
fear, and for the sight of thine eyes, which thou 
shalt see." 1 " 

I was very much pleased with the lad's ingenuity 
in the application of these pertinent Scriptures to 
his condition, and desired him to proceed. 

" When," says he, " by degrees, I grew very pen- 
sive, inasmuch that it was taken notice of by all our 
family; whereupon, being urged to it, I told my 

[ 280 ] 



OF AN APPARITION 



brother William of it, and he privately acquainted 
my father and mother, and they kept it to them- 
selves for some time. 

" The success of this discovery was only this ; 
they did sometimes laugh at me, sometimes chide 
me, but still commanded me to keep to my school, 
and put such fopperies out of my head. I did ac- 
cordingly go to school often, but always met the 
woman in the way." 

This, and much more to the same purpose, yea, as 
much as held a dialogue of near two hours, was our 
conference in the orchard, which ended with my 
proffer to him, that, without making any privy 
to our intents, I would next morning walk with him 
to the place, about six o'clock. He was even trans- 
ported with joy at the mention of it, and replied — 
u But will you, sure, sir ? Will you, sure, sir ? 
Thank God ! Now I hope I shall be relieved.'" 
From this conclusion we retired into the house. 

The gentleman, his wife, and Mr. Sam were im- 
patient to know the event, insomuch that they came 
out of the parlour into the hall to meet us ; and see- 
ing the lad look cheerfully, the first compliment 
from the old man was, " Come, Mr. Ruddle, you 
have talked with him ; I hope now he will have 
more wit. An idle boy ! an idle boy ! " At these 
words, the lad ran up the stairs to his own chamber, 
without replying, and I soon stopped the curiosity 
of the three expectants by telling them I had prom- 
ised silence, and was resolved to be as good as my 
word ; but when things were riper they might know 
all. At present, I desired them to rest in my faithful 

[ 281 ] 



A REMARKABLE PASSAGE 



promise, that I would do my utmost in their service, 
and for the good of their son. With this they were 
silenced ; I cannot say satisfied. 

The next morning before five o'clock, the lad was 
in my chamber, and very brisk. I arose and went 
with him. The field he led me to I guessed to be 
twenty acres, in an open country, and about three 
furlongs from any house. We went into the field, 
and had not gone above a third part, before the 
spectrum, in the shape of a woman, with all the cir- 
cumstances he had described her to me in the orchard 
the day before (as much as the suddenness of its 
appearance and evanition would permit me to dis- 
cover), met us and passed by. I was a little sur- 
prised at it, and though I had taken up a firm 
resolution to speak to it, yet I had not the power, 
nor indeed durst I look back ; yet I took care not to 
show any fear to my pupil and guide, and therefore 
only telling him that I was satisfied in the truth of 
his complaint, we walked to the end of the field and 
returned, nor did the ghost meet us that time above 
once. I perceived in the young man a kind of bold- 
ness, mixed with astonishment ; the first caused by 
my presence, and the proof he had given of his 
own relation, and the other by the sight of his 
persecutor. 

In short, we went home : I somewhat puzzled, he 
much animated. At our return, the gentlewoman, 
whose inquisitiveness had missed us, watched to 
speak with me. I gave her a convenience, and told 
her that my opinion was that her son's complaint 
was not to be slighted, nor altogether discredited ; 

[ 282 ] 



OF AN APPARITION 



yet, that my judgment in his case was not settled. 
I gave her caution, moreover, that the thing might 
not take wind, lest the whole country should ring 
with what we had yet no assurance of. 

In this juncture of time I had business which 
would admit no delay ; wherefore I went for Laun- 
ceston that evening, but promised to see them again 
next week. Yet I was prevented by an occasion 
which pleaded a sufficient excuse ; for my wife was 
that week brought home from a neighbour's house 
very ill. However, my mind was upon the adven- 
ture. I studied the case, and about three weeks 
after went again, resolving, by the help of God, to 
see the utmost. 

The next morning being the 27th day of July 
1665, I went to the haunted field by myself, and 
walked the breadth of the field without any encounter. 
I returned and took the other walk, and then the 
spectrum appeared to me, much about the same 
place where I saw it before, when the young gentle- 
man was with me. In my thoughts, it moved swifter 
than the time before, and about ten feet distance 
from me on my right hand, insomuch that I had not 
time to speak, as I had determined with myself 
beforehand. 

The evening of this day, the parents, the son, and 
myself, being in the chamber where I lay, I pro- 
pounded to them our going all together to the place 
next morning, and after some asseveration that 
there was no danger in it, we all resolved upon it. 
The morning being come, lest we should alarm the 
family of servants, they went under the pretence of 

[ 283 ] 



A REMARKABLE PASSAGE 



seeing a field of wheat, and I took my horse and 
fetched a compass another way, and so met at the 
stile we had appointed. 

Thence we all four walked leisurely into the 
Quartils, and had passed above half the field be- 
fore the ghost made appearance. It then came over 
the stile just before us, and moved with that swift- 
ness that by the time we had gone six or seven steps 
it passed by. I immediately turned head and ran 
after it, with the young man by my side ; we saw it 
pass over the stile by which we entered, but no 
farther. I stepped upon the hedge at one place, he 
at another, but could discern nothing ; whereas, I 
dare aver, that the swiftest horse in England could 
not have conveyed himself out of sight in that short 
space of time. Two things I observed in this day's 
appearance. 1. That a spaniel dog, who followed 
the company unregarded, did bark and run away, as 
the spectrum passed by ; whence it is easy to con- 
clude that it was not our fear or fancy which made 
the apparition. 2. That the motion of the spectrum 
was not gradation, or by steps, and moving of the 
feet, but a kind of gliding, as children upon the ice, 
or a boat down a swift river, which punctually 
answers the descriptions the ancients gave of their 
Immures, which was Kara pup.ro) a epiov teal oppirju 
aTrt,aiTohi(TOV (Heliodorus). 

But to proceed. This ocular evidence clearly 
convinced, but, withal, strangely frightened the old 
gentleman and his wife, who knew this Dorothy 
Dingley in her lifetime, were at her burial, and now 
plainly saw her features in this present apparition. 

[ 284 ]

I encouraged them as well as I could, but after this 
they went no more. However, I was resolved to 
proceed, and use such lawful means as God hath dis- 
covered, and learned men have successfully practised 
in these irregular cases. 

The next morning being Thursday, I went out 
very early by myself, and walked for about an hour's 
space in meditation and prayer in the field next 
adjoining to the Quartils. Soon after five I stepped 
over the stile into the disturbed field, and had not 
gone above thirty or forty paces before the ghost 
appeared at the farther stile. I spoke to it with a 
loud voice, in some such sentences as the way of these 
dealings directed me ; whereupon it approached, but 
slowly, and when I came near, it moved not. I 
spake again, and it answered, in a voice neither very 
audible nor intelligible. I was not in the least terri- 
fied, and therefore persisted until it spake again, and 
gave me satisfaction. But the work could not be 
finished at this time ; wherefore the same evening, 
an hour after sunset, it met me again near the same 
place, and after a few words on each side, it quietly 
vanished, and neither doth appear since, nor ever 
will more to any man's disturbance. The discourse 
in the morning lasted about a quarter of an 
hour. 

These things are true, and I know them to be so, 
with as much certainty as eyes and ears can give 
me ; and until I can be persuaded that my senses 
do deceive me about their proper object, and by 
that persuasion deprive myself of the strongest in- 
ducement to believe the Christian religion, I must 

[ 285 ] 



A REMARKABLE PASSAGE 



and will assert that these things in this paper are 
true. 

As for the manner of my proceeding, I find no 
reason to be ashamed of it, for I can justify it to 
men of good principles, discretion, and recondite 
learning, though in this case I choose to content my- 
self in the assurance of the thing, rather than be at 
the unprofitable trouble to persuade others to believe 
it ; for I know full well with what difficulty relations 
of so uncommon a nature and practice obtain belief. 
He that tells such a story may expect to be dealt 
withal as a traveller in Poland by the robbers, viz., 
first murdered and then searched, — first condemned 
for a liar, or superstitious, and then, when it is too 
late, have his reasons and proofs examined. This 
incredulity may be attributed — 

1. To the infinite abuses of the people, and im- 
positions upon their faith by the cunning monks and 
friars, &c, in the days of darkness and popery ; for 
they made apparitions as often as they pleased, and 
got both money and credit by quieting the terricula- 
menta vulgi, which their own artifice had raised. 

% To the prevailing of Somatism and the Hob- 
bean principle in these times, which is a revival of 
the doctrine of the Sadducees ; and as it denies the 
nature, so it cannot consist with the apparition of 
spirits; of which, see " Leviathan," p. 1, c. 12. 

S. To the ignorance of men in our age, in this 
peculiar and mysterious part of philosophy and of 
religion, namely, the communication between spirits 
and men. Not one scholar in ten thousand (though 
otherwise of excellent learning) knows anything of it 

[286]

or the way how to manage it. This ignorance breeds 
fear and abhorrence of that which otherwise might 
be of incomparable benefit to mankind. 

But I being a clergyman and young, and a stranger 
in these parts, do apprehend silence and secrecy to 
be my best security.

POSTSCRIPT 

It is possible that the unacquaintedness of some 
men with Church history and the writings of the 
ancient fathers may be one cause of their prejudice 
against things and narratives of this nature. I could 
cite out of them hundreds of passages in confirma- 
tion (a pari) of what I have now done and written. 
But a single testimony shall serve to fill up this 
page. 

St. Cyprian was a father of the third century, 
contemporary with Origen, Tertullian, Lactantius, 
Clemens of Alexandria, and other learned men. 
Observe his words (S. Cypriani Epist. ad Demetrium 
Ethnicum, p. 328) : — 

" Si audire velles et videre quando spiritus mali a 
nobis adjurantur et torquentur spiritualibus flagris ; 
quando daemones ejulantes et gementes humana voce 
venturum judicium confitentur ; videbis nos rogari ab 
iis quos tu rogas, et tamen ab iis quos tu adoras; 
videbis sub manu nostra stare vinctos et tremere 
captivos, quos tu veneraris ut dominos. Certe vel sic 
in erroribus tuis confundi poteris, cum conspexeris et

See Pamelius, " Notes on Tertullian," n. 64. 

1 M If you would hear and see when evil spirits are by us 
adjured and put to spiritual torture ; when the very devils, 
groaning and lamenting with a human voice, confess a future 
judgment ; you shall hear us intreated by those whom you 
intreat, and by those whom you adore : you shall see those 
stand fettered, as it were, under our hands, and tremble like 
captive slaves, whom you worship as deities. Certainly you 
must be thus confounded in your errors when you shall see and 
hear your gods, upon questions we put to them, immediately 
betray what they are."

The FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 
THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



To my anonymous worthy Friend, Physician, and 
Philosopher, whose name, for certain reasons, I 
forbear to mention. 

SIR, — I cannot, without great ingratitude, 
forget the friendly visits, and kind advice, 
I frequently received from you, during not 
only a dangerous but tedious indisposition, 
which surprisingly seized me in the year 1717, and, 
notwithstanding your extraordinary care, as well as 
unquestionable judgment, continued on me till the 
latter end of the year 1725 ; in which long interval 
of time, the attendance you gave, and the trouble 
you gave yourself, abstracted from all interest, made 
you truly sensible of my unhappy condition, and 
myself equally apprehensive of the great obligations 
I shall ever be under to so sincere a friend. 

The first occasion of my illness, as I have good 
reason to imagine, was a very shocking surprise, 
given me by certain persons, who pretended to be 
my friends in a considerable affair then depending, 
wherein their treachery threatened me with succeed- 
ing ruin, had not Providence interposed, and deliv- 
ered the oppressed from the cruel hands of such 
deceitful enemies. Upon whose hard usage, and the 
news of my disappointment, I was struck, at first, 

[ 291 ] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON ; OR, 



with a kind of epilepsy, and deprived of all my senses 
in an instant, dropped down in the public coffee- 
house, under violent agitations, which, it seems, are 
generally concomitant with this miserable distemper; 
but being luckily assisted, and kindly supported by 
some gentlemen present, I happened to escape those 
ill consequences that might, otherwise, have attended 
me, during the extremity of my convulsions, which 
were reported, by those that held me, to be so strong, 
as to be almost insupportable, till the paroxysm 
declined, which terminated in a cold sweat, trembling, 
and weeping, and this was the first attack that ever 
this terrible assailant made upon me ; though after- 
wards he forced himself into a further familiarity 
with me (much against my will). Nor could your 
kind endeavours, by the art of physic, backed with 
my own strength of constitution, fright away this 
evil companion from me, till my good genius, by the 
direction of Providence, communicated a particular 
secret to me, which, with God's blessing, has lately 
proved my deliverance, in what manner, before I 
conclude, I shall very freely acquaint you, in hopes 
you will favour me with your candid opinion in 
answer thereunto. 

Near eight years was a long time to continue under 
the frequent returns, and uncomfortable dread of such 
a shocking affliction, which, upon every little disorder 
of mind, or disappointment in business, never failed 
to visit me ; till, by convulsive, or other involuntary 
motions in my head, and other parts of my body, 
my eyes were buried in their sockets ; my other 
features contracted ; my bowels sometimes racked 

[ 292 ] 



I

with intolerable pains, and all the faculties of my 
mind so greatly weakened and impaired, that I, who, 
for many years before, had been esteemed as an 
oracle by the most polite and curious part of both 
sexes, was now, for want of strength of mind, and 
ability of body to employ my talent, and exercise 
my art, as usual, treated like an old soldier, who had 
lost his limbs in the service of his country, and 
thought only worthy, by way of requital, to be made 
a hobbling pensioner in some starving hospital. 
But, I thank my stars, it proved not quite so bad 
with me, for though some ladies were too hasty and 
importunate to bear with the least disappointment, 
or admit of any delay, without showing their resent- 
ment, or refusing to trust their money till my con- 
vulsions afforded me a rational interval, wherein I 
might be able to give them ample satisfaction ; yet 
others, of a more considerate, easy, and compassionate 
temper, were so highly concerned for my too apparent 
indisposition, that, in order to drive out this tor- 
menting demon that possessed me, they brought me 
all the old recipes they could muster up among their 
crazy aunts and grandmothers, practised upon all 
occasions in their several families, perhaps ever since 
the time of Galen and Hippocrates. But, having 
been long under the care and friendship of so able a 
physician as yourself, though to little or no purpose, 
I could not put faith enough in old women's medi- 
cines to receive benefit thereby ; so, under a kind of 
despondency of everything but Providence, I suffered 
my distemper to take its own course, till my fits in- 
creased upon me to at least twenty in a day, and by 

[ 293 ] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 



their frequent reiterations, brought, at length, such 
a dimness upon my sight, such a weakness in my 
joints, and tremor upon my nerves, that rendered 
me incapable of all manner of business, especially 
that which I had so long professed, and successfully 
performed, to the full satisfaction and great aston- 
ishment of thousands ; but being now unable to 
write, and, for want of speech, having no other way 
of communicating my answers to the demands of the 
ladies and gentlemen that applied themselves to me, 
except by digitation, which they understood not, I 
was forced, sometimes, when much disordered by my 
convulsions, to send them away dissatisfied, which, if 
it were any mortification to them, proved a much 
greater to myself, because, upon my ready perform- 
ances in the mystery I am master of, depends the 
welfare of my whole family. 

Under these unhappy circumstances I laboured 
till the month of October, in the year 1724, confined, 
by my distemper, to my own habitation, not daring 
to go abroad for fear of falling in the streets, having 
been surprised by my fits in St. James's Park, and 
several other places. But, about this time, being 
possessed with a strong inclination to the Cold Bath, 
near Sir John Oldcastle's, and the great desire I 
had to experience the same being highly encouraged 
by your advice and approbation, I summoned all the 
strength I had to my assistance, and. pursuant to 
the dictates of my own restless mind, had recourse 
thither accordingly, attended by a proper person to 
take due care of me, for fear of the worst. 

I had not repeated this cold expedient above 

r 294 1 



THE GKNKKOUS APPARITION 



twice or thrice, but I was sensible of the benefits I 
received thereby, for my distemper began to treat 
me with less severity than usual, and my fits were 
succeeded with a greater defluxion of tears than 
what was common before I applied myself to the 
bath ; so that, after my weeping was over, I found 
myself much refreshed, and all my faculties abund- 
antly more alert, than at any time they had been 
since my first illness, insomuch, that, from a timely 
continuance of this external application, I entertained 
great hopes of a perfect recovery ; but, notwithstand- 
ing my diligent prosecution of this sharp and shiver- 
ing method, I was, to my great sorrow, unhappily 
disappointed ; for my convulsions were as frequent, 
though not so violent, as formerly, and I was now 
again divested of all hopes of relief, except by the 
hand of Providence, having nothing to trust to, but 
that infallible Physician who can cure all things in 
an instant. 

The despondency I was now under of any assist- 
ance from human art, and the slender opinion you 
seemed to entertain of my recovery, made my inter- 
vals as melancholy as my fits were troublesome. 
Oppressed with these hard circumstances, I supported 
a burthensome life, and dragged on the tedious hours 
till the latter end of the year 1725, about which 
time, as I was slumbering one morning in my 
bed, after a restless night, my good genius, or 
guardian angel, clothed in a white surplice, like a 
singing boy, appeared before me, holding a scroll, 
or label, in his right hand, whereon the following 
words were wrote in large capitals : — 

[ 295 ] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 



READ, BELIEVE, AND PRACTISE; THE LOAD- 
STONE SHALL BE YOUR CURE, WITH AN ADDI- 
TION OF THE POWDER HERE PRESCRIBED YOU; 
BUT KEEP THE LAST AS A SECRET, FOR WITH 
THAT AND THE MAGNET YOU SHALL RELIEVE 
NUMBERS IN DISTRESS, AND LIVE TO DO 
GREATER WONDERS THAN YOU HAVE HITHER- 
TO PERFORMED; THEREFORE BE OF GOOD 
CHEER, FOR YOU HAVE A FRIEND UNKNOWN, 
WHO, IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE, WILL NEVER 
FAIL YOU. 

This comfortable news, though delivered to me 
after so surprising a manner, yet was it very wel- 
come to a languishing person, under a complication 
of misfortunes. Notwithstanding, I had a great 
struggle with my natural reason, before I could con- 
vince myself of what I was yet confident my very 
eyes had seen, or, at least, had been represented to 
me after an extraordinary manner, for betwixt 
really seeing a vision, or verily believing we do see 
it, there is but a slender difference. However, the 
entire confidence I had put in Providence, and the 
great desire I had to be relieved, were to me con- 
vincing arguments, beyond all objection, that my 
guardian angel had actually appeared, and communi- 
cated to my eyes the very scroll that I had read, the 
words of which, lest my memory should have proved 
treacherous, I entered in my pocket-book, as they are 
before recited, the recipe only excepted. 

Having thus subjected my reason to my senses, or, 
at least, my faith (for I either saw, or believed I saw, 
what I have here reported), I had nothing else to do, 
but to put in practice the recipe which my good 
genius had imparted to me, though how to come at 

[ 296 ] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



a loadstone, seemed to me as difficult as to find out 
the Philosopher's Stone, having but a slender knowl- 
edge of the thing itself, and much less of its virtues. 
However, upon inquiry, I soon found out a certain 
virtuoso, near Moorfields, who is an eminent dealer 
in such sort of curiosities, and, by his assistance, I 
presently furnished myself with what I wanted, and 
sending for some fat amber, and a certain prepara- 
tion of steel, which I privately dispensed in a very 
particular manner, according to the recipe com- 
municated by my genius ; then applying both as 
directed, was miraculously delivered, in a great meas- 
ure, from those racking convulsions which had so 
long afflicted me, and, in less than a month's time, 
my whole microcosm was restored to such a happy 
state of health, strength, and vivacity, that, heaven 
be praised, I could do anything as usual. But, if I 
leave off my loadstone for two or three days, which 
I have sometimes done, merely out of curiosity, my 
fits, as yet, will remind me of my foolish presump- 
tion, and force me to have recourse to my wonderful 
preservative, which has not only proved so great a 
friend to myself, but has relieved others in the like 
distress, and, as I have found by three or four late 
experiments, is as effectual in suppressing vapours, 
and removing or preventing hysteric fits in women, 
as it is in epilepsies and convulsions in our own sex, 
either men or children. 

Now, doctor, since I have happily conquered so 
stubborn an enemy, by such miraculous means as do 
not fail to assist others as well as myself, I desire 
you will vouchsafe me your real sentiments of this 

[297] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 



uncommon way of cure, your notions of the genii, 
and the wonderful manner of communicating the 
recipe ; your thoughts of the loadstone and the virtues 
thereof; your opinion of sympathy, and the cures 
performed thereby, for I know you are a philosopher 
sufficient, as well as physician, to give a very good 
light into all these mysteries, in which I own I am 
to seek ; therefore hope you will condescend so far 
as to spend a leisure hour upon the foregoing partic- 
ulars, and you will infinitely oblige, sir, your assured 
friend, and humble servant, 

Duncan Campbell. 

To my deaf and dumb Friend, Mr. Duncan Campbell, 
in answer to his letter to an anonymous worthy 
Friend, Physician, and Philosopher, 

Sib, — I received your letter, and read the same 
with no less surprise than satisfaction ; for, as I am 
greatly pleased at your miraculous recovery, so I 
am equally astonished at the wonderful means 
by which it was obtained. I confess, I have been 
too great a student in physic and natural philosophy, 
to entertain any extraordinary opinion of miracles, 
no ways accountable to human reason, except those 
that concern religion, which are brought down to 
our knowledge well attested, and recommended to our 
faith by unexceptionable authorities ; not but that 
I am ready to admit, that the power of healing is 
in the hand of Providence, and that some patients, 
when their distempers, through the frailty of human 
judgment, derive their essence from so obscure an 

[298] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



original that even puzzles the physician — then, I 
\-iv, I am so free to acknowledge, when the blessing 
of God accompanies the administration, that the 
most trifling application in the eyes of art, may 
recover such persons from the most dangerous in- 
firmities. This I look upon to be your extraordinary 
case, and therefore think not the means to which 
you ascribe your cure, or the manner of the recipe's 
being communicated to you, a proper subject for a 
physical inquiry, unless you had sent me the pre- 
scription of your genius, which I understand by your 
letter you are obliged to conceal, and then, perhaps, 
I should have been able to have judged, in some 
measure, which of the applications are most essential, 
the powder or the loadstone, also, how far your guar- 
dian angel is a regular proficient in the modern 
practice of physic. 

However, as you desire my opinion of the genii, 
the loadstone, the powder of sympathy, and the like, 
I shall not be only willing to give you my own 
thoughts, but the sentiments of others, before I take 
my leave, who have made the foregoing particulars 
their principal studies, and are therefore better 
acquainted with the nature of spirits, than I pretend 
to be. 

As for the genii or familiar spirits, good and bad, 
believed and reported, by the most wise and learned 
of the ancients, to attend mankind, and the various 
operations they have had upon human minds as well 
as bodies, I cannot but confess, seem very wonderful 
to my defective understanding ; yet, when we observe 
what innumerable instances have been handed to us 

[299] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 



by the most reputable authors, both ancient and 
modern, attested from time to time by unquestionable 
authorities, who, that, before he dived into these 
mysteries, looked upon the same to be whimsy, can 
forbear staggering in his opinion ? 

The most celebrated instance of a genius among 
the ancients, is that of Socrates, one of the wisest of 
the philosophers in the age he lived in ; and that he 
had such a familiar spirit to attend him, which the 
Greeks called Daemon, and the Latins, Genius, is 
sufficiently testified by three of his cotemporaries, 
viz., Plato, Xenophon, and Antisthenes ; also further 
confirmed by Laertius, Plutarch, Maximus Tyrius, 
Dion Chrysostomus, Cicero, Apuleius, and Facinas; 
besides others more modern, as Tertullian, Origen, 
Clemens Alexandrinus, &c. But that which is of 
greater authority than all the vouchers aforemen- 
tioned, is what Socrates says of himself in Plato's 
Theage, viz., " By some divine lot, I have a certain 
demon, which has followed me from my childhood, 
as an oracle ; and this voice," says he, for so he terms 
it, "whenever it speaks to me, dissuades me from 
engaging in what I am about to put in action, but 
never prompts me to attempt any thing. " This, I 
presume, might be the chief reason why Socrates pur- 
sued not his own inclinations, which were naturally 
vicious, as himself confessed to the physiognomist, 
but was always accompanied with a divine spirit that 
restrained him from it ; for, in speaking to Alcibiades, 
a vicious nobleman of Athens, but reclaimed by Soc- 
rates, says he, " My tutor " (meaning the spirit that 
attended him) " is wiser and better than you. 1 ' And 

[ 300 ] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



to show further, that what he called his demon was 
something more than a secret impulse of the mind, 
or dictates of a good conscience, Theocritus affirms 
in Plutarch, that a vision attended Socrates from his 
childhood, going before him, and guiding him in all 
the actions of his life, being a constant light to him 
in such affairs as lay not within the reach of human 
understanding, and that the spirit often spoke to him, 
divinely governing and inspiring his intentions. A 
thousand instances of the like nature I could collect 
from the ancients, to prove that what you have re- 
ported to me, in your letter, may be no delusion, but 
real fact, with all its surprising circumstances, could 
the task be comprised within the compass of a letter; 
but, a treatise of this nature being much fitter for a 
volume, I shall only proceed to a few familiar in- 
stances of a more modern date, that vour wonderful 
cure may gain credit with the public, because I know 
your sincerity. 

Froissart reports, that in the time of Edward III. 
there was a certain knight in France, called Corasse, 
who could tell everything transacted throughout the 
whole world, in a day or two at the most, were the 
distance never so remote ; and this he did by an in- 
visible intelligencer or familiar spirit, which he called 
Orthone, who was always at his command, and brought 
him news continually for many years, till at last he 
lost the benefit of so useful a companion, through a 
vain desire of gratifying his curiosity after the follow- 
ing manner, viz. : the knight, having hitherto only 
heard the voice of his spiritual emissary, was now 
infatuated with an earnest inclination to behold his 

[ 301 ] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR. 

shape, which favour he requested of Orthone ; accord- 
ingly, whose answer was, that the first thing he should 
see on the morrow morning, after he was risen from 
his bed, should be the object he desired, or words to 
that effect. The knight, the next morning, pursuant 
to the direction of the spirit, arose from his bed, 
looked about him, but could not discover anything 
worthy of remark ; upon which disappointment, he 
upbraided Orthone with being worse than his word ; 
who replied, he had kept his promise, desiring the 
knight to remind himself of what he had first ob- 
served after his rising. The knight, upon recol- 
lection, replied, that he saw nothing uncommon, but 
a couple of straws tumbling upon the ground, and 
sporting one with another, as if agitated by the wind. 
"That was I," saith the spirit, "and therefore I kept 
my word." Then the knight desired to see him once 
more, in such a shape as might induce him, the next 
time, to take more notice of him, to which the spirit 
consented, saying, "The first thing you see on the 
morrow morning, after your uprising, shall be me 
again.'" Accordingly, when the time appointed was 
come, and the knight risen from his bed, looking out 
of his chamber-window, the first object he espied, was 
a lean, ill-favoured sow, so deformed and ugly, that 
he was not able to abide the sight of her ; and not 
expecting Orthone to appear to him in so homely a 
manner, he set his dogs upon the sow to drive her 
away, who being highly affronted at such an un- 
friendly usage, immediately vanished, to the knight's 
great surprise ; and his old acquaintance Orthone 
never came near him after. This relation Froissart 

[ 302 ] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



asserts he had from the knight's own mouth, with 
whom he was very intimate. 

From hence I conclude, that the same sort of spirit 
that attended Corasse, has been always a friend to 
you, not only of late, in your miraculous recovery, 
but has at all times assisted you in writing the name 
of strangers, discovering the most secret intrigues, 
and foretelling future events, for which you have 
been famous. As for a further proof of the existence 
of spirits, and that, at some other times, as well as in 
your case, they have prescribed physic to their living 
friends, I shall quote an instance out of Mr. GlanviFs 
Reports, attested by the Lord Orrery, the famous Mr. 
Greatrix, and many others, living in the reign of 
King Charles the Second. 

A gentleman in Ireland, near to the Earl of 
Orrery's house, sending his butler one afternoon to a 
neighbouring village to buy cards, as he passed a 
field, espied a company in the middle thereof, sitting 
round a table, with several dishes of good cheer 
before them, and moving towards them, they all rose 
and saluted him, desiring him to sit down and take 
part with them. But one of them whispered these 
words in his ear, viz., " Do nothing this company 
invites you to ; " whereupon, he refusing to accept 
of their kindness, the table, and all the dainties it 
was furnished with, immediately vanished, but the 
company fell to dancing and playing upon divers 
musical instruments. The butler was a second time 
solicited to partake of their diversions, but would not 
be prevailed upon to engage himself with them ; upon 
which, they left off their merrymaking and fell to 

[303] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 



work, still pressing the butler to make one among 
them, but to no purpose ; so that, upon his third 
refusal, they all vanished and left the butler alone, 
who, in a great consternation, returned home without 
the cards, fell into a fit as he entered the house, but 
soon recovering his senses, related to his master all 
that had passed. 

The following night, one of the ghostly company 
came to his bedside, and told him, that if he offered 
to stir out the next day, he would be carried away ; 
upon whose advice, he kept within till towards the 
evening, and having occasion to make water, ventured 
to set one foot over the threshold of the door, in 
order to ease himself, which he had no sooner done, 
but a rope was cast about his middle, in the sight of 
several standers-by, and the poor man was hurried 
from the porch with unaccountable swiftness, followed 
by many persons ; but they were not nimble enough 
to overtake him, till a horseman, well mounted, hap- 
pening to meet him upon the road, and seeing many 
followers in pursuit of a man hurried along in a rope, 
without anybody to force him, catched hold of the 
cord and stopped him in his career, but received, 
for his pains, such a strap upon his back with one 
end of the rope, as almost felled him from his horse. 
However, being a good Christian, he was too strong 
for the devil, and recovered the butler out of the 
spirits"' clutches, and brought him back to his 
friends. 

The Lord Orrery, hearing of these strange passages, 
for his further satisfaction of the truth thereof, sent 
for the butler, with leave of his master, to come and 

[304] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



continue some days and nights at his house, which, 
in obedience to his lordship, the servant did accord- 
ingly ; who, after his first night's bedding there, 
reported to the earl in the morning, that his spectre 
had again been with him, and assured him, that on 
that very day he should be spirited away, in spite of 
all the measures that could possibly be taken to 
prevent it. Upon which he was conducted into a 
large room, with a considerable number of holy per- 
sons to defend him from the assaults of Satan ; 
among whom was the famous stroker of bewitched 
persons, Mr. Greatrix, who lived in the neighbour- 
hood, and knew, as may be presumed, how to deal 
with the devil as well as anybody ; besides several 
eminent quality were present in the house, among 
the rest, two bishops, all waiting the wonderful 
event of this unaccountable prodigy. 

Till part of the afternoon was spent, the time slid 
away in nothing but peace and quietness, but, at 
length, the enchanted patient was perceived to rise 
from the floor without any visible assistance, where- 
upon Mr. Greatrix, and another lusty man, clapt 
their arms over his shoulders, and endeavoured to 
weigh him down with their utmost strength, but to 
no purpose, for the devil proved too powerful, and, 
after a hard struggle on both sides, made them quit 
their hold, and snatching the butler from them, 
carried him over their heads and tossed him in the 
air, to and fro, like a dog in a blanket, several of the 
company running under the poor wretch to save him 
from the ground ; by which means, when the spirits' 
frolic was over, they could not find that in all this 
*> [ 305 ] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 



hurry-scurry, the frighted butler had received the 
least damage, but was left in statu quo, upon the 
same premises, to prove the devil a liar. 

The goblins, for this bout, having given over their 
pastime, and left their May-game to take a little 
repose, that he might in some measure be refreshed 
against their next sally, my lord ordered, the same 
night, two of his servants to lie with him, for fear 
some devil or other should come and catch him nap- 
ping ; notwithstanding which, the butler told his 
lordship the next morning, that the spirit had again 
been with him in the likeness of a quack doctor, 
and held in his right hand a wooden dish full of grey 
liquor, like a mess of porridge, at the sight of which 
he endeavoured to awake his bedfellows ; but the 
spectre told him, his attempts were fruitless, for that 
his companions were enchanted into a deep sleep, 
advising him not to be frighted, for he came as a 
friend, and was the same spirit that cautioned him 
in the field against complying with the company he 
there met, when he was going for the cards ; adding, 
that if he had not refused to come into their meas- 
ures, he had been for ever miserable ; also wondered 
he had escaped the day before, because he knew there 
was so powerful a combination against him; that for 
the future there would be no more attempts of the 
like nature ; further telling the poor trembling but- 
ler, that he knew he was sadly troubled with two 
sorts of fits, and, therefore, as a friend, he had 
brought him a medicine that would cure him of both, 
beseeching him to take it. But the poor patient, 
who had been scurvily used by these sort of doctors, 

[306] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



and fearing the devil might be at the bottom of the 
cup, would not be prevailed upon to swallow the 
dose, which made the spirit angry ; who told him, 
however, he had a kindness for him, and that if he 
would bruise the roots of plantain without the leaves, 
and drink the juice thereof, it should certainly cure 
him of one sort of his fits, but as a punishment for 
his obstinacy in refusing the liquor, he should carry 
the other with him to his grave. Then the spiritual 
doctor asked his patient if he knew him ; the butler 
answered no. " I am," says he, " the wandering 
ghost of your old acquaintance John Hobby, who 
has been dead and buried these seven years ; and ever 
since, for the wickedness of my life, have been lifted 
into the company of those evil spirits you beheld 
in the fields, am hurried up and down in this rest- 
less condition, and doomed to continue in the same 
wretched state till the day of judgment adding, 
that " had you served your Creator in the days of 
your youth, and offered up your prayers that morning 
before you were sent for the cards, you had not been 
treated by the spirits that tormented you, with so 
much rigour and severity.*" 

After the butler had reported these marvellous 
passages to my lord and his family, the two bishops, 
that were present, among other quality, were there- 
upon consulted, whether or no it was proper for the 
butler to follow the spirit's advice, in taking the 
plantain juice for the cure of his fits, and whether 
he had done well or ill, in refusing the liquid dose 
which the spectre would have given him. The 
question, at first, seemed to be a kind of moot point, 

[ 307 ] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 



but, after some struggle in the debate, their resolu- 
tion was, that the butler had acted, through the 
whole affair, like a good Christian, for that it was 
highly sinful to follow the devil's advice in anything, 
and that no man should do evil that good might 
come of it ; so that, in short, the poor butler, after 
his fatigue, had no amends for his trouble, but was 
denied, by the bishops, the seeming benefit that the 
spirit intended him. 

I do not introduce this old surprising story to 
amuse you, but to let you know, that it is no new 
thing for spectres to turn doctors to ailing persons as 
they retain a respect for, and that your genius was 
not the first spirit that ever practised physic. There- 
fore, if this narrative, reported by Glanvil, Beaumont, 
and others, may obtain credit, upon the authorities 
of my Lord Orrery, Mr. Greatrix, and divers persons, 
who were in a great measure eye-witnesses of the 
matter, I see no reason I have to doubt the truth of 
your letter, since I know your integrity ; besides, it 
has always been allowed by such demonologers as 
have published their thoughts upon the visibility of 
spirits, that Scotland is never without such a sort 
of people as they call second-sighted, who have not 
only the power of discerning apparitions, but, by 
their frequent conversation with spirits, foretell future 
events, to the great astonishment of all persons that 
consult them. That there are such a sort of diviners 
in the world, especially in Scotland, I am thoroughly 
convinced ; of which number I take yourself to be 
one. But how to account for your mysterious per- 
formances, I readily confess I know not, and therefore 

[ 308 ] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



shall submit that task to such as are qualified with a 
more subtle penetration. 

I doubt I have tired your patience with too much 
prolixity upon familiar spirits, therefore, to make you 
amends, I will be but short in my dissertation upon 
the loadstone, which, in the first place, is a very 
ponderous fossil, found in different climates, and 
seems in its nature and qualities to be nearly related 
to iron ore, from whence it is endowed with a peculiar 
property of drawing to itself by the power of sym- 
pathy, or the natural disposition it has to embrace 
that particular metal. In Egypt there are large 
mines of it ; some few magnets have been found in 
^Ethiopia, which have attracted iron very forcibly. 
But two sorts are dug up at the foot of the Sardinian 
mountains, of such different natures, that as one 
draws iron, the other will repel it; as you will find it 
reported by Johannes Jons tonus, in his " History of 
Nature ; " also by Pliny, in his Second Book, who, 
for the aforesaid reason, calls this stone Theamedes. 
As to the singular virtues hitherto discovered in the 
common loadstone, the most admirable of all are the 
strict correspondence it maintains with the two 
poles, and the wonderful property it communicates 
by a touch to the needle, for the benefit of mariners. 
The power of its attraction is thought by some vir- 
tuosos to be owing to a clammy bituminous substance, 
by which the contexture of the more solid parts are 
closely cemented and confirmed ; to prove this, work 
a loadstone in the fire and it shall cast forth a bluish 
flame, like that of lighted brimstone, and so continue 
till it spends its life, and loses the power of attrac- 

[309] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 



tion. There is a great deal of sulphur in iron as well 
as in the loadstone, which is the principal cause of 
their sympathising with each other, and if you destroy 
the first in either, the last will fail in course, which 
is the reason why the loadstone will not attract the 
rust of iron, though it will the filings, because in the 
former the bituminous matter is quite spent, and 
nothing left but a kind of caput mortuum. The 
loadstone hath also two poles, which answer those in 
the heavens ; if you touch the needle with the north 
pole of the stone, it will point to the Arctic, if with 
the south part thereof, as it stood posited in the 
mine, it will point to the Antarctic, but not with the 
utmost exactness, except it stands in the meridian. 
But to be further satisfied in these mysteries, have 
recourse to Libavius, Cardanus, Pliny, Bodin, Porta, 
our own " Philosophical Transactions," and such 
authors as have treated more largely upon this sub- 
ject, for, I suppose, all that you want to know of me 
is, if ever I have heard from others, or discovered by 
my own experience, any such physical virtue in the 
loadstone, as may tend to the cure of any chronical 
or other disease incident to human bodies, that may 
strengthen the opinion you seem to entertain of it 
in such cases, from the benefit yourself has lately 
received in so extraordinary a manner. 

In answer to this, I confess, I have heard affirmed 
(but not by a physician), that the loadstone hath 
withdrawn the inflammation, and given ease in the 
gout, and by changing the application of it from one 
side to the other, has at length chased it away, to 
the perfect recovery of the patient ; but in any other 

[ 310 ] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



case, excepting jour own, I never heard of a cure so 
much as facilitated or attempted to be performed 
thereby ; therefore, as the use of it in any disease is 
quite foreign to the common practice of physic, if 
others, as well as yourself, have received benefit by 
this new discovery, I think not myself obliged to 
account for it, till it becomes practical among my 
own fraternity, and then it will be time enough 
for any physician to give his thoughts thereon. 
Besides, I am a stranger to the preparation pre- 
scribed to you by your genius, and without the 
knowledge of that material secret, it is impossible 
for any physician, in your case, to make a clear 
judgment, or to know which of the two your cure 
is chiefly owing to, the powder or the loadstone ; 
for how far the latter may operate upon a body pre- 
pared by pulvis martis or other chalybeates, I shall 
not pretend to determine, though, for aught I know, 
wonderful cures may be performed in that way ; but 
upon what reason in nature such a new system can 
be founded, seems very remote from my present 
understanding. But, since you are become sole master 
of so wonderful a secret, my advice is, that you keep 
the recipe to yourself, in obedience to your genius, 
and though you assist others, never do it without 
fee or reward, for all useful discoveries ought to be 
rendered profitable. 

In answer to the last article of your request, I 
shall now proceed to say something of sympathy, and 
the cures reported to have been done thereby. The 
sympathetic powder, so highly esteemed about a 
hundred years since, by men of art in this kingdom, 

'[ an] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 

was first brought into Europe by a religious Carmelite, 
who, in his travels through India, Persia, and China, 
had made himself master of this secret, and from 
some of those eastern countries, came over into 
Tuscany, where he performed many considerable 
cures by this occult method, to the great astonish- 
ment of the most eminent physicians and surgeons 
in those parts ; insomuch that the Duke of Tuscany 
himself was very desirous of becoming master of this 
surprising arcanum, but the honest friar, by many 
handsome excuses, brought himself off, and would 
not be prevailed upon to communicate his nostrum 
to his highness. 

Some few months after this, our famous English 
virtuoso, Sir Kenelm Digby, happening, in his travels, 
to be at the Grand Duke's Court, an opportunity 
fell accidentally in the knight's way to do the friar a 
service, which the good old man took so kindly at 
his hands, that he recompensed the courtesy with a 
discovery of his secret ; and soon after returning into 
Persia, left no man in Europe master of the same 
but Sir Kenelm, who was the first person that brought 
the recipe into England, and that here wrought cures 
by it himself, and recommended it to the practice of 
others ; so that, in a little time, every mother-mid- 
wife and country flaybeard became topping surgeons, 
especially for the cure of green wounds ; for it is not 
to be trusted to in other cases. 

This sympathetic powder, by which many miracles 
have been performed at great distances, is nothing 
more than the simple powder of Roman vitriol, either 
chemically prepared, or imperfectly calcined in the 

[ 312 ] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



beams of the sun ; from whence, is said, it derives 
a very balsamic virtue. A little of this applied to 
any instrument that has done mischief, or to a rag 
dipped into, or stained with the blood of a wound, 
never fails of curing the patient at the widest dis- 
tance, provided the wound be curable. 

Sir Kenelm Digby, to advance the credit of this 
surprising medicine, speaks very largely in com- 
mendation thereof, in a little treatise of his, written 
first in French, upon the same subject; wherein he 
boasts of a remarkable cure performed by himself, in 
a most wonderful manner, with only the use of this 
astonishing powder ; and therefore, as in religious 
cases example goes beyond precept, so, to convince 
you of the miracles performed by sympathy, in- 
stances, perhaps, may prove more effectual than 
arguments : for which reason, I shall proceed to furnish 
you with a notable experiment of this magical powder, 
and so conclude. 

Mr. James Howell, a trusty servant to King James 
I., famous in those days for compiling a treatise, en- 
titled " Dendrologia," and afterwards for his legacy 
to the world, called " Epistolae Ho-Elianae," happened, 
when he was a young gentleman, to accidentally come 
by, when two of his dearest friends were fiercely en- 
gaged in a very dangerous duel, and to prevent 
further mischief, very likely to ensue, too rashly 
catched hold, with his naked hand, of his sword, 
whose passion prompted him to be the most desper- 
ate; in which attempt, the weapon being drawn 
through Mr. Howell's palm, cut the nerves and 
muscles thereof to the very bone, and, as they were 

[ 313 ] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON; OR, 



thus scuffling, holding up the same hand to defend 
one of his friends from a blow upon his head, re- 
ceived another cut upon the back of his hand, cross 
all the veins and tendons, more terrible than the 
former ; which, his friends perceiving, put a sudden 
stop to their inebrious fury, ran both to embrace 
him, and express their sorrow for the unhappy acci- 
dent, lending him their assistance to bind up his 
wounds with his own garters, and so conducted 
him to his lodgings, where they sent directly for a 
surgeon, who found the case desperate, for he bled 
abundantly. 

Mr. Howell being a gentleman much respected by 
the quality, the news of his misfortune soon reached 
the court ; and his Majesty having a great regard for 
him, sent one of his own surgeons to attend him, who 
found the case to be so very bad that he seemed 
doubtful of a cure, without cutting off his hand ; 
which occasioned Mr. Howell, about five days after 
the hurt was received, to apply himself to his good 
friend and neighbour, Sir Kenelm Digby, who at that 
time was famous for the sympathetic powder, begging 
his assistance in that painful extremity, telling him, 
that his surgeons were apprehensive of a gangrene. 

Sir Kenelm, opening the wounds, found a terrible 
case of it, and a dangerous inflammation upon the 
part, which, Mr. Howell acknowledged, gave him 
such intolerable pain as was scarce supportable. The 
knight asked him if he had any bandage with the 
blood upon it. Mr. Howell answered, yes ; accord- 
ingly sent his servant for the bloody garter which 
had first bound up his wounds, and delivered it to 

[ 314 ] 



THE GENEROUS APPARITION 



Sir Kenelm, who, calling for a basin of water, went 
into his closet for a handful of his powder, which he 
infused therein, and then soaked the garter in the 
same liquor, whilst Mr. Howell was talking with 
another gentleman, at the further end of the room, 
not knowing in the least what Sir Kenelm was doing; 
who, after he had bathed the garter in the basin 
about a minute, called to his patient, and asked him 
how he found himself, who answered, " So wonderful 
easy that the inflammation seems to be totally ex- 
tinguished, the pain quite gone off, and my hand I find 
as cool and as much refreshed as if it was wrapped up 
in a wet napkin." " Then," replied the knight, "fling 
off your dressings, meddle no more with plaisters, only 
keep your wounds clean and from the air, and I doubt 
not, but in a few days 1 time, I shall effectually cure 
you, without putting you to any further trouble." 
Much comforted w ith this assurance, Mr. Howell took 
a thankful leave of Sir Kenelm, and so departed. 

Mr. Howell had not been gone above a quarter of 
an hour, before the knight took the garter out of the 
liquor, to dry it before the fire, and carelessly hang- 
ing it a little too near, the extraordinary heat, by the 
concatenation of effluvias, had such an effect upon the 
patient, that he made as many wry faces as a cook 
that had burnt his fingers ; upon which he despatched 
his servant, with all imaginable expedition, to let his 
doctor know what a condition he was relapsed into. 

Sir Kenelm, who presently conjectured the cause of 
this disaster, smiling at the message the servant had 
delivered, and snatching the garter from the fire, told 
him that his master should be very easy by the time 

[315] 



THE FRIENDLY DEMON 



he could return to him, which the footman, by the 
acknowledgment of his master, found to be true ac- 
cordingly, Sir Kenelm doing nothing more to work 
this change, than cooling the reeking garter by a 
speedy repetition of his former application ; so that, 
without any further accident interposing, the patient 
was thoroughly cured, in five or six days' time, by this 
extraordinary method, to the inexpressible admiration 
of all his Majesty's surgeons. 

Sir, this is all, at present, I am at leisure to say in 
answer to your letter, and, I doubt, you will think it 
enough too, except more to the purpose. What ex- 
traordinary cures you happen to perform by your new 
method, I desire you will communicate to me as soon 
as you can conveniently, for to hear of your success 
will be no little satisfaction to, sir, your assured friend, 

and humble servant.
