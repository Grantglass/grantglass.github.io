LIF'E AND ADVENTURES
m
ROBINSON CRUSO-E.>
A,
* N the year 1632, I was born at Tone, ofia remuable ' amiiy.
, My father was a native of Ere-men, who, merchandizing at
Hall for ome time, gained a very pientifu' fortune, and mar-
tied my mother in Zbrk, who received her r breath in that
country : And as her maiden name was Rabz'nerz, I was calied
Rabz'njbn Kreutznaer; which not beingealy pronounced rijnx
the Englih tongue, we are commoniy known, by the name of
Cruoe. _ * v
1 was the younge of three brothers; the elde was a
Lieutenant Coionel in Lackbart's regiment, but ain by 'the
Spaniards : What became of the other I could never learn.
No charge nor pains were wanting in my education, rmy
father deligning me for the law ; yet nothing would erve me,
but I mu go to lea, both again the will of my fathenz-fftzh
tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends. One
morning my father expoulated very warmly with me : Says?
he, what reaon have-you to leave your native country, where
there mu be a more certain propect of content and happiz
nes, than to enter into a Wandering condition - of uneaneg
and' tmcertainty t He recommended to me gar': with, neitdvpjz
'o dfre adve'y'i'tyk me? fir-be: ; that a middle ate of lie'
the mo happy' ; and that the high towering thoughts raiing our condition by Wandering abroad,"v were urmu-oded'

you 'had taken' your poor depied father's counel. He pro.
nouneed thee words with uch a moving and paternal eloquence,
while oods of tears tran down his aged cheeks, that eem-ed
to em the torrent of my reolutions.
But this wore o oon, and a little after I informed my
mother, that I could not lcttle to any buines, my reolutions t
were o rohg to ee the World ; and begged he would gain
my father's conent, only to go one voyage, which ifit did not
prove properousl would never attempt a econd : But my
deire was as vain as my folly 'm aking : my mother paon-
ately expre her dihke of this propoal, telling me, That 'as
helazo I was bent upon my o-wn ale/traction, contrary to their
sun/Land my duty, he Woulday no more, but learoe me to man,
to do whatoever I pleaed. _
I was thenl think, nineteen years old, when one time 'be-
ing at Hull, I met a chool fellow of mine, going along with
his father, who was maer of a hip, to London: And ae-
quainting him with my Wandering deires, he aured me of
my free paage, and a plentiful hare or" what was neceary.
Thus, without imploring a bleiing, or taking a farewell of
my Parents, I took hipping on the r of September 1651.
"Wheno'ur hip having no ooner left the, Humber aern, but
there aroe uch a violent orm, and being extremely
len ick, I thought that the judgments of God deervedly
followed me for my diobedience to my dear Parents, 'It was
then only I called to mind the good advice of my father 3
how eay and comfortable was a middle lat-e of life ; and if
it pleaed God to et me on dry land once more, I would re-
turn to my Parents, implore their forgivnes, 'and bid a nal
adieu to my Wandering'inclinationa
z Such were my thoughts while the orm continued-5 but

another trial, whereby I could not but ee how much I
was beholden to kind providence.
Upon the ixth day, we came to an anchor in Ear-with read,
where we lay wind bound with ome Nemueat/e 'hips *, and
there being good anchorage, and our cables oon zgethe ea.
men forgot their late toil and danger, and penzgzzizaeir time
as merrily as if they had been on hore. But o le eighth
day there aroe uch-a hriik gale of wind, whieh prevented
our tiding it up the river, and till increaing, our hip rid
fore cale in, having hipped everal large eas. .
It was not long before horror eized the eamen themelves,
when I heard the maer expres this melancholly ejaculation,
Lord have mercy upon us, =we hall be all lot and undone! 'For
my part, ick unto death, I kept my cabin, till the univeral
and mo dreadful apprehenions among us of our peedy fate,
made me get up upon deck; and there I was dreadfully af-
frighted indeed : The ea went mountains high: I could ee
nothing butzdires around us: Two hips had cut their mas
onboard, and another was foundered. Two more, had lo
their anchors, were forced out to the mercy of the ocean ;
and to ave our lives, we were forced to cut our fore ma and
main ma quite awayz
Who is there o ignorant as not to judge of my dreadful
condition P I was but a freh water ailor, and therefore it
eemed more terrible, Our hip was very good, but too
much loaden, which made the ailors often cry out, She cwill
founder; words I then was ignorant of! All this while the
orm continuing,the maer and the more ober part of his
men went to prayers, expecting death every moment. In the
middle of the night one cried out, We hadprang a Ieah, another,
That there was four feet water z'n the bold. I was ju ready to ex-
pire with fear, when immediately allhands were Called to the
pump; and the men forced me alo in that extremity to hare with
them in their labour. While thus employed, the maile-r epying
ome light colliers, ired a gun as a ignal ofdires; which Lnot
underanding what it meant, and thinking that either the hip
broke, or ome dreadful thing happened, fell into a woon z
but in that common condition of woe, no body minded me,
excepting to thrut me aide withtheir feet, thinking me dead,
and it was a great while before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when upon the ignal given, they ven-
tu-redtout their boats to ave cur lives. All oartpnmpmg had
been in' vain, and vain had their attempts beenghadi they not
come'to our hip's ide, when our men ca them av'rope over

leaving our hip, we perceived it ink in les than a quarter an hauizþy which I knew what was founde-ring at ee. And,

now the men inceantlylabdurcd to recover their own hip,
but the en ran lo high, and the wind blowing hard, they'
thought it convenient to haw] within hore; which with
great diculty and danger at la we happily eected, land-
ing at a lace called Cromer, not far from Winter-ton- light
houe : etern' whence we all walked to Yarmourþ, where, as
objects of , pity, many good people furnihed us with nccea- *
ries for our ubicnce either to Hull or London.
'Tis range, that after all this, like the Prodigal "on, I did
not return to my father 5 who hearing of the hip's calamity,
for a long time thought me entombed in the deep. No doubt
but I hodld have hored in bis failed calf, as the cripture ex-
preeth it : But my ill ate ill puhed me on, in pite of the
powerful conviction of reaon and concience.
. When I had been at Ter-mouth three days, I met my old
companion, who had given me the invitation to go on board
along with his father. His behaviour and peech was altered,
and in a melancholy manner aked me how I did, telling his
father who I was, and how I had made this voyage for a trial
only to proceed farther abroad : Upon which the old gentle-
man turning to me, gravely aid, young man, you ought 'te-ver to
go toiea any more, but to take this for a certain ign that you will
'zwerprsyþer in aafarz'rzg condition. Sir, anwered I, will you
take the ame-reolution r 'Tz's a dierent cae, aid he, 'rit nzy
calling, and conequently ny duty; but as you bacve made this
naging-afar a trz'aI, you ee Alba: ill rccct ben-nen bar et before
your eyes; and perhaps our miories bowe been on your account, lite
Jonah in the hip of Tarhih : But pray ewhat are you, and or:
'what account did you go to en ? Upon which I very freely de-
clared my whole ory ; at the end of which he made this ex-
clamation, Ye acred powersl what had I committed, that
uch a wretch hould enter into my hip to heap upon me uch
a. delngc of micrics l But oon recollecting his Paions,
Young man, aid he, depend upon it, z'fyou do not go back, where-
mr you go, you rwz'll meet ewz'tb diaier: and diappoimmemr, till
yearfarber's twot-do arefulled uporzyou. And o We parted.
I thought at r to return home, but hame oppoed that
good motion, as thinking I hould bia-"laughed at by my neigh-
hours and acquaintance. So range is the nature of youth,
who are not ahamed to in, but yet ahamed to repent; and
far from being ahamed of thoe actions for which they may
be accounted tools, think it folly in returning to their duty,
which is-the principal mark of widom. In hort, I travelled
top to London, reol-ved upon a voyage; and a voyage I oon
jieard of, by my acquaintance with a Captain who took a fan.
ey to me, to go to the coa of Guz'nea. Having ome money,
and appearing like a gentleman, I went on board, not as a'
zommoa ailoror forema man 3 nay, the commander agreed
I hould
"never took me with him, but left me tottook after his little:
*
I hould go that voyage with him without any expene ; that
I hould be his mes mate and companion ; and I was very
welcome to carry any thing with me, and make the bet mer-
chandize I could.
I bleed my happy fortune, and humbly thankedmy Cap-
tain for his oer ; when acquainting my friends in Fork/Ere,
forty pounds were ent me, the greate part of which I be-
lieve my dear father and mother contributed to; and with
which I bought toys and tries as the Captain direEted me.
My Captain alo learned me navigation, how to keep an ac-
count of the lhip's coure, take an Obervation, and led me
into the knowledge of everal ueul branches of the mathe-
maties. And indeed this voyage made me both a ailor and "
merchant: For I brought home 5 pound-s 9 ounces of gold'
du for my adventure, which produced at my return to Land
don, almo three hundred pounds. But in this voyage I was
extremely ick, being thrown into a violent calenture, through
exceve heat, trading upon the coa, from the latitude of 15
degrees north, even to the line itelf.
Bntalas l my dear friend the Captain oon departed this
life, after his arrival. This was a enible grief tame; yet
I reolved to go another voyage with his mate, who 'had now
got command of the hip. But this proved unuccesful t
for though] did not carry quite £too of my late acquired
wealth, lo that- I had £2oo left, which I depo'ited with the
Captain's widow, who was an hone gentle-woman, yet my
misortunes in this voyage were very great upon me ; for out'
hip falling towards the Canter) ilands, we were chaed by a
Salee rover; and in pite of all the fail we could make, by
crowding as much canvas as our yards would pread,'or
mas carry, the pirate gained upon us, and o we prepared
oure'lves to ght. They had 18 guns, and we had but 12..
About three in the alter-noon there was a delperate engage-
ment, wwherein many were killed and wounded on both tides ;
hu't nding ourelves overpowered with numbers, our hip
diabled, and omelves too =Zmpotent to have the lea hopes
of ne'ces, we were forced to urrender, and accordingly were
all carried into the port of lSale'r. Our 'men were ent to the
lzfmperc-Ps court to be old there? but the pirate Captain tak;
ing notice of me, kept me to be his own ave.
In this condition I thought myelf the mo mierable grea-
ture on earth, and the prophey of my father came afreh 'into
my thoughts. As it happened, my condition was better "than
I thought it to be, as will oon appear. Some hopes indeed I
had, that my new patron would go to eagain, 'where he:
might be taken by a Spanih or Portugue/Z man of war, andt i-
I hould be et at liberty. But in this! was mitaken', o

turned from ea,*would make melie in the cabin, and look
after the hip. I 'had no one that I could communicate my
thoughts to, which were continually meditating my ecape 5
no Englg/Ziman, Irih-man, or Scatcbman here, but myel ; and
For two-I. years I: could ee 'nothing practicable, but only pleae
myelf with the imagination;
After ome length of time, my patron, as I found, grew o ,
poor, that hecould not fit out his hip as uual :. And then he
ued conantly, once or twice a week, if the weather was fair,
to go out a hing, taking me and a young Morejbo boy to row
the boat; and o much pleaed was he with mezfor my dex-
terity in catchingithe h, that he would often lend me with a
Maur, who was one of his kinmen, and the More/"m youth, to.
catch a dihof'h for him.
One morning, as we were at the port, there aroe uch a
thick fog, that We lot-i ight of the thore; andwrowing we knew
"not which way, we laboured all the night, and in the morning
ound ourfelves in the ocean, two leagues from land; how,
ever, we attained there at length, and-we made the greater
hambecane our omachs were exceedingly harp and'hnngry.
But the better to prevent uch diaers, my patron ordered a
carpenter to build a little lateroom or cabin in the middle
of the long boat, with a place behind it to eer and ha'wl
home the main heet, with other Conveniences, to keep him
from the weather, as alo lockers to put in all manner of pro-
viions; with a handome fhoulder of m'ntton ail, gibing
over the cabin.
In this he frequently took us a hing; and one time invit-
ing two or three Perons of ditinction to go with him, made
provion extraordinary, providing alo three tuzees, with
powder and hot, that they might have ome [port at owling
along the ea coai. The nekt morning, the boat being clean,
herancients and pendents out, and every thing ready, their
minds altering, my patron ordered us_to go a hing, for that,
his gues would certainly up with him that night.
And non/"I began to think of my deliverance indeed : In
order to this, I peiruaded the Maar to get ome proviions on,
hoard, as not dating to meddle. with our patron's ; who, tak-
ing my advice, we ored ourelves with rnk bilcuit, and
three jars of water; beides I" privately conveyed into the'
boat a bottle of brandy, ome twine, thread, a hammer, hatcha-z
et, and a aw ; in particular ome beewax, which was a great,
comfort to me, and erved to make, candles. I then per-medy.

11
thingsi neceary, we ailed out, relolving for my own part to
make my ecape, though it might co me (my life. _
' When we had paed the cale, we fell to hing-f but
though I knew there' was a. bite, I diembled the matter, in
order. to put farther out to ea. Accordingly we ran a league
farther; when giving the boy the helm, ande pretending to
oop for omething, I eized Muley by urpre, and threw
him overboard. He was an excellent lwimmer, oon aroe,
and made towards the boat; upon which I took out a uzee,
and preented it at him : Malgi, aid I, I neweryetq/igned to do
you any harm, and eek nothing no-"w but my redemptzon. I knotte
you 'are able enough to wim to hare and ame year lz'e; out
ifyou are reolcved to oIlo-w me, to the endangerzng of mzne,
ibe 'UB'J' moment you proceed I will hoot you through the bend.
T he harmles creature, at thee words, turned himelf from
me, and I make no doubt got afe to land. Then' turning
to the boy Xmy, I perceived he trembled at the action; but
I put him out of all fear, telling him, that if he would be true
and faithful to me, I would do well by him : And therefore,
aid I, you mu rokeyour face to befaz'tbful, and, as tbe Turks
bacve Iearmyou, wear by Mahomet, and tbe beard of your father,
or aye- I evill tbro=w you into 'be ea alo. So innocent did the
child then look, and with uch an obliging mile, conented,
that I readily believed him, and," from that day forward, be-
gan to love him entirely.
Thus we purued our voyage, and that they hould think
me gone to the Straz't's mouth, I kept to the outhward to the
truly Barbariaa coa ; but in the dufk of the evening, I
changed my coure, and eered directly S. by E. that I might
keep near the hore 3 and having a freh gale of wind, with a
pleaant mooth ea, by three o'clock" the next day I was 150
miles beyond the Emperor of Marocco's dominions. Yet ill
having the dreadful apprehenions of being retaken, I continu-
ed ailing for ve days lucceiively, till uch time as the wind
hiting to the outhward, made me conclude, that if any Ve-
el was in chae of me they would proceed no farther: And after
o much fatigue and thought, I anchored in the mouth of a
little river, I knew not What, or where 3 neitheridid I then
ee any people. What I principally wanted was freh water 3
and I was reolved, about dul-k, to wim ahore. But no
ooner did the gloomy clouds of night begin to ucceed
he; declining day, than we heard uch barking, roar-
ing; howling of wild creatures, that one might have
'thought the very ranget moners of nature; go; infernal
thanke, had their redence there. Poor Xum Klmoi dead

boy had learnt from the captives of our nation, pleaed me en-
tirely, and to add to his cheerulnes, I gave him a dram of the
bottle : We could get but little leep all the night for the ter-i
rible howlings they made z and indeed we were both arighted
veny much, when, by the rowling of the water, and other tok-
ens, we july concluded one of thoe mouiers made towards
our boat; I could not ee it till it came within two oars
len th, when, taking my uzee, I let y at him: Whether I
hit rim or no, I cannot tell z but he made towards the hore,
and the noie of my gun encreaed the upenduous noie of
the moners. _ '
The next morning, I was reolved to go on hore to get
freh water, and venture my life among beais or avages,
hould either attack me. Xury aid he would take one of the
jars and bring me ome. I aked him why he would go, and
not I.- The poor boy anwer-ed, z'f cwz'ld man: come, they eat me,
you go away. A mind carcely now to betimitated, o contra-
ry to elfpreervation, the mo powerful law of naturel
This indeed encreaed my aection to the child. Well, dear
Xury, aid I, swe- rm'll ber/2 go ahore, both eat nwz'ld mam, and
they hall eat rzez'tbero ur. So giving Xury a piece of rufk
bread to eat, and a dram, we waded athore, carrying nothing
with us butour arms, and two jars for water. I did not go
t of ight of the boat, as dreading the avages coming down
, he riverin their canoes. But the boy eeing a low decent,
or vale, about a mile in the country, he wandered to it ; and
then running back to me with great pregipitation, I thought
he was purued by ome avage or wild bea, upon which I
approached, reolving to perih or protect him from danger.
As he came nearer to me, I aw omething hanging over his
houlders, which was a creature he had hot, like a hare, but'
dierent in colour, and longer legs; however, we were glad
of it, for it proved wlioleome nourihing meat ; but what
added to our joy was, my boy aured me there was plenty of
ster, and that hee-e no 'wild mam. And greater ill was
Fcomfort, when wefound freh water in the creek, wherei
'-> we were, when the tide was out, without going o far up into
the country. ,
In this place I began to conider that the Carzmy and the
Cape de Yard ilands lay not faro; but having no inrument,
I knew not what latit'ude, or when, to tand o to ea for them 5
yet my hopes were, 1 hould meet ome of the Englzh trading _
Veels, who would relieve and take us up, . t V
The place I was in was, no doubt, that wild ort ofcnnntryz
inhabited only by a few, that lies between the Emperor of
'MoMca's dominione and the Negroe: .* It was, lled with wild i
beatts,
I3
beaiis, and the Maur: ue it for hunting chiev. From this
place [thought l aw the top of the mountain Tm, in
the Cauteries; which made me try twice to attain it, but as
often was I drove back, and o forced to purue my fortune
along the there.
Early one morning we came to an anchor under a little
point of land, but pretty high, and the tide beginning to
flow, we lay ready to go farther in : But Xmy, whoe youth-
ful and penetrating eyes were harper than mine, in a oft tone,
deired me to keep far from land, le we hould be devoured :

piece of the hill. Xmy, aid Lywhallgo art/bare and kill him.
But the boy looked amazed : Me kill him, ays he, be ear me
at one moutb ; meaning one mouthful. Upon which I bid him
lie ill, and charging my bigge gun with two lugd, and a
good charge of powder,l took the be aim I could to hoot him
through the head, but his leg lying over his noe, the ug
broke his knee bone. The liohawaking with the pain, got
up, bin loon feil down, giving the mo hideous groan I ever
heard : But taking my econd piece, I hot him through the
head, and then he lay iruggling for life. Upon this Xmy
took heart, and deired my leave to go on hore. Go then,
aid I. Upon which taking a little gun in one hand, he wan'
to hore with the other, and coming cloe to the lion, put a
period to his life, by hooting him again through the head.
But this was lpending our ammunition in vain, the eh not'
being good to eat. Xurj was like a champion, and comes on

not having rength to perform, cut o a foot. But I be-

cried, No, no z however, I approached nearer, and I found
they ran along the hore by me a good way: They had no wea-
pens in their lands z except one, who held a longr ick, which
Xmy told me wasa lance, with which they could kill at a
great diance. [talked to them by igns, and made them
enible I wanted omething to eat : They beckoned to me to
top my boat, while two of them run up into the country and
in les than hall an hour came back and brought with them
two pieces of dry lieth, and ome corn, which we kindly ac-
cepted ; and to prevent any fears of either ide, they brought
the food to the horehlaid it down, then went and ood a
great way o, till we fetched it on board, and then came cloe
to tis again. '
But while we were returning thanks to them, being all we
could oer, two mighty creatures came from the mountains,
ene as it were purl'uingthe other with great fury, which we
were inclined to believe, becaue they eldom appear but in
the night ; and both thee pang wiftly by the Negroes,
jum'ped into the ea," wantonly wimming about, as though
the diverion of the waters had put alop to their ercenes-
At la, one of them coming nearer my boat than I expected
or detired, I hot him directly through the head ; upon
whichhe unk immediately, yet riing again, would have
willingly made to the hore ; but between the wound and the
trangling of the water, he died before he could reach it.
It is not poible for me to expres the conernation the
poor Negroes were in at the ring my gun ; much les can I
mention their urprie, when they perceived the creature to
be (lain by it. I made igns to them to draw near it, 'and
then gave them a rope to hale it on hore. It was a beautiful
leopard, which made me deire its ikin ; and the Negroe:
eeming to covet the carcae, I very' freely gave it to them.
As for the other leopard, it made to hore, and ran with _a
prodigious witnes out of ight. The Negroes having kindly
furnihed me with water, and with what roots and grain their
veeuntry aorded, I took my leave, and after eleven days fail,

told him I was an Englihman, who had ecaped 'from the
War-It of SaL-'e; upon which they took me kindly on board,
r h all my eects. *
Surely none can expres that inconceivable joy my heart
felt at this my happy deliverance z who, from being a mier-
able and orlorn creature, was not only relieved, but in favour
with the maier of the hip, whom in return for my deliver-
ance I oered all 1 had to him; Godforþz'd, aid he, that I

Having a pleaant voyage to the Brails, we arrived in the

the Captain ; he would take nothing for my paage, 'give me

To be brief, I bought a ettlement next door to an honer
and kind neighbour, born at Libon, of Englih parents, whoe
plantation joining to mine, we improved it very amicably to-
gether: Both our ocks were low, and for two years we
planted only for food : But the third year we planted ome
tobacco, preparing each a large piece of ground for planting
canes the enuing year; but now wanting atance, 1 re-
pented the los of my dear boy Xmy.
Here having none to ai me, my father's words came a.
gain into my mind; and if only a middle (lation of life I
fought, why could it not as well be obtained in England as
here? When I pondered of this with regret, the thoughts of
my late deliverance forook me; I had none to convere with
'but my neighbour; no work to be done but by my own
hands; and this often made me ay, my condition was like
that of a man ca upon a deolate il'and. So unhappy are we
in our reections, o forgetful what good things we receive
ourelves, and o unthankful for our deliverance from thoe
Calamities that others endure.
I was, in ome meaure ettled before the Captain who took:
me up departed from the Brailr. One day I went to him,
and told him what ock I had in London, deiring his aance
in obtaining its remittance. To which the good gentleman
readily contented, but would only have me end for half my
money, le it hould micarry, whielyif it did, the remainder
might upport me : And o taking letters of procuration from
ame, bid me trouble myelf no farther about it.
zAnd indeed wonderful was his kindnes towards me ; for
he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon my
Captain's widow, but ent me over a ervant, with a eargo
proportionable to my condition. He alo ent me over tools
of all orts, iron work, and utenils neceary for my planta.
tion, and which proved o£ the greate ue to me in my bu.
nes. '
&Vealth now. accumulating on me, and uncommon ucces
crowning my properous labours, I might have reted happy
in that middle tate of life my father had o often recommend-
ed ; yet nothing would content me, uch was my evil genius ;
but 1 mut leave this happy lation, for a foolih ambition in
'riing greater than the nature of the thing admitted ; 'and thus,
once moredcal mylelfinto the deepe gult of miery that ev-'
er abandoned creature fell into. For having lived four years
an' Ere/27, I not only learnt the language, but contracted ac-
quaintance-with the mo eminent planters, and even \ the
merghants of St. Salwadore; to whom, by way of dieoure,
giving an account of my two voyages to the coa of Guinea,
and the manner of trading there for mere tries, by which
we might furnih our plantations with Negraer, they gave uch
attention
1"I
attention to what I aid, that three of them came one morning
to me, and told me'they had a ecret propoal to make. At'-
ter enjoining me to ecrey (it being an infringement on the

powers of the Kings of Partugal and S az'rz) they told me they
had a mind tott out a hip to go to ainea, in order to ock
the plantation with Negraes, which, as they could not be pub.
licly fold, they would divide among them; and if I would go
their upercargo in the hip, to manage the trading part, I
hould have an equal hare of the Negraes, without providing
any tock. 'The thing indeed was fair enough, had I been in
another condition ; but I, born to be my own deroyer, could
not rei the propoal ; but accepted the oer, upon condition
of their looking after my plantation : So, making a formal
will, I bequeathed my eects to my good friend the Captain,
as my univeral heir; but obliged him to dipoe of my eects
as directed, one half of my produce to himelf, and the other
to be hipped for England.
The hip being tted out, and all things ready, we et lail
the r of September, t659, being the lame day eight years I
let my father and mother in nih-ire. W'e failed north-
ward upon the coa, in order to gain Africa, till we made
Cape Augziim, from whence going further in the ocean, 'out
of light of land, we eered as though we were bound for the
ie of FFTUdU-l de Noremba, leaving the ilands on the eal; t
and then it was we met with a cruel tempe, which held us
for twelve days ucceively; o that the waters carried us
whereoever they pleaed. In this perplexity one of out men
died, and one man and the boy were wahed overboard.
When the weather cleared up a little, we found ourelvea
eleven degrees north latitude upon the c'oaft of Guz'rzeo. Upon
this the Captain gave reaons for returning, which I oppoed,
counelling him to tand away for Barbadaes, which, as I up-
poed, might be attained in 15, days. So altering our coure,
we failed north welt and by well, in order to reach wele-eno-
ardiiands; but a econd iorm ucceeding, drove us to the
weward, lo that we werejuily afraid of fallinginto the hands
of cruel Savoagw, or the paws of devout-ing bealis of prey. *

aw that this la eort would not be a ucient protection
from death ; o high did the ea run, that it was impoible the
boat hould live. As to making ail, we had none; neither
if we had, could we make ue of any. So that when we had
rowed, or rather were driven about a league and a half, a rag-
ing wave, like a lofty mountain, came rolling a iern of us,
and took us with uch fury, that at once it overet the boat.
Thus being wallowed up in a moment, we had hardly time
to call upon the tremendous name of God; much les to im-
plore, in dying ejaculations, his innite mercy, to receive our
departing onls.
' Men are 'generally counted inenible, when firuggling in
the pangs of death ; but while I was overwheimed with water,
I had the mo dreadful apprehenions imaginable; for the
joys of heaven, and torments of hell, eemed to preent them-
elves before me in thee dying agonies, and even in the mall
pace oftime; as it were, between lie and death. I was going,
I thought, I knew not whither, in adiimal gultT unknown,
and as yet unperceived, never to behold my friends, nor the
light of this world any more ! Could I even have thought an.
nihilation, or a total diii'olution of oul as well as body, the
gloomy thoughts of' having no further being, no knowledge of
what ne hoped for, but an eternal quietus, without life or
ene z even that, I ay, would have been enough to rike me
with, horror and eonfniion I But triving to the la extremity,
whiie I thought all my companions were overpowered and en-
tombed in the deep, it was with great diculty I kept my
breath till the wave pent itieif, and retiring back, let me on
the nore halfdead with the water 1 had taken in, However,
I got on my feet as fat as I could, le another wave hould
purne, and carry me hack again; but forail the halle I made,
I could not avoid it; -for the ea came after me like a high
mountain, or furious enemy, o that my bunels was to hold
my breath, and by raiing myelf on the water, preerve it by
wimming; the next dreadful wave buried me at once twenty
or thirty feet deep, but at the ame time carried me with a
migl'ztyort-e and lwittnes towards the hore; when raiing
myel, I held out as well as poble, till at length the water
having pent itel, began to return, at which I ruck forward,

another run, was overtook by a'mall have, which was man;
conquered 5 but before any more could overtake me, I reach-
ed the main land, where clambering up the clifts of the hore,
tired and alniott pent, I fat down on the gras, free from the
dangers of the foaming ocean. ' , -
No tongue can expres the eclaies and tranportsthat my
foul felt at this happy deliverance; it was like a reprieve to a
dying malefactor, with the halter about his neck, and ready
to be turned o! I was wrapt up in contemplation, and often
lifted up my hands, with the profounde humility, to the
Divine Power, for aving my life, when'the re'of my corn-
panions were all drowned. And now I began, to ca my eyes
around, to behold what place I was in, and what I had next
to do. I could ee no houe, nor eople : I was wet, yet had
no clothes to hift me ; hungrypan thirfly, yet nothing to eat
or drink ; no weapon to detroy any 'creature for my uffe-
nance, nor defend zizyl'elf again devouring beafls: In hort,
I had nothing but a knife, a tobacco pipe, and a box half ll.
ed with tobacco. The darkfottte night coming upon me, in.
created my fears of being devoured by wild creatures; my
mind was plunged in depair; and, having no propect, as I
thought, of life before me, prepared for another kind of'death
than what I had lately ecaped. I walked about a furlong,
to ee if I could ne-Jaw freh water, which I did to my "great
joy, and taking a q 7 of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got up
into a thick buhy tree, and eating myfelfto that I could not
fall, a deep leep overtook me, and for that night buried my
orrows in a quiet repoe.
IJt was broad day "the next morning before I awaked z
when not only I perceived the tempe was t zsfed, but the hip
was driven almo as far as the rock before mentioned, where
the waves had dahed me againtt, and which was about a mile
from the place where l was. 'When I came down fron: my
apartment in the tree, I perceived the hip's boat two miles
ditant on my right hand, lying on hore, as the waves had ca
her. I thought to have got to her, but there being an inlet
of water of 'about half a mile-'s breadth between it and me, I
returned again towards the fhip,-as hoping to nd omething
for my more immediate obence. *Abo®ut noon, when the
ea was calm, that I could come within a quarferf 3 mile Of
her, it was to my grief I perceived that, if we had kept on
hoard, all our lives had been 'avedr Thee thoughts, and'my
loljtule, drew tears from my eyes, though Fall in vain. So
retolvtngkto get to the hip, I ript, and" leapt: into the water;
when iwttttming round her, 1 washfr'aid I hout;_;_3_1ar get any
thing to lay hold of; but it was my good fortune to elpy a
(Van Pie'qfmpe hang down by thefore chains, o' low, that
WHih'EW-MUCUItY, by the-help of it, I got into the foreeaile
7 U _ r at,
20*
of the hip Here I found that the hip was bulged, and had
a great deal of water in her hold; her ern was lifted up a-
gain a bank, and her head almo in the water. All her
quarter, and what was there, were free and dry. The pro-
viions I found in good order, with which I crammed my
pockets; and, loing no time, ate when I was doing other
things; Ialo found ome rum, of which I took a hearty
dram ; and now I wanted for nothing except a boat which in-
deeed was all, to carry away what was needful for me.
Necety occaions quicknets of thought. We had everal
pare yards, a pare topma or two, and two or three large
pare of wood : With thee I fell to work, and ung as many
of them overboard as [could manage, tying every one of
them with a 'rope that they might not drive away. This done,
I went down the hip's ide, and tied four of them fa togeth-
er at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two or three
hort pieces of plank upon them crolsways, I found it would
bear me, but not any coni rable weight. Upon which I
went to work again, cutting a pare topma into three iengths,
adding them to my raft with a great deal of labour and pains.
I then conidered what I hould load it with, it being not able
to beara ponderous burden. And this I oon thought of',
r wiaying upon it all the planks any boards Iconld get;
next I lowered down three of the eattiiw' ches, after I had
lled-them with bread, rice, three Dweb Cheees, five pieces
of dried goats' eh, and ome European corn, what iittle the
rats had pared; but for the liquors, I found everal caes of
bottles belonging to our kipper. In which were ome cer-
dial waters, and four or ve gallons of arrack, which I wed
by themelves. 'By this time the tide beginning to ow, I
perceived my coat, waicoat, and hirt wim away, which I
had left on the hore; as for my linen, breeches, and ock-
ings, I wam with them on to the hip: But Ioon found
clothes enough, yet took no more than 1 wanted for the pre-
ent. My eyes were chiey on tools to work with; and after
long earch I found out the carpenter's chei, which I got ate
down on my rat r Then I looked for arms and amtnunition,
and, in the great cabin, found two good fowling pieces, two
piiols, everal powder horns lled, a mall bag of hot, and
two ruy old words. I alo' ound three barreis of powder,
two of which were good, but the third had taken water; with
, two or three broken ears, two aws, an axe, and a hammer,
I put to ea ; and in getting to there, I had three encourage-
ments; 1. A mooth calm ea. z. The tide riing and 'et-
ting in to the hore. 3. The little wind there was blew tow-
ards land. But after I had failed about a mile, I ound the
tat to drive a little diance from the place where I r land-
ed 5 and then I perceived alittle opening of the land, with al
i rong
21
flrong current of the tide running into it, upon which I kept
in the middle of the tream : But great was my concern, when
on 'a udden the ore part of my rat ran aground ; o that had'
I not with great diculty, for near half an hour, kept my
back raining again the ches, to keep my eects in their
places, all I had would have gone into the ea. But after
ome time, the riing of the water caued the tat to oat a-
gain, when coming up a little river, with land on both ides,
llanded in a little cove, as near the mouth as poble, the
better to dicover aail, if any uch providentially paed by
that way. *
Not far o, I pied a hill of a upendous height, urround-
ed with leer hills about it: And thither [was reolved to
go and view the country, that I might ee what part was the
be place to x my habitation in : Aceordingly, arming my-
lel with a piol, a owling piece, powder, and ball, I acend-
ed the mountain: There I perceived I was in an iand en-
compaed by the lea; no diant lands to be een, but catter-
ed rocke that lay to the we ; that it eemed a barren place,
and, as I thought, inhabited only by wild beals. I perceived
abundance of fowls, but was ignorant of what kind, or wheth-
er good for nourihment; I hot one of them at my return,
which occaioned a conped creaming among theother birds;
and I ound it, by ianaedlour and beak, to be a kind of hawk,
but its'jeh was perfect earrion.
When I came to my raft, I brought my eects on hare,
which work pent that day entirely; and fearing that ome
cruel beas might devour me in the night while I lept, I.
made a kind of a but or barricade with the ches and boards I
brought from hare. That night I tlept very comortably,
and the next morning-my thoughts were employed to make a
further attempt on the hip, and bring away what necearies I
eguld nd, before another torm hould break her to pieces.
Aecord-ingly, I' got on board as before, and prepared a econd
tat, far 'more nice than the r ; upon which I brought away
the carpenter's ores, two or three bags full of nails, a great
jack crew, a dozen or two of hatchets, and a grindone. I
alo took away everal things that belonged to the gunner, par-
ticularly two or three tron ere-ws, two barrels of mnket bul-
lets, another owling piece, a mall quantity of powder, and a
large bag full of mall hot. Beides thee, I took all the mens'
clothes I could nd, a pare fore top ail, hamrnock, and ome
beddrng ;. and thus completing my econd cargo, I made all
the halle to hore I could, fearing ome wild bea might de-
hoy what I had there already. But I*onl\y found a little
wtld cat itting on one of the ches, who not eeming to fear
meet' the gun that I preented to her, I threw her a piece of.
bþzyWhih he inantly ate, and departed.
U When
22
When I had gotten thee eects on hare, I went tn work,
in order to make me a little tent with the tail and (eme pnles
which I had cut for that purpoe; and having nihed it,
what things might be damaged by the weather I bmnght in,
piling all the empty ches and caks in a Circle, the better to
fortiy it againt any udden attemntof man or beal. After
this I blocked up the doors with' turne boards, and an empty
che turned the long way without. I then charged my gun
and piol; and laying my bed on the ground, lept as com-
fertably, till nexhmornlng, as though I had been in a Chri-
tian country.
Now, though I had enough to ubi me a long time, yet,
depairing of a udden deliverance, or that hnth ammnnition
and proviion might be pent before uch a thing happened, I
covered as much asl could : And o long as the hip remained
in that cnnditioml daily brought away one neceary or other;
particularly, the rigging, aits, and cordage; ome twine, a
barrel of wet powder, ome ngar, a barrel of meal, three eaks
of rum; and what indeed was mo welcome to me, a whoie
hoghead of bread. -
The next time I went, I cut the cables in pieces, carried o
a hauer whole, with a great deal of iron "work, and made a-
nother raft with the mizen and prit fail yards z but this being
o unweildly, by the too heavy hurdeniilw laid upon it, and not
being able dextrouly to guide it as the "rmer, both my cargo
and I were overturned. For my part, all the damage I u-
tained was a' wet kin ; and at low water, after much labour
in diving, I got mo of the cables, and ome pieces of iron.
Thirteen days had 1 now been inthe iland, and' eleven"
times on board, bringing awav all that was poihle; though,
I believe,-had the weather been calm, I hould have brought
away the Whole hip, piece by piece. A? I was going the
twelfth time, the wind began to rie ; however, I ventured at
low water, and rumma'ging the 'cabin eecttmlly, in a locker I
found everal razors, ciars, and ome dozens of knives; and
forks; and in another, thirty ax pounds in pieces of eight,

I had about me, and it was with much diculty I got a-
hot-e, when oon after it blewx a fearful orin.
That night I ept very contentedly in my little tent,
urrounded with all my eects; but when I looked out in
the morning, no more hip was to be een. This much ur-
prifed me lot' the preent, yet when I conidered I had lo no

mitted to the will of Providence. A.
My next thoughts were, how I hould defend and ecure
myelf from avages and wild beais, if any uch were in the
ill-and. At one time I thought of digging a cave ; at another,
1 was for ere-fling a tent; and, in hort, I reolved tio do
both : The manner or form of which will not, I hope, be un.
pieaing to decribe.
When I conidered the ground where I was ; that it was
moorih, and had no freh water near it ; my reolutions were
to earch for a oil healthy and well watered, where I might
not only be heltered from the lun's earching heat, but be
more conveniently ituated, as well to be ecured from wild
men and beas ot prey, as more eaily to dicover any diant
fail hould it o happen.
And indeed it was not long before I had my deire ; I found
a little plain near a riing hill, the front towards which being
a; leep as ahou'e ide, nothing could decend on me from
the top. On the ide of this rock was a little hollow place res
embling the entrance or door of a cave. Ju before this
place, on the circle of the green, I refolred my tent hould
tand. This plan did not much exceed too yards broad, and
about twice as long, like a delightfnl green before my door,
With a pleaing, though irregular decent every way to the low
grounds by the ca lidc, lying on the N. N. W. de of the
hill, o that it was heltered from the exceve heat of the ort-a.
tftterthis I drew a emicircle, containing ten yards in its emi-
oiameter, and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two
rows of rong akes, not ix inches from each other. - Then,
with the piece; of cable which I had cut on board, I regularly
laid them inzzecircle between the pctiles up to their tops,
which were Mrs than ive feet out of the earth, and after
drove another row of piles looking within ide again
lhemizþctween two' or three feet high', which made me con-
clude it a little jmpregnable catle, from men andi'beas :
And:- f' my 'better ecurity, l would have no door, but
tered in and'carne out by the help of a ladder', which I

WHEN was' my ence and fortres, into which "I, carried all

the'roclc, what with the dirt and ones I cing out,i not only

raied my ground two feet, but made a little Cellar to my man-
ion houe ; and this co me many days labour and pains. But
one day in particular a hower of rain falling, thunder and
hghtning enued, which put me in terror, lel my powder
hould take re, and not only hinder my neceary ubience
by killing me food, but even blow up me and my habita-
tion: To prevent which, I fell to making boxes and bags,
in order to eparate it, having by me near 15oz. weight.
And thus being etablihed as king of the iland, every day
I went out with my gun to ee what I could kill that was t
to eat. I oon perceived numbers of goats, but very thy :
Yet having watched narrowly, and eeing I could better hoot

Thus entered into a trange cene o life, as ever any man
was in,l had mo melancholy apprehenions concerning my
deplorable condition; and manyftimes the tears would plen>
tifully run down my face, when I conidered how I was de-
barred from all communication with human kind. And

aceue previdence, other good thoughts would interpoe and

J O U R N A L.
Seþtember 30, 1659. I unhappy Robz'aan Crrg/þe, havingu-
fered hipwreck, was driven on this deolate iand, which I
named the De/ate [and of Dqpaz'r, the re being wallowed
up in the tempeltuous ocean. The next day I pent in conid-
eration of my unhappy circumances, having no propect, but
of death, either to be arved with hunger, or devoured by
beas or merciles avages.
Octoh I. That ,morning, with great comfort, I beheld the
hlp drove ahore. Some hopes I had, that wher. the orin
was abated, I might be able to get ome food and necearies
out of her ; which I conceived were notdamaged, becaue the
hip did tand upright. At this time I lamented the Los of
my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the Veel"
When I perceived the hip, as it were, lie dry, l waded through
the ands, then wam aboard, the weather being very rainy,
and with carcely any maid. _
To the 24th or' this month, my timewas employed in mak-
ing voyages, every tide getting what. I could out of the hip,

the hip dioived in pieces, o that nothing was een of her but:
the wreck at low water. This day 1 ecured my goods from
the inclemency of the weather.
0805.- 26. I wandered to ee where I could nd a- place con-
venient for my abode. I xed upon a rock, in the evening,
marked out a half moon, intending to erect a wall, fortied
with Piles, lined within, with pieces of cables, and covered with

the Broiliam call an iron tree. I had like to have poiled tpy

ladde'nlyea great deal ofthe top broke in; o that it'was- a men
FY
ey I was not buried in the rnins. This occaioned a great
deal of pains and trouble to me, before I could make it rm
and durable.
Dec. 17. I nailed up ome helves, and drove nails and a-
ples in the wall and pos, to hang things out of the way.
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place, then made a ort
of a dreer, and another table.

Bet. 26. Very fair weather.
Dee. 27', I chanced to light on ome goats, hot one, Wound-
ed another. I led it home in a firing, bound up its leg, and
cured it in a little time ; at length it became o tame and fa-
miliar, as to feed before the door, and follow me where I
pleaed. This put me in mind to bring up tame creatures, in
order to upply me with food after my ammunition was pent.
Dee. 28, 29, 30. The weather being exceive hot, with lit-
tle air, obliged me for the mot part to keep within doors.
Frm. 1. Still ful-try. However, obliged by neceity, I went
out with my gun, and found a great tore of goats in the val-
lies ; they were exceedingly hy, nor could my dog hunt them
down.
ion. 3, to 14. My employment this time was to nih the
wall before decribed, and earch the iland. I dicovered a
kind of Pigeons like our houe Pigeons, in a neft among the
rocks : I brought them home, nured them till they could fly,
and then they left me. After this 1 hot ome, which proved
excellent food. Some time I pent vainly in contriving to
make a cak ; I may well ay it was vain, becaue I could
neither join the iaves, or x the heads, o as to make it tight.
Then taking ome goat's tallow I had by me,and a little oakum
for the wick, I provided myelf with a lamp, which erved me
intead of candles.
But now a very trange event happened : For beingh the
height of my earch, what hould come into my hand, but a
bag, which was ued to hold corn (as I uppoed) for the
Fowls: So immediately refolving to put gunpowder in it, I
'hock all the huks and dirt upon one ide of the rock, little
inpecting what the conequence would be. The rain had
fallen plentifully a few days before ; and about a month after,
to my great amazement, omething began to prout out very
green and ouribing: And when I came to view it more
nicely every day, as it grew, I found about to or 12 ears. of
green barley appearing in the very ame hape and make as
that in England.
l can carce expres the agitations of my mind at this ight.
Hithertol had looked upon the actions of this life no other-
wie than only as the events of blind chance and fortune:
But now, the appearance of this barley, to that ort of grain:
ourihing,
nourihing in a barren oil, and my ignorance in not conceiv-
ing how it hould come there, made me conclude, that mzracles
ewere not ye: raied: Nay, I even thought that God had ap-
pointed it to grow there without any eed, purely for my u.
tenance in this mierable and deolate iland. And indeed
uch great eect had this upon me, that it often made me melt
into tears, through a grateful ene oGod's merctes z and the
greater ill was my thankulnes, when I perceived, about this
little eld of barley, ome rice alks, wonderfully ourihing
in proportion to the crop within. '
While I was thus wonderfully pleaed in mind, I concluded
there mu be more corn in the iland; and therefore made a
diligent earch narrowly among the tocks, but could not nd
any; when, upon a uddemit came into my mind, how I had.
haken the hoks of corn out of the bag, and then my admira-
tion cealed, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as thin/ting
it was but natural, and not to be conceived a miracle z though
even the manner of its preervation might have made me own
it as a wonderful event of God's kind Providence.
It was about the latter end of Yune when the ears of this
corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully, together with
20 or 30 alks of rice, expecting one day I hould reap the
fruit of my labour; yet four years were expired before I
could aliow myelf to eat any barley bread, and much longer
time before I had any rice. After this, with indefatigable
pains and indury for three or four mouths, at la I nihed
my cave on the r4th of Aþril, having no way to go into it, but
by a ladder again the wall. .
Aþril 16. I nihed my ladder, and acended it; after pull-
ed it up, then let it dawn on the other de, and decended in-
to my new habitation, where I had pace enough, and o for-
tied that nothing could attack me without icaling the walls.
But what do all human pains and indury avail, if the ble.
ings of God do not crown our labours? Or, who can and
before the Almighty, when he lretcheth forth his arm: For
one time, as I was at the entrance of my cave, there happened
uch a dreadul earthquake, that not only the root of the cave
came crumbling about my ears, but the polls eemed to crack
terribly at the ame time. This made me, in great amaze-
ment, run to my'laddct, and get over the wall : When there,
1 plainly knew it 'vasan earthquake; the place I ood on u-
taining three terrible hocks in les than three minutes. And
when I aw the top oa great rock roll into the ea, then I ex-
pected the iland would be wallowed up every moment : And
dreadful it was to ee the ea thrown into the mot violent agi.
tation and diorder by this tremendous accident.
_ For my part, I ood like a criminal, at the place of execu-
tion, ready to expicre. At the moving of the earth, I was, its
2 it

30
w
it- were, ea ick ; and very much afraid let the rock, under
which was my fgnce and habitation, hould overwhelm me?
and it in a lat' _i"-tomb. _
'When the third dreadful hock had pent itel, my pirits
began' to revive; yet ill [would not venture to acend the
ladder, but continued itting, not knowing what l hould do.
So little grace then I had, only to ay, Lord have mercy upon
me! and no ooner was the earthquake over, but that pathetic
prayer let me.
It was not long after when a horrible tempe aroe, at the
ame time attended with a hurricane of wind. The ea eem-
ed mountains high, and the waves rolled o impetuouly, that
nothing could be perceived but froth and foam. Three hours
did this florin continue, and in' o violent a manner, as to tear
the very trees up by theroots, which was ucceeded by abund-
ance of rain. When this was over, I went to my tent, but the
rain coming again upon me in a itrious manner, obliged me
to take helter in the cave; and then I was forced to cut a
Channel through my fortication to let the water out. It con-
tinued raining all that pight, and ome time the next day :
Yet, no ooner did the weather clear tlp, but I reolved to build
me a little hnt in ome open place, walled round, to defend me
from wild creatures and avages, as not thinking but at the
next earthquake the mountain would tall upon my habitation
and me, and wallow up all in its bowels.
zlpril 19, 20. Thee days 1 pent in contriving how and in
what manner I hould fix my place oabode : All this while I
was under the mo dreadful apprehenions. When l looked
round my habitation, every thing I ound was in its proper

not. At length I reolved to tay where. I was, till I had
ound a convenient place where I might pitch my tent. '

had much refrehed me when I awaked. I fell aleep a
econd time, and fell into this range and terrible ort of
dream.
Methought I was itting on the ame pot of ground,at the
outide of the wall, where I at when the orm blew after
the earthquake; and that I aw a man decending from a
great black cloud, and alight upon the ground. He was all
over as bright as a ah of ire, that a little before urrounded
him; hiscountenance inconceivably terrible; the earth, as
as it were, trembled when he ept upon the ground, and
ahes of re eemed to ll all the air. No ooner I thought
him landed upon the earth, but with a long pear or other
weapon he made towards me; but r aicending a riing
ground, his voice added to my amazement, when I thought
I heard him pronounce thee dreadful words, Unhappy wretcb I
ring all thee thing: battle not brought thee to repentance, thou
halt immediate-A; die. In pronouncing this dreadful entence,
I thought he went to kill me with the pear that was in his
hand.
Any body may think it impoible for me to expres the
horrors of my mind at this viion 5 and even when I awaked,
this very dream made a deep impreon upon my mind.
'The little divine knowledge I had,l received from my father's
inruttions, and that was worn out by an uninterrupted eries
o leaaring impiety, for eight years pace, except what ick-
nes forced from me ; I don't remember I had one thought
of lifting up my heart towards God ; but rather hadva certain
upidity of oul, not having the lea ene'of fear of the om-

tranports of foul I had, which was not through grace, but
only a common flight of joy, that I was yet alive, when my
companions were all drowned : and no other joy could I
conceive but what is common with the ailors over a bowl of
punch, after they have ecaped the greate dangers.
The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor Conveniences
might have called upon me for a thankful acknowledgment to
Providence. Indeed the growth of my corn touched me with

dreadful amazement continued no longer than its duration.
But now, when my pirits began to ink under the burden of
a rong diemper, and I could leiurely view the mieriee
of death preent itelf before my eyes, then my awakened
concience began to reproach me with my pa life, in which
I had o wiekedly provoked the juice of God to pour down
his vengeance upon me.
Such reexions as thee opprelled me even in the violence
of my diiemper. Some rayers I uttered, which only pro-
ceeded from my fear of eath. But when I conidered my ,,
father's advice and prophecy, I could not forbear weeping e

the reach of my bed 5 and to make it more nourihing, and
lesehilly, I put ome ruminto it. The next I did was to

in the intervalagf this operatiomtho'gh my head was gid-

No ooner did I open it,but there appeared to me thee words,

jub 4., This morning I began eriouy to ponder on what
is written in the New-ament, reolving to read a chapter
every morning and night, as long as my thoughts would en-
gage me : But when oon after I et about this work eriou-

my dream revived, All thee things barve not brought 'bee to re-

deed I prayed with a true ene of my condition, and a more
certain hope founded on the word of God: Now I had a dif-

than living among the race of human kind, urrounded with
o much oppreiion, miery and aiction : "And, in a word, I
came to this concluion: That a deliverance from lin, was
a much greater bleng than a deliverance from aiction.
But again I proceed to my journnl. *
To the a4th oj'ugy I walked about with my gun, a little
and a little at a time, having been reduced to the greate ex-
tremity of Weaknes. The application and experiment I ued
were perfectly new ; neither could I recommend it to any
one's practice. For though it carried o the t, it- very much
weakened me ; and I had frequently Convulions in my nerves
and limbs for ome time. From hence I learned, that going
abroad in rainy weather, epecially when it was attended with
orms and hurricanes of wind, was mot pernicious to health.
In thisiland I had been about ten' mouths, *never all the
while having een any human kind, and o accounted myelf
as ole monarch; and, as I grew better, having ecured my
habitation to my' mind, I reolved to make a tour round my
kingdom, in order to make new dtcoveries.
The 15th of Fuly I began my journey. I r went to the
creek, where I had brought my ra'fts on hore; and travelling
farther,found the tide going no higher than two miles up, where
there wasa little brook cf running water, on the ban-its of
which were many pleaant avannas or mead-owe, plain, mooth,
atid covered with gras: On the riing parts, where' [up-
poed the watei'did not reach, I perceived a great deal 'of to-
bacco growing to a very trong (talk : Several other plants l
likewie found, the virtues of which 1 did not undertand. But
a long
a long time [earched 'for the caava root, which I knew the
Indian: in that climate made their bread of, but allin vain.
There were everal platits of aloes, though at that time I knew
not what they were : Likewie >I aw everal ugar cartes, bitt
imperfect for want of cultivation. With thee few dicoveries
l came back that night, and lept contentedly in my little
catlle.
The next day, being the i6th, going the ame way, and
farther than the day betore, I found the country more adorned
with woods and trees. Here I perceived dierent fruits,
which lay in very great abundance. The melons m plenty lay
on the ground; and clutiers of grapes, ripe and very rich,
pread over the trees. You may imagine I was glad of this
dicovery, yet ate very paringly, lel hould throw myelf
into a ux or ever. As for the grapes, l ound them of eg-
cellent ue ; for when I had dried them in the un, which, prie-
erved them as dried raiins are kept, they proved very whole-
ome and nourihing, and erved me in thee caons when no
grapes were to be had:
The night drawing on apace, I acended up a tree, and
lept very comfortably, though it was the r time I had
lain out of my habitation. And when the morning camefl
proceeded with great pleaure on my way travelling about four
miles, as I imagined by the length of the valley, directing my
coure northward, there being a ridge of hills on touth and
north ide of me. At the end of this valley I came to an
opening, where the country eemed to decend to the welt :
There I ound a little pring ot freh water proceeding out of
the ide of a hill, with its chryal reams running directly
cat. And indeed here my enes were charmed with the mo
lovely object nature could aord ; or the country appeared
o ourihing, green and delightul, that to me it eemed like
a planted garden. I then decended on the ide of that deli-
cious vale, wherel found abundance of cocoa, Grange, lemon
and Citron trees, but very wild and barren at that timg :
The juice (If which l afterwards ued to mix in water, which
made it very cool and refrehing. And now, I was reolved
to carry home and lay up a ore o grapes, limes, and lemons,
againt the approaching wet ealon : So laying up in eparate
parcels, and then taking a few of each with me, I returned to
my little eagle, after having pent three days in this journey :
But before I got home, the grapes were o bruied that they

jub' 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither
again ; but to my great urprize found all the grapes pread
about, trod to pieces, and abundance eaten, which made
me, to conclude there were wild creatures thereab'outs. To
D remedy'
remedy this, I gathered alarge quantity of the grapes, and hung
them upon the out branches of the trees, that they might cure
and dry in the un; and- having well loaded mylelf with
limes and lemons, I returned once more to my old place of
reidence.
And now it was, that c. ntemplating on the ruitfulnes of
the valley, the pleaantne s othe ituation, the ecurity from
lorms 'on that ide the water, and the deligntnlnes ofan ad-
jacent wood 3 I concluded I was ettled in the wor part of
the country, therefore was thinking to remove my habitation.
But when I conidered again, that though it was pleaant it
was not by the ea ide, where there was a poibility, ome
time or other, a hip might either be driven to, or fail by that
coa : and that to encloe myelamong hills and woods mnit
certainly frurate all hopes of a deliverance ; I reliolved to
let my calle remain where Providence had r agned it.
Yet, o ravihed was I with this place, that I made me a little
kind of bower, urrounding it at a ditance with a double
hedge, as high as l could reach, well ak'ed and lled with
bulrufhes, and having pent a great part of the month of
joly, I think it was the r of Augu before 1 began to enjoy
my labour.

dog. 14.. It began to rain this day ; and thoughl had made
me atent like the other, yet having no helter of a hill to
keep metrom orms', nor a cave behind me to retreat to, I
was obliged to retreat to my old cale. Still the rain
continued more or 'les every day till the middle of October ;
and ometimes o violently, that Ipcould not llir out of my.
cave for everal days. This eaon I ound my family to
increae; for one of my Cats that ran away from me, and
whom I thought had been dead, returned about Auga, with
three kittens at her heels, like herlel, which I thought range,
becaue both my eats were fema'es, and the wild cats of the
iand eemed to be oa dierent kind from our European eats ;
but from thee cats proceeded uch numbers, that I was forced
to kill and deroy them as I would do wild beais or vermin.
To the 26th of this month I could not ir out, it taining in-
ceantly ; when beginning to want food, I was compelled to
venture twice, the firt of which 'I hot a goat, and after found
a very large tortoiie. The manner of rcgulating my hood
was thus: A bunch of raiins erved me for breaka z a
piece of goat's efh or turtle broiled for my dinner ; and
two or three turtle's eggs for my upper. While the rain
laed, I daily worked two or three hours at cnlarging my cave,
' and
and by degrees worked it on towards one ide till I came to
the out ide of the hill, and made a door or way out, which
came beyond my tence or wall, and o I came in and out thiis
way. BUJMF'CI" 1 had done this, I was troubled to ee my
elf thus expoed, though I could not perceive any thing to
fear, agoat being the bigge creature I had teen upon thss
jand. - -
Sept. 30. Caing up my notches on my pohwhieh amounting
to 355, I concluded this to be the anniverlary of my landing;
and therefore humbly proratmg mylel on the ground, con-
teng my ins, acknowledging God's, righteousjudgmehts up-
on me, and praying to j/ur Chri to have mercy on me, I faed
for twelve h0urs,till the going down othe on; and then eating
a bicuit and a bunch ofgrapesdaid me onthe bed, and with great,
comfort took myunight's repoe. Till this time having no tene
of religion, I never dltlmguthed the Sabbatb-a'ay ; but now
I made a longer notch than ordinary for the dajrof rect, and
divided the Weeks as well as I could, though I found I had
lo a day or two in my account. Soon after. my inlt trailing,
I omitted a daily memorandum of indierent' thtngs, and con-
tented myelt to write down only the mo remarkable events
ofmy life. The rainy and dry (reaons appeared now regular
to me, and experience taught me how to provide for them z
yet, in onethtng-l am, going to telate, my experience very
much failed me. You may call to mind what I have men-
tioned of ome barley and rice which I had aved Labout thin;-
ty alks of the former, and twenty of the latter ; and at that
time the un being in its louthem poition going from me,
together withthe ratus, made me conclude it a very proper eat-
fon to tow it. Azrcordingly, 1 dug up a piece of ground with
any wooden pade, and dividing it in two parts, awed: about
two thirds of my feed, preerving by me: about a handful
of each. And happy itwas I did o, for no rain falling, it was
choaked up, and never appeared above theearth till the wet
eaton came again, and then it-grew as if it had been newl
own.
I was reolved till to make another trial ; and eeking for
a moiter piece of ground near my bower, there I (owed the
re of my feed in Februmjy, a little before the vernal eqtu'v
nox, which having the rainy mouths ofþ [March and Aþril to
water it, yielded anoble crop, and prung up very pleaant:-

all ; and my crop amounted to above halfa peck-of each fort.

As the winds happened to blow, o the 'wet eaon' would

But ill I wanted two neceary things ;. I had not any calle

Neither had I a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle,

to ee the whole iland ; accordingly, taking my dog, gun,
haiehet, two bilcuit cakes, a great bunch of raiins, with a
larger quantity of powder and hot than uual, I began my
journey. And having paed the vale where my bower ood,
I came within view of the ea, lying to the well, when it be-
ing a clear day, I fairly decried land, but could not ay whe-
ther it was an iland or aeontinent : It extended from the W'.
to the W. S. VV. about ten or fteen leagues, as I concluded.
Neither could I tell what place this might be, only thought it
was part of America, and where I might have been in a mier-
able condition hadl landed. Again, I conidered, that if
this was the Spanih coa, certainly one time or other I hould
ee ome hip pas by ; and if it was not, then it mu be the
iavage wall, between the Spanih country and. Bmil, which

As I proceeded forward, I found this ide of theilland much
more pleaant than mine, the elds ragrant, and adorned with

Now though this journey producedthe mo pleaing atis-
action, yet my habitation was o natural to me, that I did
not repine at my being eated on the wor part of the iiland 2
And o travelling about 12 miles towards the Ea, I et a
great pile on the hore for a mark, concluding that my next
journey hould be on the other ide of the iiand, ea from
my calle, and o round till I came to my pott again. How-
ever I took another way back, thinking l could not mis by
having a conllant view ofthe country 5 but carcely had I trav-
elled three miles, when I dccended into a very large valley,
o urrounded with hills that were covered with wood, that
I had no guide but by the un, nor even then, unles I knew
well the poition of the un at that time of day. What added
to my misfortune was, the weather proved o hazy, for three
or four days, as to oblige me to return to my pot by the
ea ide, and o backward the ame way I came. My dog ur-
prized a kid in this journey, and would have killed it, had I
not prevented him. I had often been muing, whether I could-
not geta kid or two, and o raie a breed of tame gears to upply
me after my ammunition was pent. Upon which, I made a
collar for this little creature, with a ring made of rope yarn,
which I always carried about with me z and when I came to
my bower, there [incloed and let him, and after: a month's-
time in thisjourney I came home to my old habitation.
Nobody can uppoe otherwie, but that I had a pleaing at-
isaction, when I returned to my little cale, and repoed myelf
in my hammock. After this journey I reted myelf a week,
and the principal concern I then had, was, to make a cage for
my pretty Poll. And then I began to conider the poor kid I
had Eft at my bower; and immediately I went to fetch it
home. When] came there, I found the young creature al-
mot arved ; when eeding it with branches of uch hrubs
as l could find, l tied it as before ; but there was no occaion,
for it followed me like a dog ; and as I conantly fed it, be-
came oloving, gentle and fond, that it commenced one of my
domeics, and would never leave me. '

ared with that accured manner olivingl tormerly ued,
whileeithe-rl was hunting or viewing the country, the an-
guih ofmy foul would break out upon me _on a udden, and
my very heart would ink within me, to think of the woods,
the mountains, the deartsl was in ; and how I was a prit'oner,
liieked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an
uninhabited wildernes, without hopes and Without rcdemp-
tion. And in this condition, [would often wring my hands
and weep like a child : Even in the middie of my work, 'this
t would take me; and then I would immediately it down
and igh, looking on the ground for an hour or two together,
till uch time as my grief would be vented, by buring out in-
to melting tears.
As one morning I was uddenly pondering in my mind, I
opened my Bible, when immediately [xed my eyes upon-
thee words, I will newer leave 'bee nor fbrake time! Surely,
thought I, thee words are directed to me z or ele, why hould
they appear ju at a moment when I am bemoaning my or-
lorn condition P And if God does not orak'e me, what mat-
ters it, ince he can make me more happy in this ate of life
than if I enjoyed the greate plendour in the world 2 But
while I was going to return God thanks for my preent ate,
omething eemed to hock my mind, as if it had thus aid, Un-
worthy wretch! can you pretend to be thankul for a condiu
tion, from which you would pray to he delivered? Here I-
opt. And though I could not ay, I thanked the Divine
Majey for being there, yet I gave God thanks for placing to
my view my former wicked coure of life, and granting me a
true knowledge of repentance : And. whenever I opened or
hut the Bible, I blek kind Providence that directed my goods-
without my order, and for aing me to, ave them from
the power of the raging ocean.
And now begin-ning my third year, my everal daily em-
ployments were thee : Fz'i, My duty to heaven, andxdiligent-
ly reading the Holy Scriptures, which I did twice or thrice
every day. Second] , Seeking provion with my gun, which
commonly took me tip, when it didnot rain, threehours every
morning. Tbirdly, The ordering, curing, preerving, and
Looking what I had killed or catched for my upply, which
took me upa great part of the day : And in the middle of the
day, the on being in it heighth, it was o hot that I couldnot

my

my. want o tools, help, and ltill, walled a great deal of time;
for I was two and forty days making a board t ot a long
helf; whereas, two lawyers, with their tools and aw pit,
would have cut everal out of the ame tree in liaif a day ; but
this was the cae, it was to be a iarge tree, becaue my, board
was to be broad z I was three days icutting it down, and two
morein lopping o the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of
timber; this I hack'd and hew'd o each ide till it became
light to move , then I turned it, made one ide of it mooth-
and at as a board, from end to end, then turned it down.

bout three inches thick, and mooth on both ides. Any body.
may judge my great labour and atigue in uch a piece of wo. k ;.
but this I went through with patience, as alio many other
things that my circumances made neceary for me to do.
But now came my harve mouths, Noe-embar- and December,
in which I had the plealing propect of a very good crop ; But
uch was my misfortune, that the goats and hares having once
taied of the weetnes othe blade, kept it o hort, that it had
not rength to hoot up into a alk : To prevent which, Iien-
cloed it with a hedge, and by day, hot ome oits devourers 3.
and my dog, which I had tied to the eld gatqkeepins bark,-
ing all night, frightened the creatures away.
No ooner did I get rid of thee, but other enemies appear-
ed ; whole ocks of everal orts of birds, whoonly waited till
my back was turned to ruin me. So much did this provoke
me, that I let y, and killed three of the maleiactors 5 and af-
terwards, erving them as they do notorious thieves in England,
hung, them up in chains as a terror to others. And indeed o
good an eect had this, that they not onlyv forook the corn,
but all that part of the iand, o long as thee crimmals hung
there.
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end o December,
which was my econdharvet of the year, I reaped it with a
cythe made of one of my broad words. I had, no great fa-
tigue in cutting down my r crop, it was o lender ; the ear-s
of which l carried home in a baket, rubbing it out with my
hands inead of thrahing it ; and when my harve was over,
1 found my half peck of leed had produced near two buhela
of rice, and two buhels and a halk of barley. Andnowl
plainly foreaw. that, by God's goodnes, 1 hould be furnihed
with bread 5, but yet l was concerned,.becaue I, knew not how
to. grind or make meal of my. corn z nor bread, neither knew
how to bake it. Upon thee coniderations, l would not tale
any of the crop, hnt preerve it again the next eaon, and in
the mean while ue my bet endeavours to provide myel with.
nateriais to. make bread. * .
But.
45
But where were my labours to end ? The want of a plough
to torn up the earth, or hovel to dig it, I conquered, by make-
ing me a wooden pade after a wooden manner: The want of
a harrow, I u'pplied myel, by dragging over the cdrn a great
bough of a iree: Whenkit was growing or fully ripe, I was
forced to'fencev it, mow it, carry it home, thrah it, part it
from the cha, 'and ave it : And after all this, I wanted a
mill to grind it, ieves to dres it, yea and alt to make it in-
to bread, and an oven to bake it. This et my brains on
work to find ome expedient for every one of thee necearies
again the next harvel. -
And now, having more ced, my firt care was to prepare
me more land. I pitched upon two large at pieces of ground
near my calle, for that purpoe, in which I owed my eed,
and enced it with a good hedge, which took me up three
months,by which time it was the wet teaon. While the rain
kept me within doors, I ound everal occaions to employ
myelf ; and while at work ued to divert myel with talking
to my parrot, learning him to know and peak his own name,
POLL, the t t welcome word 1 ever heard poke on the i-
lland. I had been along time contriving how to make earthen
Veels, which I wanted extremely ; and when I conidered the
heat of the climate, I did not doubt but, if I could nd any
proper Clay, I might botch up a pot, rong enough, when dri-
ed in the lun, to bear handling, and to hold any thing that
was dry z as corn, meal, and other things. t-
To be hort, the clay I ound ; but it would occaion the
mo erious peron to mile to ee what aukward waysI took,
and what ugly mihapen things I made; how many either fell
out or crack'd by the violent heat of un, and tell in pieces
when they were removed : So that I think it was two months
time before I could perfect any thing; and after this great ai-
tigue, made two clumly things in imitation of earthen jars.
Thee, however, I very gently placed in wicker bacets, made
on purpoe lor them, and between the pot and the bakets,
ued it full of rice and barley raw 3 and thee I preumed
would hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal when the
corn was bruied. But as for maller things, I made them
with better ucces, which the un baked very hard, uch as
little round pots, at dihes, pitchers, and pipkins. "
Yet lill I wanted one thing abolutely neceary, and that
was an earthen pot, not only to hold any liquid thing, but to
bear the re, which none of thee could do. It once 'happen-
ed, that as I was putting out my re, I found thereina broken
piece o one of my Veels, burnt hard as a rock, and red as'a
tile. _This made me'contrivehow to order my re, o aseto
make it burn ome pots; and having no notion ot a kilngor
'fglazing them with lead, I xed three large pipkins, and two
Of
"46
or three pots, in a pile one upon another. The re I plied
round the outide and on the top with dry wood, till I faw the
pots in the inide red hot, and found that they did not crack
at all ; and when I perceived them perfectiy red, I let one of
them tand in the ne about ve or ix hours, tii] the Clay
melted by the extremity of the heat, and would have run to
glas, had I uered it; upon which, I (lae (ed mv ize by de-
grees, till the rednes abated ; and watching them tiil the
morning, I ound I had three very good pipkins, and two
earthen pots, as welt burnt and t for my turn as l could de-
re.
No joy Can be greater than mine a? this dicovery : For a-
ter this, I may ay, I wanted for no ort of earthen wate. ii I
iied one of my pipkins with water to boil me ome meat,
which it did adtnirabiy well, and with a piece of kid 1 made
me ome good broth, as weii as my circumances would af-
ford' me at that time.
The next concern A' had, was, to make me a tone mortar. to
beat ome corn in, inead of a mill to grind it. Here indeed
I was at a great ios, as not being t for a one cutter; atid
many days I pent to find out a great tone big enough to cut
holiow and make t for a mortar, and trong enough to bear
the weight: of a peile, as would break the corn without lling it
with and : 'But aii the ones of the Zand being of avmouidg
sting n . V exendered my earchvfruittetsz and then I reolv-
ed to Ioo ® a great black of'hard wood ;, which having oon
found, I zmed with my a_xe and hammer, and then with in-
nite labour made a hollow place in it, ju as the. Indian: of
Bmil make their 'carter-r. When I had nihed this, I made a
great pee of iron wood, which I had formerly laid. upagain
my ucceed-ing harve.
My next buines was to make me a ieve, to-it mv mea),
and part it from the bran and the hutk. Having no ne thin
canvastu earch thr meal through, I could not tell what to
do; what Linen l. had was reduced to rags : [had gous' hair
enough, but neither tools to work it, not did I know how: to
Foin it : At. length, I remembered I had. ome neckcioths of
caiiico, or muhn, of the fail-ers, which I hadyþrought out of
the hip, and with thee I made three mall ieves, proper e-
nough for the work. V
And now [come to conider the baking part in coure.
The want of an Oven I uppiied by making ome earthen 'pans
very broad but not deep. 'When I had a mind to bake, I
made a great re upon my hearth, the tiles of which I had
made myelf, and when the wood was burnt into live coals, I
pread them all over it, till it became very hot; then weeping
them away, 1 et down my loaves, and wheiming down the
earthen pots upon them, drew the ahes and coals all artgund
I C-

the outide of the pots to continue the heat : And in this man-
ner I med to bake my barley loaves, as well as if] had been a
complete pary cook, making myt'elt' of the rice everal cakes
and puddings.
It is no wonder that all thee things took me up the be
part of a year, ince what intermediate time I had, was beow-
ed in managing my new harvett and ht-handryz for in the
proper t'eaton I 'eaped my corn, carried it home, and laid it up
in the ear in my large balkets, till I had time to rub, inead of
thrahtng it. And now indeed my corn increaed o much,
that it produced me about twenty bnhels of barley, and as
much of rice, that I not only began to ue it freely, but was
thinking how to enlarge mv barns, and was reolved to' ow o
much at'a time as would be ucient tor me a whole year.
All this while the propec't of' land, which I had een from
the other ide of the iand, ran in my mind. 1 ill meditated
a deliverance from this place, though the fear of greater-mi-
fortnnes might have deterred me from it : For after I had at-
tained that place, I run the hazard of being killed and eaten
by the devouring cannibals; and 'e not o, yet I
might be flain, as other Europeamhadctz? ein; '*'_feil into their
hands. Notwithanding all this, mygithoux '



_ In continually
upon my acquiring that ihore: And nowl wanted my boy
Xury, and the long boat, with the houlder of mntton ail.
Then I went the hsp's boat that had been cat a great way on
the hore in the late orm. She was bu'ta little removed;
but her bottom was turned up by the impetuoity and fury ofthe
waves and wind. With all the rength l had, I tried whatever
I could do, with levers and rollers I had ent from the wood, to
turn her, and repair the damages he had inamed. This
wotk took me up three or four weeks, when nding my little
rength all in vain, I fell to undermimng it, by digging away
the and, and to make it fail down, etting pieces of wood to
thru and guide it inthe fall. But after this was done, una-
bt'e was 1 to ir it up again, or to get under it, much les to
move it forward towards the water, and o I was forced to
give it over. *
Not conten with this-diappointment, I began to think
whether it wer ot poiible for me to make a canoe or peri-
agna, uch as the Indian: make of the ttunk of a tree ; but
heel iay under particular inconveniences; want of tools to
make it, and want of hands to m-Jve it to the water when it was
made. However, to workI went upon it, opping all the
enquiries I could make, with this very imple anwer I made
to myelf, let's-r make it, I'll warrant I'll nd ome way or
other to get it along when it is done.
_I ri cut down a cedar tree, which was ve feet ten inches
dtameter at the lower part next the ump, and our feet ellcve
me ies

inches diameter at the end of twenty two feet, after which it
leened for a pace, and then parted into branches. Twenty
days was I hacking and hewing this tree at the bottom, tour-
teen more in cutting o the branches and limbs, and a whole
month in haping it like the bottom ofa boat; as for the in-
ide, I was three weeks with a maiiet and chiel, clearing it in
uch a manner as that it was big enough to carry twenty ix
men, much bigger than any canoe l aw in my lite, and
contequentlv ucient to tranfport me and all my eects to
that withed for hore I o ardently deired.
Nothing remained now, but indeed the greate diculty,
to get it into the water, it lying about IOO yards from it. To
remedy the r inconvenience, which was a riing hilt between
this boat and the creek, with wonderful pains and labour I
dug into the urface of the earth, and made a declivity. But
when this was done, all the rength I had was as inucient
to move it, as it was when I attempted to move the boat.
Then I proceeded to meaure the diance of ground, reolving
to maken canal, in order to bring the water to the canoe,
ince/I could not bring the canoe to the water. But as this
eemed to be impracticable to myelf alone, under the pace
of eleven or twelve years, it brought me into ome ort of
conideration, that I concluded it impoible to be done, and
o this attempt was in vain alo. And now I aw, and not be.
fore, what iupidity it is to begin a work before we reckon its
cots, or judge right of our own abilities to go through with
its performance. . * t
It wasin the heighth of this work, my fourth year expired,
ince I was ca on this iand ; and then I did not forget my
anniverary, but kept it with the ame ardent devotion I had
done before. But now my hopes being frurated, I looked
upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do with ; and ve-
ry well might I ay, as father Abraham unto Dives, Between
me and time there z's a gulf ixed. And indeed from the world I
was eparated, from its wickednes too, having neither the lu
ofthe eh, the lui of the eye, or the pride of life: l had
nothing to covet ; being lord, king, or emperor over the
whole country l had in poeion, without dipute, and with-
out control. I had loadings of corn, plenty of turtles, tim-
ber in abundance, and grapes above meaure z but after l was
erved, what was all the re to me? The money I had by me
lay as depicable dres, which I would freely have given fora
gros of tobacco pipes, or a hand mill to grind my corn: In a
word, the nature and experience of thee things dictated to me
this ju reection, that the good things of this world are no
farther good to us than they are for our ue; and that what-
ever we may heap up to give others, we can but enjoy as much
"as we ue, and no more.
Thee
_---"
Thee thoughts rendered' my mind more eay than uual,
Every time I tat down to eat, I d'tdit with thankfulnes; ad-
uniting the providential hand of God, that in this wildernes
had pread this table to me. And now I conidered wh at I
enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; 'compared my preent
condition with what I at r expected it hould be; how l
hould have done, if I had got nothing out of the hip ; that [
mu have perihed before I had caught h or tu'rtles; or liv-
ed, had l found them, like a mere avage, by eating them raw,
and pulling them in pieces with my Claws, like a bea. 4 I
next compared my ation to that which I deerved; how un;
dutiful I had been to my Parents, how deitute othe fear of
God; how void ol every thing that was good; and how un-
grateful for thoe abundant mercies I had received from heav-
en ; being ed, as it were, by a miracle, even as great Elzjab':
being fed by ravens 3 and ca on a place where there was no
venomous creature to poion or devour me z ln hort, making
God's tender mercies matter of great conolation, I relinquih.
ed all adnes, and gave way to contentment.
As long as my ink continued, which, with water, I made la
as long as Icould, I ued to minute down the days of the
month on which any remarkable thing happened. And,
Fir, I oberved, That the ame day I forook my Parents
and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go to ea, the ame
day afterward, in the next year, I was taken' and maden Have
by the Salr'ee rover.
The very dayl ecaped out of the wreck of the hip in Yar-
moutb roads, a y-ear after, on the ame day, I made my ecape
from Salfee, in my patron's hing boat. -
The 30th of September, being the day of' the year I was born
on, on that day twenty tix years alter, I was miraculouiy tav-
ed, and ca on fhore on thisand.
The next thing that waed, after myink, was the bicuit
which l had brought out of th'e hip: And though I allowed
mylelf but one cake a day, for above a twelvemonth, yet I was
quite out of bread for near a year before [got anycoirn ol my
own. -
In the next place, my clothes began to det-ay, And my line'
'had been gone long before; however, Ihad preerved about
three dozen of the ailors' check thirds, which proved a
great refrehment to me, when the violent beams of theim
would not uer me to bear any of the teamens' heavy watch
'coammhich mace-me turn taylor, and, after a mierablezbotch-
ing manner, convert- them into jackets. 'To * preerve my
head, I made me a cap of goat kin, with thezhair outwards, 'to
keep out the-rain z which indeed-erved me o well, that] at'-
terwards made me a waiicoat and open k-nee'd breet hes of the
tame z And then I cgntrived a ort of an umbreila, covering
it
50
it with lkins, which not only kept out the heat of' the tun, but
the rain alo. Thus being eay and ettled in my mind, my
chiefe happines was to convere with God, in mo heavenly
and comfortable ejaculations.
For ve- years after this I cannot ay any extraordinary
thing accosted to me. My chief employment was to cure my
raims, and plant my barley and rice, of both which I had a
year's prroviion beforehand. But though I was (lit-appointed
in my r canne, I made it, at intermediate times, my buines
to make a econd, of much inferior ize ; and it was two years
before I nihed it. But as l perceived it would no ways an-
'iiwer my deign of ailing tp'the other hore, my thoughts were
\

confined to take a tour, round the iand, to ee what further
dicoverjesl could make. To this intent, after having moved
her to the water, and tried how he would fail, I tted up a
little malt to her, and made a fail of the hip's fail that lay by
me. I then made lockers or boxes at the end ot it, to put in
neceary proviions and amnzunition, which would preerve
them dry either from rain, or the pray ot the ea; and in the
inide of the boat I eat along hollow place to lay my gun,
and to keep it dr'y, made aagzto hang over it ; my umhrella I
xed in 'a ep in'the ern like a malt, to keep the heat of the
on o me : And now, reolving to ee the Circumference of
my little kingdom, I victoalled my hip for the voyage, put-
ting in two dozen of my barleyihread loaves, an earthen pot
full of ziarched rite, a little bottle of rum, half a goat,_powder
and hot, and two watch Coats. It was the 6th of Name/near, m
the 6th year of myreign, or captivity, that I et out in this
voyage, which ctw'as' much longer than I- expected, being oblig.
ed to put forther out, by reaon of the tocks that lay a great
way in" the ea: And indeed o much did thee rocks'urprie
me, th'at "I" was for putting back; fearing, that if I ventured
further it would be out of my pot-ver to return." In this con-
ftlion I came to an anchor jut o hare, to which I waded
with my gun on my houider, and then, climbing up an hill,
which exact-looked that point, I aw the full extent of, it, and
preolved to run all, hazard. , . -
Iri this propect from 'the hill, I perceived a violent furrent
'running to the ea, coming very cloe to the point z which I
'he more carefully. oberved, thinking it dangerous, and that,
when I came to it, I, might-be droye into the ea by its force,
and not able to return to the iand; and certainly it mu
have been: o, had I not made this obervation'; fopztonthe
otherde was the like current, with' this dierence, that it et:
uat a greaterdinnce; when, I perceived there was a rong'
' eddy un'de'r' the land, Io that myehicfet buines was to work
out oft the r current, and conveniently get into an eddy.
Turn dey' I uid here, the wind blowing very br-iz'y E. S. E,

which, being' contrary to the current, leaves a great breach oii
the ea upon the point; o it was not t for me to keep too
near the there, upon account of the breach 5 nor to and at
too great diance, for fear of the reamsi That night the
wind' abating, it grew o calm that I' ventured out ; but urely
_I was to be a memento to all rah and ignorant pilots : For I
was no ooner come to the point, andnot above the boat's
length from the hore, but I was got into a deep water, with a
current like a mill, which drove myhoat along o violently,
that it was impoible for me to keep her o much as to the
edge of it ; but it forced me more and more out from the eddy
to the left of me, and all I could do with my paddles was ue-
les, there being no wind to help me.
Alas! now l began to think myel quite lo; ince, as the
current ran on both ides of the iland, l was'very certain they
mujoin again, and then I had no hopesxbut of perihing ot'
want, in the ea, after what proviions I had was pent, or be-
ore, if a orm hould happen to arie.
. W'ho can conceive the preent anguih of my mind at this
calamity ? YVith longing eyes did I look upon my little king-
dom, and thought the iiand the pleaante place in the uni-
vere. Happy, thrice happy deart, aid I, hall l never ee
thee more? W'rctched creature! whither am Igoing? Why
did I murmur at my loneome condition, when now I would
give the whole world to be there again? While 'I was thus
contemplating, I found myel to be driven about two leagues
into the ea ; however, I laboured till my rength was pent,
to keep my boat as far north as poibly I could, to that ide of
the current where the eddy lay on. About noon, I perceiv-
ed a little breeze of wind pring up from the S. S'. E. which
overjoyed my heart the more, when, in about half aiu hour, it
blew a gentle ne gale. Had any thick weather prung up, I

had been lo another way ; for having no compas on board,_
I hould never haveound the way to eer towards the iland,
ifonce it had diappeared ; but it proving the contrary, I et:
up my ma again, pread my ail and ood away northward,
as much as I could, to get rid of the current : And no ooner
did the boat begin to retch away, but I perceived by the
clearneis of the water, a change oflthe current was near ; for
where it was clear, the current abated. Tothe eath] oon
aw, about half a mile, abreach of the ea upon ome tocks,
which caued it again to eparate ; and as the main force drove
away more touthwardly, leaving the rocks to the north ea, o
the other came back by the repule of the tocks, mak-ing a
harp eddy, which returned back again to the north we with
a very wift ream. _ v- '
They who have experienced what it is to be reprievw 'upon
the ladder,,or _to he aved from t'hievesjuft going to meeke-'ay

52
their lives, or ele uch who have been in the like Calamities,
may gues my preent exces of joy 5 how heartily I run my-
boat into the ream of this eddy, and how joylully l pread
my ail tothe rerehing wind, anding cheerully before it
with a mart tide under foot. By the aance of this eddy, l
was carried abovea league home again, when being in the
'wake of the iland, betwixt the two currents, I found the wa-
ter to be at a fort of a and. About four o'clock in the af-
ternoon I reaehed within a league o the iiland, and perceived
the points of the rock, which caued this dilaer, retching
out as I oberved before, to the outhward, which, throwing
o the current more outhwardly, had occaioned another ed--
dy to the north. But having a fair brik gale, I retched a-
cros this eddy, and in an hour came withina mile of the
iore, where I oon landed to my unlpeakable comfort z And
after an humble proration, thanking God for my deliverance,
with a reolution to leave all thoughts of ecaping aide, I
brought my boat ae into a little cove, and laid me down to
take a welcome repoe. When I awoke, I was conidering
how I might get my boat home; and coaiing along the there,
I came to a good bay, which ran up to a Fivulet or brook,
where nding a ae harbour, I flowed her as afe as if the had
been in a dry dock made on purpoe for her.
And now I perceived myelf not far from the place where
before I had travelled on foot ; when taking nothing uithrme
except my gun and umbrella, I began my journey, and in the
evening came to my bower, wherel again laid me down to
ret. But it was not long before I was awakened, in great ur-
rie, by a range voice that called me everal times, Robin,
Heav'n, Robin Craoe, Poor Robin! Were are you, Robin Crahe ?

several times, being terribly arighted, I arted up in the ut-
mo Confuion, when no ooner were my eyes fully open, but
3 beheld my pretty Fall itting on the top of the hedge, and
oon knew tlrat it was he that called me; forju in uch be-
wailing language I ued to talk and teach him, which he o ex-

to be the parrot, it was a great while before I could adju my-

that he hould x about that place, and no where ele. When
I was aured it could be no other than my hone Fell, my

thumb, as he was wont, conantly prating to me, with Poor
Robin/on Cruoe, and Halw did I came bare? and Where bad I

him home alongr with me: '
Now though I was ntctty well cured of my rambling to ea
again, yet I could wih my boat. which had co me o much
trouble and pains, on this ide the iland once more, which in-
deed was impracticable. And o i led a very retired life, living
near a twelvemonth, in a very contented manner, wanting for
nothing except converation. As to mechanic labours, whichv
my neceities obliged me to, I fancied I'could, upon occaion,
False a tolerable carpenter, were the tools I had to work
withal but good. Beides, as I improved in my earthen ware,
I contrived to make them with a wheel, which I found much
eaier and better; making my work hapeable, which before
was rude and ugly. 'But I think I was never o elevated with
my own performance, or project, as for being able to make a
tobacco pipe; which though it proved an aukward, clumy
thing, yet it was very ound, and carried the moke perfectly
well, to my great atlislaction.
Alo I improved my wicker ware, making me abundance of
neceary bakets, which though not very handome, were very
handy and convenient to fetch things home in, as alo for holda
ing my ores, barley, rice, and other proviions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me examine at'et; what
manner 1 hould lcill the goats or birds to live on, after it was
all gone. Upon which I contrived many ways to ennare the
goats, and ee if I could catch them alive, particularly a he
goat with young. At la 1 had my deire; formaking pit-
falls and traps, bated with barley and rice, I found one morn..
ing in one of them an old he gnat, and in the other three kids,
one mal-e, the other two females.
So boilerous was the old one, that I could not bring him a-
waY. But I forgot the proverb, That hunger will tame a lion :
For had I kept him three or four days without victuals, and
then given him ome water with a little corn, he would have
been as tame as a young kid. The other creatures I hound
with trings together. But' I had great diculty before r
could bring them to my habitation. lt was ome time before,
they would feed, when throwing them ome corn, it o much'
tempted them, that they began to be tame ; from hence I con-
cluded that if Ideigned to furnih myelf with gonteh
when my ammunvition was pent, the tamely breeding them up
like a ock of heep about my ettlcment, was the only meth-'
od I could take. I concluded alo, I mu eparate the wild
from the tame, or ele they would always run wild as they
I?" up; and the bell. way for this was to have ome encloed
E a ' ' piece
54
piece of ground, well enced, either with hedge or pale, to
keep them o eectually, that thoe within might not breaÞ:
out, or thoe without break in. Such an undertaking was
very great for one pair of hands ; but as there was an abolute
neceity for doing it, my r care was, to nd a convenient
piece ofground where there was likely to be herbage for them
to eat, water to drink, and cover to keep them from the un.
But here I began madly, pitching upon a piece ol meadow
land o large, that had I encloed it with innite pains, this
hedge or pale mu have been at lea two miles about. In-
deed had it been ten miles I had time enough to do it in ; but
then I did not conider that my goals would be as wild in lo
much compas, asif they had had the whole iand, and cone-
quently as dicult for me to catch them. And this thought
came into my head, after I had carried on, I believe, about
fty yards; when I reolved to encloe a piece of ground no
yards in length and too in breadth, ucient enough for as
many as would maintain me, till uch time as my ock en-
creaed, and then I could add more ground. Upon which, I
vigotoullxy prolecuted my work, and it took me about three
mouths in hedging the r piece ; in which time I tethered
the three kids in the be part of it, feeding them as near me as
poible to make them familiar: and indeed very often would
I carry ome ears of barley, or ahandful of riee, and feed
them out of my hand z by which means they grew l'o tame,
that when my enclolure was nihed, and I had let them looe,
they would run after me for an handful of corn. This indeed
anl'wered my end; and in a year and a half's time I had a
ock of about twelve goats, kids and all z and in twg years
after, they amounted to three and forty, beides what I had
taken and killed for my uenance. After this, I encloed
five everal pieces of ground to feed them in, with. as ta-
drive them into, that I might take them as I had oeca i'"_ .
But ill I had additional bleiings, not only in having plen-
ly of goats' eh, but milk too, which in my beginning' 1 did
not o much as think of: And indeed, thoughl had_oever
milked a cow, much les a goat, or een butter or cheele made,
yet, after ome eays and micarriages, I made me both, and
never afterwards wanted.

if I pleaed, I could either hang, draw, quarter, give liberty,
or take it away. When I dined, I eemed a King, eating
alone, none daring prefume to do o till 1. had done. Poll, as
il he had been my principal court favourite, was the only per-
on permitted to talk with me. My old but faithful dog,
now grown exceeding crazy, and had ound no pecies 'to
multiply his kind upon, continually fat at my right hand;
while my two Cats at on each ide of the table, expecting a
bitrom my hand, as a principal mark of my royal favour.
Yet thee were not the Cats I had brought from the hip z they
had been dead long before, and interrcd near my habitation
by mine own hand : But one of them, as 1 uppoe, generat-
ing with a wild cat, thee were the couplel had made tame 5
whereas the re run into the woods, and grew o impudent as
to return and plunder me of my ores, till uch time as I that:
a great many, and the re left me with this attendance. And
in this very plentiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing
but eonveration. One thing more indeed concerned me,
the want o! my boat. I knew not which way to get her round
the iland. I reolved one time to go along the there by land
to her , but had any one in England met uch a gure, is
would either aright them, or make them bur into laughter :-.
Nay, myelf could not but mile at my habit, which 1 think,
in this place, it is very proper to decribe.
The cap l had upon my head was great, high, and hapeles,
made of a goat -tin, with a ap or penthoue hanging down
behind, not only to keep the un from me, but to (hook the
rain o from running into my neck, nothing being more per-
nicioua than the rain falling upon the lieth in thee parts. I
had a hortjacket ofgoat kin, whoe hair hung down uch
a length on either ide, that it reached down the calves o my
legs. As for hoes and ockings I had none, but made a re-
emblance of omething, I know not what to call them ; they
were made like bnfkins, and laced on the ides like patter-
dahes, barbarouly haped, like the re of my habit. 1 had
on me a broad belt of goat [kin dried, girt round with a cou-
ple of thongs inead of buekles ; on each of which, to up-
ply the deciency of word and dagger, hung my hatchet and
aw. I had another belt, not o broad, yet faened in the
ame manner, which hung over my houlder; and at the end
of_it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, made alo of goat
ikunto hold my powder and hot. My bafket I carried on my
back. and my gun on my houlder, and over my head a great
clumiy ugly goat tin umbrella, which, however, next my gun-
was the mo neceary thing about me. As for my face, the
colour was not o warthy as the mulattoes, as might be ex.
pected fromueha peron as I, who took o little care ot itin a
elanate within nine or ten degrees from the eqoator. At one
ltm

time my beard grew o long, that it hung down above a quar-
ter of a yard ; but as! had both razors and lciars in ttore,
I cut it all o, and uered none to grow except a large pair of
Mabometan whikers, the like of which I had een worn by
ferne Turks at See/Ire, not long enough to hang a hat upon, but
of tucfn a montrous ize, as would have amazed any in Eng-
[and to have een.
But all this was of no conequence here, there being none
to oberve my behavicur or habit. And o without fear, and
without control,l proceeded on my journey, the proecution of
which took me up ve or ix days. I r travelled along the
Iea hore, directly to the place where] r brought my boat to
an anchor, to get upon the tocks. But now, having no boat
to take care of, lwent over the land a nearer way, to the
ame heighth that I was upon before 5 when looking forward
to the point of the rock which lay out, and which 1 was forc-
ed to double with my boat, I was amazed to ee the ea o
mooth and quiet, there being no ripling, motion, or current,
any more than in other places : Which made me indeed pon-
der ome time to imagine the reaon of it, when at la I was
convinced how it was, which was this; the ebb etting from'
the well, and joining with the currents-of waters from ome
great rivers on the hare, molt be the occaion ofthee rapid
Ilreams ; and that conequently as the winds blew more we-
wardly, or more outherly, o the current came the nearer, or
went the further from hore. To atisy my CLZFlONY, I wait-
ed there till evening, when the tide of ebb being made from'
the rock, I plainly perceived the current again as before, with
this dierence, that it ran farther o, near half a league from
the (bore ; whereas in my condition, it et quite upon it, fu-
rioully hurrying me and my canoe. along with it, which at a-
nother time it would not have done. And now I was con-
vinced, that, by oberving the ebbing and owing of the tide, I=
might eaily bring my boat round the iand again 2 But when
I began w think of putting it in practice, the remembrance OF
the late danger I was in, ruck me with uch horronr, that I
changed my reolution, which was more afe, though more la-
borious ; and this was to make another canoe, and o have
one for one ide of the iand, and one for the other.
Here I think it very proper to inform my readers, that I
had two plantations in the itlan'd z the r was my little or-
tiication, fort, or cale, with many large and pacions im-
provements = For by this time I had enlarged the cave behind-
me with everal little caves, one within another, to hold my"
ball-lets, corn and raw. The piles with which I made my
wall were grown o lofty and great, as obcmed my habita-a
tion: And near this commodious and pleaant ettlement lay
my two well cultivated and improved- zorn elds) whicnkilndn
7

'ly yielded me their fruit in the proper eaon. My econd
plantation was that near my country eat, or little bower,
where my grapes ourihed, and where, having planted many
takes, Imade encloures for my goats, o rongly fortied
by labour and time, that it was much ronger than a wall,
and conequently impoible for them to break through. As
for my bower itelf, I kept it conantly in repair, and cut the
trees in uch a manner as made them grow thick and wild,
andorm the mo delightful hade. In the centre of this
ood my tent, thus erected : I had driven our Piles in the?
ground, preading over them a piece ofthe hip's ail ; beneath
which I made me a ort of a couth with the tins of the crea-
tures I had tain, and other things 5 and having laid thereon
one of the ailors' blankets, which I had aved from the wreck
of the hip, and covering myfelf with a great watch coat, I
took up this place for my country retreat. _
Very frequently from this Ictettlemcnt did I ue to viit my
boat, and kept her in very good order. And ometimes I
would venture in her a ca or two from hare, but no farther,
le eithera rong current, a udden orm wind, or ome on-
lueky accident, hould hurry me from t e iland as before.
But now I entreat your attention, while I proceed to inform
you of a new but mo urpriing cene of lie, wherein I was
aeting again in a ranger manner.
You may uppoe that after I had been here o long, troth-
ing could have been more amazing than to have een a human
creature. - But one day it happened, that, going to my boat, I
aw the print oa man's naked foot on the hore, very evident
on the and, as the toes, heel, and every part ofit. Had' 1 een
an apparition, in the mo frightful manner, I could not have
been more confounded: My willing ears gave the ritie' at-
tention. I ca my eyes around, but neither could atisfy the
one or the other. 'When I proceeded alternately to every part
of the hore, ill it was all as one; neither could 1 ee any
other mark, though the and about it. was as uceptib'e to take
Impreion as that which was o plainly ampt. Thus, ruck
Wllh Fonfuion and horrour, I returned to my habitationiright-
ened at* every buh and tree, as taking them for men z and,
being poeed with the wilde ideas, got over I cannot tell
how; But that night my eyes never cloed, though farther
from danger. When even then, I formed nothing but the mo
dimal imaginations, thinking it mu be the mark of the De.-
vtl's foot which I had een: For otherwie how could any
*m__9"&l body come to this iand t And if o, where wasthe
htp that tranported them? And what igns of any other-
ootlieps? Though thee eemed very rong reaons for uch a.
uppoitionx Yet, (thought I) why hould the Devil make the-
priitt of his foot to no purpoe, as I "can ee, when beþmlghi
- *' ave

have taken other ways to have terried me ? Why hould he
leave his mark on the other ide of the iand, and that too on
the and, where the urging waves of the ocean might oon
have eraed the impreion. Surely this action is not conit-
ent with the ubt-ilty of SATAN, [aid I to myelf, but rather
mu be ome dangerous creature, ome wild avage of the
main land over again me, that, ventoring too far in the ocean,
was driven" here either by the violent currents or contrary
winde; and o, not caring to ay on this deolate iland, was
gone back to ea again. _
Happy was 1 in my thoughts that no avage had een me m
that place, yet much terried, le, having foundmy boa'a
they hould return in numbers and deroy me, or at leaicar-
ry away all my corn, and deroy my ock Of tame oats: In
a word, all my religious hopes vanihed, as though I thought
God could not protect me by his power, who had o wonder-
fully preerved me o long.
What various chains of Providence there are in the life of
man i How changeable are cur aections, according to dier-
ent circumtances P Vv'e love to day what we hate to morrow 3
we hun one hour what we eek the next ; and this was evi-
dent in me in the mo perpicuous manner; for I, who be-
fore had o much lamented my condition, in being bamhed
from all human kind, was now almo ready to expire, when I
conidered that a man had et his foot on this deolate iand.
But when I conidered my (lation of life, decreed by the in-
nitely wie and good Providence of God; that I ought not to
dipnte my Creator's overeignty, who had an undoubted right:
to govern and dipoe of his creatures as he thinks convenient ;
and that his juice and mercy could either punih or deliver
me: I lay, when I conidered all this, I comortably found it
my duty to tru ineerely in him, pray ardentlv to him, and
humhiy reign myelf to his divine wilZ. 
One morning, lying on my bed, thee words OF the acred
Writings came again into my mind, Gall upon me in "58 day Of
trouble, and I 'will deliver thee, and. thou hall glorijj' 7716'- U_P0"
this entence, riing more cheerfully from my bed, I oered
up my prayers in the mo heavenly manner: And When I
had done, taking up my Bible to read, thee words appeared
r in my ight : Wait an 'be Lord, and be of good them', and be'
hall irengzbm to; bear-t; rwaz't, I ay, an the Lard. Such divine
comfort did this give me, as to remove all caue of adnes
upon that occaion.
T hus,after a world of apprehenions and fears, for three
davs and nights, at la I ventured out of my cale, and
milked my goats, one of which was almo poiled for Want
oit. I next, though in great ear, viited my bower. and
milked my ocks there aio z When grow-ing bdlden; went
own

down to the there again, and meanring the print of the foot
to mine, to ee whether, perhaps, I' myelf had not occaioned
that mark, I found it much lnperior in largenes ; and o I re-
turned home poeed with the notion, that either ome men
had been ahore, or that the illaad mu be inhabited; and
therefore, that I might be urpriled before] was aware.
Struck with a econd and more terrible ear, everal thoughts'
of ecurity came into my mind : And that night I was r
propoling to cut down my enclotiutes, and turn my tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
frequent the iand in hopes of the ame. Second] ,I was for
(ligging up my corn elds, for the very ame realon : And,
Lalj, [concluded to demolilh my bower, le eeing uch
a place of human contrivance, they might come farther and
attack me iz-i my little callle.
Such notions did the ear of danger tugge unto me ; and
I looked, l thought, like the unfortunate King Saul, when
not only oppreed by the Pbz'lzirzn, but alo forlaken by' God
himelf: And it is trange, that a little before having entire-
ly religned myielt to the will of God, I hould now have o
little condence in him, fearing thoe more who might kill
this fading body, than him who Could detroy my immortal
foul.
Sleep was an utter trange-r to my eyes that night ; yet na-
ture, pent and tired, lubmitted to a ilent repoe the next
morning : And then, joining reaon with my fear, I conider-
ed,that this delighttul and pleaant iand might not be en-_
tirely forlaken, as I might think ; or that the inhabitants
from the other hore might ail either with deign or necety
by cros winds ; and if the latter Circumance, they departed
upon the r opportunity. But ill my fear occaioned me
to think of a place for retreat, upon an attack. I now re-
pented that I had made the door that came out beyond my
fortication z but reolving to make me a econd, I drove be.
tween that double row of trees, which I planted about twelve
years before, everal Piles, thickening it with pieces of timber
and old cables, and rengthening the foot of it with earth
which I dog out of my cave. I alo made me even holes,
wherein I planted my mnkets like cannon, tting them into
frames reembling carriages. This being nihed with inde-
at'gable mdulry, for a great way roundl planted icks of
oier like wood, about twenty thouand of them, leavinga
large pace between them and my wall, that I might have
room to ee an enemy, and that they might not be heltered
by the young trees, if they oered to approach the outer wall.
And indeed iarce two years had paed over my head, when
there appeared alovely hady grove, and in ix years it became
a hlck Wood Perfectly impaablc. For my afety, [let no
RVCRUC
avenne to go in or out; inead o which I et two ladders;
one to a part of the rock which was low, and then broke in,
leavingiroorn to place another ladder upon that ; o that when
I took thoe down, it was impoible for any man to decend
without hurting himelf; and if they had, they would ill be
at the outide o my outer wall. But while I took all thee
meaures of human prudence for my own preervation, lWBSOI
altogether unmindliul of other aairs : To preerve my flocks
of tame goats, that t_he enemy hould not take all at once, I
looked out for the mo retired part of the illand, which was
the place where I had lo myel before mentioned, and there
nding a clear piece of land, containing three actes, ort-ound-
en' with thick woods, I worked o hard, that in les than a
month's time I enced it o well round, that my ocks were
very well ecured in it, putting therein two he goats and two
the ones. As this labour was occaioned purely by my ear-
nl apprehens'ions, on account of eeing the print o a man's
foot; not contented with what I had done, I earched for a-
nother place toward the wei point of the iland, where I mi ht
alo retain another ock. Then methought I perceivedg a
boat at a great ditlance in the ea; but could not poibly tell
what it was, for want of my perlpective glas. Iconideted
then it was no trange thing to ee the print of a man's foot ;
and concluding them cannihals, bleed God for my being ca
on the other ide of the illand. where none ofthe avages, as I
thought, ever came. But when I came down the hill to the
hare, which was the S. VV. point ofthe iland, I was not only
amazed, but perfectly confirmed in my opinion : For the place
was pread with knlls, hands, Get, and bones of human bodies ;
and then l perceived a pace like a circle, in the mid owhich
Jiad been a re; about this re I conjectured thee wretches
et, and unnaturally lacriced and devoured their fellow crea-
tures. "
The horror and lothomenes of this dread ul pectacle both
confounded my enes, and made me dicharge the violent di-
order from my lomach. So that when I had vomited in a
very exceive manne-r, l returned towards my habitation ; and
in my way thither hedding lloods of tears, and falling down
on my bended knees, gave God thanks for making my nature
contrary to thee wretches, and delivering me o long out of
their' hands. **
Now, though reaon and my long reidence there had aured
me, that thee avages never came up to the thick woody parts
of the country ; and that I had nooccaion to dicover myel,
who was o perfectly concealed from them ; yet uch an ab-
horrence did I till retain, that, 'For two years alter, I conned
,mylelf only to my three plantations ; I mean my calle, coun.
try'eat, and encloure in the woods. And when, in this oli-
tary
tary life, my dreadful appreheniorts began to wear away, yet
my eyes were more vigilant for ear of being urprized, and I
was cautious of ring my gun, le being heard by thoe crea-
tures, they hould proceed to attack me ; but reolving man-
fully to loe my life it they did', I went armed with three pi-
tols uck in my girdle, wh'ch, added to the decription I have
given of myelf belore, made me look with a very ormidable
appearance.
And thus my circumances for ome time remained very
calm and undiurbed. When I compared my condition to
others, I found it ar from being mierable : And indeed
would all perons compare their circumances, not with thoe
above them, but with thoe innumerable unhappy objects be-
neath them, I am ure we hould not hear thoe daily mur-
murings and complainings that are in the world. For my
part, l did not want many things: Indeed the terror which
the avages had put me in poilt ome inventions or my own
Conveniences; one of which was really very ridiculous, ex-
cept I could accompliih it, and happy it was they hindered me
from putting it in practice. My deign was to brew me ome
beer, when I had neither caks ucient, nor could make any,
to preerve it in ; neither had l hops to make it keep, yeal to
make it work, nor a copper or lfttle to make it boil. Per-
haps indeed, after ome years, I might bring this to bear, as l
had done other things : But now my inventions were placed.
another way,- and one was, how I might detroy ome of thee
cannibals, when proceeding to their bloody entertainments;
and o aving a victim from being acriced, he might after
become my ervant. Many were my contrivances for this
purpoe, and as many more objections occured after I hatched
them: For when l contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their re, and put therein ve or ix pounds
of gunpowder, which would conequently blow up all thoe
that were near it; why then I was loth to pend o much up-
on them, le it hould not do that certain execution I could
deire; and but only aright, and not kill them. Having laid
this deign aide, I propoed to myelf to lay privately in am-
buh, in ome convenient place, with my three gons double
loaded, and let fly at them in the mid of their dreadul cere-
mony; and having killed two or three of them at every hot,
fall upon the refi uddenly with my three piols, and not let
one mother's on ecape. And o much did this imagination
pleae my fancy, that I ued to dream of it in the night time.
To put my deign in execution, I was not long eeking for a
place very convenient for my purpoe, where, uneeml might
behold every action wof the evages, Here I placed my two
mu'lelsz Each of which was loaded with a brace o ings, and
four er ve lt-nalletiybullets, about the ize of pitolbullzetwsazX
l te
m
the fowling piece was charged with near a handful of the large
e (wan hot ; and in every piol were about four bullets.
Andthus all things being prepared, no ooner would the wel.
come light pread over the element, but, like a giant rcjfrtjhed
'It-'itb ravine, as the Scripture has it, would I iue orth trom
my caltle, and, from a lofty hill, three miles diant, view if I
could ee any invaders approach nnlawfnily to my kingdom.
But having waited in vain two or three mouths, it not only
grew very tireome to me, but brought me into ome conider-
ation, and made me examine myel, what right I had to kill
thee creatures-in this manner 2
If (argued I to myelf) this unnatural Cuom of theirs be a
n oenive to heaven, it belongs to the Divine Being, who a-
lene has the vindictive power in his hands, to hower down
vengeance upon them : And perhaps he does o, in making
them become one another's executioners. Or inot, if God
thinks thee doings ju, according to the knowledge which
they conceive, whatauthority have I. pretend to all the de-
ere-es of Providence, which has permitted thee actions for o
many ages, perhaps from almot the beginning of the creation I
They never oended me," what right had I then to concern
m-yelf in their fhedding one another's blood P And, as I have
ince known, they value no more to kill and devour a captive
'taken 'Q war, than we do to kill aii ex, or eat mutton. From
hence it followed, that thee people were no more murder-ers
than Chriians, who many times put whole troops to the
word, after throwing down their armsp Again I conidered,
that if I fell upon them, l hould be as much in the wrong as
the Spaniards, who had committed the greate barbarities up-
on thee people, who had never oended them in their whole
lives; as if the kingdom of Spaih was eminent for a race of
men without common compallion to the mierable, which is
reckoned. to be a principal ign of the mot generous temper.
In a word, I concluded never to attack them, whoe numbers
'might overpower me ; or that ome ecaping, might bring
thouands to my certain deruction ; nor o much as to hew
myel, which might oblige me even to a neceilary duty ot de-
lence. And indeed religion took their part o much, as to con-
vince me, how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of hed-
ding human blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever
they are to one another; and that I had nothing to do with it,
but leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as l aid
vbeforg to do therein what eemed convenient to his heavenly
widom. And therefore, on my knees, I thanked the Almigh-
'ty for delivering me from blood guiltines, and begged his pro-
fection that I might never fail into their hands.
Thus, giving over an attempt which l had rahly begun, I
never acended the hill on that occaion afterwards z only l re-
moved
moved my boat which lay on the other de of the iand,"and
every thing, uch asthey were, that belonged to her, towards
the ea, into a little cove,*that there might 'not be the lea
hadow of dicovery of any boat near, or habitation upon the
iland. And then my cale became my cell, keeping very re-
tired in' it, except to milk my he goats, and order my little
ock in the wood, which was quite out of danger ; for ure it
is, thee avages neverv came here with expectations to nd any
thing, and conequently never wandered from the cbai z and
as they might have everal times been on hore, as well before
as after my dreadfulrapprehenions looked back with horrour
to think in what a ate I might have been, had I uddenly
met them enderly armed, with one gun onlyloaded with mall
hot : And how great would have been my amazement, if, in-
tead of eeing the print of one man's foot, I had perceived
fteen or twenty avages, who, having once et their eyes up-
on me, by the wititnels o their feet, there was no poibility of
my ecaping? Thee thoughts would ink my very 'toul within
me, o that I would fall into a deeo melancholy, till uch time
as the conideration of my gratitude to the Divine Being moved
it from my heart. And then I fell into a contemplation of
the lecret prings of Providence z' How wonderfully we are
delivered, when we are inenible o it; and when intricated in
uncertain mazes or labyrinths of doubt or heitation, what e-
cret hint hall direct us intthe right way, when we intended to
go out of it; nay, perhaps, contrary to our buines, ene or
inclination. Upon which, t xed within me this as a certain-
rule, Ne-wr to dtj/bbgv thee-hare: imprefozzs of my mind, to the act-

ing or not acting any thing that oered, for c'which I jet could a- '
ign 720 reaon .* But let it be how it wilt, the advantage of this
conduct very eminently appeared in the latter part of my a-
bode on this ilan-d; I am a ranger in determining whence
thee ecret intimations of Providence derive; yet," methinks,
they are not only ome proofs of the convere t' pirits, but
alo of the ecret communications they are uppoed to have
with thoe that have not paed through the gloonzi' vale of
death.
As in thee many anxieties o mind, the care of my pre-
ervatton puta period to all inventions and contrivances, either
ot' luture accommodations or Conveniences ; o I never cared
to drive a nail, chop a tick, re a gun, or make a ire, le
Clil'll' the noie hould be heard or the moke dicover me :
And, upon this acccount, I ued to burn my earthen ware pri-
vately in a cave which 1 found in the wood, and which I made
convenient for that purpoe : But the principal caue that r
brOught me here, was to make charcoal, o that I might bake
and dres my bread and meat, without any danger. While I
was cutting down ome wood for this purpoe, I perceived a
cavity
ca'it behind a very thick branch of under wood. curious
to loo into it, I attained its mouth, and perceived it ucient
For meto tand upright in it. But when I had entered and
took a further view, two rolling hiningeyes, like aming
ars, eemed to dart themelves at me, o that I made all the
haile out that I could, as not knowing whether it was the
Devil ora moner that had taken up'his reidence in that place.
But when I recovered from my urprize, I called myel a
thouand lools, for being afraid to ee the Devil one moment,
who had now lived almo twenty years in the mo retired ol-
ituide : And therefore, reuming all the courage I had, I took'
up a aming rebrand, and in I ruhedagain; when not hav-
ing proceeded above three teps, I was more arighted than
before; tor then I heard a very loud igh, like that of a hu-
man creature in the greatet agony, ucceeded with a broken
noie, reembling words half expreed, and then a broken igh
again. Siepping back, Lord l (thought I to myel) where am
I got? Into what enchanted place have I plunged myel,
uch as are reported to contain mierable captives, till death
puts an end to their orrow P And indeed uch a great amaze-
ment was I in, that it ruck me with a cold weat; andhadz
my hat been on my head, I believe my hair would have moved
it o. But again, encouraging myei with the hopes of God's
protection, I proceeded forward, and, by the light of my re-
brand, perceived it to he a monrous he goat, lying on the
ground, gaping for life, and dying of mere old age. When
at rl I tirred him, thinking to drive him out, the poor an-
cient creature irove to et upon his eet, but was not able;
o I e'en let him lie i, to aright the avages, hould they
venture into this cave. In the mean time, I looked round
m', and ound the place but mall and fhapeles: At the furth-
cr fide of it I perceived a ort oan entrance, yet o low as
mut oblige me to creep on my hands and knees to it 3 when,
having no candle, I upended my enterprize till the next day,
and then I came provided with ix large ones of my own mak-
wg.
VVhemF upon my hands and eet I had crept through the
Rraighr, I ound the roofroe higher up, I think, about twen-
ty eet : But urely mortal never aw uch a glorious ight in
this iand beforel The roof and walls of this cave reected
a hundred thouand lights to me from my two candles, as
though they were indented with hining gold, precious ones,
or parkling diamonds. And indeed it 'as the mo delight-
to) cavity or grotto, of its kind, as could be deired, though
entirely dark : The oor was dry and level, and hada kind of
gravel upon it; no naueous venomous creature to be een
there, neither any damp or wet about it : I could nd no fault
hutia the entrapcc, which I thought might be very neczary
' or

for my defence, and therefore was rcolved to make this place
my mu principal magazzne. I brought hithe'r two fowling
pieces and three mukets, leaving only ve pieces at my cale,
planted in the nature of Cannon. In a barrel of gunpowder,
which I took out of the ea, I brought away about ixty pounds
of good powder, which was not damaged ; and thee, with a.
great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed from my calile to
this retreat, now ortied both by art and nature.
Surely it is no wonder, if at this time l thought myelf like
one of the giant: oi old, who were aid to live in oaves and
holes among the tocks, inacceble to any but themelves, or,
at leat, mo dangerous to attempt. So that now it eems I
detpzled both the cunning and trength of the avaget, either
to nd me out or to hurt me.
But l mu not forget the old gnat, who caued my late dread.
ful amazement 2 The poor creature gave up the gho the day'
alter my dicovery; and it being dicult to drag him out, I
dog his grave, and honourably entombed him in "the ame
place where he departed, with as much ceremony as any Weþ
gnat has been interred about the high mountain &tamen-ware.
I think I was now in the twenty third year of my reign,
and much eaier were my thoughts than formerly, contriving
everal pretty amuements and diverions, to pas away the
time in a pleaant manner. By this time my pretty Fall had
learnt to peak Englfh, and pronounce his words very articu-
lately and plain z lo that for many hours we ued to chat to-
gather after a very familiar manner, and he lived with me no
les than twenty x years : My dog, who was nineteen years
old, ixteen years of which he lived with me, died of mere old
age : As for my eats, they multiplied o tall, that I was forced
to kill or drive them into the woods, except two or three, which
became my particular avourites. Betides thee, I continually
kept two or three houlehold kids about me which I did learn
to feed, out of my hand, and two more parrots which would
talk indierently, and call Kobirzan Crzzae, but not o excellent'
as the ri, as not taking that pains with them. Several ca
lowls I had alo, which having wounded,l cut their wings,
and growing tame, they ued to breed among the low trees
about my cale walls z all which were very agreeable to me.
But what unforeeen events uddenly deroy the enjoyments
of this uncertain ate of life, when we leai expect them l it
was now the month of December, in the southern olice, and
particular time of my harvei, which required my attendancc
in the elds; when going out pretty early one morning, be-
ore itwas d y light, there appeared to me, from the ea there,
a aming lig t, about two miles from me, at the eat end of'
the iand, where I had oberved ome avages had been, as
F 2 before,
before, but not on the other ide; but, to my great aiction,
it was on my tide of the iand.
Struck with a terrible urprie, and my uual apprehenions,
that the avages would perceive my improvements,-I returned
directly to my cale, pulled up the ladder after me, making all
things look as wild and natural as poibly I could. In the
next place I put myelf in a poure of defence, by loading my
mukets and piols, and committing myelf to God's protec-
tion, reolving to defend myeit till my latei breath. After
two hours pace, impatient for intelligence, I et my ladder up
to the ide of the hill where there was a flat place ; and then
pulling the ladder after me, acended the top, where, laying
myelt on my belly, with my perlpective glas, I perceived no
les than nine naked avages, tting rounda mall re, eating
as'I uppoed, human eh, with their two canoes haled upon
hare, waiting for the ood to carry them o again. You can-
not eaily expres the coniernation I was in at this ight, epe-
cially eeing them near me ; but when I perceived their com-
ing mu be always with the current of the ebb, I became more
eay in my thoughts, being very fully convinced, that I might
go abroad with ecurity all the time of ood, if they were not

'before landed. And indeed this proved ju as I imagined;
for no ooner did they all take boat, and paddle away, but the
tide made northwe. Before they went o, they danced,
making ridiculous potures and geures, for above an hour,
all (lark naked, but whether men, or women, or both, I could
not perceive. When I aw them gone I took two guns upon
my haulders, and placing a couple of pitols in my belt, with
my great word hanging by my ide, I went to the hill, where
at r I made a dicovery o thee cannibals, and then aw
there had been three canoes more of the avages on hore a'
that place, which, with the re, were making over to the
main land.
But nothing could be more horrid to me, when going to
the place of tacrice, the blood, the bones, and other mangled
parts of human bodies, appeared in my tight; and o, ired
with indignation, I was fully reolved to be revenged of the
r that came there, though l lo my life in the execution. It
then appeared to me, that the viits, which they made to this
iand, were not very frequent, it being fteen months before
they came again ; all this time I was very uneay, by reaon of
the dimal apprehenions I had of their urpriing me unawares;
nor dared I oer to re a gun on that ide of the iland where
they ued to appear, le taking the alarm, the avages might
return with many hundred canoes, and then God knows in
what manner I hould have made my end : And thus I was a
ear or more, before I ever aw any of thee devout-ing can ni-
ls again.
But
But to wave this dicoure for a while, the following acci-
dent demands your attention, which for a while eluded the
force of my thoughts in revenging myelon thoe heathens.
It was the I6th of May (according to my wooden calendar)
that the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abund-
ance of lightning and thunder all that day, and ucceeded by a
very iormy night. What occaioned this Icould not imagine;
but as the eeming anger of the heavens made me have re-
coure to the Bible, whilt I was eriouly pondering upon it, I
was uddenly alarmed with the noie oira gun, which I conjec-
tured was ired upon the ocean. Such an unuual urprize,
made me tart up in a minute, when, with my ladder, acend-
ing the mountain as before, that very moment a ah of re
preaged the 'report of another gun, which I preently heard,
and ound it was from that part of the ea where the cuirnt
drove me away. I could not then think otherwie, but that
this mu be a hip in diires, and that thee were the melan-
choly ignals for a peedy deliverance. Indeed, great was my
orrow, upon this occaion, but altogether vain and fruitles.
However, I brought together all the dry wood that was at
hand, and making a handome pile et it on re on the hill.
Certain it was, that they plainly perceived iit, by their ring
another gun, as oon as it began to blaze, and after that ever-
al more from the ame quarter. All the night long didI keep
up this re; and when the air cleared up, I perceived ome-
thing a great way at ea directly cat, but could not diinguih
what it was, even with my glas, by reaon the weather was o
very foggy out at ea. However, keeping my eyes directly
xt upon it, and perceiving it not to tir, I preently concluded
it mu be a hip at anchor; and o very haty I was to be atis.
tied, that, taking my gun, I went to the outh eat part of the
iland, to the ame tocks where I had been formerly drove away
by the current; in which time the weather being perfectly
cleared up, to my great orrow, I perceived the wreck of a hip
ca away upon thoe hidden rocke, which I ound when I was
out with my boat; and which, by making a kind of an eddy,
were the occaion of my Preervation.
Thus, what is one man's afety is another's ruin : For un-
doubtedly this hip had been driven on them in the night, the
wind blowing rong at E. N. E. Now, had they perceived
the ifland, as I could notiiimagine they did, certainly, inead of
ring their guns for help, they might rather have ven'tured in
their boat, and aved themelves that way. Then I thought,
that perhaps they had done o, upon eeing my re, and were
cal away in the attempt; for I perceived no boat in the hip.
Again, I imagined, that perhaps they had another Veel in
company, which, upon ignal, aved their lives, and took the
boat up: Or latly, that the boat might be driven intojhe
main
main ocean, where thee poor creatures might be in the mot
mierable condition. But as all thee conjectures were very
uncertain, I could do no more than comtniterate their ditrels,
and thank God for delivering me, in particular, when o many
perihed in the raging ocean.
When I conidered eriouly every thing concerning this
wreck,l could Perceive no room to uppoe any ot them lav-
ed : 1 cannot explain, by any poible force o_ words, what
longings my onl elt upon this ight, often breaking out in
this manner: Oh l that there had been but two or three, nay
even one peron aved, that we might have lived together,
convtred with and comlorted one another! And lo much
were my deires moved, that when I repeated thee words,
Ob ! that there bad been but one! my hands would o clench
together, and my ngers pres the parlms o my hands o cloe,
that had any olt thing been between, they would have cruh.
ed it involuntarily, while my teeth would trike together, and
fet again each other o rong, that required ome time for
me to part them. __
Till the lat year of my being on this tland, I never knew
i any had been aved out of this hip or not z and had only
the aiction ome time after, to fee the corpe of a drowned
boy Come on hore, at the end othe illand, which was next
the hipwreek : There was nothing on him but a eaman's
wailcoa't, a pair of open knee'd ltnen drawers and a blue
linen hirt; but no particular mark to gues what nation he
was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight and a tobacco
pipe, thela of which I preerred much more than I did
the r. And now the calmnes of the ea tempted me to
venture out in my boat to this wteck, not ouly to get ome-
thing neceary out of the hip, but perhaps ome living crea-
ture might be on board, whoe life I might preerve. This
had uch an inuence upon my mind, that immediately I went-
home, and prepared every thing neceary for the voyage, car-
rying on board my boat, proviions of all orts, with a good.
quantity of rum, freh water and a compals. So putting o, I
addled the canne along the hore, till I came at lat to the
KJ. E. part of the iland, from whence I was to launch int' the
ocean 5 but here the currcnts ran o violently, and appeared
o terrible, that my heart began to fail me ; tureeeing that itT
I was driven into any of thee currents, I might be carried not
only out ot the reach or ight of the iand, but even inevltam
bly lot in the boiling urges of the ocean. I
So Qppreed was I at thee troubles, that I gave over my
enterprize, ailing to a little creek on the hore, where tep-
ping out, I at me down on a riing hill, very'penive and
thoughtful. Ithen perceived, that the tide was turned, and
&lit-ood came on, which made it tmpracticabie for me to go
out

out for o many hours. To be more certain, how the ets of
the tides or currents lay when the ood came in, I acended a
higher piece o ground, which overlooked the ea both ways,
and here I ound, that as the current of the ebb et out 'cloe
by the outh point of the iand, o the current of the flood et
in cloe by the hore of the north ide; and all that If had to
do, was, to keep to the north of the iland in my return.
That night I repoed myel in my canoe, covered with my
watch coat inead of a blanket, the heavens being my teter.
1 let out with the r o the tide full north, till l elt the be-
net o the current, which carried me at a great rate ealtward,
yet not with uch impetuoity as before, as to take from me all
government of my canne 3 o that in two hours time I came up
to the wreck, which appeared to me in a mo melancholy man-
ner. It eemed to be a Spanih Veel by 'its building, tuck la
between two tocks; her tern and quarters beaten to,pieces'*
with the ea; her main mal and ore mail were brought o by
the board; as much as to ay, broken hort o. As l ap-
proached nearer, I perceived a dog on board, who perceiving
me coming, yeiped and cried, and no ooner did I call him,
but the poor creaturejumped into the ea, out of which l took-
him almo famihed with hunger and thir : So that when I
gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous wolf could devour it
more greedily; 'and he drank to that degree of freh water,
that he would have bur himel had 'I uered him.
The r ight I met with in the hip, were two men drown-
ed in the cook room or oretalle, encloed (in one another's
arms: Hence 1 very probably uppoed, that when the veel
ruck in the tor'm, o high and inceantly did the waters
break in, and over her, that the men, not being able to bear
it, were irangled by the conant ruhing in of the waves.
There were everal caits of liquor, whether wine or brandy, I
Could not be poitive, which lay in the lower hold, as were
plainly perceptible by the ebbing out of the water, yet were
too large for me to pretend to meddle with : Likewie I per.
ceived everal chels, which I thought might belong to the ea-
menz two o them I got into my boat, without examining
then what were in them. Now had the lern of the hip been
xed, and the fore part broken o, certain I am I hould have
made a very properous voyage; ince by what I after ound
in thee two chels, I could not otherwie conclude, but that
the hip mu have abu ndance of wealth on board : nay. if I
mut gues by the coure he eered, (he mut have been bound
from Burnet Ayrer, or Rz'oi de la Plara, in the outhern
part of merjca, beyond the Ere-ily, to the Her-wench, in the
gulph of Mexi'ca, and o perhaps to Spain. What became of
the rei of her ailors, I could not certainly tell; and all hee
"dles ignied nothing at that time to any body.
Searching
Searching farther, I found a caik, containing about twenty
gallons, full of liquor, which with ome labour Igot into my
boat: Inacabin were everal muikets, which l let remain
there, but took away with me a great powder horn, and about
four pounds of powder in it; I' took alo a re hovel vand
tongs, two bras kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and
a gridiron,v eil which were extremely neceary to me, epeci-
ally the re hovel and tongs. And o with this cargo, accom-
panied with my dog, l came away, the tide erving for that
purpoe ; and that ame evening, about an hour within
night, I attamed the illa-nd, after the greate toil and fatigne
imaginable. *
That night [repoed my wearied limbs in the boat, reolving
she next morning to harbour what i had gotten in my new
found ubterraneous grotto, and not carry my cargo home to
my ancient caliie. When I had ref'rehed myelf, and got all
my eects on thore, I proceeded to examine the particuiars ;
And o tapziing the catk, I found the iiquer to be a kind of
tum, but not iike what we had at the tBmils, nor indeed near
o good. At the opening of the che, everal things appeared
very ueful to me aFor inRance, I found in one a very ne
cae of' bottles, containing the ne and beil orts of cordial
waters : Each bottle held about three pints, coriony tip't with
hive-r. I found aio two pots full of the choicet. weet-meats,
and two more which the water had utterly zioiied. There
were likewie everal good hir'ts, exceedingly w'eicome to me,
and about a dozen and a half of iiaen white handkerchieis and
coloured neckloths, the former of which were abolutely ne:
oeary for wiping my face in a hot day ; and in the tili, I found
three bags of pieces of eight, about eleven hundred in all ; in-
all of which, decently wrapt up in a piece of paper, were ix
doubloons of: gold, and ome mall bars and Wedges of the
ame metal, which I believe might weigh near a pound. In
the other cheti, which I gueed to belong tothe gnnner's mate,
by the mean circnmianges that attended it, I only found ome
Clothes of very little vaine, except about two pounde, of nie
glazed powder, in three Haks, kept, as I believe, for charging
their narling-pieces on any occaion. So that on the whole, I
had no great advantage by this voyage : The money was in-
deed as mere dirt to me, ueles and unprotable, all which l
would have freely parted with for two or three Englih pair of
hoes and lockings; things that for many years I had not
worn; except lately thoe which I had taken o the feet of
thoe unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck, yet not
o good aSEngLf/Z hoes, either for eae or ervice : And hav-
ing 'found in the eamen's che about fty pieces of eight In
riais, but no goid, I uppoe what I took from the r be.-
longed to an ocer, to whom this eemed to have a much
inferior
7 r
inferior peron its owner. Weil, the money, as depicable as
it eemed, llikewie lugged to my cave, laying' it up lecurely
asl did the re of my cargo. After I had done all this, I
returned back to my boat, rowing or paddling her along till
[came to my old hatbour, where I careully laid her up, and
o made the be of my way to my caile. When I arrived
there, every thing eemed ate and quiet; o that now my
only buines, was to repoe myfel after my wonted manner,
and take care of my domeic aairs. But though l might;
have lived very ealy, as wanting (or nothing aþolutely need.
ful, vct ill I was more vigilant than uual on account of
the lavages, never going much abroad ; or if l did, it was to
the EczJ'? part of the iland, wherel was well aured that the
avages never came, and where I might not be troubled to
carry that heavy load of weapons for my deleoce, as I was
obliged to do if I went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in all which
time, contrary to My former reolutions, my heart was lled
with nothing but projects and deigus how I might ecape from
this illand : And o much were my Wandering thoughts bent
on a rambling dilpoition, that had lthe ame boat I went
from Sallce in, I hould have ventured once more to the uncer.
tainty of the raging ocean.
But certainly I was an unhappy inance of that part of
mankind, who make themelves wretched by their diatisfac-
tion with the ation which God has placed them in : For not
to take a review of my primitive condition, and my father's
excellent advice, the contrary to which was, as I may ay, my
originaln, my following miiakes, of the ame nature, had
been the means of my preent unhappy llation. What bui-
nes had I to leavea ettled fortune, and well ocked plan-
tation, improving and increaing, where by this time I might
have been worth a hundred thouand moidores, to turn uper.
cargo to Guz'nea, to fetch Negroes, when time and patience
would have o much enlarged our ock at home, as to be
able to employ thoe, whoe more immediate buines it was to
fetch them home, even to our doors ?
But as this is very commonly the fate of young heads, o as
a erious reection upon the folly of it, ordinarily attends the
exercie of future years, when the dear bought experience of
time is o much repented of. Thus it was with me, at that
eaon ; but notwithanding what I had, or might uer up-
on thee occaions, the thoughts of my deliverance ran o
rongly in my mind, as eemed to check all the rlictates of my
poor reaon and Philoophy. And now to uhermy kind real-e
der, with greater pleaure to the remaining part of my rela-
tions, I atter myelf it will not be taken amis to give him
a'
an account of my r conception; on the manner of ecaping,
and upon what foundation l laid out my foolih chemes.
I mu now uppoe myelf retired to my cale, after my
late voyage to the hip, my rigate laid up and ecured, as
uual, and my condition in the hine manner as before, except
being richer ; though I had as little occaion for riches as the
India-m of Peru had for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came
among them. One night in ZWarc/a, being the rainy eaon, in
the four and twentieth year ot this my olitude, 1 was lying
on my bed awake,very well in health, without diternper, pain,
or uncommon uneatines, either of body or mind ; yet for all
this, l could not compoe myel to leep the night long. All
this tediouswhile, it is impoible to expres what innumerable
thoughts Cane into my head : I traced quite over the whole
httory ot my life in miniature, from my utmo remem-
brance othings, till I came to this iland ; and then proceed-
ed to examine every action and paage that had occurred,
incel had taken poeiion of my kingdom. In my reections
upon the latter I was comparing my happy poure of aairsin
the beginning of my reign, to this life of anxiety, fear and con-
eern, ince I dicovered the print of a foot in the and ; that:
while I continued free without notions, I was capable of form.
ing any dreadful apprehenions ; though I ought rather to be
thankul for the knowledge of my danger, ince then it was
the greatet happines to have ucient time to provide for my
reection : How iupendous is the goodnels of Providence,
which lets uch narrow bounds to the ight and knowledge of
human nature, that while men walk in the mid of o many
danger-s that tun-round them, till perhaps they are diipated
and vanihed quite away.
And when I came more particularly to conider of the real
danger I had for to manycyears ecaped; how I had walked a-
bout in the greatet ecurity and tranquillity at a time, perhaps
when even nothing but the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the

' 'omm'on approach of night, had only interpoed between me
and the detiructive hands of the cannibals, who would devour
me with as good an appetite as I would a pigeon or curlew.
Surely all this, I ay, could not but make me incerely thank-
ful to my great preerver, whoe ingular protection I acknowl-
edged with the greate humility, and without which I muin-
evitably have fallen into the cruel hands of thee devourers.
Thus having dicued thee thoughts in the cleare manner
according to my weak underanding, I next proceeded to con-
ider the wretched nature of thee deiroying avages, by eem-
ing, though with great reverence, to inquire why God hould
give up any of his creatures to uch inhutuanity, even to but--
tality itelt', to devour its own kind? But as th's was rather
matter of abrue peculation, it better became rue-to enquiM

what part of the world thee wretches lived in; how far o the
coa was from whence they came ; why they Ventured over
o ar from home z what kind of boars conveyed them hither ;
and why I could not order myel, and my buines d, that Itt
might be as able to attain their country, as they were to come
to my kingdom. ' a
Never had l the lea thoughts how I hould manage myelf
when I hould go thither 5 what would become of me if I fell
'into the hands of the avages 5 or how I hould ecape from
them if they made an attempt upon me. And uppoing I
hould fall into their power, what could I do for proviion, or
which way hould I bend my coure t Now though thee things
did expres the greate horrour and Confuion imaginable, yet
till] looked upon my preent condition the mot mierable
that pobly could be, and that nothing could be worle except
death. For (thought l) couldl 'but attain the hore of the
tuain, I might perhaps meet with ome relief', or coa it along,
as l did with my boy Xmjr, on the A-z'can hore, till I came to
ome inhabited country, where I might meet with ome relief,
or fall in with ome ebriian hip that might take me in 5 and
if I failed, why then I could but meet with death, which would
put an end to all my mieries. But yet I mu here note, that
all this was the fruit of adittempered mind; an impatient tem-
per, made deperate, as it were, by long continuance of the
troubles and the diappointments I had met with in the wreck,
where I hoped to have found ome living peron to peak to, by
whom] might have known in what place I was, and of the
probable means of my deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts
were agitated, my relignation to the will o heaven was entire-
ly upended; o that l had no power to x my mind to any
thing but the project of a voyage to the main. And indeed
o much was [inamed upon this account, that it et my blood
into a erment, and my pulle beat high as though I had been
in a fever ;' till nature being, as it were, atigued and exhaut-
ed with the very thoughts of it, made me lubmit mylelf to a
lent repoe.
Certatnly it is very range, that I did not dream of what l
was lo intent upon ; but intead of which, my mind roved on
a quite dierent thing, altogether oreign to it. I dreamt,
that as I was iuing from my cale one morning, asacuoma-
ry, I perceived upon the hore two canoes, and eleven lavages
Coming to land, who had brought with them another Indian,
whom they deigned to make a acrice of, in order to devour :
But ju as they were going to give the fatal blow, methought:
the poor deigned victim jumpt away, and ran directly into a
little think grove before my fortication, to ablcond from his
enemies; when, perceiving that the others did not follow him
'that way, I appeared to him 5 that he hunib-ly kneel'd down
G before-
'74
before me,'eeming to pray for my attance; upon which I
hewed him my ladder, made him acend, carried him to my
cave, and he became my ervant; and when I had gotten this
man, I] aid to myelf, nowurely I may have ome hopes to
attain the main land; for this fellow Wlll erve me as a pilot,
tell me what to do, and where I mu go for provilions; what
places to hun, what to venture to, and what to ecape. But
when I awak'd, and found all thee inexprethle impreions of
joyctentirely vanihed, I ell'into the greate ciejection of pirits
imaginable. 4
Yet, after all, I made this conclui *m,that my only way of e.
caping was to get a avage ; and after I had ventur'd my life to
deliver him rom the bioodyjaws of his devout-ers, the natural
ene he might have of uch a preervation, might inpire him
with a laiing gratitude and mo incere aection. But then
this objection reaonably interposkl: How can I eect this
(thought I) without i attack a whole caravan of them, and
kill them ail t Why hould I proceed on uch a deperate at-
tempgwhich my cruples had before uggeed to me were un-
lawul, and made my heart tremble at the thoughts of o much
blood, though it were a means to procure my deliverance! And
though I might, according to my reaon, uppoe that thee men
were the real enemies to my life, and would devour me, were
it in their power, o that it was elf preervation in the highe
degree, to free myel from this dread of death, by acting in
my own defence, as if they were actually aaulting me :
Thoughall thee things, I ay, eemed to me to be othe great-
eft weight; yet, as I ju aid before, the dreadful thoughts of
tedding human blood, ruck uch a terrour to my oul, that
it was a long time before I could reconcile myelf to it.
But how far will the ardency of deire prompt us on? For
notwithanding the many diputes and perpiexities l had with
myel about it; right or wrong, I was rel'olved to get one of
thee avages into my hands, let it co what it would, or loe
my lie in the attempt. Thus inpired with a rm reoilution,
all my wits, were at work, in the next place, to nd out what
methods I hould take t. anwer my, deign ; and this indeed
was very dicult to reo ve on. , Since then I could not. pitch
upon any, probable means or it, I reolved continually to be
in a vigilant poture, to perceive when theavages came on
hot-e, and o leave the ret to the event, let the opportunities
oer as they would. U '
Such was my xed ret-lution, and accordingly I fet myelf
upon the cout as often as l Could, till uch time as I was
heartil tired of it. I waited for above a year and a half, the
reate part of which time I went out to the well end, and,
outh we corner of the iand, almo every day, to ee for ca-
noehbnt none appeared. This was a very great dicouragement,
at
at which I was very much concerned z yet never did this wear
o the edge of my deire to the thing ; but the longer it eem.
ed to be delayed, the more eager l was for it : In a word, I
was never at r o careful to hun the loathed ight iof thee
favages, as I was now eager to be upon them. Beides, I
thought myelf uciently able to manage one, two or three
avages if I had them, o as to make them my entire flaves, to
do whatoever I hould direct them, and prevent their being
able at any time of doing me amichie. iMan'y a time did I
ue to pleae myei with this aair, with long and ardent ex;
pectations, but nothing yet preented; all my deep projected
tchemes and numerous ancies vanihed away, as thoughmhiie
I retained thpethoughts, the decree of 'providence was uch,
that no avages were to come near me. 7
It was about a year and a half, that as I was mo eriouly
muing-ot undry ways how I hould attainctimy end, one morn-_
. ing early l was very much urpried by eeing no les that!
ve canoes all on hore together, on my tide the'iland, and the
creatures that belonged to them all landed, and out ot my
ght. Such a number of them diconcerted all my meaures ;
for eeing o many boats, each of which would contain ix,
and ometimes more, I could not tell what to think of it, 'or
how to order my meaures, to attacktwenty or thirty mein in-
gle handed : Upon which, much dicomc rted and perplexed, I
lay (lill in my cale; however I put myelf in the ame pofln're
foran attack, that I had formerly provided againt, and was
ready to" enter upon an engagem-fent, hould they attempt it.
But when I had waited a long while, till uch time as my im-
patient temper would let me bear, it no longer, I et my guns
at the foot of my ladder, and as u'u'al acended up to the top
of the hill at two tages; however, tanding that my head did
not appear above the hill o that by any means they could not
perceive me; and here I oberved, by the azance of 'my per-
pective glas, no les than thirty in number around ar'e,
eain'g upon what meat they had d'reed : How they cooked
it, or what it was, I could not then perfectly tell ; but they
were all dancing and capering about the ames, uing many
frightul and barbarous 'getures. J
But while with a curious eye I was beholding thee wretches,
my pirits unk within me, when I perceived them drag two
mierable creatures from the boats to act afreh the dreadful
tragedy, as I uppoed they had done before. lt was not long
before one of them fell upon the ground, knocked, down, 'as I
uppoed, with a club, or wooden v *rd; for that was their
manner, while two or three others went immediately to work,
cutting him open for their cookery, and then fell to devour
him as they had done the former, while the la unhappy cap-
lli'ez'as left by himelf till uch time as they were ready foe

him. The poor creature looked round him with a wihul
eye, trembling at the thoughts of death, yet eeing himelf a
little at liberty, nature that very moment as it were inpired
him with hopes of life, that he tarted away from them, and
ran with incredible witnes along the ands directly to that
part of the coall w here my ancient and venerable cale ood.
You may imagine I was dreadully arighted upon this oc-
caion, when as l thought, they pnrued him in a whole body,
all runing towards my palace. And now indeed-I expected that
part of my dream was going to be fullled, and that he would
certainly y to my grove tor protection ; but for the re of
my dream Icould depend nothing on it, that the avages would
purue him thither and nd him there. However my lpirits
beginning to recover, I ill kept upon my guard, when I plain-
ly perceived there were but three men out of the number, that
purued him ; 'and I was innitely pleaed with what wiftnes
the poor creature ran from his puruers, gaining much ground
of them, that I plainly perceived, could he thus hold it for
half an hour, there was not the lea doubt but he would ave
his life from the power ofhis enemies.
Between them and my cale there was a creek, that very
Fame where I ailed into with all my eects from the wreck of
the hip, on the eep banks of which I very much feared the
poor victim would be taken, if he could not wirn for his e-g
rape : But I was oon out of pain for him when he made noth-
ing of it though at full tide; but with an intrepid courage,
purred on by the ene ot- danger, he plunged into the ood,
wimming over in about thirty trokes, and then landing, ran
with the lame wonderful trength and wifmes as before.
When the three puruers came to the creek, one of them,
whom] perceived could not wim, happily' tor his part, re-
turned back to his company ; while the others with as equal
courage, but much les wiftnes, attained the other ide, as
though they were reolved never to give over their puruit.
And now, or never, I thought was the time for me to procure
a ervant, companion or altant; and that I was decreed by
Providence to be the inrument that hould ave this poor-
creature's life. I immediately decended my two ladders with
the greate expedition, took up my two guns, which [aid
before were at the bottom of them; and getting up again,
with the ame hae towards the hill, l made nearer the ea :
In a word, taking a hort cut down the hill, I interpoed be-
tween the puruers and the purued, hallooing aloud to the
latter, who vent-niting to look back, was no doubt at r as
much terried at me as them. I beckoned to him with my
hand to return back, in the mean time lowly advancing tow-
ards the, puruers ; when uddenly ruhing on the ore-mo, knocked him down with the ock of my piece, andlaig him
flat on theground. I was very unwilling to re le the re
hould hear, though at that diance I queion whether they
could or nor; and being out of ight of the moke, they could
not eaily have known what to make of it. The oher avage
eeing his fellow fall, opt as if he had been amazed, when ad-
vancing towards him, I could Perceive him take his bow from
=his back, and xing an arrow to it, was preparing to hoot at
me, and without dipute might have lodged the arrow in my
lbrea, had I given him leave; but in this abolutely neceary
caue ol elf Preervation, l immediately ired at him, and hot
him dead, ju as his hand was going to draw the fatal ring.
All this while the avage who had fled before, ood ill, had
the adsaction to ee his enemies fall, or killed as he thought,
who deigned to take away his lile : So arighted was he with
the re and noie of my piece, that he ood as it were, like
Lat'r wie, xt and immoveable, without ene, and without
motion. This made me halloo to him again, making the plain-
e igns] could to him to draw nearer: I perceived he un-
derood thee tokens, by his approaching to me a little way,
when, as if afraid I hould kill him too, he opt again. Sev-
eral times did he advance, and as often opt in this manner,
-till coming more to my view, I perceived him trembling, as if
he was to undergo the ame ate. Upon which I looked upon him
with trmiling countenance, and ill beckoning to him,at length
he came cloe to me, kneeled down, kied the groundrlaid
his head upon it, and taking me by my foot, et the ame up-
>0n his head : And this, as I underood afterwards, was a tok-
en of wearing to be my ave forever. l took him up, and
making very much of him, encouraged him in the be manner
l could. But here my work was not yet nthed; for I per-
ceived the avage whom I knocked down, was not killed, but'
unned with the blow, and began to come to himelf. Upon
which I pointed to my wnew ervant, and hewing him that his
enemy was-notyet expired, he ipoke ome words to me, but
what I could not underand; y'et being the r ound odia
man's-voice I had heard for above thee twenty ve years, they
were very pleaing to me. But there was no time for treeic.

valorous ex ploit was done, he came to me laughing, and as a.
token of triumph, deiivered me my word again with abund-
ance of urprizing geures, laying it along with the bleeding
and ghaly head of the Indian at my feet.
The greate atonihment that my new ervant conceived,
was the manner of killing the avage at uch a diance without
a bow and arrow: And uch was his longing deire to know
it, that he firt pointed to the dead creature, and then made
igns to me to grant him leave to go to him. Upon which I
bid him go, and as well asI could made him enible I granted
his reque. But when he came there, how wonderfully was
he ricken with amazement ! r he turned him on one ide,
then on the other, wondering he could perceive no quantity of
blood, he bleeding inwardly: And after uciently admiring
the wound the bullet had made in his brea, he took. up his
bow and arrows, and came back again z upon which I turned
to go away, making many igns to him to follow, lea the ret,
ming their companions, might come in puruit of him, And
this I ound he underood very well, by his making me un-
derand that his deign was to bury them, that it might not be
een ifit happened; and which by igns again, I made him en-
ible I very much approved of. immediately he fell to work,
and never was grave digger more dexterous in the world than
he was ; for in an inant, as 1 might ay, he craped a large
hole in the and with his hands, ucient to bury the r in,

poor creature be, upported chiey by that vivacity of ipirit,
anduncommon tranports of joy, that his deliverance occa-

fur-ly, but rathera ort o majely in his face; and yet, el-
pecially when he miled, he had a l the weetnes and oftnes
of an European. His hair was not curled like wool, as many
of the blacks are, but long and black, with the molt beautiful,
vet careiestrees preading over his thouldezs. He had a ve-
ry high and large forehead, with a great vivacity and parkling
harpnes in his eyes. His kzn was not o tawny as the i/'zr-
giniam, Brailz'am, or other Americans, but rather of a bright
dun olive colour, that had omething agreeable in it,though
not very eay to give a decription of. His face was round
and plump, with a mall noe, very dierent from the flatnes
of the negroes, a pretty mall mouth, thin lips, ne teeth, ve-
ry well et, and white as the driven now. In a word, uch
handome features, and exact ymmetry in every part, made
me conider that l had aved the lie of an Indian prince, no
les graceul and accomplihed, than the great Oraonoko, whoe
memorable behaviour, and unhappy contingenczes of life, has
charmed the world both to admiration of his peron and com-
pallion to his uerings.
But let him be either prince or peaant all my happines cen-
tered in this, that] had now got a good lervant, or companion,
to whom, as he deerved, 'I was reolved to prove a kind ma-
ter, and lating friend. He had not, 1 think, lept above an
hour, but he awakened again, and while I was milking my
goats hard by, out he ran rom the cave, towards me in my
encloure, and laying himelf down on the ground in the low-
eft proration, made all the antic getlures imaginable, to ex-
pres his thankfulnes to me For being his deliverer. I confes,
though the manner of his behaviour eemed to be ludicrous e-
nough to occaion laughter ; yet I was very much moved at
his aection, o that my heart melted within me, fearing he
might die away in exces of joy, like reprieved malefactors ;
and then I was incapable either to let him blood, or admini-
ter phyic. And I wih many chriiians would take example

him in many things, 1 made him enible I was very well plea-
ed with him ; and in a little time l began to peak to him, and
learn him how to talk to me again. In the r place I made him
to underand his name to be Fridqy, becaue it was upon that
day I aved his life. Then I taught him to ay Maer, which
I made him enible was to be my name. I .ikewie learned
him to ay yes and no, and to know what they meant. I gave
him ome milk in an earthen pot, making him view me white
I drank it before him, and t'oped my bread in it; and I gave
him a cake of bread, cauing him to do the like, to 'which he
readily conlented, making igns of the greate atisaction im-
aginable; 7
All that night did I keep him there, but no-.ooner did the
morning light appear, when I ordered him to arie and come
along with me, with certain tokens that I would give him
ome clothes like mine ; at which he eemed very glad, as be-
ing tlark naked, not o much as any thing to cover what ought
to be concealed. As We paed by the place where the two
men had been interred, my man pointed directly to their
graves, hewing me the marks that he had made to nd them
Again; giving me to underand by igns, that he hould dig
them up and devour them : Upon which I appeared extreme-
ly dipleaed, expreed my utmo abhorrence, made as if I
would vomit at the apprehe e ions of it, beckoning him with
my hand to come away, which he did with the greate rever-
encc and nbmtiion. After this I concluded him to the top
of the hill, to view if the re of the avages were yet remain-
ing there ; but when I looked through my perlpective glas, I
could ee no appearance of them, nor of their canoes, o that
it was very evident they never minded their deceaed com-
panions whom he had flain, which if they had, they would
urely have earched for, or let one boat behind for them to
follow, after they returned to their puruit.
But ill my curioity and deire of atisfaction animating my
'pifit with freh courage, l** took myVmah Fridey with me, put-
tin a word into his hand, with the" bow and arrows at his
back, which l vperceived he could ue very dexterouy, cauing
him to carry one gun for me, and-I two for myelf ; and
thus equipped again all attacks, away We marched directly
to the place oftheir bloody entertainment. But when 'I came
there, I was'lriclcen with the ulual'horrour at o dreadful a

particular igns, to make me underand, that thev had'brought
over our prionert. to fea upon, three of which they had
eaten. and that as he was the fourth, þointing to himelf:
That there had been a bloody battle between them 'and 'his

with many others ; all'which were carried, to everal places to
bedevoured by thee conqnerors, and that it was his fortune
to be brought hither by thee wretches, orthe ame purpoe. i
After I was made enible of thee things, I caued Fridaytq
gatlf noe horrid remains,and lay them together upon a
heapwhieh I ordered to be let on re and o burnt them ye,

But'uch an extreme abhorrence did I exprets at the'la ap-
pearance o it, that he durl; no otherwie than conceal ; for It
made him very enible that if he oered any uch thing I
would certainly hoot him. ,
All this being done, I carried my man with me to my calle;
and then I gave him a pair of lmcn drawen-s, which I had tak-o'
en out of the poor gunner's che before mentioned ; and
which with a little alteration tted him very well : In the'
next place I made him a jerkin of goat's kIn, uch as my hill
was able to manage, though I thought myelf then a tolerable
good taylor. I gave him alo a cap, which I made of a harte's,
kin, very convenient and fahionable. Thus being clothed!
tol-erably well, my man was no les proud of his habit, than'
I was in eeing him init. Indeed he went very ack-wardly'
in thee things at r, the drawers being too heavy on his
thighs, 'not ued to wear any weight, and the leeves of the
waitcoat galled his houlders, and the inide of his arms ; but'
a little eaing them, where he Complained they hurt him, and
uing himelf to them, at length he took to them very well.
My next concern was where I hould lodge h-m ; and that
I might do very well by him, and yet be perfectly eay myelf,
I erected a tent for him in the vacapt place between my two'
fortiications, in the inide of the la, and outide of the r :
And as there was an entranee or door in my cave, I made a
formal rarined door cae, and a door to open on the inide.
I barred it up in the night time, taking in my ladders roof;

I had not been abiove two or three days returned to my ca.
tle, but my chief deign was, how I hould' bring-Friday o'
from his horrid way of feeding; and to take from him that in-
human relih he, by nature, had been accuomed to, I thought
it my duty to let him tae other lieth, which might the rather
tempt him tothe ame abhorrence I lo often expreed again
their accured way of living. Upon which, one morning, I
took him out with me, with an intention tolslll a kid out of
the flock, and bring it home and dres it: But as I was going,
I perceived a the goat lying down in the hade, and two young
kids itting by her. 'Immediately I catched hold of my man
Friday and bidding him tand ill, and not ir, I preented my
piece, and hot one o the kids, My poor ervant, who had at
a ditance perceived me kill his adverary, and yet did notknow
by wlut means, or how it was done, ood trembling and ort.

unk into the earth. He did not ee the kid I aimed at, or*be-
held I had killed it,but ript up his waiicoat to ee it he was not
wounded, thinking my reolution was to' kill him;" o comin
to me, he ell'on his knees, earneily pronouncing many things
which! did not underand, the meaningof which at length I
perceived was, thatl would not take away his life. *
Indeed I was much concerned to lee him in that condition
where nature is upon the et-'erect trial, when the immediate
hand of death is ready to pot for ever a period to this mortal
life: And indeed o much compaon had I for this creature,
that it was with diculty I refrained from tears. But, hovtev'.
er, as another ort ofcountenance was neceary, to convinee
him that I would do him no harm, I, miling, vtook him by
the hand, then laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which
I had flain, made igns to him to fetch it, which accordingly
he did. He was no les curious in viewing how the creature
was kille"d,'th"an he had been before in beholding the Indian;
while he was, admiring it, I charged my gun again, and' pre-
ently perceived 'a great fowl like a hawk, perching uponta

the greate amihment to one who had never heard a? was
 a t ing
'a thing in his 'whole life: And really his amazement con.
itinued nlonghatxhadl allowed it, he would ,have pro.
trated himelf before me and my gun, with the greate wor-
jhip and and adoration. As For the gunin particular, he would
not ibimueh as uer his HFFXZLZOH touch it for everal days
after; but would come an zlt'þthrnunicate his thoughts to it,
and talk to it, as if the ene-tos piece had undertood and an-
weted him : All thisI could perceive him do, when hethonght
my back was turned; the ehiet'intent of which was, to de-
fire it not to kill him, as I afterwards came to underand.
'I never it-cave to prevent his admiration nor hinder, him
'from thoe comieal getures he' ued on uch occaions : But
when his aionihment was a little over, l made tokens to him
to run and fetch the parrot that I had hot, which he accord-
ingly did, aying 'ome time longer than uual, by reaon the
bird, not being quite dead, had uttcred ome way farther from
the place where he fell. In the mean time as he was looking
for her, I took the advantage of charging my gun again, that
I might be ready for another mark that might oer itelf; but
inothing more occurred at that time. So I brought home the
kid, and the ame evening took o the kin, and divided the
careae as well as QI tould. Part of this eh 'I tewed, or
boiled, in a potI had for this occaion. And then preading
'my table, I at down, giving my man ome to eat too, who
iwas wonderfully pleaed, and eemed to like it very well, hut
(what was mo l'urprimg to him, was to ee me eat alt with
it : Upon which he made me to underand, that the alt was
very had for me ; when putting a little into his mouth, he
ieemed to naueate it in uch a manner as to pit and putter
,iat it, and then wathed his mouth with freh water :* But to
hew him how contrary his opinion was to mine, I put ome
meatin my mouth without alt, and feigned to pit and putter
as much or want of it, as he (had done at it : Yet all this prov-

Well, now it was high time I hould et my ervant to work;

in a little time, asiwell as I could doit myelf. La ' *
When I conidered, that Phad two mouths to feed inead of
one, I was necearily obliged to think, that, in conequence
thereof, I mu provide more ground for my harve, and plant:
a larger quantity of corn than I commonly ued to do; upon
which I marked out a bigger piece of land, encing it in the
ame manner as I had done before; in the execution of which
I mu give Friday this good word, that no man could work
more hard or willingly than he did: And when I made him
enible that it was for bread to erve him as well as me, he
then very paonately made me underand, that he thought-I
had much more labour on me on his account alone, than i had
for mylelf; 'and that no pains or diligence hould be wanting
in him, if I would but direct him in thoe works wherein he
might ucceed.
I mu certainly own, that this was the mo pleaant year I
ever had in the iland : For, after ome time, Friday began to
talk pretty well, and underand she names of thoe things
which I was wont to call for, and the places where Iued to
end him. So that my long (lient tongue, which had been
ueles o many years, except in an exclamatory manner, either,
for deliverance or blengs, now began robe occupied, in teach-
ing and talking to my man t Friday; for indeed I had uch z
ingular atisfaction in the fellow himelf', o innocent did his

always got the better in fight. Upon which we proceeded on
the following dilcourle. You ay, aid I, that you always ght
the better; why then, Friday, how came you to be taken prin-
ibner?_ '
Fridajz. But for all that my nation beat much.
Maer. How, ay you, beat l if your nation beat them, how
came you to be taken P
Friday. They more many mans than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me: My na>
tion much over beat them in the yonder place, where me no
was ; there my nation mans beat one, two, three great tou-
and.
Maer. Then why did not your men recover you from the
hands of your enemies t .
Friday. They run, one, two, or three, and me ; they make
all go in the canon 3 my nation have no canon that time.
Maer. It's very well, Friday: But what does you-r nation
do' witlitthe prioners they take? What do they carry them a-
way, and eat them, as thee have done 2
Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat up all.
Mater. To what place do they carry them to be devoured?
Friday. Go to other nations where they think. '
.Macr. Do they bring them hither t
Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other place.
Maer. And have you been with them here, Friday?
Friday. Yes, me been here : (pointing to the north we of
the iand, being the ide where they ued to land.)
Thus having got what account I could from my man, I
plainlyunderood, that he had been as bad as any of the re
of the rannibals, having been formerly among the avages, who
ued to come on hore on the farthe part of the iand, upon
the ame bloody occaions as he was brought here for: And
ome time after 1 carried him to that place where he pointed 5
and no ooner did he come there, but he preently knew the
ground, ignifying to tue, that he was once there, when they
ate up twenty men, two women, and a young child. But nshe
could not explain the number in Englzh, he did it by o many
tones in a row, making aiign to me to count them.
This paage I have the rather mentioned, becaue, it led to
things more important and ueful for me to knowne For after
I had 'this tatisfa-Zgry dicoure with him, my next quetion
was, how far it M''om the illand to the there, and whether
the canoes were. not often lot in the ocean t to which he an-
Þivnered, there was no danger, no'canoes ever lot; but that af-
zer- a little way out to the eact, there was a rong current, and
i wind always one way 'in theyatetnoon. This I thought at
r to. be no more than the ets of 5 the tide, of going out, or
coming in si but I afterwards undertood it was ocmcnehdcby
i t
the great draught and retinx  the mighty river Draw-take, in the
motcttth or gulph of which imagined my kingdom lay-3 and
that the land which I perceived to the W. and N. W. mut be
the 'great iiand Tiz'm'd'ad, on the north ot the river. A thou-
and queltions (if that would atisfy me) did I ak Friday about.r
the nature of the country, the ee, the eoais, the inhabitants,
and what nations were neare them : To which queions, the
poor fellow declared all he knew,with the greate openneis and
utmo incerity. When I demanded of him the particular
names of the various nations of his ort of people, he could
only anwer me in general that they were called Carz'bdee,
Hence it was I conidered, that thee mu be the Caribbees, o
much taken notice of by our maps to be on that part ot Am:-
rim, which reaehes rom the mouth o titC river Omorwko to
Gzzz'ama, and o on to St. Mart/m. Then Friday proceeded to,
tell me, that up a great way beyond the moon, as much as to
lay, beyond the etting of the moon, which mut be W. from.
their country, there dwelt white bearded men, uch as I was,
painting to my whikers, and that they had killed much man-s.
I was not ignorant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated-
thee creatures; o that I preently concluded it mu be them,
whoe eruelties had pread throughout Alma-Sea, to be remem-
hered even to ucceeding generations.
Well, you may be ure, this knowledggwhieh the imper-
fect information of my man had let me to, was very comforta-
bie to me, and made me o curious as to ak him, how I might
depart from this iland, and get among thoe white men i he
told me, yet, yet, I might go in two comes. In two canoes,
thought I, what does my man mean? urely he means one for
himeland another for me; and if not', how mu two canoes
hold me, without being joined, and then put one part of my
body in one, and the other part in the other; and indeed it'
wasa long WilliC before I undertood his meaning, whichtwas,
that it mui be a large boat as-big as two canoes, able to bear
wzith'the waves, and not o liableto be overet as a mall one
mut have been,
I believe there is no iate of life' but what may be happy, if
people wouid but endeavour er their part to make it o. He
IS not the liappib man that has the mo riches, but he that is
content with what he hath. Before I had myervant I thought
n'tyelfmierable till I had him 5 and now I enjoyed the happy
benets of him, I retained the ame thoughts for wantiof a de-
live-rance from a place of retirement, eae and plenty, where Providence had uciently hleed me: In a word, from this
time Ientertained ome hopes, that one time or other I might
nd an ppportnnity to make my ecape from this iland, and?
What this 'poor lawage might. be a great furtherance mentum
All the time ince my man became o intelligent as to un-
derand and peak to me, I pared no pains or diligence 'to in-
tuct him, according to my poor ha re of knowledge, in the
principles of religion, and the adoration that he ought to pay
to the true God. One time, as I very well remember, I aked
him who made him P at firt, the innocent creature did not
undertand what I meant, but rather thought I aked him, who
-was his father 2 upon which I tool; another way to make him
jeuible, by demanding of him an anwer to this queion;
Friday, (aid I) who is it that made the ea, this ground where-
on we wall-e, and all thee hills and woods which we behold ;
and here indeed I did not mis of my intention; for he told
me it; was one old Benamactee, (the God whom 1 uppoed
thee avages adored) who lived a great way beyond all. But
'as for his attributes, poor Friday was an utter ranger to them.
He could decribe notiig of this great peron ; and all that
he could ay was, that he was very old, much older than the
jea and-land, the moon, or the ars. Friday, (aidl again) if
'his great and old peron has made all things in the world, how
eomes it to pas, that all things, as me in particular, do not a-
'dore andworhip him? upon' this looking very grave, with a
perfect weet look of innocence, he replied, Maer, all things
ay O to bim, by which it may reaonably be uppoed he meant
adotation. And where, aid I, do the people of-your country
go when they die? he anwered, they all go to Bezzamuckee.
What, and thoe people that are eaten up, do they go there ?
Said he, Benamuckee ome them dear-chi; we pray to Benamuc-
kee in de Canon, and Benamuckee would love me, twhen dey eat
I'
a me all up. .
Such dicoures as thee had I with thy man,and ueh as made
me enible, that the true God is worhipped, though under im-
Þerect militudes. And that the fale adoration which the
heathens give to their imaginary deity, is as great an argument

; But leaving thee determinations aide, more t for theable
divines than me to' dicus, I began to inruct my ervant in
'the aving knowledge of the true Deity; in which, the direc-
tions of God's holy pirit aied me. I lifted up my hands td
heaven,
heaven', and painting there-to, told him, that the' greatMaker
at' heaven and earth lived there: That as his innite power'
faihioned this world out of a confued c/aaas, and made it in
that heantitul frame which we behold, lo he govetns and pre-
erves it, by his undoubted knowledge, overeign greatnels, and?
peculiar Providence r That he was omnipotent, could do every
thing for us, give every thing to us, and take every thingaway
from us : That he was a rewarder and puniher ofgood and evil
actions : That there was nothing but what he knew, no thoughts'
o leuet but he could bring to light : And thus by degrees I
opened his eyes, and detcribed to him the manner of the creationv
or the World, the ituation oparadie, the tranlgrellions of out:
rlt Parents, the wickednes of God's peculiar people, and the
univeral ins and abominations of the whole eatth.. When'
thee things 'were implanted in his rmind, I told him that asi
God's juice was equal to his mercy, he reolved to deroy
this world, till his on, Yeu; Chri, intergoed in our beha,
and to procure our redemption, obtained leave of his heavenly
Father to come down from heaven into the world, where he'
took human nature upon him', inructed us in our way to etern
nal life, and died as a acrice for our ins: That he was now
acended into heaven, mediating for our pardomlkde-livering
otir petitions, and obtaining all thoe benets we aked,
in his name, by humble and hearty prayers, which' were heard=
inethe throne of heaven. As yery frequently I ued to incul-
cate things into his mind, Friday one day told me that if on:

be a greater God 'than their Benamuckre, who zlived but a little)
way,,and yet could' not hear them, till theyacended the great

Friday, (laid l) you than know, that before this world was
made, there was one Almighty Power, exient before the be.
ginning, by whoe power all things were made, and whoe
majey 'hall haire no end. To he gloried and adotcd by be-
ings of a heavenly nature, he created angels and archangels,
that is, glorious pirits reembling himelf', to encompas round
his throne, eternally inging forth his praite in the mo hea-
venly ounds and divine harmony. And among this heavenly
choir, Lacfkr bore a great way, 'as being then one of the par-
ticular avourites of thee celeiial abodes : But he, contrary
to that duty he owed his heavenly overeign, with unbounded
ingratitude to his divine Creator, not only envied him that ad-
oration which was his due, but thought to uurp that throne,
which he hadncither power to keep, nor title to pretend to.
He raied a diention and civil war in heaven, and had a num-
her of angels to take his part. Unbounded folly z upendons
Eride; thtis to hope for victory, and a'pire above his powerful
reatorl the Deity, not fearful o uch an enemy, yet july
þrovoked at this rebellion, commions his archangel St. Mi-
tbael to lead forth the heavenly ho, and give-him battle; the
advantage of which was quickly perceived, by Satan's being
overthrowo; and the prince of the air, (for o the Devil was
called) with an his fallen angels, driven headlong into a di-
inal lace, which is called hell.
T i'e recital of this truth made my man give the greate at-
tention, and he expreed a great atisfaction, by his geures,
that God had ent the devil into the deep hole. And then I
deli'red him to 'give great heed to what I had further lo ay.
No ooner (proceeded 1) was God freed from, and the heav-
ens clear of 'this arch traitor, but the Rather peaks to the Son
and Holy Spirit, who belonged to his eence, yet equal to him,

both under the heavenly diplealpre.
Here Friday expreed a great concern: Ah! poor n'am-I'
(cried he) nazzgbty Womans! naugbty Devil! make God not lowe-
a'e mam', make man like Devil þitzgef.
Friday, aid I, God till loies mankind; and though the
Devil tempted human nature o far, he would not uer him
to have abolute poweroverthem. l have told you before of
his tender love to his people, till they, like Luczfrr, diobeyed
his commands and rebelled again him; and that even then,
how jelus Chrit his only on came to ave inners. But till
every man that lives in the world, is under temptation and tria
al. The Devil has yet a power, as prince of the air, to ulgge:
evil cogitations in our minds, and prompt us on to wicked ac-
tions, that he might glory in our detruction. Whatever evil
thoughts we have, proceeded from him. So that God, in this
our direls, expects that we hould apply oorelves to him by
fervent prayer for our peedy redres ; He is not like Bend-
muc/eee, to let none come near him but Oa-wokakee 3 but uers-
the people as well as pries, to oer themelves at his feet,
thereby to be delivered from the power and temptation ot the-
Devil.
But though at rfl, my man Friday expreed ome concern
at the wickcdnes of Lucg'ex, t found it not o ealy to imprint-
the right notions of him in his mind, as it was about the di-
vine elence of God t. For there nature aited me in all my
arguments to hew to him plainly the necctj of a great r:-
caue, and overruling governing power,,a lecret directing pro-
vidence, and othe equity and reaonablenes of paying adorn-
tion to our Creator :_ Whereas there appeared nothing of all
this in the notion of an evil pirit, of his firt beginning, his
nature, and above "all, of his inclination to evil actions, and;
his power to tempt us onto the like. 'And indeedwthis un.

By the contant applications I made of "the ceiptures, as I
read them tomy man Friday, l ear-nely endeavoured 'to make
him undertand every part of it, as, much as lay in my POWCF-
He aloon the other hand, by his: very ferion's quettions and
' enqniries,
enquiries, made me a much better procimt in criptme
knowledge than l hould have been by my own private read-
ing and udy. I mut not omit adolher thing proceeding from
the experience I had in my retirement; it was, that innite
and inexpreiihle hleng, the knowledge of God through
Wri J'cs, which was' o plain and eay to be underood, as
immediately to direct me to carry on the great work ofincere
repentance for my ne, and laying hold of a Siviour for eternal
il'e, to a practical ated reformatioo, and obedience to all:
God'siniitutions, without the aiitaoce of a reverend and or-
thodox divine; and epecially by this ame inruction, o to-
enlighten this avage creature, as to make him (me a good
ehriian as very few could exceed him, and there was only
this great thing wanting, that l had no authority to ad miniier
'he holy larrament, that heavenly participation of Chri's body
and blood 5 yet howe'--r we reed ourlelves content that God
would accept our deires, and, ac'ording to out faith, have
mercy on us.
But what we wanted one way, was made up in another, and
that was uoiver peace in our little church. We hacl- no
diputes or wranglmgs about the nature of eq oality ofthe holy,
bleed, and undivided Trinity; no niceties in i doctrine, or-
fchemes of church govetnmen-ez no fomzand moroe dienters
to impoe more ublimated notions upon us, nor p'edamic
ophiiers, to confound its with unintelligihle myeries: but
inead of all this, we enjoyed the mo certain guide to hea-
ven ; that is, the Word of God, beides which we had the
comfortable views of His Spirit leading usi-jnto the truth, and
making us both willing and obedient to the inruction of his
Word. And as the knowledge and practice of which are the
principal means of alvation, l cannot fee what it can Bil-tail any
Chriiianchurch or man in the world, to amue themelves
with every indierent pecolaiion and opinion, except thoe-
v'ho have a mind to Aiplay their particular vanity and aec-
tation. -
You may well uppoe thzt, by 'thee common diconres we
had together, my main and I became molt intimately acquaint-
ed, and that there was but very little that I Could ay, but'
Friday underood, peaking ved; uently, though indeed it
was but broken Englih. And really I now took a particular
pleaure in relating all my adventures, epecially thoe that
occured ince my being ca onlthis ill-and. I made him un-
derand the wonderful myery, as he conceived of gtmpowu
der and bulle't, and taught him how to hoot : I alo preented
him: knife, which pleaed him exceedingly; making him a.
belt with a rog hanging thereto, like thoe in which we wear
hangers in England ; and inead ofa hanger to put 'in that

more excellent weapon upon any other occaion. ln a word,
my man thus accomred, looked upon himelf as great as
you szyz'xate, when that celebrated champicn went to combat
the wind mill. '
After all this, I gavelhim a very particular decriptionv of
the territoriesofumpe, and in a particular manner of Old
England, the place ofmy nativity. i laid before him the man-
ner ofour worlhipping God, our behaviour to one another,
and how we tradcd in hips to every part of the univere. l
then told him my misfortunes in being hipwrecked, hewing
him, as near as I could, the place where the lhipylay, which
had been gone long before. I brought him to 'the ruins of

but now was almot rotten and fallen to pieces. I oberved
my man Friday to view this hoar with an uncommon Curioity,
uhich when he had done, he ood ponderinga great while and
aid nothing. At lat, aid I, Friday what makes you pon.

* [was tome time indeed before I underood what my man
meant; but examining farther into it, I plainly found uch
another boat reembling that, had come to the country where

the boat was driven theie through violent llorms and lrcs
of weather. lt preently cameinto my mind, that ome Eu-

and being all, as I thought, drowned, I never concerned mylelf
to all: any thing about them, but t y only enquiry was about
the boat, and what decription my an could give of it.
Indeed Friday anwered my demands very well, mak.

Some coniderable time after; upon a very pleaant day, in

on the ea ide of the iland, whence I had once befor'e beheld
the eontinent of Amerira. I could not tell immediately what

dicover whether he was deceittul in his thoughts and inclina-

ient with the belt principles, both as a religious chriian and
grateful friend 5 and indeed l ound every thing he aid was o
mgenuous and innocent, that I had no room for upicion, and,
in pite of all uneaincs, he not- only made me entirely his own
again, but alo caued me much to lament that I ever concei-v.
ed one ill though-t of him. a . A
As we were walking up the ame hill another day, when the
weather being o hazy at lca that 1 could not perceive the con-
tment, Friday, aid l, don't you wilhyourell to be in your own
country, your own nation, among your old friends and ac-
quaintance 3 es, aid he, me mue/2 0 glad to be in: my own na-

you turn wild again, eat man's Rein, and be a avage as you

ing his head) Friday 'to-w tell them to lime good, tell tbrm to Pray

they will kill you, and to manife their contempt of uch in.
ruction, may eat you up when they have done. He then put
on a grave, yet innocent and mooth countenance, aying, m,
'lazy no kill me, they willing lawe learn; that is, that they would
be very willing to learn ; adding withal, that they bad learn much

could not twim o far. But, laid I, l will make 'ac-arme for

I go, Friday! laid I, why would zou have them eat me up,
and devour your kird maier? No no, aid he, me make the) m'
eat mit/ler, me make they much lawe you; that is, he woufd tell
them how l had ain his enemies, and thereby aved his life,
for which reaon he would make them love me : And then he
related to me, as well as he was able, how exceeding kind thoe
of' his nal-tion were to the white, or hearded men as he called
them, who in their great calamity, were driven into their coun-
try.
It was from this time, indeed, I had trong inclinations to
venture over, and me my utmo eorts, if poble, to join
thee white 'headed men, who. undoubtedly were Spaniards or
Partugue' : For (thought I) it mu be certainly a better and
ate-r way to ecape when there is a good company, than for me
alone, from an iiand forty miles o the hore, and without a-
ny aiilance. Some days after, Friday and 1 being at work as
ulual, at the ame time diverting ourelvcs with various dil'.

coures, I told him [had a boat which I would hetow upon
him, whenever he pleaed to return to his own nation r And to
convince' him of the truth ofwhat I aid, I took him with me
to the other ide of the iland where my rigate lay, and then
taking it from under the water (for I always kept it unk for
fear of a dicovery) we both went into it, to ee how it would
manage uch an expedition.
Really never could any ibe more dexterous in rowing than
my faithful ervant, making the boat go as al'l again as I
could. Well now, Friday, (aid I) hall we go to your o
much admired nation P But intead o meeting with that cheer-
ulnes l expected, he looked very dull and melancholy at my
aying o; which indeed at r urprized me, till hemade me
enible that. his concern was about the boat's being too mall
to go o far a voyage. Upon which I let him underand I
had a much bigger; and accordingly the next day, went to
the place where the r boat lay which I had made, when all
the rength I had, or art could ue, failed me in my attempt
to get into the viater; but now, it having lain in the un two
and twenty years, and no care being taken of it all that while,
it became in a manner rotten. My man told me, that uch a
boat would do very well for the purpoe ; ucient to carry'
enough rvz'ttle, drink, bread, for that was his manner of talking.
In hort, my mind being rongly xed upon my deign of go-
ing over with him to the continent, I very plainly told him
thatwe would both go, and make a boat full as big, and more
proportionable than that, where he might afely return to his
own nation.
Thee words I oberved made Friday look o very penive,
that I thought he would have fallen at my eet'. It was ome-
time before he would peak a word, which made me ak him
what wastlte matter with him ? He rcplied, in a very lot and
moving tone, iwbat ba: poor Friday done ? JV/zy are you angry

thoughts of going there without me. I go there, Fridqy! aid

make your nation enible of, when I myelf am but a poor ig-
norant man? No na,'ma/Ier, aid he, you be no ignorant, you
reacbee me good, you teache-e 'be'n good. You hall go without
me Friday, aid I, for I don't care to accompany you thither :
I would rather live in this olitude, than to venture among
uch inhuman avages. Go your way, ince you deire it, and
leave me alone by my'el, as I was before I aved your life.
Never was any creature more thunder truck than Friday
was at thee words, Go me away, lewe'maer away ! aid he,
after a long lence. No He," Friday die; Friday-nor time mer
gone! as though he had aid, I neither can nor will live if my
matter ends me from'him. And here I cannot but take no-
tice of the trong ties of friendhip, which many times urpas
thoe of conanguinity : For-often we nd a great diagreement
among kindred; and when there is any eeming regard for
each other, 'tis very eldom true, and carce ever laing,if
powerful intere does not bear the wayz andthat alone is
often the occaion of 'the greate hatred in the world; which
is to deire the death of 'parents and relations, for the ake of
enjoying their fortunes : But here was no uch thing between.
my et-vant and me; inead of which, there was nothing but
gratitude, and the mcere love: He foundme not only his
deliver-er, but his ipreerver and comorter : Not a evere and
cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving, and aable friend. He want-
ed for no manner of uenance ; and when he was ill, or out of
Order, I was his Phyician, not only for his body, but his foul :
and therefore it was no wonder that uch an innocent creature,
long ince divelted of his former natural cruelty, hould have

an uncommon concern at o cruel a eparation from me, which,
pierced him to the very onl, and made him deire even to die
rather than live without me.
Ater I had told Friday, in a very careles manner, that he
Should be at his liberty as oon as the boat was made, the lan-
guage of his eyes expreed all imaginable Confuion, whenim-
mediately running to one of his hatchets which he ued to wear
as a mo deenive weapon, he gives it into my hand, with 2:
heart o full that he could carce peak. Friday, aid I, Whak
its-It you mean t What mu I do with this? Ozzþ: l-z'll Friday,
ozdbe, Friday no care live long. But what mu I kill you for,
replied I again. Ab! dear Maer, ewher makejau Friday ome
from eat a me up, h keep long Friday, make Friday lowe God,
and not lowe Benamuckee; and norw Friday end away, 'se-ver
'e Friday more! As though the poor creature had laid, Alas!
my deare, kinde Maer, how comes it to pas that after
havtngyentured your precious life to ave me from the jaws Of
devounog cannibals, like myel; after uch a tender regard
to

ing o long a kind maller, and mut incere friend ; and after-
rnaking me orake the fale notion of an Indian deity, and
worhip the true God, in prit and in truth: after all this I,
ay, how comes it now, that you are willing to end me away
to my former coure of living, by which means undoubtedly
ne hall be dead to each other; but greater mut be my mis-
fortune, that l hall never behold the be friend I have in this
world any more! And this certainly, though he could not ex-
pres himelf lo fully, mu be his entiments; for the tears
ran down his cheeks in uch a plentiful manner, that l had;
much ado torerain from weeping alo, when I beheld the poor
rreature's aection : So that I was forced to comfort him in
the bet manner, which I did by telling him, if he was content
to abide with me, [hould be ever willing to keep him.
. After Fridays grief was omething abated, more fully to
eonvince me of his, aection, he aid O 'na/ler, me not (are be it:
z'zy rzatien, leave-you here; me' deire my nation learn good, that all ;
meaning that. his deire was for the converion of that harbar.
ous people. But as I had no apoolic miion, nor any con.
eem about their alvation; o I had neither the leil inten-
tion or deires-ii under-taking it ; and the rength of my incli-
nation, in order to ecape, proceeded chiey from my late di.
coure with Fridqy. about thee eventeen white þearded men,
that had been driven upon the barbarian coa, whom l deign,
ed tojoin with, as a urer means to . further our ecape. To
which intent my man and I went to earch for a proper tree to
fell, whereof we might make a large periagoa, or canoe, to
undertake the voyage : And indeed we needed not be long in
nding one t for our purpoe, there being wood enough in
the iland to have built a eet of large Veels; but the thing
we principally wanted was, to get one o near the water, that
we might lannch it after it was nihed, and not commit o
horrid a mitake as I had done once, many years before.
VJell, after a great earch for what was hell and mo con-
venient, Friday at lat, whoe judgment in uch aairs was
much operior to mine, pitched upon a kind of wood the molt
tting for it. To this day I cannot tell the name of the tree I
cut it from, nor decribe it any other way, than only by laying,
that it is very like what we call uiic, or betwixt that and the
Nicaragua wood, being much of' the ame colour and mell.
But though my man exceeded me in the knowledge of the
mo proper tree, yet I hewed hir'n a much better and cleaner
way to make a canoe than ever he knew before : For he was
for burning the hollow or cavity o the tree, in order to make
this boat: but I then told him how we might do it with tools,
learning him at the ame time how to ue them, which indeed
he did very dexterouly z o that in a month's labour,.we t'in--.

ifhed it, making it very handome, by cutting the outide into
the true hape of a boat. After this it took ua full a fortnight
before we could get her into the water, which we did as it
were, inch by inch, upon great rollers ; But when he was in,
the would have carried twenty men with all the eae imagin-
able. .
As I was 'very well pleaed, you may be lure, at the launch-
' g of this man of war of mine, 1 was no les amazed to behold
ith what dexterity my man would manage her, turn her, and
paddle her along. Well, Friday aid I, what do you think of
it now? Do you think this will carry us over? Te: llaett,
aid he, me venture o-ver well, though great blow wind. But
my deign was yet farther, which he was inenible of, and that
was to make a malt and fail, and to provide her with an an-
chnr and &able. As for a ma, that was no dicult thing at:
all to procure ; o l xed upon a rait young cedar tree, which
1 ound near the place, there abounding great plenty of it in
the itland ; and etting Friday to cut it down, I gave him par-
vcular directions how to hape and order it; but as to the fail,
that belonged to me only. I very well knew I had ome oid

Lame to look over them, I found them almo all rotten, ex-
ssept two; and with thee I went to work, and after a great
deal of pains, and aukward tedioustt tching, for want of nee-
dles, I nihed at length a 'three corner'd ugly thing, like
what we call in Englarz'da houlder of mutton ail, to go with
boom at bottom, and a little mall prit at the top, like thole
which our long boats ue, and which I very well knew how to
manage 5 epecially ince it was like that which I had in my
patron's hing boat, when, with my boy Xiny, I made my
eieape from the Barzbarzy hare. .
it was near two mouths, l-think, before I completed this
'k-tforlc, that is, the rigging and tting my ma and fails ;t and
.ndeed they were nicely done, having made a mall ay, and a

But what with the many dull contrivances I had aho nt it, and
the failure of many things, it co me as much pains' in order-
ing. as in making the boat. Beides, when all this was done, I

the ea by the ame, and how the ail gibbed and filled, this
way, or that way, as the coure we ailed changed. After
ome time, and a little ue, I made all thee things very familiar
to him, o that he became an expert ailor, except in relation to
the compas; and that I could make him underand but very
little of. But as it happened there was eldom occaion for it,
there being but little cloudy weather, and carce ever any og
in thoe parts; the tars were always viible in the night, and
the hore perpicuous by day, except in the rainy eaon,which
conned every one around them to their habitations.
Thus entered in the even and twentieth year of my reign,
or captivity, which you pleae, (the la three of which bleled
with the company of my man Friday, ought not to be reckon-
ed) I kept the anniverary of my landing here, with the ame
thankfulnes to God, for his tender mercies, as I did before z
and certainly, as I had a great caue for a thankful acknowl-
edgement for my deliverance at r, I had much greater now,
for uch ingular and additional teimonies of the care of Prov-
idence over me, in all my direes, both of body and mind,
and the-great hopes I had of being eectually and peedily de-
livered; for I had a rong impreion upon my mind, that I
hould not be another year in this iand: But however, I ill
continued on with my huhandry; digging, planting and ence-
.ing as uual :, Gathering and curing my grapes, and doing all
other things that were ne eary for me.
And now the rainy ealon beginning to come upon me, o-
bliged me to keep the longer within doors ; but beore this l
brought my nezw veeljjmo the creek, where I, had landed my
rats from andghauling her up to the hore, l ordered
my man Frz'dqy'to diga dock ucient to hold her in, and deep
enough to" give her water, wherein (he might oat ; and then
when the was out, we made a rong dam acros the end
of it, to keezgttpthe water ; by which means the lay dry, as to
the tide the ea; and to keep the rain from her, we
zhatchedher over, as it were, with boughs o trees, like a
houe; and o waited for the mouths of Narvember and Decem-
, ber, in which I deigned to venture over the ocean.
No ooner did the eaonable weather begin to draw near, but
o much was I elevated by this new deigned adventure, that l
daily prepared for the voyage. The r thing I thought of
was, to lay by a certain quantity of proviions, as a ucient
ore for uch an expedition, intending in a week or fortnight's
time to open the dock and launch out the boat for that pur-
ppe. But one morning, as 1 was very buy upon omething
neceary for this occaion, I called Friday to me, and bid him
go to the ea more, and ee if he could nd a turtle or tortoie,
a thing which we commonlyad once a week, as much upon

long been gone, but he came running back, as though he
was purued for life, and, as it were, flew over my outward
wall or ence, like one that elt not the ground, or eps he et
his feet on; and beorel had time to enquire the reaon of
his precipitation, he cries out, O Maer! O dear Maer! O
orrortmorrorwl bad! Obad! Why, what's the matter, Fria-
day ? aid I. Oyonder, yonder, aid he, there be one, t'wo three

man's way of reckoning; but on a. ricter enquiry, I ound
there was but three. Well, Friday, aid I, don't be terried,
I warrant you we will not only defend durelves again them,
but kill the mo o thoe cruel avages. But though I com-
orted him in the be manner I could, the poor creature trem-
bled o, that I carce knew what to do with him : O Maer,
ays he,tbe_*y come look Friday, (at piece: Friday eala me up. Why,
Friday, aid I, they will eat me up as well as you, and my
danger is as great as yours : But inceit is o, we mu reolve
to ght for our lives : What ay you ? can you ght, Friday ?
Ties, aid he very faintly, mehaat, me kill 'what I can, but there
came great margy number. That's no matter, aid I "again, our
gons will territy thoe that we do not kill : 1 am very willing
to tand by you till the lat drop o my blood ; now tell me, it
you will do the like by me,and obey my orders in whatoever I
command P Friday then anwered, O Maer, me Iq? lz'foryoa,
me die cwbenjou bid die. Thus concluding all queions con-
cerning his delity, immediately 1 fetched a good dram of tum,
(of which I had been a very good huhand) and gave it him
to comfort his heart. After he had drank it, I ordered him
to take the two fowling pieces, which we always carried, and
load them with large wan hot as big as mall pioi bullets;
then I took our mukets, and loaded them with two ings, and
ve mall bullets each, charging my two piois each with
a brace. I hung my great word, as cuomary, naked to my
ide, and gave Friday his hatchet, as a mot certain weapon of
defence.
Thus prepared,l thought, as well as any Knight errant
that ever handleda word and pear, I took my perpective
glas, and went up the ide ofthe hill, to ee what I eouldikfg
cover ; and I perceived very oon, by my gias, that there was'
one and twenty avages, three prioners, and three canoes z and;
that their chief concern eemed to be the triumphant quet upon the three poor human bodies, a thing which by,


. 'in-ac
time] had oberved was very common with them. hence I alo remarked, that they did not land at What =p£g
from whence Friday made his ecape, but nearertothe creek:
where the there was low, and where a thick wood came very
cloe to the ca. And then it was my oul_was filled with indig-
nanon

nation and abbot-rence of uch inituman wretches, that put a
period to all my former thoughts in their vindication ; neither
would I give myelti time to conider their right of conquel', as
I had done before. But decending from the mountain, I
came down to Friday, and told him, l was reolved to go 'pee-
dily to them and kill them all ; aicmg him again, in the lame
breath, if he would and by me? When by this time being
recovered from his right, and his pirits much cheered with
the dram I had given him, he was very pleaant, yet eriouly
telling me, as he did before, 'when I bid die, he would die.'
And now it was, that having xed my reolution in o trong
a manner, that nothing could dive my brea from its uncom-
ctimon fury, l immediately divided the arms already charged be.
tween us. To my man Friday l gave a piiol to tick in his
girdle, with three guns upon his houlder, a weight too great
1 confes to bear ; but what mut a poor king do, who had but
one oldier in the world t But to hew I made him bear no
more than what I would lay on myel, I tuck the other piitz-l
in my girdle, and the three guns upon my houlders, nay ome,
thing more, but that was like zEap's burthen, a mall bottle of
rum, which oon was lightened to our exceeding retrehment,
'Thus we marched out, under a ponderous load ot' armour, yet,
like two invincible Champions, with a quantity of powder and
bullets to and our battle, when the pieces were dicharged.
And now my orders being to be obeyed, I charged Friday to
keep cloe behind me, and not to ir, or hoot, or attempt any
thing till l commanded him, and, in the intenm, not to peak
o much as one word. It was in this order I fetched acornpals
to my right hand, of near a mile, as well to get over the creek
as to attain the wood ; and by this 1 thought to come within
hot of them before I could be dicerned 5 as I found by my
glas, was no dicult thing to accomplilh.
But how ckle and wavering is the mind of man, even in our,
greate fury, and tronget inclination; for while I was taking
this march, my reolutions began to abate, not through fear or'
their numbers, who were a parcel of naked unarmed wretch.-
es; but thee reections occured to my thoughts, as what
power was I commioned with, or what occaion or neceity
had I to go and imbrue my hands in human blood, and mur-
der people who had neither done, nor intended to do me any
wrong t They were innocent in particular as to me ; and their
barbarous Cuom was not only their misfortune, but a ign
that God had left them in the mot immene tupidity ; but yet
did not appoint me to be a judge of their actions, much les
an executioner of his righteous judgments ; that on the con-
trary, whenever he thought t, he would take vengeance. on
lthem himelf, and punih them in a national way, according to
their national crimes; but this was nothing at all to mel, 'TO
'la

had no concerns with them. Indeed my man Friday might
juiy himelf, becaue they were his declared enemies, of that
very ame nation that went to acrifice him before; and in-
deed it was lawful for him to attack them, which l could not
ay was o in repect to me. So warmly did thee things pres
upon my thoughts all the way I went, that I only reolved 'o
place myelf o, as to behold their bloody entertainmeot, with.
out falling upon them, except omething, more than ordinary,
by God's pecial direction, hould oblige me thereto.
Thus fixed in myreolution, [entered into the thick wood (my
man Friday following me cloe behind) when, with all poible
warines and filence, I marched till l came to the kirt of it,
on that ide which was the neare to them 5 for only that one
end of the wood interpoled between me and them. Upon
which I called very oftly to Friday, and hewed him a great
tree, that was ju at the corner of the wood, I ordered him to
repair thither, and bring me word, if he could plainly perceive
their actions : Accordingly, he did as I commanded him, and
came back with thismelancholy tory, that they were all about
their fire, eating the eh of one of their prioners z and that
another lay bound upon the and, a little diant from them,
which they deigned to be their next acrice; and this, be
told me, was not one oftheir nation, but one of thee very
bearded men, who was driven by a lorm into their country,
and whom he had o often talked to me about. Ybu may be
ure: that upon hearing this, my oul was ready to ink within
me; when acending up into a tree, I aw plainly 'by my
glas, a white man, who lay upon the beach of the, fea, with
lus hands and feet tied with ags, or things reembling nihes,
being covered with clothes, and eemed to be a European)
From the tree where I took this propect, I perceived another

might come at undicovered, and then I hould be within half

mote perfectly revenged upon them made me withhold my

ble, when going back about twenty paces, I got behind ome
buhes, which held all the way till I came to the other tree t
and then I acended a little riing ground, not above eighteen
yards diance from us, and there [had a full view of thee
creatures, and I could perceive all their actions.
Such a ight did then appear, as obliged me not to loe a
moment's time. There were no les than nineteen of thee
dreadful wretches eated upon the ground, cloe huddled to- -

untie the bands from his teet, in order or death,-as fetters are
knocked o from the feet of malefact-ors beore they go to
the place of execution. Herenpon immediately turning to my
man, now, Friday, aid I, mind what I ay, fail in nothing, but
do exactly as you ee me do. All which he promiing he
would perform, I et down one o my mufkets and the ow-ling
piece upon the ground, and Friday did the ame by his ; and
with the other mulket I took my aim at the avages, bidding
him do the like ; are you ready t aid I, Yes, Maer, aid he.
Why then re at them, aid I 3 and that very moment I gave
fire likewie.
For my part, I killed one and wounded two z but my 'man
Friday taking his aim much better than I, killed two and
wounded three more. You may be ure they were in a dread-
ful conlernation, at uch an unexpected dilaier ; and thoe
who yet had ecaped our penetrating hot, immediately jnmped
upon their feet, but were in uch Confuion, that 'they knew
not which way to run or look, not knowing from whence their
deflrnction came. XVe then threw down our pieces and took'
up others, giving a econd dreadful volley 3 but as they were
loaded only with wan hot, or mall piol hullets, we perceiv.
ed only two of them fall ; but o many were wounded, that
they ran yelling and creamingabout like mad creatures. Now,
Friday, aid I, lay down your piece, and take up the muket,
and follow me. He did o with great courage, when hewing
ourelves to the avages, we gave a great lit-nt, and made dl-
rectly to the poor victim, who would have been acriced,

and do what you can. And indeed he did o with uch conr-
age and intrepidity, that he ent two of them to pieces in an
inant, (the avages not having the power to y for their
lives.) I ordered Friday to run or thoe pieces we had left at
the tree, which he brought to me with great witnes, and then
l gave him my mucet, while I loaded the re. But now
a Leg-'A
there happened axeree encounter between the Spam'ard and
one otthe avages, who had made at him with one of their
wooden (words ; and though the former was as brave as
could be expected, having twice wounded his enemy in the

The avagesm the canne woi'kod very hard to get out of
our reach, and Friday was as eager in puruing them; and
indeed I was no les anxious about their ecape, le, after the
news had been carried to their people, they hould retur-n in
multitudes, and deroy us. So being relolved to purue them,
Ijumped into one of their canoes, and bid Friday to follow
me; but no ooner was I in, when to my urprize, I found
another poor creature bound hand and foot for the aughter,
ju as the Spam'ard had been, with very little lie in him.
immediately 1 unbound him, and would have helped him up,
but he could neither and nor peak, but groaned piteouv,
thinking he was only unbound in order to be flain. .Hereupon
I bid Friday peak to him, and tell him o his deliverance;
when pulling out my bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a
dram 5 which, with thejoyt'ul news he had received, o re-
Vi'v'ccl his heart, that he at up in the boat. As oon as Fri-
day began to hear him peak, and looked more fully inhis
face; it would have moved any one to tears to perceive his 'im-
common tranports of joy ; for lie kied him, embraced him,
iiugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced,

head: then uing and jumped. admit again, like a diiracted

creature ; o that it was a great wliilelheore I could make him
peak to me, or tell me what was the matter with him ; but
when he came to the liberty ot his peech, at lat he told me,
it was his father.
Here indeed I was innitely moved to ee the dutiul and
tender aertzon this poor avage had to his aged parent. He
would it down by him in the boat, open his hreat, and hold
his father's head cloe to his booni hal an hour together to
nourih it ; then he took his arms and ankles, which were
liand numoed with binding, and chaed and rubbed them
with his hands ; by which means, perceiving what the cae
zk'as, I gave him ome tum, which proved of great benet to
inn.
VJhile we were buy in this action, the avages had gotten
almot out oight ; and happy it was we did not purue them;
for there aroe from the-north wet, which continued all night
long, uch a violent orm, that I could not uppoe otherwie,
but that they were all drowned. Atter this, called Friday
to me, and alced him, if he had given his ather any bread t
He (hook his head, and aid, None, 71010'26' bit, me eat a up all ;
o l gave him a cake of bread out ot a little pouch I carried
for this end. I likewie gave him a dram for himelf, and two
or three bunches o rai'ins for his father. Both thee he car-
ried to him, for he would make him drink the dram to comort
him. Away he then runs out of the boat as il he was bewitch-
ed, with uch an extraordinarary wit'tnes, that he was out of
ight as it were in an intant ; but at his return I** perceived
him lacken his pace, becaue he had omething in his hand:
And this I ound to be, as he approached nearer, an earthen
jug to bring his father ome water in, with two more cakes of
bread, which he delivered into my hands. Being very
thirly myel, Idrank ome of the water, of which when his
father had drank uciently, it more revived his 'pirits than
all the rum I had given him.
I then called Frz'drgz to me, and ordered him to carry the
Sþarziard one of the cakes and ome water, who was repoing
himelf upon a green place under the hade of a tree, but o
weak that though he exerted himelf, he could not (had upon
his teet. .Up0n which] ordered Frz'dgr to rub and bathe his
ankles with rum, as he did his father's. But every minute
he was employed in this, he would ca a wihful eye towards
the boat , where he left his father itting; when uddenly,
not being to be een, he flew like lightning to him ; and ind-
ing he only laid himelf down to eae his limbs, he returned
back to me preently ; and then 1 poke to the Sprmiard
to let Fridqy help him, and lead him to the boat, in order td
be conveyed to my dwelling, where I would take care of him:
U pon which Fridizy made nothing to take him upon his back
an
1 09'
and o carried him to 'the canne, letting him cloe by his father;
and preently epping out again, launched the boat Qt, and
paddled it along the hot-e falier than I could walk, 'though
the wind blew very hard too ; and having brought them ae
to the creek, away he runs to fetch the other canoe, which he
brought to the creek almo as oon as I got to it by land ;
when wating me over, he took our new gueis out of the boat ;
But o weak were they, that l was forced to make a kind o
hand barrow ; and when l came to my cale, not being willing
to make an entrance into my wall, we made them a handome
tent, covered with old ails and boughs of trees, making two
good beds of rice raw, with blankets to lie upon and cover
them. Thus, like an abolute king, over ubjects who owed
their lives unto me, I thought myelf very remarkable, epe.
cially conidering l had three religious in my kingdom, my
man Friday being a Proteant, his father a Pagan, and the
Spam'arda Papi ; but I gave liberty of concience to them all.
To get proviions for my poor weak ubjects, I ordered Pri-
daj to kill meayearling goat, which when he had done, I
cut o the hind quarters, and chopping it into mall pieces,
boiled and (lewed it, putting barley and rice into the broth.
ThisI carriedinto their tent, et a table, dined with them
myel, and encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter to
his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, who poke the lan-
guage of the avages pretty well. After dinner I ordered Fri-
day to etch home all our arms from the eld of battle, and the
next day to bury the dead bodies, which he'did accordingly.
And now I made Friday enquire of his father, whether he
thought thoe avages had ecaped the late lorm in their ca-
noe; and if o, whether they would not return with a power
too great or us to rei t He anwered, that he thought it im-
poible they hould outlive the lorm, or if they were driven
outhwardly, they would come to a land where they would as
certainly be devoured, as if they were drowned in the ea.
And uppoe they had attamed their own country, the range-
nes of their bloody and fatal attack, would n ake them tell
their people, that the re o them were killed thunder and
lightning, not by the hand of man, but by two heavenly pirits
(meaning Friday and me) who were ent from above to detroy
them t And this, he aid, he knew, becaue he heard them ay
the ame to one another. And indeed he was in the right
will ; or I have heard ince, that thee our men gaue out,
that whoever went to that inchanted iiand, would be deiroy-
ed by re from the gods.
No canoes appearing ome time after, as I expected, my 'ape
prehenions ceaed z inead of which my former thoughts of a
Voyage took place, epecially when Fridqy's father aured 'me I
hould have goodtizage in his country. As to the Spam'frdz
' C
he told me, that ixteen more of his countrymen and Pan-a-
g'zeh, who had been hipwrecked, made their ecape thither;
that thottghglmy were in union with the avages, yet they were
very mierable for want of proviions and other necearies.
When I aked him about the particulars of his voyage, he an-
wered, that their hip was bound trom Ria de la Plato tothe
Ha-vanna, that when the hip was loi, only ve men perlhed
in the ocean 5 the ret, having aved themelves in the boat,
were now landed on the main continent. And what do they
intend to do there P aid I. He replied, they had concerted
meaures to ecape by building them a Veel, but they had
neither tools nor Proviions; o that all their deigns came to
nothing. Suppomg, aid I, I hould make them a propoal,
and invite them here, would they not carry me prioner to
New Spain ? He anwereo', no, for he knew them to be uch
hone men as would corn to act uch inhuman balenets to
their deliverer: That, if I pleaed, he and the old avage
would go over to them, talk with them about it, and bring me
an anwer; that they hould all wear delity to me as their
leader, upon, the holy acraments ; and that for his part he
would not only do the ame, but tand by me to the 'la drop
of his blood, hould there be occaion. _
Thee olemn aurances made me reolve to grant them re-
liei, and to end thee two over for that purpoe : But when
every thing was ready, the Spam'ard raied an objection which
carried a great deal of weight in it. You know, Sir, aid he,
that being ome time twith you, I cannot but heerj'z'hle qfyauf er/a
of rite and corn, zciem, perhaps, for us at preent, hat not jot' ,
them, hould the) come other preently ; much le to evz'ctual a cvr/el
jbr an intended rvoyage. Want might he as great an acca/zo/zfor
them radragree and rebel, as the children of Irael did again God
himelf, rwhen they twanted bread in the rtoz'ldernct: And there-
jbre my rid-'vice is to rwait another harrvcyl, and, in the mean time,
mld-'vale and improwe ome more land, 'whereby Me may have
pie-nt] qfprocxiiom, in order to execute our deg'z.
This advice of the Spezm'ard l approved ot" extremely, and
o atised was 1 of his delity, that I eteemed him ever after.
And thus we all four went to work upon ome more land, and
againt ieed time we had got as much cured and trimmed up,
as was ucient do ow twenty two buiels of barley on, and
ixteen jars of rice, which was in hort all the eed we had to
pare. As we 'were four in number, and by i- this time all in
good health, we feared not an hundred Indiam, hould they
venture to attack us : And while the corn was growing, I
pitched upon ome trees t to build us a large Veel in cae
the Spaniards came over ; which being marked, l ordered Fri-
dq'and his father to cut them down, appointing the Spam'ard,
who' was now my Privy Counellor, to overee and direct kthe
wot' .

work. l likewie increaed my ocks of goats, by hooung
the wild dams, and bringing home their kids to my encloure:
Nor did I neglect the grape lealon, but cured them as uual,
though I had uch a quantity now, as would have lled eiglity
barrels with raiins. And thus all ol'us being employed, they
in working, and I in providing for them, till harvell came,
God Almighty bleed the increae of it o much, that from
twenty two barrelsof barley, we tlirehed out twojhumlred
and twenty, and the like quantity of rice, ucient to victual
any hip, to carry me and all the Spaniards to any part of d-
merzca. -'
Thus the principal objection being anwered by a ucient
flock of provition, I lent my two ambaadors over to the main,
with aregal authority, to adminier the oaths of allegiance
and fidelity, and have an inmment igned under their hands,
though l never alced whether they had pen, ink, or paper;
when giving each of them a mut'ket, eight clmrges of powder
and ball, and proviliou enough for eight days, they (ailed away
with a fair gale, on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce a fortnight had paed over my head, but impatient
for their return, I laid me down to leep one morning, when
a range accident happened, which was uhered in' by my
mas coming running to me, and calling aloud, Maer, Ma-
ter, they are come, they are came. Upon which, not dreaming of
any danger, out I jumps 'from my bed, puts on my clothes.
and hurries through my little grove, When looking towards the
iea, I perceived a boat about a lcague and a half diant,'land-
ing in for the there, with the wind fair. I beheld they did not
Come from the ide where the land lay on, but from the (outli-
ermo end of the iand : So thee being none of the people
we wanted, I ordered Friday: to lie till, till uch time as l de-
lcended from the mountain, which, with my ladder, I now a-
cended, in order to dicover more fully what they w eret And
now, with the help of my perpective glas, I plainly perceiv-
ed an Englih hip, which I concluded it to be, by the fahion of
tts long boat, and which lled me with uch uncommon trani-
ports of joy, that I cannot tell how to decribe z and yet ome
ecret doubts hung about me, proceeding from i know not
yvhat caue, as though I had reaon to be' upon my guard. And
Indeed I would have no man contemn the ecret hints and in*
timations of danger, which very often are given, when he may
imagine there is no poibility of its being real : For had-1 not
been warned by this ilent admonition, I had 'been in a wore
(tation than before, and perhaps inevitably ruineid.
llt was not long before I perceived the boat to approach the-
llwre, as though they looked for a place where they might
cdntremontly land; and at la they ran their boat on (bore

much the happier or me ; ince had they come into the eree lt,
they had landed jui at my door, and might not only have ore-
ed me out o my caltle, but plundered me of all I had in the
world. Now I was fully convinced they were all Englzlbmm,
three of which were unarmed and bound; when immedi-
ately 'the firt our or ve leaped on hore, and took thoe three
out of the boat as prionersh One of whom I could perceive
ued the mo paonate geures of entreaty, aiction, and
depair, while the others, in a leer degree, hewed abundance
of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much alon-
ihed, and I beckoned to Friday, (who was below) to acend the
mountain, and likewie view this ight. 0 Maer, ays he to
me, you he Englih man: eat prz'jbtzers, as two/1 as arvage maw.
And do you think they will eat them, Friday? aid l. Ter,
aid Friday, they eat all up. No no, aid I, Friday, l am much
more concerned lea they murder them; but as or eating
them up, that I am ure they never will.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not having
the Spam'ard and ava e with me, but alo that I could not
come within hot of t em unperceived, (they having no re
arms among them) and ave thee three men, whom I thought
they were going to kill with their words. But ome comfort
it was to me, that l perceived they were et at liberty to go
where they pleaed, the racally eamen cattering about as
though they had a mind to ee the place: And o long did
they negligently ramble, that the tide had ebbed o low, as to
leave the boat aground. Nor were the two men that were in
her more circnmpect, for having drank a little too much li.
quor, they fell fat aleep; but one o them waking before the
other, and perceiving the boat too a aground for his rength
to remove it, he halloo'd out to the re, who made all poible
expedmon to him: But, as Providence ordered it, all their
orce was ineectual to launch her, when I could hear them
peak one to another, Why let þer alone, Jack, Earth-ye, he'lloat
nex: tide; by which words I was fully conrmed that they
were my own countrymen. 'All this while 1 lay very quiet,
as being fully enible, it could be no les thanten hours be-
ore the boat would be aoat, and then it would be o dark. *
as that they could not eaily perceive me, by which means l
hould be at more liberty to hear their talk, and oberve all
their motions: Not but that I prepared or my defence be-
fore; yet as I had now another ort of enemies to combat
with, I acted with more caution. I took- two fnzees on my t'houlders. and gave Friday three mukets ; beides my ormi-j/

day, the ailors were all iraggling into the woods, and un-
doubtedly were lain down to leep. The three poor direed
creatures, too anxious to get any repoe, were however eated
under the hade of a great tree, about a quarter of: mile from
me : Upon which, without any more ado, I approached to-
wards them, with my man following behind me, and before I
was perceived, I called aloud to them in Spanih, What are je

viing them to re upon them as they lay. The captain mod-

with the ock of his gun : Three others were alo lightly
wounded, who, at my approach, cried out for mercy. This
the captain granted, upon condition that they would weat to
be true to him in recovering the hip, which they olemnly
did ;"* however,l obliged the captain to keep them bound; Af-
ter which I ent Friday and the captain's mate to ecure the
boat, and bring away the oars and ail ; when at their return,
three men coming back, 'and eeing their late ditireed captain,
now their conqueror, ubmitted to be bound alo. And then
it was, that having more liberty, I related the adventures of
my whole life, which he heard with a erious and wonderful
attention. After this, I carried- him and his two men into my
little ortied callle, hewed them all my Conveniences, and re-
frehed them with uch proviions as I could aord. When
this was over, we began to conider about regaining the hip.
He aid, that 'there were 26 hands on board, who knowing
their lives were forfeit-ed by the law, for eonpiracy ar'd mu-
tiny, would grow o very hardened, that it would be danger-
ous for our mall company to attack them. This was a rea-
onable inerence indeedz'but omething we did reolve on,
and immediately put in execution ; for we heaved the boat up-
on the beach o high, that he could not hoot o at high wa-
ter mark, and broke act hole in her, not eaily to be opped ;
and o all the ignals they gave for the boat vto come on board
were in Fvain. This obliged them to end another boat ahore,
"with ten men armed, whoe Face: the captain plainly decribed,
the boatwain being the chief ocer ; but he aid there were
_ three hot-let lad: among them, who were forced into the con-
piracy. Hereupon I gave him freh courage (for I had per-
ceived he was in concern) in the-mean while ecuring our pri-
oners, part in my came, over whom Friday ood centinel;
but two others we took into our ervice, and then 'thought
ourelves rong enough to adventure a battle. When the
ailors landed, and beheld their boat in that condition, they
not any halloo'd, but ired for their companions to hear, yet
they rteei'cd no anwer. This ruck them with hot-tour and

amazement, thinking their companions were murdered; then
they made as if they would return to the hip 3 l could per-
ceive the captain's countenance change at this, till of a udden
three men were ordered to look after the boat, while the other
even leaped on there, in order to earch for their'companions 1
And indeed they came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient
cale, from whence they could ee a great way into the woods,
and there houting and hallooing till tired and weary, at length
eated themelves under a preading tree. My opinion was,
that nothing could be done till night, when I might ue ome
artice to get them out of the boat : But of a udden they atl
arted up, and made to the ea tide : liereupon I ordered Fri-
day and the captain's mate to go over the creek, and hailoo as
loud as they could, and , o, decoying them into the woods,
come round to me again. And this indeed had its eect ; for
they followed the noie, till coming weward to the creek, they
called or their: boat to carry them over, taking one of the
men out of her, and leaving two to look after her, having fat-
ened her to the tump of a little tree on hore. Hereupon im-
mediately the captain and our party, paing the creek out of'
their ight, we urprized t em both, by the captain's knock-
ing down one, and ordering the other to urrender on pain of
death, and who, being the mo hone of them all, incerely
joined with us. By this time it was pretty late, when return-
ing to their boat, which they found aground in the creek, the
tide out, and the men gone; they ran about, wringing their
hands, crying it was an inchanted iland, and that they hould
be all murdered by pirits or devils. My men would willing-
ly have fallen upon them, but I would not agree to hazard any
of our party. But to be more certain, Friday and the captain
crawled upon their hands and feet, as near as poible 5 and
when'the boatwain approached in ight, o eager was the cap-
tain, that he ired and killed him on the pot; Friday 'wounded
the next man, and the third ran away. Hereupon, I advanc-
ed with my whole army, and, it being dark, I ordered the
man we had urprized with the boat, to call them by their
names, and to parley with them. Accordingly he called' out
aloud, Ybm Smith! Tam Smith! He anwered, Wba's that ?
Robinon l The other anwer-ed, For Gad': ate, Tom, rr'mu-
der immediately, or you are all dead men. Who mu we urren-
der to t ays Smith. To om- captain and fty men here, 'who bit-ne

Shall we have quarters then t aid he. Hereupon the captain
calls out, You, Smith, you know my 'voice ; urrender immediate-
9, andyou hall all barm- your time: granted, except Will Atkins.
Hereupon Atkim cried out, What ba-ve I dam', captain, more them
'e re, 'who borne been as bad a: me ? But that was a lie, for he
aeizhc peron that laid hold of him, and bound him. How-
ever, he was ordered to ubmit to thetgoves'neur's mercy, for
uch was'l called. And o, laying' down their arms, we hound
them all, and eized on their boat. ' , ' ,
After this the'captain expoulated with them, telling them,
that the'Governour was an EglZ/þman, who might execute them
there; but he thought they wouldbe ent to England, except
Will dlkim, who was ordered to prepare for death next morn-
ing. Hereupon Atkins implored the captain to intercede For
his life, and the re that they might not be ent to England.
Thus anwecred our project for eizing the hip. For tending

they all promied to and by him"till their la drop of blood;
and whoever acted treacherouy hould be hanged in chains
'upon the beach. They were all releaed on thee aurances';
and then the captain repaired the other boat, making his pa-
icnger captain, with our men well armed; while his make,
himelf, and ve men more went in the other. By midnight

_they came within call of the hip, when the captain ordered
Robin/'on to hail "her, and tell them that, with great diculty,
they-had ound the men at la. But while they were dicourl'-
ing, the captain, his mate, and the re entered, and knocked
down the econd mate and carpenter, ecured thoe that were
upon deck, by putting them under ha-tches, while the other
'boat's crew entered and ecured the' forecale 5 then broke in-
tothe round houe, where the mate, after ome reillance, hot
the p'irate captain through the head; upon which all the re
yielded themelves prioners. And thus the hip beingrecov-
ered, the joyful ignal was ,red, which I heard with the greatk
e joy imaginable: Nor was it long before he brought the
hip te'an anchor at the creek's month, when coming to me
unawares, There, ays he, m) deare friend anddelz'rverer, there is

'as made me woon in his arms, while, with gratitude to heav-
en,\we were tenderly embracing each other. 7 .
"Nothing now remained, but to conult what we hould do
with the prioners, two of which he thought not aeto take on

next morning two che-the men came twimming to the hip's
ide, deiring the captain to take them on board, though he
hanged them afterwards, complaining mightily how barbar-
only the others ued them. - Upon which I prevailed with the
captain to ta'ke them in, and being everely whipped and pic--
kled, they proved more hone for the future. And o I bade
farewel to this itland, carrying alongwith me my money, par-
rot, umbrella, and goat fkin cap, etting ail Dec. 12, 1686, a-
ter twenty eight years, two mouths, and nineteen days rei-
dence, that ame day and month that I ecaped from Sal/ce,
landing in England, j'une II, r687, after thirty ive years ab-
ence from my own country, which rendered me altogether an
utter ranger.
Here I found my r captain's widow alive, who had buri-
ed a econd hgzjband, but in very mean circumances, and'
whom I made mighty eay upon my account. Soon after I
went down to re/Him, where all my family were expired, ex-c
cept two iers, and as many of one o my brother's children.
I ound no provilion had been made for me, they concluding
I had been long ince dead ; othat I was. but in a very len-
der ituation. Indeed the captain did me a great kindnes, by
his report to the owners, how I had delivered their hip on
the deolate iland, upon which they made me a preent of
£zoo erling. I next went to LZ/bon, taking my man Friday
with me, and arriving there in dy'd, I met the Portugud'e cap-
tain, who took me on board on the Aft-iron coatt; but being
ancient, he had let o the ea, and rcigned- all his buines to
his on, who followed the Bral trade. So altered both of os
were, that we did not know each other at r, till I dicovered
mylel more fully to him. After a few embraces, I began to
enquire after my concerns, andthen the old gentleman told me,
that it was nine years ince he had been at Bral, where my
partner was then living, but my trulees were both dead ; that
it was his belief, I hould have a good account o the product
Of my plantation; that the imagination of m being lo, had

curator Fical, who, in cae of my not returning, had given
one_third to the King, and the re to the Monalry of St. Au-
gume; but if I put in myclaim, or any one for me, it would
be returned, except 'the yearly product, which was given to
the poor. I then deired him to tell me, what improvement

vtce, I was'perl'uaded to go by iand to Calais, 'and there take

me, together with two Englh and two Pofluguq/Z gentlemen, o
that with a Partugzzce ervant, an Englih ailor, and my man
Friday, there were nine'in number.
Thus armed and eq-xipt, we et out, and Came to Madrz'a',
when the ummer decaying, we haed to Narvarre, where we
were informed that there was carcely*an,y pang, by reaon
of the prodigious quantity ot' now; o that we were obliged
to abide neartwemy days at Pampeluna, and at la to take
a guide to conduct us ate towards, Tboulozg/e. And now tVVCtVC
other gentlemenjo'ming with us, together with' their ervants,
we had a very jolly company. Away 'our guide led us by

But now came on two adventures, both tragical and comi-

bear, "who tet upon him and his hore, and wounded hctm in
three places : Upon which my man riding up to his at anee,
hot one of them dead, on which the others ran into the

attack the bear, This creature, if let alone, wiZl never med-

Friday cried out, New, Maer me make much laugb, me make

made the creature look behind him to ee how he could te.

ing Bag/Mr, Why you no: come farrber, Mr. Bear P aid he.
Pray, Mr. Bear, camzfartbrr: And then indeed we> all bur
into laughter, epecially when we perceived Friday drop like a
quirrel upon the groundgleaving the bea to make the be of
his way down the tree. And now thinking it the mo con-
venient time to kill him, Friday cried out, O dear, Maer, no
hoot; mehootlgy and by; when taking up the gun, Me not
hoatjet, aid he, me make ame more much laugh. And accord-
ingly he was as good as his word, for the creature decending
back-wards from the tree 'very leinrely, before he could lay
one foot on®the ground, Friday hot him through the ear one-
dead, and looking to ee if we were pleaed, bur out into a.
hearty laugh, aying, So 'we kill bear in my country ; not rwit/r
gan, but mach long arrow. Thus ended our diverion, to out'
great latisfaction, epecially in a place where the terrible
howli'ngs ruck us with continual terror. But the now now
growing very deep, particularly on the mountains, the raven.
ous ere-ctures were obliged to eek for uitenance in the villag-
es, where coming by urprie on the country people, they
killed everal of them, beides a great number of their heep
and horles. _
Our guide told us, we had yet one more dangerous place to
pas by ; and if there were any more wolvesin thecountry, there
me hould nd them. This was amall plain, encompaed with
woods, to get througha long lane, to the village where we
were to lodge. When we entered the wood the (un was with-
in halan hour o- etting; anda little after it was et, we
came into the plain, which was not above two furlongs over,
and then we aw five great wolves cros the road, without tak-
ing potice of us, and o wit as though they were puriuing
after their prey. Hereupon our guide, believing there were
more coming, deired us to be upon our guard. According-
ly out eyes were very circumpect, till about a league farther
we aw a dead horc, and neara dozen of wolves det/curing' its
carcais. My man Friday fain would have ired at them, btist I
would not permit him : Nor had we gone half over the plain,
' but we heard dreadful howiings in a wood on our left, when
preently we aw an hundred come up again us, as though
they had been an experienced army. This obliged nate
term oprelives in the bet manner :, ,\and then I ordered
every other man 'hould re that thee who did not might-"De e

andhen every man to make ue of' his piols. But there
was no necellity for this ; for the enemy being terried,
topped at the noie of the re ; our of them were hot dead,
and everal others being wounded, went away, bleeding, as we
could very plainlydicover by the lnow. And now remem-
bering what had rbeen often told me, that uch was the majey
ot a man's voicezas to rike terror even in the erce creatures,
I ordered all my companions to holloo as lond as poible :
And in this notion I was not altogether mitaken ; for they
immediately turned about upon the r halloo, and began to
retire : Upon which, ordering a econd volley in their tear,
they galloped into the woods with great precipitation.
Thus we had ome mall time to load our pieces again, and
then made all the haile we could on our way : But we had
not rode far before we were obliged to put ourelves in a po-
ture-"of defence as before, being alarmed with a very dread-
ful noie in the ame wood on our left hand, the ame way as
we were to pas, only that it was at ome diance from us.
By this time the darkome clouds began to pread over the
elements, and the light growing very dulky, made it, lo much
the more to our diadvantage : But the noie ill increaing
more, we were fully aured, that it was the howlin and yell-
ing of thoe rave'nouscreatures : when preentlyt ree troops
of wolves, appeared to our ight on our front, as though all
thee companions had a deign to urround us, and devour us
in pite of ate. But as they did not all upon us immediate-
ly, we proceeded non ourjournevtin the wifte manner that
the roads would permit our hores, which was only a large
trot. It was in this-manner we travelled, till uch time as
we dicovered-another wood, and had the propect of its en-
trance, throngh which we were to pas at the farthe ide of
the plain.w * But urely none can expres the teirror we were in,
when' approaching the lane, we perceived a confued number
of the erce- wolves anding, and as it were, guardi-ng its en-
hance; VNor werewe long intthis amazement, before another
ioccaton'tof horrourapreented itel : For uddenly we heard the
report-et a-gttn' at'- anot-her opening into the wood .; and looking ,
that way', out ran-azhore, bridled and addled, ying' withzthe

When we rode-up zto that entranee from whence the hor!
ram? forth, there lay the earcaes of two men and aotbeþl
hore, mangled and torn by thee devouring wolves : _A riden-2
doubtediyeone of'thee men was the peron who xed the grim,
which we wheat-if' for the piece lay by hint; but alas l- man: '
Of
of the upper part of his body and his head was enton le d- i.
the bowels of thee ravenous creatures.
What coure to take, whether to proceed or retreat, we could
not tell; but it was not long before the wolves themelves
made us come to a reolution : For uch numbers urrounded
us, ever one of whom expected their prey, that were our bo.
dies to e divided among them, there would not be half a
mouthul a piece. But happy, very happy, it wasfor us, that
but a little way from the entrance, there lay ome very large
timber trees, which I uppoed had been cut down and lay
there for carriage, among which I drew my little troop, plac.
ing ourelvcs in a line behind one long tree, which erved us
for a brca work ; when, deiring them to alight, we tood in
a triangle, or three fronts, encloing our hores in the centre,
the only place'where we could preerve them.
Never certainly was a more furious charge than what the
wolves made upon us in this place; and the ight of the hores,
which was the principal prey they aimed at, provoked their
hunger, and added to their natural ercenes. They came on
us with a mo dreadful noie, that made the woods' ring again,
and beginning to mount our pieces of timber, I ordered every
other man to re as before directed 5 'and indeed o well did
they take their aim, that they killed everal of the wolves at
the r volley ; but ill we were obliged to keep a continual
ring, by reaon they came on like devils, puhing one another
with the greatet fury. But our econd volley omething a-
hated their courage; when opping a little, wet hoped they
would have made the be of their way, however it did not
prove o, for others madea new attempt upon us : And though
jn four rings 'we killed eventeen or eighteen ot them, lam-
ing twice as many ; yet they came on everal times ucceively,
as though they valued not their lives for the lake of their
rey. i I
P Unwilling was I to pend our la hot too uddenly :' And
therefore called my other ervant, and giving him a horn of
powder, bid him lay a large train quite along the timber, which
he did, while Friday was charging my t'uzee and hiszpwn, with
tihe greate dexterity. By this time the wolves coming up the
timber, 1 et re to the traiobby napping a dicharged piol
clole'on the powder. This o earched "and terried their',
that ome fell down, and others jumped in among us with the
'rength and terror of the ame, but thee we immediately di-
patched, when all the re, rightened with the light, which the
darkome night caued to appear more dreadful, began at
length to retire: Upon which, ordering our la piols to be
ired at oncqgiving at the ame time a great hout, the wolves
were obliged to have recoure to their witnes by turning
tail; and'tltcnwe el-lied out upon twenty lame ones, Zutt'mg
I em

them in pieces with our words, which obliged them to how!
lamentably, to the terror of their fellow devourers, who re'-
gned to us the eld, as victorious'conquerors. And, indeed,
l queion whether Alexander, King. of Macedon, in any of his
conquets, had more occaion for triumph than we had; for
he was backed by numerous captains and loldiers of the great-
el: courage, co'nancy, and reiolution ; whereas our little ar-
my was obliged to combat a legion of devils, as it were, wore
than eannibals, who, had they ain us, would have acriced
us the ame moment, to atisy their voracious appetites. *
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beas, having killed
threecore of them, and aved our lives from their fury. We
till had a league to go farther, when, as we went, our ears
were faint-ed with their molt unwlcome howlings, expecting
every moment another attack. But, in an hour's time, we
arrived ae at the town where we were to lodge ; and here we
ound the place Rrictly guarded, and all in terrible contuion,
as well theymight, by reaon of the bears and wolves break-
ing into the village, in order to prey upon theircattle and
people. The next morning we were obliged to take a new
guide, by reaon the other tell very bad o his wounds which
he had received, as before mentioned. After we had reached
Y'Zzaulauh, we came into a warm, pleaant, and fruitful country,
not infeed with wolves, nor any ort of ravenous creatures:
And when we told our tory there, they much blamed our
guide, for condudling us through the ore at the oot of the
mountains, and in uch a evere eaon, when the now obliged
them to eek for helter in the woods. When, we informed
them in what manner we placed ourelves, and the horeg in
the centre, then they exceedingly reprehended us, and told us,
It was an hundred to one but we had all been deroyed 3 'for
that it was thezght of the liores, their o much delired prey,
made the wolves more ragingly'furious than they would have
been ;* which was evident, by their being at other times really
afraid of a gun; but then, being exceedingly hungry and u-
rtous upon that account, their eagernes to come at the hores
made them inenible of their danger ; and that if we had not
by a continual 're, and at la, by the cunning ratagem of the
train of powder, got the power over them, it had been great
odds if their number had not overpowered us : Beides, it was
3 gfat mercy 'we alighted' from our hores, and fought
With that courage and conduct, which, had we failed todi,
every man of us, with our beas, had been devoured. And
indeed this was nothing but the truth; for, never in' my life
was lo enible of danger, as when 300 devil? came roaring

I thinke! have nothing uncommon in my paage through
France to take notice of, ince other travellers of greater learn-
ing and ingenuity, have given a more ample account', than my
pen is able to et forth. From Tboulazg/Zr I travelled to Paris,
from thence to Calais, where I took hipping, and landed at
Da'ver the t4th of January, in a very cold ealon.
Thus come to the centre o my travels, I oon dicovered
any new found eiate, and all the bills of exchange I had
brought were currently paid. The good ancienr widow, my
only Privy Counellor, thought no pains or care too great to
procure my advantage; nor had '1 ever occaion to blame her
delity, which drew from me an ample reward. I was for
leaving my eects in her hands, intending to et out or LZ/Izon,
and o to the Brailry but as in the deolate lland I had tome
doubts about the Romih religion, o I knew there was little
encouragement to ettle there, without I would apoatize from
Ihe orthodox faith, or live in continual fear o the inquiition.
Upon this account I reolved to fell my plantation, and to this
intent I wrote to my old friend at Lillvon, who returned me an
anwer, to my great atisaction, which was, that he could
readily ell it there: However, if I thought it convenient to
give him liberty to oer it in my name to the two merchants,
the urvivors of my trutees, reiding at the Brails, who cone-
quently underiood its intrinic value, having lived jut upon
the pot, and who I was enible were very rich, and therefore

whatoever. -
You may be ure. I could not but agree with this kind and
ingenuous propoal ; and immediately .I ent him an order to
oer it unto them, which he accordingly did : 'So that about
eight mouths ater, the hip being in that time returned, he
gave me a atisfactory account that they not only willingly ac-
cepted the oer, but that they had alo rernitted thirty three
zthouand pieces o eight, to a correpondent of their own at

-Hereupo*t, in: return, I igned theinirument of aleaccord-

- HEN we conider the puiant force of nature, and what
mighty inuence it has many times over the temper of
the mind 5 it will be uch great wonder t0* think that my
powerful reaon hould be overcomeby a much ronger in-
clination. My late act-quired kingdom ran continually. in my
thoughts aH-the day, and I dreamt ofit in the night z nay, I
made it' the continual ubject of my taile, even to imperhnence,
when] was awake. I 'had uch Vapours in my head, that I
'actually uppoed myelf at my cae : That I not only per-
ee-ived Friday's fathermhe old Spam'ard, and the wicked ailors;
but that talked and dicoured with them about their man-
.ner of living : That I heard thoe 'Dogs-related to me, which
1 foundsafterwards to be but. too true ; and that I executed my
- judgments with the greatet everity upon the oenders. And
'indeed this anticipating all the pZeaing joys of my life, carce-
ly ao'eded me one pleaant hour ;* my dear and tender wie
could ot but vtake notice of it," which drew thee aec-
rio'nate peeehes from her : Mj- dear, aid he, I and-really per-

* Such-

Such endearing tendernes, graced with the molt innocent,
and yet mo powerful Charms, brought me inenibly into my
right undertanding : And when I conidered all the tranac-
tions-of my life, and particularly my new engagement ; that I
had now one child born, and my wie big of another ; and that
1 had no occaion to eek for more riches, who already was
hie'ed 'with uciency; with much lrnggling, I altered my
reolntions at la, reolving to apply myelf to ome buines
or other, which might put a period to uch Wandering incli-
nations. Hereupon I bought a little farrn in the county of
Bedford, with a reolution to move thither; Upon this there
was apretty convenient houe, urronnded with land, very
capable ofimprovem-ent, which uited my temper, as to plant-
ing, managing and cultivating. Nor was I long before 1 en-
tered upon my new ettlement, having bought ploughs, har-
rows, cart, waggon, hores, cows, and heep 5 o that I now led
the lie ofa country gentleman, and was as happy in my retire-
ment as the greate monarch in the world. And what made
me think my happines the greater was, that I was in that mid-
dle tate of life which my father had o often recommended,
much reembling the felicity ofa rural retirement, which is
elegantly decribed by the poet in thee lines:
Freetam all After, free from m re,
Age ba: no pain, andyouib no nare;
But in the midt of this my chiee happines, [was udden-
ly plunged in the greatet orrow that I could poibly endure 2
For, when I lea expected it, my dear and tender wie was
forced to ubmit to the irreilable power of death, leaving
this tranitory life tora better. I: is impoible t'or me to ex-
pres the beanties of her mind, or the lovelines of her peron 3
neither can I too much lament her los, which my late breath
that' record. Her inuence was greater over me than the
powers of my own reaon, the importunities of friends, the
iniructions of a father, or the meltingg,r tears of a tender and
diconolate mother: In a word he was the landard of all
my aairs, the centre of my enterprizes, and the principal
engine to direct me in the coure to happines. But now,
ince thecrnel hand o death had cloed my dearei's eyes,
in my thoughts, I eemed a lranger to the world; my Privy
Connellor being gone, l was like a hip without a pilot, and
that l could only rnn before the wind. And when I looked
around me inthis bny world, one part labouring for bread,
and the other qt-iandenng away their elates ; this put me in
mind how-I had lived in my little kingdom, where reaon and
religion dictated to me, that there was omething that certain-
ly was the reaon and end of lite, which twas. fariffnperior to
what couid be hoped for on this ide the grave. My country
delights were now as inipid and dull as- mnieorrene thoe

who have neither taie or ingennity. KIn hort, reolving to
leave o houe keeping, l let my tarm, and in a few mouths
returned to London. -
But neither could that great city, o famous for its variety
ofentertainments, aord me any agreeable delight. A (late
ol' idleneis l ound to be the very dregs of lie, andmo hurt-
ful to body and, foul. It was'now the beginning of the year
1693, at which time my nephew (who I before oberved had
r been brought up to the ea, advanced to be captain of a thip)
was returned from a hort voyage to Bz'z'baa, the r he had
made in that ation. He comes to me one morning, telling
me, that ome merchants of his acquaintance had propoed to
him to go a voyage for them to the Ea India: and China, in
the manner of private traders: And 'to-w, Uizfle, aid he, z'f'
joaz'eil accompany me thither, I'll engage to [and you upon jam- old
illa-nd, there to behold tbe ate of your little kingdom.
It wasjnt before he came in, my thoughts were xed to
get a patent or its poeon, and then to ll it with inhabi-
tants. After I had paued a little while, and looked iledfaily
on him, What devil, or pirit, aid I, ent you here 'with this un-
luC/p'ermnd? He iartled at r, but recovering himelf, when
he perceived I was not oended : Sir, replied he, what I have
propoed cannot, I hope, be iyled unlucky, ince certainly you
mut be deirous to ee your little territory, where you reigned-
with more content than any of your brother kings in the nni-
vere. Nephew, aid l,\it' you will leave me there, and call
for me as you come-back, l care not if I give my conent : But
he anwered, that the merchants would not allow their Veel,
laden with an innite value, to return there again, which was
a month's ailout o the way ; Beides, Sir, laid he, uppoe I
hould zmilcarr-y, was your , requelt granted, why then you
would be in theame tate as before. This indeed carried a
great dealzoreahn in it, bntwe ound out a remedy, and that
was, to can-ry a framed iloop on board, ready to be et up in the
ilantl, by the aance of ome carpenters which we hould carry
with us, thatvwould beztted ina few days to go to ea. l was

iderable cargo for my new colony. Fi', I had ome ervants,
whom I propoed to leave there as inhabitants, or to work
while I tayed there, as they hould appear willing : There
were two carpenters, a mith, and a very ingenious fellow 'who
was jack o all trades 5' for he was not only a cooper by trade,
but was alo dexterous at making wheels and hand mills to
grind corn, likewie'a good turner and a good pot maker. I
alo carried a taylor, who conented to ay in my plantation,
and proved a mo neceary fellow in the i-land. As to my
cargo, it conied of a ucient quantity of linen, and Englih
us, for clothing the Spaniards that] expected to nd-there;
a; likewie gloves, hats, hoes, 'iockings ; together with beds,
bedding, and houhold iu, epecially kitchen utenils,'with'
pots, kettles, pewte', bras, &e. alo nails, tools ofall orts,
tiaples, hooks, hiuges, and all other things neceary; all which,
I think, cot me about (300. Nor was this all, for I carried
an hundred pare arms, mucets, and uzees, beides ome "pi-
tols, a coniderable quantity of everal-orts of hot, two bras
Cannon, beides words, cutlaes, and the iron * part for ome
pikes and halberts; and I made mymephew take with us two
mall quarter-derk guns more than he had occaion for-in his
hip, to leave behind, if there 'was a neceity: So that we
knight build a ort there, and man it again all oippoers what-

Well, we put out to ea; and though I can't ay this vbyage
was o nnproperous as my others had been, yet contrary winds
drove us o tar northward, that we were obliged to put in at
(Io/tway' in Ire-land, where we lay wind bound two and twenty
days. Here indeed our proviions were-very cheap, and we
added to our hip's ores, by taking in everal live hogs, two
Cows and calves, which [then reolved to put- on therein my
iand, if our neceties did not call for-them. On'the 5th of
Frbrnary we failed from Irelmd, with a very fair'gale, which
lated tor ome days; and, I think it was about the zoth of the
fame month, late in theteveni'ng, when the mate informed us,-
that he aw a Bath of re, and heard a gun ired ; and while
he was Ftpeazking,a boy came in, and told us the hoatwain
heard another. Upon which, we all ran to the quarter deck,

from whence, in a few minutes-we perceived a terrible re at a'
ditance. We had immediate recoure to our rcckoniugs, in
which we were allof opinion that there could be no land that
Way, it appearing to be at N. N. W. Hereupon we concluded
that, ome hip had taken re at ea; and that it could not be

mfldcvup directly to it, and in half an hour's time, wind being

there were two priel'ls, the one an old, and the other a young

For, no ooner did he perceive himlell freed from danger, but
he dropped down as it were without life, and to every one's
appearance, quite dead; but the liurgeon, chang and rubbing

owing more freely, the old man began to open his eyes, and
in a quarter of an hour was well again But loon revolving
his happy change, the joy of which whirled his pirits about
falter than the Veels could convey them, his blood became o
feverih, as made him more t for bedTam than any other

fectly compoed next morning. a
Remarkable indeed was the behaviour of the young Prie.
Athis entrance on board the hip, he fell on his face in the
mo humble proration to the Almighty. I thought indeed
he had fallen into a l'woon, and lo ran to help him up ; but he
modelly told me, he was returning his thanks to the Almigh-
ty, deliring me to leave him a few monients, and that, next
to his Creator, he would return me thanks alo. And indeed
he did o about three minutes after, with great eriohlnels
and ziection, though the tears flood in his eyes, which con-
rmed the gratitude of his foul. Nor did 'ne les hew his piety

Frmcb are eminently remarkable. The next day the captain
and one of'the priells, delired to peak with me and my nephew

and valnable things out of the rnined Veel, which was at our
ervice, only that they deired to be et on hore ome where in

had the Portugue captain erved me o) peruaded him to the

the Wr-lndies, that ifpoiible they might geta paage to France
or England. Indeed they were very thankul for our r
kindnes ; but were under great concern, epecially their pa.
engers, at their being carried to the Ea India. They beg.
ged therefore I would keep on the-bank-s of Ne-"ttybundland,
where probably they might meet with ome hip or oop to
carry them to Canada, whence they came. As this was
but a reaonable reque, I was inclined to grant it, ince it
was no breach o charter party; and that the laws of God
and nature obliged us to do what good we could to our fellow
creatures ; and beides, the danger we ourelves hould be in
for want of provizons: So we contented to carry them to
Newfozmdland, if wind and weather would permit ; if not,
that we hould carry them to iMartiniro in the lVr/I India. But,
as it happened, in a week's time, we made the banks of Ne-'w-
eundl'and, where the French people hired a bark to carry them
to France. But the young prie being deirous to go to the
Ea ladies, 1 readily agreed to it, becaue 1 liked his conver-
ation; and two or three of the French ailors alo entered
themelves on board our. hip. .
Now directing our coure for the We India-r, eering S. and
S. by E. about twenty days with little wind, another adven-
ture happened to exercie our humanity. In the latitude
of 27 degrees 5 m. north, the t9th oMarcb 1694-5, we per-
ceived aail, (ourcoute S. E. and by 8.) which bore up to

alterthem, becaue he had nothing to give them for relief.
Hereupon we reolved to let them have what we could l-þare,
ordering the mate to bring ome of his me 'on beard us,
which he aecordingly did,yet both he and they looked like (hele-
tons ; and when meat was et before them, 1 ordered them
to eat paringly. But, however, they oon fell ick, which
obliged the fur-geon tt) mit-(omething in their broth, that was
to be to them both'twd'and phyi-c. When they were fed,
we ordered our mate to carry them a lack of bread, and four
m ve pieces of beef to boil ; but the urgeon charged them
to ee it boiled, and to keep a guard in the cook room, to pre.
vent the men eating it raw, and conequently kill themelves
with what was deigned for their relief. But particularly I
detired the mate to l'ee what condition the poor paengers were
in, and the [urges-'t gave him a pitch-er of the lame broth
which he had prepared for the men : And being curious to ee
this cene of miery-myelt, I took the captain, (as we called
the mate of the hip) in our own boat, and failed after them.
Here was a lad light indeed! Searce was the victuals half
boiled in the pot, but they were ready to break- opeu the Cook
room door. To ay their omachs, themate gave them bit'-
cuits, which were dipt in, and liet'teurd with the liquor of the
meat, wi: eh they Crtll Brmois; telling them it was for their own
afety, that he was obliged to give them but a little at .a time;
and to feeding them gradually, their hellies were eomortably

from it; her other arm lay over her head, and her eet lay
both together, et al again the frame of the eabin table ; not
only being iarved with hunger, but overcome with grief for
the los of her mires, whom the loved mo tenderly. It
was a great while before the urgeon could bring her to life,
and a much longer time before he came to her enes.
After we had failed with them ome days, we ent them five
barrels of beef, one o pork, two hogheads o bicuit, with
peae, Hour, and other things, taking three cahs of ugar,
ome rum, and ome pieces of eight for atisae'lion, we left
them, but took the youth and maid with us, with all their
goods. þ he lad was about 17 years old, very handome,
mode, fe ible, and well bred, but mightily concerned for the
los of his honoured mother, having lo his tather at Babadocx
but a few months before. He beeeched the lurgeon to in-
tercede with me to take him out of the hip z for that the tail.
ors, not paring a mall uenance, had murdered his mother.
But hunger has no bounds, no right, and conequently is in-
capable of any companion. When the urgeon told him that
out' voyage might put him in bad circumances, and farther
from his friends, he anwered, he did not care o he was but
delivered from that terrible crew : That as the captain (mean-
ing me) had aved him from death, o he was ure that he
would do him no harm ; and as for the maid, when he was
reored to her enes, he would be no les thankul, let us
'xcarry them where we would. And indeed the urgeon o re-
prelented their cae to me, that I conented, and took them on
board, with all their goods, except 1 I hogheads of lugar; but
_ Fhe youth having a bill of lading, I made the commander ign
a writing, to oblige him to deliver a letter and the deeiealed
widow's goods to Mr. Rogers, a merchant at Briol : But l be-
Jieve the hip was loft at lea, for we could never hear what be-
came of her afterwards. We were now in the latitnde of 19
dog. 3: min. having as yet a tolerable good voyage. But,
paing by everal little incidents relative to wind and weather,
1 hall relate what is more remarkable concerning,r my little
kingdom, to which I was then drawing near. I had great di-
culty in attaining it; for as I came to, and went from it be-
Fore, on the outh and ca of the iand, as coming from the
Brailr; o now approaching between the main and the iland,
pot having any chart of the coa, nor land mark, it obliged us
30 go on lhore on everal illands, on the month of the great
river oroanako, but to no purpoe. Then I perceived, that
whatl thought was a continent before, was no uch "thing, but
a. long iland, or rather a ridge of land. On one of 'hete i-
lands, l found ome Spaniards, but they belonged to the iaztd
' o
ome pear] mucles, if they could. But at length I came fair
on the outh tide of my iland, and then I preently knew the
countenance of my little kingdom; o we brought the hip ate
to an anchor, with iher broadide to the little creek, where
flood my ancient and venerable came.
No ooner did I ee the place, but calling for Friday, l ak-
ed him where he was P But when he looked a little, he clap-
ped his hands, crying, O joy, O there, O yet, O zberel pointing
to our old abode, and then fell a dancing and eapering as if he
was mad ; and I had much ado to keep him from jumping in-
to the ea, to wim ahore. Friday, aid I, what do you think,
hall we ee your father? At the mentioning his father's name,
the poor aection-ate creature ell a weeping : No no, (lays he)
me ee bin: no more, nerver ee paorfatber more I be long ago die,

aid I, but hall we lee any body ele? He looks about, and
pointing to the hill above my houe, he cries out, We ee! two
ee! there much men, and there! which though I could not pen.
ceive them with my perpective glas, was true, by what the
men themelves told me the next day.
When the EngZi/B ancient was pread, and three gons ired
asa ignal of riendthip, we perceived a moke rite from the
creek ; upon which I ordered the boat out, taking Friday with
me, and, hanging out a white ag of truce, I went on hore, ae-
companied alo by the young Friar, to whom I had related the
hilory of the r part of my life. Beides, we had ixteen
men well armed, in cae we had met with any oppoition.
After we had rowed directly into the creek, the r man I
xed my eyes upon was the Spam'm-d, whoe life l had aved,
and whoe face 1 perfectly well knew. I ordered them all to
tay in the boat for a while; but Friday, oerceiving his father
at a diance, would have jumped into the ea had they not let
him go. No ooner was he on hore, but he ew like a wiiit
arrow out of a bow, to embrace his ancient father. certainly
it would melt a man of the rme reolotion, into the ote
tears, to ee with what uncommon tranports ojoy he aluted
him. He firt kicd him, then lroked his ace, took him in
his arms, laid him under a hady tree, (at down by him, then
looked as earnely at him as one would do at a picture, for a
qnarter of an hour together. After this he would lie upon the
ground, iroke his logs, and kis them, then get up and (tare
at him as though he was bewitched : But the next day one
could not forbear laughter, to ee his behaviour 3 for he
would walk everal hours with his father along the there, lead-

noon z orpwhen he et old Friday on the ground, he would
dance round him, making comical pouresand gettures; and
all this iwhile would be telling him one tory or other of his
travels and adventures. - "* H
It was on the xoth of Aþrz'I, Anno x695, that I et my foot
upon the Land a econd time. When my faithful Spaniaru',
accompanied by one more, approached the boat. He little
knew who l was, till 1 dicovered mylelfto him : Signiar, aid
I, Peru/gature, don't you know me t He (poke never a word;
but, giving his muket to his attendant, extended his arms, and
ay-ing omething in Spanih that I did not then underand, he
came forward and embraced me; aying, he was inexcoable,
not to know his deliverer, who, like an angel lent from heav-
en, had aved his life. He then beckoned to the man to call
out his companions : aking me if 1 would walk to my own
habitation, and take poeon, where I hould nd ome mean
improvements ; but indeed they were extraordinary ones ; for
they had planted o many trees, o cloe together, that the place
was like a labyrinth, which none could nd out except them- i
elves, who knew its intricate windings. I aked'him the mean-
ing of all thee orticatious; he told me, he would give me a
large account of what had pa ince my departure to this time,
and how he had (ubdued ome Englghtwho thought to he their
murderers, hoping I would not be dipleaed, ince necety
compelled them to it. As I knew they were wicked villains,
[gold him, that I was not only far from nding fault with it,
but was rather heartily glad' they had nbdned them. But
while we were talking, the man whom he had tent returned,
'accompanied by eleven. more; butgin uch habits, that it was
Ltnpobh: to tell what nations they were of. He r turned
to me, pqjnting to them : Thee, Sir, aid he, are ome of the
gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodnes; and then
turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them enible
who I was : And then indeed they hluted me one by one, noi
as ordinary menxbut as though they' had been ambaadors of
noblemen, and I a trinmphant conquerer: For their beha-
viour not only agreed with a manlike, majeic grayity, but, at
the ame time, was oobliging and courteous, as made them
admiraþle touthe la degree.
Befofre I relate the hide-ry of the tranactiom of my king-
dom, as I had it from the Sþaniard's own mouth, I mu here,
inert what I omitted in my former relation. The matter is
this : Jut before we weighed anchor to et hiithere happed-
ed a quarrel on board the hip, which had like to have occa-
ioned a econd mutinytill uch timeasthe courageous cap-r
p, taking two of the; mut reractory prioners, he laid them
a
m won-s, threatening them, as they wem concerned in the form-
ter
er diorders, to have them hanged in England for running away'
with the hip. This rightened ome of the re, as thinking
the captain would erve them in the ame manner, though he
eemed to give them good words for the preent. But the
mate, having intelligence of this, made me acquainted with
their fears; o that to make them more eay, and ourelves
more tafe from their contipiracies, I was obliged to go downz
and pas my Honour-'s word for it, that, upon their good beha-
viour, all that was pa hould be pardoned; in teliimony of
which I ordered the two men's irons to be taken o, and
themelves forgiven. But as this had brought us to an anchor
that night, in which there was a calm, the two men that had
been in irons, Hole each of thema mnfket, and ome other
weapon-s, and taking the hip's pinnace, not yet hawled up, ran
away to their brother rogues. The nextymorning we ent the
fong boat, with men to purue them, but all in vain. The
mate, in revenge, would have demolihed my little cattle, burnt
DTS furniture, and deroyed their plantations ; but having no
orders for it, he did not put it in execution. And thus there
were ve Englz'men in the iand, which caued great dier--
ences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a perfect account of in
the following manner ;
You cannot, Sir, but remember the embay you ent me it;
hent, and what a diappointment we met with, by your aid-5
tence, at our return. There is but 'little variety in the relax-
tion of' our voyage, being ble with calm weather and a
ttnooth ea. Great indeed was the joy of my countrymen, on
eeing me alive, having acted as the principal man on board,
the captain of the hipwrecked veel dying before; nor'was'
their turpre les, who knowing I was taken prioner by-thq
Favages of another nation, thought me long ince entombed in"
their montrous bowels. But, when I' hewed them the arms;
ammsmition, and proviion l had brought for them, they look-'s
ed upon me as a econd FQ/YPIJ advanced in Fbamab's court,
and immediately prepared to come along with-me. Indeed,
they were obliged to trepas upon their friendly avagesgby
borrowing two of their canoes, under a pretext for hin'g;
and they came away the next morning, but without any ro-'
viions of their own, exeept'a few roots, which ferred 'them inl-i

of the iland, a little inclining to the wel, for fear of avages.
Here they built two huts, one to lodge, and the other to lay
their tores in; for my good natured Spaniards giving them
ome eed, they dug and planted as I had done, and began to
live prettily. But while they were going on thus comfortably,
the three unnatural brutes, their countrymen, in a mere bul-
lying humour, inulted them, by aying the Governour (mean-

guih them) thought their three countrymen only jeled, and
one of theminvited them in,to ee their ne habitations ; while
the other acetiouy told them, that ince they built tenements,
with great improvements, they hould, according to the Cuom
of landlords, give them a longer leae; at the ame time de-
tiring them to fetch a tcrivener to draw the Writings. One of

laingto me and my Spaaianlt for juice, which might have

edly, Sir, put into a great contternation on this account, let!
they hould run into our grove, and, vGooe-quently, bring us
into the like danger. Hereupon we reolved to kill the r
that came, to prevent dicovery ; and that too with our words
and the but end of our mukets, for fear the report of our£guns
hould be heard. - * t
And o indeed ithappened as we thought ; for three of the
vanquihed army croing the creek, ran directly to the place,
as to a thick wood for helter; nor was it long before our tout
ave us notice of it ; as alo that the Victors did not think it
it to pnrue them. Upon this, I would not uer them to be
flain, but had them urpried and taken by our party; and
afterwards they proved very good lervants to us, being tout
young creatures, and able to do a great deal of work. The
remainder of the conquered lavages ed to their canoes, and
put out into the ocean ; while the conqueiors,joining togeth-
er, houted by way of triumph 5 and about three in the after-
noon, they alo embarked for their own nation. Thus we
were freed at once, lromthe avages and our fears, not per-
ceiving any of thee creatures for ome coniderable time
after. We-found two and thirty men dead in the eld of
battle; ome were ain with long arrows, which we found
ticking in their bodies ; and the re were killed with
rge unwieldy wooden i_'words, which denoted their va
trength ; and of which we found eventecn, beides bows and
arrows t But we could not nd one wounded creature among
them alive-'3 for' they either- kill their enemies quite, or carry
thoe wounded away with them.
This terrible fight tarried the Bnglihmm for ome time;
conidering how unfortunate they might have been, had they
fallen into their hands, who would not only kill them as ene-
miss, but alo for food, as we do cattle : And, indeed, lo
much did this naueate their omaehs, that it not® only made
them very lick, but more tractable to the common neceary
buines of the whole ociety, planting, owing, and reaping,
with the greate igns of amity and friendhip X So that now,
being all good friends, we began to conider of circnmttanw
in general ;_ and the r thing we thought of was, Whether,
as we perceived the avages haunted that tide ol the ihnd, and
there being more retired parts of' it, and yet as well uited '0
our manner of living, and equally to our- advantage, we ought
not much rather to move our place of reidence, and plant il
in a mnch ate-r place, both for the ecurity of our corn and
sattle 2
After
After along debate on this head, it was reolved, or rather
veted. nemine contmdiceme, not to remove our ancient' calle ;
and that lor this very good reaon, that ome time or other
we expected to hear from our upt-eme Governor (meaning
you, Sir) whoe meengers, not nding us there, might think
the place demolihed, and all his (objects deroyed by the
iavages. >
Asto the next concern relating to nor corn and cattle, we
conented to have them removedto the valley where the cave
was, the land there being propere, and ucient for both.
But yet when we conidered further, we altered one part of
our reolution, which was to remove part of our cattle thither,
and there plant only part of our corn; o that in cae one
part was deroyed, the other might be preerved. YVe took.
another reolution, which really had a great deal of prudence
in it, and that was, in not truing the three avages which we
had taken prioners, with any knowledge of the plantation we
had made in that valley, or of what number of cattle, much
les the cave, wherein we conveyed everal arms, and two bar-
rels of powder you let for its, at your departure from this
iand. But though we could not change our habitation, we
renlved to make it more ortied and more eciet. To this
end, Sir, as you had planted trees at ome diance before the
entrance ofyour palace, o we, imitating yourezampie, plant-
ed and lled up the whole pace of ground, even to the banks
of the creek, nay, into the very onze where the tide flowed,
not leaving aplace for landing : And among thoe you had
planted, we alo intermihgled lb many lhort ones, all of'
which growing wonderfully fa and thick, carce a little dog
could nd the way through them, Nor was thin ucient,
as wethonght, for we did the ame to all the gtound to the
right and let of us, even to the top of the hill, without o
much as a paage or ourelves, except by the ladder ; which
being taken down, nothing but what had wings, or wit-chcraft,
could pretend to come near us. And indeed this was excel-
lently well contrived, epecially to erve that occaion, for
which 'ice-afterwards ound it neceary.
Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, not having
one viit from the avages all that time. Indeed one morn-
ing we had an alarm, which put us into ome amazement ; for
ate-few of my Spaniards being out very early, perceived no les
thantwenty canoes as it were, coming on hore : upon' which,
returning home with great precipitation, tl-ey gave us the alarm,
which obliged us to keep at home all that day, and the next,
going out only in the night time to make our Obervations:
But, as good luck would have it, they were upon another cle-'
gn, and did not land that time upon the iand. B
ot
But now there happened another quarrel between the three
wicked Englzhmen, and ome of my Sþam'ardr. The occaion
was this: One ofthem being enrage-(I at one of the avages,
whom wehad taken prioner, for not being able to compre-
hend omething,r which lie-was hewing him, he natches up
a hatchetin a greatfury, not to correct, but to" kill him 3 but
miing his head, he gave him ucha barbarous cut in his
honlder, that had like to have ruck o his arm; at which
one of my good natnred Spaniards, interpoing between the
EnglF/lzmctn and the poor tavage, beeeched the former not
to nmrderthe poor creature: But this kindnel's had like to
have co the Spam'ard'; life ; for the EnglZ/Zman ruck at him in
the ame manner, which he nimbly and uddenly avoiding,
returned uddenly upon him with his hovel, (being all at
work about their corn land) and very fairly knocked! the
hrtttih creature down. Hereupon another Englman, coming
to his tttflow's aance, laid the good Spaniard on the earth z
when immediately two others, coming to his relief, were at-
tacked by the third Englihman, armed with an old cutlas,
who wounded them both. But this uproar oon reached our
ears, who ruih'ng out upon them, took the three Engliþmen
priloners : And then, our next queion was, what hould
be done to nchmutinous and impudeot fellows, o furious,
deperate and idle, that they were michievous to the highet
degree, and conequently not ae for the ociety to let them
live among them.
Now. bir, asl was Governour in your ahence, o I alo
took the authority o a Judge, and having them brought before
me, I told them, That if they had been of **my country,l
would hang every mother's (on of them ; but ince it was an
Englzhmarz (meaning you, kind Sir,) to whom we were indebt-
ed ter our Preervation and deliverance, I would, in gratitude,
ue them with all poible mildnes; but, at__the ame time,
leave them to thejndgntent of the two other Englihmm, who,
I hoped, forgetting their reentments, would deal impartially
by them. .
Hereupon one otheir eotmtrymen flood up : Sir, aid he;
lfdW it no! to as, foryau may behnibk Me brae realm to en-
tence them to 'be gallows .' Bezder, Sir, thiefe-low, Will. Atlcim,

ng, and yet evere je put him into, that he was going to y
at me, and undoubtedly had attempted to kill me, if poeed p
of weapons, and had not been prevented by three Sþanz'ardr.
This' unparalleled and villainous earriage ma'de us eriouly
conider what was 'to be done. The two Englzhmen and the
Spaniard, who had aved the poor Indian's lite, mightily pe-
titioned me to hang one of them, foa' an example to the others,
which hould be him that had twice attempted to commit murder
with his hatchet, it being at that time thought impoble the poor
ave hould recover. But they could never gain my conent
to put him to death, for the reaons abovementioned, ince it was
an Englz'hmarz (even yourielf) was my deliverer: And, as
merciful counels are mo prevailing, when earnely preed,
o I got them to be of the ame opinion, as to clemency. But
to ' prevent them doing us any future michief, we all agreed
that they hould have no weapons, as words, guns, povt der
or hot, but he expelled from the ociety, to live how they
pleaed by themelves; That neither the two EngIZ/bmen, nor
the re of the Spaniards, hould have converation with them
upon any account whatoever: That they hould be keptfrom
coming within certain limits of our cale; and it' they dared
to oer us any violence, either by poiling, burning, killing or
deroying any of the corn, plantains, buildings, fcnces, or cat-
tle, belonging to the fociety, we would hoot them as freely as
wewould do beatts of prey, in whatoever places we hould
perceive them.
This entence eemed very ju to all but themelves; when,
like a merciful Judge, I called out to the two hone Englih-
men, faying, you mu conider they ought not to be tart-'ed
neither; and ince it will be ome time before they can raie
corn or cattle of their own, let us give them ome corn to la
them eight mouths, and for feed to ow, by which time they
will raie ome for themelves. Let us alo beow upon them
ix milch goats, four he ones, and ix kids, as well for their
preent upport, as a farther increae : together with tools ne-
Ceary for their work 5 as hatchets, an axe, aw, and other
things convenient to build them huts: All which were agreed
to; but before they took them in poeon, I 'obliged them' tol-
emnly to weat', never to attempt any thing again us or their
Countrymen for the future. Thus dimiing them from out'
ocletyv they went away, ullen and refractory, as though neith-
Cr willing to go 'no'r ay : However, eeing no remedy, they
took what proviion was given them, pretending to chue a
Convenient place, where they might live by themelves.
N About
About ve days after, they came to thoe limits appointed,
in ender for more victuals, and ent me word by one of my
Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had pitched their
tents, and marked themelves out an habitation and planta-
tion, at the N. E. and mo remote part of the iland. And in.
deed there they built themelves two very handome cottages,
reembling our little cale, being under the ide of a moun-
tain, with ome trees already growing on three ides of it; o
that planting a few more, it would have been obcured from
ight, unles particularly fought for. When thee huts were
nihed, we gave them ome dry goats' kins for bedding and
covering; and, on their giving us fuller ureties of their good
behaviour for the future, we gave them ome peas, barley, and
rice for owing, and whatever tools we could pare.
Six months did they live in this eparate condition, in which
they got their r harvet in, the quantity of which was but
mall, becaue they had planted but little land : Forindeed,
all their plantations being to form, made it the more dicult,
epecially it being a thing out of their element. And when
they' were obliged to make their boards and pots, &e. they
could make little or nothing of it. But the raioy eaon com-
ing on, put them into a greater perplexity, for want of acave
to keep their corn dry, and prevent it from poiling : And o
much did this humble them, that they begged of my Spaniards
to help them, to which the good natured men readily conem-
ed, and in four days pace worked a great hole in the ide of
the hill for them, large enough for their purpoe, to ecure
their corn and other things from the rainj though not com-
parable to our's, which had everal additional apartments.
But a new whim poeed thee rogues about three quarters
of a year afterwards, which had like to have ruined os, and
themelves too: For it eems, being tired and weary nt' this
ort of living, which made them work themelves, without
hopes of changing their condition, nothing would erve them,
but they would make a voyage to the eontinent, and try if
they could not eize upon ome of the avages, and bring them
over, as laves to do their drudgery; while they lived at eae
and pleaure. i- i
Indeed the project was not o prepo-lerous, if they had not
gone farther ; but they neither did, or propoed any thing, but
what had michief in the deign, or the event. One morning
'thee three fellows came down to the limited iation, and hum-
bly deired to be admitted to talk with us, which we readily
granted. They told us, in hort, that being tired of their
manner of living, the labour of their hands, in uch employ-
ments, not being ucient to procure the necearies of life,
they only deired one of the canoes we came over in, with
ome arms and ammunition, for their defence, and they yvoztcild
* ce
eek their fortunes abroad, and never trouble us any more.
To be ure, we were glad enough to get rid of uch wretched
plagues; but yet honely made us ingenuouly repreent to
them, by what we out-elves had uered, the certain deliruc-
tion they were running into, either of being arved to death
or murdered by the avages. To this they very audaciouly
replied, that they neither could or would work ; and cone-
quently, that they might as well be arved abroad as at home:
And as to their falling into the hands of the avages; why, if
they were murdered, that was nothing to us, there was an end
of them; they had neither wives nor children to cry after
them : Nay, o intent were they upon their voyage, that if the
Spaniards would not give them arms, o they had but the ca-
not', they would go without;
But though we could not well pare our re arms, rather
than they hould go like naked men, we let them have two
mukets, a piol, a cutlas, and three hatchets, which were
thought very ucient: We gave them alo goats' lieth, a
great baket full of dried grapes, a pot o freh bntter, a young
ive kid, and a large canoe ucient to carry twenty then.
Andthus, with a ma made of a long pole, and a fail ot ix
large goat kins dried, having a fair breeze, and a ood tide
with them, they failed merrily away, the Spaniards calling af-
ter them, Bat: Vgvaoja, no man ever expecting to ee them a-
am.
8 When they were gone, the Spam'ard: and Engl'zhmen would
often ay one to another, O bow pears-ably do Me now lime/int:
'ba/'e turbulem fellaw barve left us! Nothing could be farther
from their thoughts than to behold their aces any more; and
yet carce two and twenty days had paed over their heads, but
one of the Englzj/bmen, being abroad a planting, perceived at a
diance, thiee men well armed, approaching towards him.
Away he ies with peed to our catie, and tells me and the
re, that we were all undone, for that llrangers were landed
on the land, and who they were he could not tell, but added,
that they were not avages, but men habited, bearing arms.
'Why then, aid l, we have the les occaion to be concerned,
ince, if they are not Indiam, they mu be friends ; and I am
ure there is no Chrilian people upon earth, but what will do
us good rather than harm. But while we were conidering of
the event, up came the three Englzbmen, whoe voices we
quickly knew, and o all our admiration of that nature ceaed
at once. And our wonder was ucceeded by another ort of
enquiry, which was, What could be the occaion of their re-
turning lo quickly to the iand, when we little expected, and
much les deired their company t But, as this was better to
be related by themelves, I ordered them to be brought in,
and they gave me the following relation of their voyagek
A ter
After two days ail, or omething les, they reached land,
where they ound the people coming to give them another ort
of .reeeption, than what they expected or deired; for being
armed with bows and arrows, they dur not venture on horei,
but ieeredxnorthward ix, or even hours, till they attained to
an opening, by which they plainly perceived, that the land that
appeared from this place, was not the main, but an iland;
that at their' entranceinto the opening of the ea, they dicover-
-ed another iland, on the right hand north, and everal more
lying to the welward ; but being reolved to go on hore ome-
where or other, they put over to one of the weern ilands.
Here they found the natives very courteous to them, giving
them everal roots and dried h; nay, even the women too,
were as willing to upply them with what they could procure
them to eat, bringing it a great way to them upon their heads.
Among thoe hopitable Indian: they continued ome days, en-
quiring, by igns and tokens, what nations lay around them;
and were informed, that there were everal erce and terrible
people lived every way, accuomed to eat mankind z but, for
themelves, they never ued uch diet, except thoe who were.
taken in battle, and of them they made a olemn fea.
The Englibmen enquired, how long it was ince they had a
lea of that kind ; they anwe-red about two moons ago, point-
ing to the moon, and then to two ngers ; that at this time their
king had two hundred prioners, which were fattening up for
the daughter. Mighty deirous were the Englzhmrn for eeing
the prioners, which the others mtaking, thought that they
wanted ome of them for their own food : Upon which they
beckoned to them, painting to the riing, and then to the 'et-ct
ting of the un ; that when it appeared in the ea the next
morning, they would bring them ome : And indeed they were
'as good as their words, for by that time they brought eleven
men and ive women, jut as o many cows and oxen are
brought to ea port towne, to victual a hip. But as brutih as
thee Englihmen were, their omachs turned at the ight. What
to do in this cae they could not tell : To refue the prioners,
would have been the highe aront oered to the avage gen-
try; and to dipoe of them, theyknew not in what manner,
However, they ieolved to accept them; and o gave them in
return, one of their hatchets, an old key, a, knife, and x or
even of their bullets ; things which though wholly ignorant
of, they eemed entirely contented with, and dragging the
poor wretches into the boat, with their hands bound behind
them, delivered them to the Englih/nen. But this obliged,
themto put o asoon as they had thee preents, le the do-
hors might have eipected two or three of them to be killed,
and to be invited to dinner the next day : and o taking leavei
with all poible repect and thanks, though neither of _ them:
underood
underood what they v could ay, they  ailed away back to the
r iland, and there et eight of the men prioners at liberty.
In their voyage, they endeavou-red to comfort, and have, ome
comunication withghe poor captives; þut it was impoible to
make them enible of any thing ; and nothing they£ could ay,
or give, or do for them, could make them otherwie peruad-
ed, but that they were unbound only to be devoured. If they
gave them any food, they thought it was only to fatten them
for the [laughter 3 or looked at any one more particularly, the
poor creature thought itelf to be the r lacrice : And even
when they brought them to our iand, and began toue them
with the greate humanity and kindnes; yet they expected
every day their new maers would devour them. r
And thus, Sir, did thee three range wanderers conclude
the unaccountable relation of their voyage, which was both a-
maztng and entertaining. Hereupon I ak'ed them where their
new family was? They told me, they had put them into one
of their huts, and they came 'to beg ome victuals for them.
This, indeed, made us long to ee them; and to, taking Fri-
day's father with us, leaving only two at our callle, we came
down to behold thee poor creatures.
When we arrived at the hut (being bound again by the
Englzhmen, for fear of ecaping) there they all at, ark naked,
expecting their fatal tragedy : There were three lulty comely
men, well haped, with rait and fair limbs, between thirty
and ve and thirty years old ; and ve women, two of whom'
might be from thirty to forty, two more not above our and
twenty 5 and the la, a comely tall maiden of about l'eventeen.
Indeed all the women were very agreeable, both in their pro-
portion and eatures, except being tawny, which their modelit
behaviour and other graces made amends for, when they af-
terwards came to be clothed.
Their naked appearance, together with their mierable-cir-
cumtances, was no very comfortable ight to my Spaniards,
who, for their parts, I may venture, Sir, without attery, to
ay, are men of the be behaviour, calme tempers, and weet-
e natures, that can pobly be: For they immediately or.
dered Friday's father to ee if he knew any of them, or if he i
underood what they could ay. No ooner did the old Indian
appear, but he looked at them with great eriounes 3 yet, not,
being of his nation, they'were utter rangers to him, and none"
could underand his peech, or igns, but one woman. Thisct
was enough to anwer the deign, which was, to aure them
they would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of Chri-
tians, whoabhorred uch barbarity. When theynwere fuliy
atised of this, they. expreed their joy by uch trange get-t'
1u>tfes,:;,and uncommon-remes," as are not poble for meto den;
cribei But the woman, theirinterpreter, was'ordered next to"
N z w ehquire,®

enquire, whether they were content to be ervants, and wouid
work or the men who had brought them thither to ave their
lives? Here-upon (being by this time unbound) they ell a ca.
pering and dancing, one taking this thing upon her houlders,
and t'other that, intimating that they were willing to do any
thing for them. But now, Sir, having women among us, and'
dreading that it might occaion ome trike, i not blood, 1 aked
the three men what they would do, and how they intended to
ue thee creatures, whether as ervants or women t One of
them very pertly and readily anlwered, they would uethem
as both. Gentlemen, aid I, as you are your own matters, I
am not going to retrain you from that; but methinks, for a-
voiding dienions among you, I wouid only deire you to en-
gage, That none of you will take more than one ot' a woman
or a wie; and that having taken this one, none'ele hould
preume to touch her; for though we have not a prieltly au-
thority to marry you, yet it is but reaonable, that whoever
thus takes a woman, hould be obliged to mantain her; ince
nobody ele has any thing to do with her: And this indeed
appeared o ju to all preent, that it was unanimouy agreed
o. Then the Eg/mct alked my Spaniards, whether they
deigned to take any ot' them t But they all anwered no, ome
declaring, they had already wives in Sþain, and others, that
they cared not to join with inidels. On the revere, the En-
glzhmerx took each of them a temporary wie, and et up a new
method ot living. As to Fridaj's father, the Spaniards, and
the three avage et-vants we had taken in the late battle, they
all lived with me in our ancient cale ; and indeed we uppli-
ed the main part o the illand with food, as neceity required.
But the mo remarkable part of the ory is, how thee Enga
Iz'bmen, who had been o much at variance, hould agree about
the choice of thee women ; yet they took a good way enough
to prevent quarrelling among themelves. They et the ve
'women in one of their huts, and going themelves to the oth-
er, drew lots which hould have the r choice. Now he that
had the r went to the hut, and fetched out her he choe a
and it is remarkable, that he that choe r, took her that was
accounted the mo homely, and elde o the number, which
made the ret ot the Englzhmn exceeding merry, and the Spa-
retard: themelves could not but mile at it 2 But, as it happen-
ed, the fellow had the be thought, in chuing one t for ap-
plication and buines; a-nd indeed he proved the belt wife of
all the parcel.
But, when the poor creatures perceived themelves placed in
a row, and eparated one by one, they were again eized with
an unpeakable terror, as thinking they were now going to be
ain in 'earnetz And when the Englybman- came to take the
firt, the re et up a lamentable cry, clapt their arms argued
' er
her neck, and hanging about her, took their -la fat-rewel, as
they thought, in uch trembling agomes, and aectionate em-
braces, as would have oftened the harde heart in the world,
and made the drie eyes melt into watery tears: Nor could
they be peruaded, but that they were going to die, till uch
time as Fridays father made them enible, that the Englih/nen
had cholen them for their wives z and o ended all their ter-
ror and concern upon this occaion. .
Well, after this, 'he Englzhmen. went to work, and, being
aiiiied by my good natured avages, in a few hours they e-
rected every one of them a new hot or tent, for their eparate
lodging, ince thoe they had already were lled with tools,
houehold uand proviion. They all continued on the north
there of the iiand, but eparate as before; the three wicked
ones pitched farther o, and the two hone men nearer hand
to our catle : So that the iiand eemed to be peopled in three
places, three towns beginning to be buih for that purpoe.
And here I cannot but remark, what is very common, that
the two hone men had the wor wives (I mean as to indury,
cleanlines and ingenuity) while the three reprobates enjoyed
women of the contrary perections. k
But another Obervation I made is in favour of the two hon-
e men, to hew what diiparity there is between a diligent ap-
plication to buines, on the one hand, and a lothkul, negligent,
and idle temper, on the other. Both of them had an equal
parcel of ground laid out, and corn to iw ucient for them z,
but both did not make the ame improvements, either in their
cultivation or in their planting. The 'two hone men had a
multitude o young trees planted about their habitations, o
that when you approached. near them, nothing appeared but at
wood, very pleaing and delightt'uh Every thing they did
propered and ourihed ; their grapes,plantedin order, eem-
ed as though managed in a.- vineyard, and were innirely pre-
ferabie to any of the others. Nor were they wanting to nd,
out a place of retreat ; but dug a cave in the mo retired part'
of a thick wood to ecure their wives and children, with their
proviion and chiefe goods, ful-rounded: with innumerable-
takes, and had the mo ubtle entranee, in cae any michief
hould happen, either by their fellow count-rymen, or the de-
'ouring avages.
As to the reprobates (though I mu own they were much
more civiliaed thanv before) inead ofa delightul wood ur-
rounding their dwellings, we ound the words of King Solomon.
too truly veried : I rwent by 'be vvz'ncjard of the otbfd, and it-
'was tower-grown 'with tlaorm. In many places their crop was
obcured by weeds; the hedges, having cvyeral gaps in them,
the wild goats had got in and eaten up the corn; and here and
there was a dead buh, to op in thoe gaps for the pgjztz,
w ict
which was no more, than hutting the liable door 'after the deed
was lolen away. , But for their wives, they (as l oberved be-
fore) were more diligent, and cleanly enough, epecially in
their victuals, being inructed, by one of the hone men, who
was a cook's mate on board a hip: And very well it was o,
for, cooking himelf, his companion and their families lived as
well as the idle huhands, who did nothing but loiter about,
fetch turtles eggs, catch h and birds, and any thing but work,
and they lived accordingly ; while the diligent lived very hand.
omely and plentifully, in the mo comfortable manner.
And now, Sir, l am come to lay before your eyes a cene,
"quite dierent from anything that ever happened to us be-
tore ; and, perhaps, ever bet'el yon in all the time of your
reidence on this iland : I hall inform you of its original in
the following manner.
One morning, Sir, very early, there came ve or ix canoes
of Indian: on hore, indilputably upon their old cuiom of de-
vouring their prioners. All that we could do upon uch an
occaion, was to lie concealed z and they not having any no.
tice of the inhabitants, would depart quietly, after perform.
ing their bloody execution. Whoever dicovered thee ava-
ges r was to give notice to all the three plantatipns, _to keep
within doors; and then proper cout was to ced, to
give us intelligence of their departure. But niioicttwt -_handing
thee wie mealures,an unhappy dialler expoed us to the knowl-
edge of the avages, which had like to have caued the cleola-
tion of the whole illand: For after the avages were gone o
in their caxnoes, omevof my Spaniards and I, looking abroad,
and enamed with a Curioity. to ee what they had been doing
here, to our great amazeinent, we beheld three avages fa
aleep on the ground, who either being gorged, could not
awake when the others went ; or, having wandered too far in-
to the woods, diid not colne back in time.
What to do with them at r we could not tell : As for
il-aves we, had, enough of them already ; and as to killing them,
neither chriiianity, nor humanity, would uer us to hed inz,
nooent blood, iwho never did us wrong, and therefore had
nnju quarrel again them, to julliy opr taking their lives
away. We perceived they had no boat left them to tran-
port them to their own nation; and that, by letting them,
wander about, they might dicover us, andin-form the firt av-
ages that hould happen to land on' this bloody occaion 5
which information might entirely-"ruin us hand therefore I.
counelled my Spaniards toiecure them, and det1 them aboun
ome work or other till we could better dipoe fof them.
Hereupon we all went back, and making them awake, took,
them prioners. It is impoible to expres the hot-rout they,
were in, epecially when bound, as thinking they were going,-
to
,.1-53
tobemurdered and eaten z but we oon eaed them of teir
ear as to thatkpointa We r took them to the bower, where
was the chief o our country work ; as keeping goats, plant-
ing corn, &Sir. and then carried them to the two Englzhmm'a
habitation, to help them in their buines : But happy it w
for us all, we did not carry them to our cale, as will appear
by the equel. The Englzhmen indeed found them work to
do 5, but, whether they did not guard them rictly, or that
they thought they could not better themelves, I cannot tell ;
but certainly one of them ran away intothe woods, and they
could not hear of him for a long time after.
Undoubtedly there was reaon enough to uppoe he got home
in ome othe canoes, the avages returning in about four
week's time, and going o in the pace of two days. You
may be certain, Sir, this thought could not but terriy us ex-
ceedingly ; and made us july conclude, that this avago
would inform his countrymen of our abode in the iland, how
few and weak we were in comparion to their numbers ; ex-
peci'ting it would not be long before the Englih/nen would be
attacked in their habitations 5 but the lavages had not een
their places ot aety in the wood, nor our satle, which it was
a great happinels they did not know. p U
Nor were we miaken in our thoughts upotctct'this occaion :
for about eight months after this, ix cxanues of avages, with
about ten men in each canoe, came ailing by the north ide.
of the iand, which they were never accutomed to do before,
and landed about an hour after un rie, near a mile from
the dwelling of the two Englihmm, who, it eems; had the
good fortune to dicover them about a league o; o it was
about an hour before they could attain the there, and it re-
quired ome longer time before they could come at them.
And being now conrmed in this opinion, that they were cer-
tainly betrayed, they immediately bound the two (layes which
were let, cauing two of the three men, whom they had
brought with the women, and who proved very faithful, to
lead them with their wives, and other conveniencies, into their
rcured cave in the wood, and there to bind the two fellows
hand and foot till they had further orders. Then they opened
their fences where they kept their milch goats, and drove
them all out, giving the goats liberty to wander in the woods,
to amuethe avages that they were wild ones ; but the Have
had given a truer information, which made them come toviheir
very incloures. The two frighted men ent the other lave of
the three, who, had been with them by accident, to alarm the:
Spaniardr, and deire their aiiiance 5 in the mean" time 'they
mak their arms and ammunition, and made to the cave where.
they hadent their wives, and ecuring their laves, eat-ed:
hgmves In a prieste place, from whence they might blelhold
a
all theactions of the avages; Nor had they gone far, and
acending a riing ground, but they could ee a little army of
Indiam approach to their beautiful dwelling ; and, Pin a few
moments more, perceived the ame, and their furniture, to
'their unpeakable grief, burning in a conuming ame : And
when this was done, they pread here and there, earching
every 'both and place for the people, of whom it was evident
they had information. Upon which the two Engl'zhmen not
thinking themelves ecure where they ood, retreated about
half a mile farther into the'country, rightly concluding that
the farther the attages rolled, there'would be the les num-
ber together : Uþonj'which they took their next and where
the trunk of an' old _tree ood, very hollow and large,-where
they reolved to ee what would oer. But they had not
flood long there, before two avages came running directly
towards'them,'as though having knowledge of their being
there, they reolved to attack them. A little farther were
three more, and ve more behind them again, all running
the ame way. lt cannot be imagined what rperplertity'tlie
poor men were in at this ight, thinking that, i aiance did
not peedily come, their cave would be dicovered in the
wood, and conequently all therein lot. So they reolved to A
rei them there ; and, when overpowered, would acend to
t the top of the trees, where they would defend themelves as
long as their ammunition laed, and ell their lives as dear as
pbble to thoe deitouring iavages. Thus xed upon their
reolution, they next conidered whether they hould re at
the r two, or wait for the three. and o take the middle par-
ty, by which the two r and the ve la would he eparated.
In this regulation the two avages alo conrmed them, by
turning a little to the other part of the wood z but the three,
and the ve after them, came directly towards the tree. Here-
ttpon they reolved to take them in a direct line as they ap-
proached nearer, becaue the r hot might perhaps hit them
all three ; and upon this occaion, the man who was to re
charged his, piece with three or four bnliets. And thus,
While they were waiting, the avages came on : one of them
was the run-away, who had caued all their michief, o they
relolved he hould not ecape, if they both red 'at once. But
however, though they did not re together, they were ready
charged; when the 'r that let y was too good'a markman
to mis his aim ; for he killed the foremol ootright; the ec-
ond, who was the run away Indian fell on the ground, being
hot through the body, but not dead; and the third 'WZISB
little wounded on the houlder, who itting down on "The
ground, fell a creaming in a moi fearful manner. The
noie of the gons, which not only made the mo reottndmg
echoes, fr'bm one'ide to another, but raied the' birds of 'all
orts
orts, attering with the mo confued noie, o much terried
the ve avages behind, that they ood ill at r like o ma.
ny inanimate images. But when every thing was in its r pro.
found ilence, they came to the place where their companions
iayin a mierable condition t And here, not being enible that
they were liable to the ame fate, they ood over the wounded
man," undoubtedly enquiring the caue of his ad calamity 5
and, as 'tis reaonable to uppoe, he told them that it came
by lightning and thunder from the gods, having never een
or heard ofa gab before, in the whole coure of their lives.
By this time the Englzhmemhaving loaded their pieces, ired
'both togethera econd time, when, eeing them all fall im.
mediately upon the ground, they thought they had killed eve-
ty creature of them. This made them come up boldly before
they had charged their guns, which indeed was a wrong ep ;
for, when they came to the place, they ound four alive, two of
them a very little wounded and one, not at all, which obliged
them to fall upon them with their mulkets: They r knock-
ed the run away avage on the head, and another that was but
a little wounded in the arm, and then put the other languih-
iog wretches out of their pain; while he that was not hurt,
with bended knees, and lift up hands, made piteous moans and
igns to them to pare his lite : Nor were they indeed unmer-
ciful to the poor wretch, but pointed to him to it, down at;
'the root of a tree hard by, and then one othe Englybmen, with
a piece of rope twine he had in his pocket by were chance,
tying his two feet fa together, and his two hands behind him,
there they left him, making all the hae they could after the
other two, fearing they hould nd out their cave; but though
they could not overtake them, yet they had the atisfaction to
perceive them, at a ditance cros over a valley towards the
ea, a quite contrary way to their retreat : Upon which they
very contentedly returned to the tree, to look after their
prioner 5 but when they came there he was gone, leaving the
pieces of rope-yarn wherewith he was bound, behind him.
_ Well, now they were as much concerned as ever, not know-
ing how near their enemies might be, or in what numbers:
Immediately they repaired to their cave, to ee if all were well
there, and ound every thing afe, except the women who were
frighted upon their hubands' account, whom they now loved
eljrely. They had not been long here, before even of my
Spaniards came to ali them 3" whilesthe other ten, their erjju
&Us. and Friday's father, were gone to defend their bower,
cornaod cattle, in cae the avages hould have rambled lo-
.far. There accompanied the even Spaniards one of the
three avages, that had formerly been taken prioner 5 and,
with them alo, that very Irzdia'n whom the Englzhmen had a
llftlejbefottgleft uuderthe tree; for it eems they paged by
* * t at; _
that way where the daughter was made, o carried along with
them that poor wretch that was let bound. But o many
prioners now becoming a burthen to us, and fearing the
dreadful conequence ot their elcaping, "mo of the Spaniards
and Englih urged the abolute neceity there was for killing
them, for our common Preervation : But, Sir, the authority I
bore as Govemour overwayed that pieceof cruelty 5 and then
l ordered them to be ent prioners to the-old cave in the val.
ley, bound hands and feet, with two Spaniards to guard them.
So much encouraged were the Englzhmen, at the approach
of the Spaniardr, and o great was their fury again the avag-
es, for deiroying their habitations, that they had not patience
to ay any longer 5 but taking ve Spaniards along with them,
armed with our muikets, a piiol, and a quarter a, away
they went in puruit 0 their enemies. As they paed by the
place where the avages were ain, it was very eay to be per-
ceived that more of them had been there, having attempted
to carry o their dead bodies, but found it impracticable.
From a riing ground our party had the mortication to ee
the moke that proceeded from the ruins z When, coming far-
ther in ight of the hore, they plainly perceived that the av-
ages had embarked in their canoes, and were putting out to
ea. This they were very orry for, there being no coming
at them, to give them a parting alutation: But, however,
they were glad enough to get rid of uch unwelcome gues.
fThus the two hone, but unfortunate Englibmen, being
foined a econd time, and their improvements quite detroyed,
mo of my good natured Spanz'ardi helped them to re-build,
and we all helped them with needful upplies: Nay, what is
more remarkable, their three michievous countrymen, when
they heard it (which was after all thee diaiers were over,
they living remote eaiward) ympathized with them in a very
friendly manner, and worked for them everal days ; o that
in a little time their habitation was rebuilt, their neceties
upplied, and themelves reored to their former tran-
quillity.
The avages had nothing to boa of in this adventure,
everal canoes being driven ahore, followed by two drowned
creatures, having undoubtedly met with a iorm at ea, that
very night they departed. Norcan itbe uppoed otherwie,
but thoe, whoe better fortune it was to attain their native
more, would ename their nation to another Aruinous attempt,
with a greater orce to carry all before them. * And indeed' o
it happened; for bout even months after, our iland'as
invaded with as? ormidable navy ; no les than, ei hzgnd
twenty canoesctull of avages, armed with wooden &itrdzta'
monrous clobs, bows and arrows, and uch like inrunintiis
of war, landed that evening at the eamot ide of theiTC
on
Yon may well imagine, Sir, 'what conetnation our men
were in upon this account, and how peedy they were to exe.
oute their reolution, 'having only that night's time allowed
th'etn. They knew that ince theycould not withiand their
enemies, eoneealmcnt was the only way to procure their afe-
ty : And therefore they took down the huts that were built
for the two Englzhmen, and drove their ock of goats together
with their own at the bower, to the-old cave in the valley;
they left as little appearance of inhabitants as poible, and then
poed themelves with all their force, at the plantatiton of the
two men. As they expected, o it happened 5 or early the ,
next morning the ndiam, leaving their canoes at (he ca end-
of ' the il'and, came-running along" the hare, about two hun-
dred and fty in number, as near as can be gueed. Our
army was but little indeed ; and, what was our greater mi-
fortune, we had not arms ucient or them: The account,-
as to the men, Sir, is as follows : .

As to our laves, we gave three of them halberts, and the
other three long aves, with great iron pikes at the end of
them, with hatchets by their ides : We alo had hatchets too,

were krightened to the highe degree; and when the econd
volley was given, they concluded no les but their companions
were flain by thunder and lightning from heaven. And in this
notion they would have continued, had Will. Atkim and his
men retired as oon as they ired, according to order, or had
the rielt been near them, to pour in their hot continually, there
might have been a complete victory obtained ;_ but taying to
load their pieces again, dicovered the whole matter. They
were perceived by ome of the cattering avages at a diliance,
who let y their arrows among them, wounded Atkins himelf,
and killed his fellow Englzhmrm, and one of the Indian: taken
with the women. Nor did out' party fail to anwer them while
they tretreated, killing above twenty avages: And here l can-
not but take notice of our poor dying ilave ; though opt
from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his a and hatch-
et, he deperately and gallantly aailcd the puruers, andkill-
ed ve of the avages, before his life ubmitted to a multiplici-
ty of wounds. Nor is the cruelty' or malice of the Indian; to
be les remarked, in breaking the arms, legs, and heads, of the
two dead bodies, with their clubs and wooden words, after a
mo wretched manner. Hereupon our party was obligedbto
interpoe between the avages and Atkim, who had retreated
to a riing ground in the wood ; but after three vollies we were
obliged to retreat alo; for they were o very numerous and
deperate, that they came to the very teeth ot us, hot their ar-
rows like a cloud, and their wounded men, enraged with cru-
el pain, fought like madmen. They did not think t to ol-
iow us, but drawing themelves up in a circle, they gave two
triumphant hoots, in token of victory ; though they had the
þggie to ee everal of their wounded bleed to death before
t em.
_ After l had, Sir, drawn up our. little army together upon a

By the brightnes of the moon that night, we perceived the
favages in great diorder, about their dead and wounded men.
This made us change our reolntion, by falling upon them in-
the night, if we eontd give them one volley unditcovered, And'
this we had a fair opportunity tov do, by one of the two Eng-
lzhmen's leading u-s round between the woods and the ea ide

ed from among the trees to the very teeth of the enemy, end-
ing forth the greate (houtsyand acrlamations. The avages,
hearing a dierent noie from three quarters at once, tood in

'did not prove mortal. But ruhing in uddenly among them.

get the valour of the two women, for, they expoed themelves
'to the greatet danger-s, killed many with their arrows, and
valiantly deroyed everal more with their hatchets.
indeed we were o much tired in ghting thee two battles,
that 'we did not then trouble ourelves to purue them to their
eanoes, in which we thought they would preently put to the
ocean :: But there happened a dreadjl orm at eat, which
'continued an that night, and not only prevented their voyage,

Hereupon, coming within muket hot of them, I ordered two

another battle, or were utterly dipirited from uch an attempt,
that we might manage them accordingly. And indeed the pro-
ject took very well ; for no ooner did the avages hear the
r gun, and perceive the ah of the econd, but they ud-
denly arted upon their feet, in the greate conlernation; and
When we approached towards them, they ran howling and
creaming away up the hill into the country.
We could iather, at r, have withed that the weather had
permitted them to have gone 'o to the ea; but, when we
conidered that their ecape might' occaion the approach of
multitudes to our utter ruin and deolation, we were very well
pleaed the contrary happened : And Will. dtkimgwho, though
wounded, would not part from us all this while, advied us
not to let ip this advantage, but clapping between them and
their boats, deprive them of the capacity of ever returning to
plague the iand. I &na-w, aid he, there z': but one olzjrctz'an you
ran mal-e; 'which is, that the/2' creatures, living lite bea: in 'be
Wood, may make gxrmiozzs, rife 'be pamatiom, and tle/fig' 'be
'ame gears : But 'ben conider, 'we bad better barn-e to do 'with an
'þyndrrd man, rwbom ewe am kill, or make-ame: of a: Iezure, that
'with a hundred nations; twlbom it is impqble cwe hould et-w aur-
l-vesram, murb Irrubdue. This advice, and thee arguments
being approved ot, we et fire to their boats; and, though they
were o wet that they would not burn entirely, yet we made
them incapable of wimming in the teas. As oon as the In-
diam- perceived what we were doing, many of them ran out of
the woods in ight o us, and kneeling down, piteouy cried
out Oa, Oa, War-senator', intimating, I uppoe, that if we would
but pare their canoes, they would never trouble us again.
But all their compieiuts, and ubmiions, and entreaties
were in vain; for, elf pt eervation obliging us to the contra-
ry, we detroyed every one othem that had ecaped the fury
or' the oceany When the Indian: perceived this, they raied a
lamentable cry, and ran into the woods, and from thence rang-
ed about the whole iland. Here we hould have conidered
indeed, that making thee creatures thus deperate, we ought,
at the ame time, to have et a ucient guard upon the plan-
tations. The avages had before found out the bower, de-
iroyed the ence-s, trod the corn down under foot, and torn up
the vines and grapes. But though we were able, upon all oc-
caions, to ght thee creatures; yet they were too wit for us,
nor dnr we go out ingle, for fear of 'their numbers : But our
only comfort was, they had no weapons, nor any materialcto
" ma

make them; and their extremity appeared' in alittle time-
after.
As to our own parts, the only refuge we had left, was our
ock of cattle in the valley by the cave, with ome little corn
that grew there, and the plantation of Will. meint and-his com-
panions, one of whom'being killed by an arrow, they: were now
reduced to two. And it is' remarkable, that this was the fel-
low that cut the poor Indian-with his hatchet, and had a deign;w
to murder me and my countrymen, the Sjpaniardr; Such- was
our mean condition, that we concluded to drive the avages up
to the farther part of the il'and,.outh we; at prcent,.w=here
no Indian: landed, killing as many. of them as> we could, till we
had reduced their number, and then give the remainder ome.
corn to plant, teaching them how to live by their daily labour.
Accordingly we purued them with our gons, at the hearing,
of which, they. were o terried, that they would'fall upon the
ground. Every day we killed and woundedome of them, and
many we found iarved to death, o that our hearts began to
relent at the ight of uch mierable objects. At la, with
great diculty, taking one of them alive, andung him with:
kindnes and tendernes, we brought him' to old Friday, who
talked to him, and told him how- good we would be to them.-
all, giving them corn and landto plant and live in, and re.

ers : And tberqnre, aid he, go your rway, and inform your calm-

The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, and being reduced.
to about thirty even, joyully accepted the oer, and earnely
begged for ome food : Hereupon we ent twelve Spaniards,
and two Englzhmm. well armed, together with old Friday, and
three Indian aves, who marched to the place where they were;
the aves were loadedwith a-large quantity of bread,.and ries'
cakes, leading three live goats. Being ordered to it down on

THERE is no doubt to uppoe, but that the preceding re-
lation of my faithful Spaniard was very agreeable, and no les
urpriing to me, the young Prie, and to all that heard it:
Nor were thee people les pleaed with thoe abolutely ne-
ceary utetzils that [brought them, as kinives, ciars, pades,
hovels, 'and pick axes, with which they made a mighty im-
provement to their habitations. So much were they aected
to wicket work', prompted by the ingenuity of the Indian: who
aiied them, that when l viewcd the Er'zglg'lþmem' colonies,
they leemied at a diance, as though they had lived like bees
in a hive: For Will. rit/rim, who was now become a very in-
durious and ober man, had made himelf a tent of baket
work round the outide 3 the walls were worked in cloe as 3
balket, in panne's, or trong quares of 32 in number, and-
ingabout 7 feet high; in the middle was another, not above
22. paces round, but much ronger built, being in form eight
quare, and in the eight corners tood eight rong Pos, round
the top of. which he laid rong pieces, pinned with wooden pmsz
from which he raied a pyramid from the roof, mighiy grew:
'a me
I 53'
I aure you, and joined ve, well together with iron pikes
which he made himelf ; for e had made him a forge with a
pair of wooden bellows, and charcoal for his work, forming an
anvil out of one of the iron ctows to work upon ; and in this
manner would he make himelf hooks, aples, pikes, bolts,
and hinges. After he had covered the ro'of of the innermott
tent, he made it o rm between the raters and the baket
work, thatching that over again with rice traw, and over that
a large leaf oa tree, that his houe was as dry as if it had been
tiled or ated. The outer circuit was covered, as a leanto,
quite round this inner apartment, laying long rat'ters from the
32 angles, to the top polls of the inner houe, about zo feet
ditant, o that there was a pace like a walk within the outer
wicker wall, and without the inner, near no feet in breadth.
The inner place he partitioned o with the ame wicker work,
dividing it into ix fair apartments, every one of which had a
door, r into the entry of the main tent, and another into the
pace and walk that was round it, not only convenient for re-
treat, but for family necearies. Thoe ix paces were not
taken up in the circumerence. \Vhat other apartments the
outward circle had, were thus ordered When you were in at
the door of the outer circle, there was aipaage directly to the
door of the inner houe; on either de was a wicker partition
and a door, by which you went r into a'large room az feet
wide, and about 30 long, and through that into another of a
maller length ; to that in the outward circle were ten hand-
onie rooms, ix of which were only to be come at through the
apartments of the inner tent, erving as retiring rooms, to the
repective chambers of the inner circle, and four large ware.
houes which went in through one another, two on either hand
of the paage that led through the outward door to the inner
tent. In hort, nothing could be built more ingeniouy, kept
more neat, or have better ctni-eniences ; And here-lived three
families, Will. Atkim, his companion, their wives and children,
and the widow of the oeceaed. As to religion, the men el..
dom taught their wives the knowledge of God, any more than
the ailors' cuom of (wearing by his name. The greate im-
pzrovement their wives had, was, they taught them to peak
nglih o as to be undertlood. None of their children were
then above ix years old. They were all fruitful enough ; and,
I think, the Cook's mate's wie was big of her ixth child.
So much as to the Englz'þmen. When I enquired of the
Spaniards, about their circumances among the avages, they
gold me, tha: they were a poor mierable handful of people,
that, having no means put into their hands, were abandoned
to depair, and' thought of nothing but lat-ving, One of them

dire'sggreaterpreence of mind; than thoe ot any other
country thatct'hev lmd met with 5. and'that t'hey,,and the Fortu-
guejlv, were the" wor menxin the world to ruggle unden mis-
fortune. When theylanded among the avages, they found
but little proviion, unles they would turn cannibals z there-
being' but a few roots and herbs with little ubance in them,
and of which the net-tives gave them but very paringly. Ma,
ny were the ways they took to eivilize and teach the av-
ages, but in vain; nor Would'they own them to be their in-x
ilructors, whoe lives were owing- to their bountyu. Their
extremities were very great, being many days entirely without
food 3 the avages there being more indolent, andles devour-s
ing, than thoe who had' better upplies, YVhenever war hap-
pened, they a-ted thee people, being compelled thereto, and
by which, my faithful Spaniand beingtaken, had' like to have
been devoured; They had lot theirammunition,_which ren-
dered- their re arms ueles z. nor couldthey ue the bows ands
arrows that were given them z- o that while the armies-were at
a diance they had no chance, but would combat their enemies
when cloed with halberts, and harpened" icks put into the
muzzles of their mukets. They made themelves targets of
wood, covered with the fkins of wild' beals 3, and when one
happenedto be knocked down, the ret of the company fought
over him till he recovered ;_, and' then anding cloe in a line,.
-*they would make their way through-a-thouand.av-ages. At.
the'return o- their friend, who they thought had been entomb-
ed in the bewels of their enemies,_, their joy was inconcew-
able. Nor were they les unpried at the ight of- the loaves-
ofbread Ihad ent them, things that they had not een for
everal years, at the ame time crong and bleng it, asthough-
it was manne: ent from heaven :: But when they knew the
errand, and perceived the boat, which was to carry them" to.-
the peron and place from whence uch relief came, this truck
them-with a urpr-ie of joy, that made ome of them fain-t
away, and other-s bur-into tears. r
This was the ummary account that-[had from- them; o
that it now becomes neceary I inform the reader what I> did
for them, and in what a condition I let them. As we, were
aliagreed. that the avages would; carce, trouble "them any,-
more
more, o we had no apprehenions about it. I told them I was
come purely to eablith them, and not remove them 3 and
upon that occaion, had not only brought them necearies for
convenience and defence, butalo articers, and other perons,
both for their neceary employments, and to add to their 
number. They were all together when I thus talked tothem ;
and, before I delivered to them the tores I had brought, l alked
them one by one, i they had entirely forgot their old animoi'-
ties, would engage in the ricte friendhip, and hake hands
with one another? To this, Will. Arkim, with abundance of
good humour, aid they had aictions enough to make them
all ober, and enemies enough to make them all friends ; As
for himelf, he would live and die among them : owning that
what the Spaniards had done to him, his own mad humour
had made neceary for them to do. Nor had the Spaniards
occaion to julliy this proceeding to me z but they told me,
that ince Will. lit/tim- had behaved himelf o valiantly in light,
and at other times hewed uch a regard to the common interc
of them all, they had not only forgot all that was pall, but
thought he ought to be as much truled with arms and nece-
aries as any of them, which they tetiied by making him com-
mand next to the Governour 3 and they mo heartily embrac-
ed the opportunity of giving me this olemn allurance,that they
would never eparate their intere again as long as they lived.
Well, upon thee kind declarations of friendhip, we. ap-
pointed all of us to dine together the next' day, on which I
caued the hip's cook, and his mate, to come' on hare for
that purpoe, and the cook's mate on laud aed them in
dreng our dinner. We brought from the hip ix pieces of
beef, and our of pork, together with our punch bow), and
materials to ll it z and, in particular, I gave them ten bottles
of French Claret, and ten of Englz'h beer, which was very ac-
ccptable to them. The Spaniards added to our feat vewholc
kids; which being roaed, three of them were lent as freh
meat to the ailors ondboard, and the other two we ate our-
,elves. After our merry and innocent eat was over, I began
to diribute my cargo among them ; at r [gave them- lin-
en ucient to make every one of them four huts, and, at the
Sþam'ard's requel, made them up ix. The thin Englih lus
I allotted to make every one a light, coat, like a flock, agree-
able to the climate 3 and let them uch a quantity, as to make
more upon their decay ; as alo pumps, hot-s, hats, and

ttwo earpenters ;but epeeially my Jack of all Trades, was a re.
markable man among them. My taylor fell immediately to
work, and made every man of them a fhirt ; after yvhich he
learned the women to ew and itch, thereby to become more
helpful to their hnhands. Neither were the carpenters les
ueful, takingin pieces their clumy things, inead of which
they made convenient and handlome tables, iools, bedeads,
tinphoards, lockers and helves. But when I carried them to
'ee Will. Aniim's balket houe, they owned they never aw uch
a piece of natural ingenuity before. I'm ure, aid one of the

crow. a broad axe, and a aw, with a itore for a general up-
ply, hould any he broken or' worn out. l left them alo nails,

to death) together with 'the maid, a pious and well educated'
young woman, eeing things' o well ordered on (hote (for I
made them accompany me) as alo conidering they had nooc-
calion to go o lon a* voyage as to the Ea-lndz'erz they
both deire'd of me, t at I would leave them there, and enter
them among my iibjects. This l readily agreed to, ordering
themaplat of ground, on which were three little hones-
erected,_environed with" baket-work,. palliadoed like Atkim's,
iand adjoining to his plantation. So contrived were their tents
that each of them had a room apart to lodge in ; while the
'middle "tent was not only their Ptore houe, but their place for
veating and drinking. At this time the two Englihmen remov-
ed their habitations to their former place ; lo that now the-
iland was divided into three colonies : Fir, thee I have ju-
now mentioned: Set-onely, that of Will. Atkz'm, 'where there

in my life. . '
Sir (aid he to me one day) ince under God (at the ame
time croing his breat) you have not only aved my lite, but,
by permitting me to go this voyage, have granted me the hap-
znmes oi free convex-ation, I think it my duty, as my prote-
non obliges me to ave what ouls I can', by bringing them to
the knowledge of ome Catholic doctrine, neceary to alva-
tion ; but ince they are under your immediate government,
in gratitude, juice, and decency, for what you have done for
me:_l hall oer no farther points in religion, than what hall
merit your approbation. Pleaed with the modey of his car-
rtage, I told him he hould not be the wore ued for being of

poor India-m ought to be inructed in the knowledge of the
true God, and his Son Jeus Chri. To this he replied, That

he would dicoure with me rather as a gentleman than a reli-
S'OUS; but, if we did enter upon religious arguments, upon
nzy deiring the ame, that I would give him liberty to defend
Us own principles. He further added, that he would do all
- that become him in his oce, as a Prie, as well as a chriian,
to procure the happines of all that were in the hip; that
though he could not pray with, he would pray for us, on all :
occaions : And then he told me everal extraordinary events
Of lus life, within a few years pa, but particularly in this la,
which was the mo remarkable : Thatin this voyage the had

zmrlfit-ign was to have gone to Ilartinico, for which he took
3 hlPat St. llala, but was forced into Li/Z-an by had weather,
Zhe Veel running aground in the mouth of the age: 2 That
tm thence he went on board a Portuguge hip bound to the

their leading at the me of May, and to fail to Ne-uxndlaad;
at the banks of which they met a French hip, bound to Walter-i,
in the river of Canada, and from thence to Martz'm'co: In this
hip he embarked, the mailer of which dying at Rye-bark, that
voyage was upended : And laly, thipping himelf for frame,
that hip was deroyed by the fury of the ames, as before has
been related : And o our dicoure ended for that time.
Another morning he comes to me, ju as I was going to
viit the Englzhmms' colony, and tells me, that as he knew the
prolperity of the iland was my principal deire, o he had
omething to communicate agreeable to my deign, and perhaps
might put it, more than he yet thought it was, in the way of
the benediction of heaven. How, Sir! aid l in a urprie,-
are we not yet in the way of God's bleng, after all thee
ignal providences and deliverances, o which you have had
uch an ample relation t He replied, I hope, Sir, you are in
the way, and that your good deign will profper; but ill
there are ome among you that are not 'equally right in? their
actions: And remember, lbeeech you, Sir, that Acbcm; by
his crime, removed God's bleing from the camp of the Chil-
dren of rael; that, though ix and thirty were entirely in-
nocent, yet they became the objects of divine vengeance, and
bore the weight of the punihment accordingly.
So enibly was I touched with this dicoure, and o atised
with that ardent piety that enamed his oul, that I deired
him t'o accompany me to the Englj/bmem' plantations, which
he was very glad of, by reaon they were the lubjects of what
he deigned to dicoure with me about. So we walked on to-
gether, and then he began in the following manner :
Sir, aid he, I mu confes it is a great unhappines that we
diagreein everal doctrinal articles of religion ; but yet this
'we acknowledge, that there is a GOD, who, having given us
ome (lated rules for our our ervice and obedience, we ought
not willingly and knowingly to oend, either by neglecting
what he has commanded, or doing what he has forbtdden :
and this too is owned by every Chriian, that whenever any
people preumptuouy n again God's command, the Al-
mighty withdraw: his bleing from them 3' and therefore eve-
ry good man ought to prevent uch neglect of, or in again
God and his' commands, o long as any perons are under his
care. Hereupon I thanked him for expreing o great a con-
cern For us, and dei'red him to explain the particulars of what
he had oberved ; that according to the' parablie of dcban,_\
might remove that cured thing from us. Why then, Sir, 'aid
he," in the r place, you have our Engliþ'nen, who, having
taken avage women to their'wives, by whom they have had
evetfal children, and yet not legaliy married, as the laws 0
God and man require 5 they, I e'yjzsi'r, are no' les than adul-
*' t __ were,
rerers, and, livingin adultery, are liable to the cure of God.
I know, Sir, you may object the want of a Prie or clergymen
or any kind ; as alo pen, ink and paper, to write down a con-
tract ot marriage, and haveit igned between them. But nei-
ther this not-what the Spanih Governour has told you, of their
chuing by conent, can be reckoned a marriage, nor any more
than an agreement to keep them from quarrellingamong them-
elves: For, Sir, the eence or acrament of matrimony (o he
called it) not only conis in mutual conent, but in the iegal
obllgatlon which compels them to own and acknowledge
one another, to abtain from other Perons, the men to pro-
vide for their wives and children, and the women to the
fanne, or like conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their ide :
whereas thee men, Sir, upon their own pleaure, on any oc-
calion, t'orake then: women to marry others, and by dih-jun-
ing their children, uer them utterly to perih. And now,
bir, added he, can God be honoured in uch an unlawfulliber-
ty as this P How can a bleng ucceed the be endeavours, if
men are allowed to live in open adultery t Indeed I was ruck
with the thing itelf, and they were much to blame that no or-
mal contract had been made, though it had-been breaking a ick
between them, to engage them to live, as man and wife, ney-
er to eparate, but love, cherih, and comtort one another all
their lives. but, Sir, (aid I, when they tooktheie women, I
was not here ; and iit is adultery, 'tis pa my Medy, and I
cannot help it. 'Tis true, Sir,_an£weredwthe young Prie, you
cannot be charged with that-part of the crime which was done
in your abence : But, I beteechyou, don't atter yourel
that you are under no obligation, now, to put a period to it ;
which it' you neglect to do,.the guilt will be entirely on you,
alone ; tince itis certainly in no body's power but your's to
alter their condition. 1 mu confes I was o dull, that I
thougbtuhe meant l hould part them, which, knowing itwould
put the whole i-and in Confuion, I told him I could not con-
ent to upon any account whatoever. Sir, aid he, in a great
hirnrie, l do not mean that you hould eparate, but marry
them : I mean in your way bya wriven contract, igned by both
man andwoman, and by all the witnees preent, which al!
the European laws decree to be of ucient ecacyt Amazed
with uch true piety and incerity, and conidering the validity

very ju and kind, and that I-woutd dicoure with the men
about it : Neither could Ieewhat reaon they could have
not to let him marry them, whoe authority in that aair is
owned to be as authentic as if they were married by any of out'
clergym'en in England.
The next complaint he had to make me was this, That thee

ruction, having learnt them not only to peak, but to read
Englih ; all this while they had never taught them any thing
of the Chriian religion, or the knowledge of God ; much les
in what manner he ought to be erved. And is not this an
tmaccountable neglect? aid he, warmly. Depend upon it,
God Almighty will call them to account for uch contempt.
And though I am not of' your religion, yet I hould be glad to
ee thee people releaed from the devil's power, and be aved
by the principles of the Chrilian religion, the knowledge of
God, of a Redeemer, wthe reurrection, and of a uture tate.
But, as it is not yet too late, if you pleae to give me leave to
inruct them, 1 doubt not but I hall upply this great defect,
by bringing them into the great circle of chirianity, even
while you continuain the iand.
at I could hold no longer, but, embracing him, told him, with
a thouand thanks, I would grant what he requeied ; and de-
ired him to proceed in the third article, which he did in the
following manner :
Sir, aid he, it hould be a maxim among all Chriians,
That chrilian knowledge ought to be propagated by all
poiible means, andlon all occaions', Upon this account, out'
chuuch ends mionaries into Pe'ia, India,and China, men who
are willing to die for the ake o God, and the Chriian faith,
in order to bring poor indels into the way oialvation. Now,
Sir, here is an opportunity to convert even and thirty poor
favages, that I wonder how you can pas by uch an occaion
of doing good, whichis really worth the expence of a man's
whoie life.

Could not teli how to anwer him: Sir, aid he, eeing' me in
diorder, I hall be very orry if I have given you oence : No,
Sir, aid I, I'm rather confounded ; and you know my circum-
tances, that being bound to the Ea ladies, in a merchant hip,
I'cannot wrong the owners o much, as to detain the hip here,
the men lying at victuals and wages on their account. If I
tay above twelve days, I mu pay 31. erling, Per die-m, de-
murragqnor mu the hip iay above eight days more, o that
I am unable to engage in this work, unles I would leave the
hip, and in be reduced to my former condition. The prie,
though he ownedthis was hard upon me, yet laid it to my con-
icience, whether the bleing of saving even and thirty ouls,
was not worth venturing all that I had in the world 2 Sir, aid
I, 'tis very true 3 but, as you are an Ycdleiaiiq it naturally
falls into your profeon : why therefore dcn't you rather
oer to undertake it yourlel, than pres me to it t Upon this
he turned about, makinga very low bow. I mo humbly
thank God and you, Sir, aid he, for _o bleed a can and
'no

mot willingly undertake o glorious an oce, which will uf.
ciently compenate all the diculties and hazards I have
gone through, in a long and uncomortable voyage.
While he was thus peaking, I could dicover a rapture in
his face, by his colour coming and going z at the ame time his
eyes parkled like re; with all the igns othe mo zealous
tranports. >And when I aked whether he was in earne, Sir,
aid he, it was to preach to the Indian: I conented to come
" along with you; thee indels, even in this little iland; are
innitely of more worth than my poor life ; and, o! am, the
happy inrument o aving thee poor creatures' ouls, l care
not il never ee my native country again. Theonly thing!
beg ofyou more is, that you would leave Friday with me, to
be my interpreter, without whoe aiiiance neither of us wizii
undertand each other. a ,_;,z ,
This reque veryenibly troubled me, tir upon Frz'a'qyz's
being bred a Proteant, and econdly for the acction I bore
to him for his fidelity : But immediately the remembrance of
Friday's father eominginto my head,I recommended him to
him,as having learned Spanih, which the Prie alo undertood,
and o was thoroughly atised with him.
When we came to the EngZ-metz, after I had toldthem
what neceary things I had done for them, l talked to them
of the candalous life they led ; 'told them what notice the Cler-
gyman had taken of it, and aked themif they were married
men, or batchelors P They anwered two of them were widow-
ers, and the other three ingle men, But, aid I, with what
concience can you call thee your wives, by whom-you have
o many children, and yet are not lawully married? They
all aid, that they took them before the Governour as uch,
having-nobodyele to marry them, which they thought as le-
gal as if they had had a paron. oNo doubt, aid I, but in the
ight of God you are o : But, unles I am aured of your
hone intent, never to deert thee poor creatures, I can do
nothing more for you, neither can you expect God's bleiing
while you live in uch an open coure of adultery. Hereupon
Will. Azkizzr, who poite for the ret, told-me, that they believed
their wives the mo innocent and virtuous creatures in the
world 3 thatthey would never oral-zev them whilethey had
breath ; and that if there was ._a Clergyman in the hip, they
would be married to them with, all their hearts. I told you
before, aid I, that I have a miniier with me, who hall marry
you to-morrow morning, if you are willing ; o I would have
you conult to-night with the; re about, it. Itoldhimthe
Clergyman was a Frencbman, and knew not aword of Englih,
but that I would act as a clerk between them. And indeed
this buines met with uch peedy uccels, that in a ew mi-
nutes after they all told me, they were ready to be formal-*
ly married as oon as I pleaed, with which informing the
Prie, he was exceedingly rejoiced. _
Nothing now remained, but that the women were to be
made enible ofthe meaning othe thing, with which being
welt-atised, they and their' hutbands attended at my apartw
ment the next morning: There was my prie, habite'd in a
black vet, omething like a caock, with a ah round it, much
reembling a Miniier, and [was his interpreter. But the e-
xiounes of his behaviour, and the crupl'es he made of mar-
lying the women who were not baptized, gave them an ex'-
ceeding reverence for his peron : Nor indeed would he marry
them at all, till he obtained my liberty to diceure both with
the men and wenten; and then he told them, That, in the
tight of all indierent men, and in the ene of the laws of o-
ciety, they had lived in open adultery, which nothing now, but
their content to marry, or nal eparation could put an end to;
and even here was a diculty, with repect to the laws of
Chriiian matrimony, in marrying a profeed Chrilian to an
Heathen idolater, ;unbaptized but yet there was time enough
totmake them profes the name ot Chri, without which noth-
ing could be done; that beides, he believed themelves very
indierent Chritians, and conequently had not dicoured-with
their wives on that ubject ; and that unles they promied
him to do o, he could' not marry them, as being expresly or-
hidden by the laws ol God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned readily 2 But,
Lord, Sir, aid Will. Atkz'ns to me, how hould we teach them
religion, who know nothing of it ourelvesi And hould we
talk to our wives of God, jeu's Chrit, Heaven and Hell, they
would only laugh at us, who never yet have practied religion,
but on the contrary all manner ofwickedne's. Will. Atkz'm, aid
Lean't you tell your wie he's in the wrong ; and that her
Gods are idols, which can neither hear, peak or underand ;
but that our God, who has made, can deroy all things 3 that
he rewards the good, and punihes the wicked z and at la
will bring us t'o judgment t Can't you tell her thee things t
That's true, aid Anlim, but then he'll tell me 'tis utterly fale,
ince I am not punihed and ent to the devil, who have been
inch awiek'ed creature.- Thee words I interpreted to the
Prie : 0 'l aid he, tell him 'his repentance will make him a
very good minii'er to his poue, qnaliiying him to preach on
the mercy and long uering o'f a merciful Being, who deires
not the death of a (inner ; that he even defers damnatioctn to
the lat judgment, 'which will lead to the doctrine of it,
and will make him 'an excellent preacher to his wife.-

mean? I know well enough, aid he, what 1 mean, I mean 'tis
too late. _ _ ' p
When I told the prie what he aid, the poor aectionate man
could not refrain from weeping : But recoverinig himelf, pray',
r, aid he, ak him, i-he is contented that it is to'o late; or is
he concerned, and wihes it were not o P This 'quetion I put
fairly-to ztkirzs, who repled in a paion, how can 1 be eay in a.
tate of damna-tiomwhich I know mu terminate in my ruin a;
For I really believe ome time or other, I hall cut my throat, to
put a period b h to my life and to the-terrors of my concience.
At this the clergyman hook his head : Sir, aid he, pray
tell h-im it is not too late! Chri will give him repentance,
ifhe has recoure to the merit of his Paon. Does he think
he is beyond the power of Divine mercy P There may indeed be
a time when provoked merey wili-mo-longer trive, but never
too late for men to repent in this world. I told Attim' every
word the Prie had aid, who then parted from us, to talk to
his wie; while we dicoured with the re : But thoe were
very tupid in religious matters, yet all of them promied to
do their endeavours to make their wives turn Chriians 5 and,
upon thee promies, the Prie married the three couple; But,
as Alein: was the only mcere convert, and of more ene thait
the re, my Ciergyman was earneily enquiring after hint:
Sir, aid he, let's walk out of this Labyrinth, and I dare ay we
hall nd this poor man preaching to his wie already. And
indeed' we found it true; for, coming to the edge of the wood,
we perceived ztkirzt, and his favage wie, itting underthe hadi:
of a both in very earne dicoure: He pointed to the tun,
to the quarters o the earth, to himelf, to' her, the wood, "add
the trees. Immediately we could perceive him iart upottcticts
feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift up both hishands' at
which the tears ran downv my Ciergymas cheeks; but dt'tr
great misfortune was, 'that we could not hear oine word thit

to forgive me, a mierable inner. Hereupon I went a little
ditance, and, kneeling down, prayed earnely to God to en-
lighten her mind and to pardon her ins : When this was
done, we continued our dicoure thus. '
Wz' e. What you put down knee for ? For what hold up

Here the poor man Fell upon his knees, and made her kneel
down by him, praying in the greate ervency, that God
would inruct her by his holy pirit ; and that-ome time God,
by his Providence, would end them a bible for both their in-
ruction. And uch- was the early piety ol his new convert,
that the made him promie never to forake God any more ;
le, being made dead,as the called it, he hould not only want
her inructor, but himelbe mierable in a long eternitv.
Such. a urpring account as this was, proved very aecting
to us both, bu-t'particularly to the young Clegyman, who was
mightilyv concerned he could not talk to her himelf : Sir, aid
he, there is omething more to be done to this woman than to
marry her : I mean that he ought to be baptized. To this
I preently agreed : Pray, aid he again, ak her hufband,
whether he has ever talked to her of Jeus Chrit, the alvation
of mners, the nature of aith and redemption in and by him,
of the holy pirit, the reurrection ; la judgment, and a t'u-
ture ate; but the poor fellow melted into tears at this que-
tion, aying, that he had aid omething to her of thee things,
but his own concience tetriying him with the molt dreadful
apprehenions, he was afraid le her knowledge of it hould
make her rather contemn religion, than embrace it ; but if i
would dicoure with her, it was probable my labour would
not be in vain. Accordingly I called her in, and placing mysa.
elf as interpreter between the religious priett andthe woman,
I entreated him to go on : But ureiy never was uch a ermom
preached by any clergynran in thee latter days of the world,
which had o much zeal, knowledge and inc'erit-y: In hort
he brought the woman to embrace the knowledge of Chri,
and of redemption by him, with o urpriing a degree of un-
dertlanding, that (he made it her own reque to be baptized.
And now he performed his oce in the acrament of Bap-
tim, r by aving ome words over to himelf in Latin, and
then, at'ing me to give her a name, as being her godfather,
he poured a whole dihul of water upon the woman's head,
aying, MARY, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and'
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghol, o that none could know
what religion he was of; and ater,he pronounced the bene-
diction in Latin. Thus, the woman being made a Chrihan,
he married her to Will. Atkim, which being nihed, he aec-e-
- tionately exhorted him to lead a holy life for the future 5 that,
ince the Almighty, by the convictions of his eoncience, had
honoured him to be the inrument of his wife's converion, he
hould not dihonour the grace of God, let, while the avage
'was 'onverted, the inrument hould be cat away. And time
ended
**.t78

'ended the ceremony, which made it the mo pleaant and a-
greeable day I ever paed in my hie. .
The aairs of the iland being ettled, I was preparing vto go
on board, when the young man, whoe mother was at-ved,
came to me, aying, That, as he underdood I had a ciergyman
with me, who had married the Englihmen with avages, he had
a match to mak between two Chriians, which he deired
might "be nihed before I departed. But thinking it was
himelf that had conrted his mother's maid, I perhaded him
not to do any thing rahly upon the account of his olitary
circumances; that the maid was an unequal match for him,
both in repect to ubance and years; and that it was very
probable he would live to return 'to his own country, where he
\might have a fat' better choice. At thee words, he milingly
interrupted me, thanking me or my good advice z that, as he
had nothing to beg of me, but a mall ettiementh with a er-
vant or two, or ome few necearies 3 to he hoped I would not
rbeunmindful of him when I returned to England, but give
his-letters to his friends; and that when he was redeemed, the
plantation, and all its improvements, however valuable, hould
be returned to me again :- But, as for the marriage he propo-
ed, why truly it was between my Jack ofall Trades, and the
.maidSzen. . - i .
Indeed! was agreeably urprized at the mentioning this
;match,_which eemed very uitable z- the one being avery in-
genious fellow, and the other an excellent, dexterous, and en-
ible houewie, t to botgovernes ofthe whoie illand : So we
married them the ame day ;_ and as I was her father, and gave
her away, o I gave her a handome portion, and appointed
her and her hubond alarge convenient pace of ground for
"theiripiantatiom , The haring out of the land to themhl left
to Will. Atkins, who reallyvery july divided it to every per-
on's atisfaction : They only delired one general writing, un-
der my hand, for the whole, which I cauted to he drawn up,
igned, and eaied to them, etting out their bounds, andgiv-
ving them a right to the . whole poeiiono their repective
plantations, with their improvements,-to the-m andtheir heirs,
reerving all the ret of the iand as my own property, and a
certain rent for every particular plantation, after n years. As
to their laws and government, I exhorted them to love one
another : And' as to thelndiam, who lived on a neck by them-
elves, I all'otted three or four ofthem plantations, and the re
willingly choe to become et-vants to all the other amilies, by
which means they were employed in ueful labour, and fared
much better than they did before. Thusthe tavages, being
mixed with the' Chriians, the work of the converion of the
Indian; might he et on foot by the latter, inv the clergyrnanjs
vameate, to our equal atisfaction. But how', aid the ycaung

_ 1 1'79
Prie, hall lknow that the Chriians will do their parts m
inruct them; l told him we would call them all together,
that we hould peak-to the Sþanz'ara'r, who were Papisand I
to the Englih, who were Proteants, and make them promie
that they would never make any dilinction in religion, but
teach the general true knowledge of God, and his Son Jeus
Chrit, in order to convert the poor avages': And tlus'indeed
they all promied us accordingly. - >
When I came to Will. Antz'ns's houe,_I found'his baptized
wite, and the young woman newly married to my Jack of all
Trades, were become great intimates, and diicouirng of re-
iigion together: O Sir, laid Will. Atkz'm, when God has in-
nen: to reconcile to himelt','he never wants an inructor: l
knew I was unworthy of o good a work, and therefore this
young woman has been ent hither, as it were from heaven,
who is ucient to convert a whole iiland- of avages. The
young woman bluhed, and was going to rie, but I deired her
to it ill, and hoped that God' would blei's her in o good a
work: And then, pulling out a Bible, which I brought on
purpoe in my pocket for him ; here tkim, aid I, here is an
arant that perhaps you had not before. So confounded was
the poor man, that it was ome time before he could peak ; at
la, turning to his wife, my dear, aid he, did In not tell you.
that God could hear what we laid t Here-is the book I prayed
for when you and] kneeled under the buh : God then heard
us, and now has lent it. The woman was urpried, and
thought God had reallyent that individual book from heav-
en 5 but I turned to the young woman, and deired her to ex-
plain to the new convert, that'God may properly beaid to an-
wer our petitions, when, in the coure ot' his Providence, uch
particular things as we petitioned for, do come to pas. This
the young woman did eectually; but urely Will. Atkis's
joy cannot be e'xpreed; 'no man in the world being more
thanktul for any thing, than he was for this bible, nor deire
it from a better principle. '
After everal religious dicoures, I deired the young wo-
man to give me an account of the anguih the felt when-he
was arving to death for hunger; to which (he readily-coh-
ented,*and began in the following manner: "
v " Sir, aid he, all our victuals being gone, after I had fa-
ed one day, my omach was very ickih, and, at the 'approach
of night, I was inclined to yawnin and leeping. "When I
ept upon the couch three hours : hree hours after, my' o-
mach being more and more ickih, I laid down again, but
could not leep, being very faint and ill. Thus 1 paed the
econd day in a range variety, r hungry, then ick again,
with reachings to vomit. T hat night I dreamt that] was at
Barbadm, buying plenty of provions, and dining heZrnly.

of wine, which being mixed with ngar, I drank up, but, for
want ot ubance to dige upon, the fumes of it got into my

The morning after, I fell into a violent paon of crying, and
atter that into hunger. I epied the blood that came from my

I had the uual variations, as pain in the omach, ick, eepy,
and ravenons; and 'l had no thoughts but that I hould die be-

Surely this is uch a diinct account of iarving to death,

notice to them of the ioop that I had framed, neither would I
leave them the two pieces of bras cannon, or the two quarter

But, without thee things, leaving them in a ourihing con-
dition, with a promie to end them further relief from Bmil;
as heep, hogs, and COWS (being obliged to kill the latter at ea,

we feared nothing but their etting the hip on re; to prevent
which, I ordered them to get their boats out, and faen them,

of thee canoes containing above ixteen or eventeen men.
As they approached near us, they eemed to be in the great-
eft amazement, and not knowing what to make of us, they
trowed round the hip, which occaioned us to call to the men
in the boats, not to uer them to come near them; Hereup.
on they beckoned to the avages to keep back, which they ace.
cording-ly did; but, at their retrear, they let y about 50 ar-
rows amongu us, and very much wounde one of out' tmn in
the long boat. I called to them not to re npon'any account,
but handing them down ome deal boards, the carpentere made
them a kind of ence to hield them from the arrows. In half
an hour after, they came o near a ern of its, that wehadxa

(hundred arrows, no les than even piercing through his body,
killing one of the be of ervants, and aithfulle of compa-

So enraged was I at the death of poor Fridczy, that I ordered
the gons, which were charged before only with powder to"
frighten them, to he loaded with mall hot ; nor did the gun,

out of their wits, little regarding their fellows a drowning,
ecured away as fa as they could; but our men took up one
poor wretch, wimming for his life, an hour after. He was o
fallen at r, that he would neither eat nor peak ; but 1 took
a way to cure him, by ordering them to throw him into the
ea, which they did, and then he came wimming to them like
a Fork ; calling, in his tongue, l upppoe, to ave him. So
we' took him on board, but it was a long time before we could
make him peak or underand Englih; yet, when we taught

And now being under fail, I cannot but take my la farewel
of poor hone Friday! And indeed we interred him with all
poible decency and olemnity, by putting him into a con,
and committing him to the deep, at the ame time cauing e-
leven guns to be ted for him: And thus ended the life of
one of the mo grateful, faithful, hone, and aectionate er-

When we failed from the Brals, we made directly 5 ' r the *

ly being limited to a certain number of days for iay, by chart-
er party, at the everal parts he was to go to 5 but all thl be-

none of my buines. At the Cape we only took in freh wa-

that a French man of war of fty guns, and two large merchant
thips were failed for the India, but we heard no more of
themu
The firt place we touched at was the iand of BIadaga/Zar;
where, though the inhabitants are naturally erce and treach-
etous, ormidably armed with bows and lanees ; yet, for
Lame time they treated us civilly enough ; and, in exchange of
knives, ci'ars, and other nies, they brought us eleven good
iat_bullocks,,which we took partly for preent freh victuals,
apdthe remainder to alt for the hip's ue.
i-Sof curious was I to vjew every corner of the world where I
came to; that I went on there as often as I could; when one
evening, numbers of the people ood gazing at us at a dim-
tence, yet we thought ourelves in no danger, becaue they
hadued us kindly. However, we cut three boughs out of a

that country, is not only a token of truce and amity, but, when
poles or boughs are et up on the other ide, it is a ign the

their pokes, take up their weapons, and then the truce is at an
end. One evening it happened, when we went on there, a
greater number of people than uual, both men and' women,
honey traded among us for uch toys as we had, with uch
gneat civility, that we made us a little tent of large boughs of
trees, ome ol" the men reolving to lie an hore all night. But,
for my part, I and ome others took our lodging in the boat,
with boughs of tree-e pread over it, having a tail pread at the
bottom lo lie upon ; when, about two o'cluelc. in the morning,
eve heard the ring of ve mm'kets, as alo out' then crying out
to: help, or ele they hould all he murdered : Nor carce had
we. time to get the boat ahore, but that out' men came and
tzlugd themelves ime the water, having above four hundred
imen at their heels : 1We took up even of 'the men, three of
'them y much wounded, and one left behind killed, while
'wthe ene 'y poured their arrows o thick among us, the: we were
forced be xnake a barricade, with hearde lying at the ide of the
beat, to hield us from danger: And having got ready our
fire arms, we returned them a valley, which no doubt wounda
ed everal of them, as we could hear by their cries. In this
condition we lay till break of day, and then, making cgknazs of
t li re s

diiirefs to the hip, which my nephew, the captain, heard and
underood, he weighed anchor, and ood as near the (hote as
pnbie, and then tentv another boat with ten hands in her to
ai us;r but we called to them not to come near, informing
them of our unhappy condition: However they vent-tired,
when one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in his hand,
and keeping our boat between him and our adveraries, (warn
on board us, and made fa the line to our boat; upon this
ihpping our cables, they towed us'but of the reach of their ar-
rows, and quickly after a broadtide was given them from the
hip, which made a mot dreadful havoc among them. But
when we had got on board, and examined into the occaion of '
this tay, the men who ed informed us, that an old woman,
who fold milk within the poles, had brought a young woman
with her, who carried roots or herbs 3, the ight owhom o
much tempted our men, that they oered rudenes to the maid,
at which the oid woman et up a great cry; nor would the
tiaiiors part from their prize, but carried her among the trees,
while the old woman went and brought- a whole army down
upon them. At the beginning of the attack one of our men
was kiiled with a lance, and the fellow who began the nail-
thief, paid dear enough for his miires, though as yet we did
not know what became of him, but the ret got free. The
third night after the action, being curious to underand how
aairs ood; 1_ took the upercargo, and twenty tiout fellows
with me, and landed about two hours before midnight, at the
tame place where thoe [valiant tood the night before; and
there we divided our men into two bodies, the boatwain com-
tnanding one, and I the other. It was oatk, that we could
ice nobody; neither did we hear any voice near us ; heit by

o'away they went, notwithanding all my admonitions, either
concerning their own aety, or the Preervation of the hip.
Indeed they were gallamty armed, every man having a znuti
ket, bayonet, and a piltol, beides gotiaes, izangens, poleaxes,
and hand granades. They came to a few Indian hotiles at
r; but, not being the town they expefled, they went farth-
er, and nding a cow tied to a tree, they con-eluded that wcuid
be a ltzcient guide to them, and o it proved; for after they
untied her, the led them directly to the ton n, which conited
of above two hundred houes, fere-tal fanjlles living in ome
ofthe hms together. Here, being all in a proound leep, the
ailors conulted to divide themelves into three budl, and
eexthree parts of the town on fire at once ;_ to kill thoe that
were ecaping, and plunder the re of the houtes. Thus de-
perately reolved, they went to work; but the rparty had
not gone far, before they called out to the re, that they had
found Ybm i'ery; whereupon they all ran up to the place,
and found the poor fellow indeed, hanging up naked by one
arm, and his throat almo cut from ear to ear: In a houe
that was hard by the tree, they found 16 or 17 Indian: who
had been concerned in the ray, two or three of them being
wounded, who were not gone to leep; this houe they let on
re r, and quickly, ve or x places more in the town ap-
peared in ames, which they occaioned by wild re, as the
tte to burn their thatches, coniing of flags or nihes : and
no ooner did the arighted creatures run out to ave their
lives, but they were either driven back into the flames by the
ailors, or killed without mercy. After the boatlwain had
ain two with his pole-axe, he threw a hand-granade into' the
houe, which, oon buring, made a terrible havock, killing
and wounding mofl of them ; and neither their king, nor any
of his train, who were in that houe, ecaped their tory, but
they were every creature mothered and burnt together. All
this while they never red a gun, le the people hould waken
aler than they could o'er-power them. But they 'waked fat
enough; which obliged our fellows to keep together in badiest
And by this time'the whole town was in a ame, yet their fury

eeing him relolved to go, l had not power to (lay behind him :
He ordered the pinnace back again for twelve men more ; and
then we marched directly as the ame guided us. But ureiy
never was uch a cene of horrour beheld, nor more dimal
cries heard before, except at the time of that vile traitor and

he neither lpared man, woman or child.

we took means to let them know we would not hurt them ;
while the poor creatures, with bended knees and lift up hands,v
made piteous lamentations to us to ave their lives. I ordered
our men not to hurt any of the poor creatures whatoever z
but, being willing to undertand the occaion of all this, I
went among thee unhappy wretches, who neither undertood)
me, nor I believe the meaning themelves. Herenpon, beingc
relolved to go into the middle of the town through the re,
in order to put an end to this barbarity, I ordered the men to
follow me 3 but I had carce poke the word, before the boat-
wain came up, with our of our men at his heels, covered
with blood and dut, eeking more people to maacre ; upon
which, callingont to them, we made them underand who we

ran the boatwain and eight'more to nih the tragedy 5 which
being out of my power to prevent, I penively returned back,

fortunate creatures, who were made victims to their furyo
Nor was it a les piece ot folly in me to return to the boat with
a few others, having narrowly etcaped forty armed Indiam,
who had been alarmed by the conagration ; but, having mi-
fed the place where they ood, I got to the boat, accompanied
with the upercargo, and o went on board, ending the pin-
nate back again, to ai the men in what might happen. When
l had got to the boat, the re was almo extinguihed, and the
noie abated; but I had carce been half an hour on board the
hip, when I heard another volley given by our ailors, and
agreet moke, which, as [afterwards found, was our men-
fallirnr upon thee houes and Perons that ood between them
and' the" fea ; but here they ipared the wives and children, and
killedabout ixteen or eventeen men. And o they came
rolling down to the innace, which, at that time was gotten
on hore to receive t iem. Nota man of them had received?
the lea hurt, except two, one of whom rained his foot, and
the other burnt his hand a little, having met with no reit-
ance, the poor Indian: being unprepared, amazed and con-
founded. ,
Indeed I was extremely angry with every one 'of them, but
particularly the Captain ; who, inead of cooling the rage of
the men, had prompted them on to farther michief : 'Nor
could he make any other excue, but that, as he was a man, he
could not maer his paone, at the ight of one of his men o
cruelly murdered. As for the re, knowing they were net
under my command, they took no notice of my anger, but'
rather boaed of their revenge 3 and', according to ali'their ac-z
counts, they killed orcieroyed' about 15o, men women and
children, beides burning the town to athes. They tookttheir
accomption Tbm yeery from the tree, covered him with ome
of the ruins, and o lelt him. But, however juiiable this
t-ton of out men might eem to 'themtelvee, yet I always open-

faith of the public capituiation, which was o treacherouiy

broken.
We were now under fail, when the hoatwain would defend
this bloody action, by aying, That the Indian: had broke the
truce, the night before, by hooting one of our men without
juprovocation PAnd what ifthe poor fellow had taken a
little liberty with the wench, he ought not to have been mur-

account, and being but a paenger yonrel, we are not obkig-
ed to bear it; not' can we tell what iii deigns you may have
to bring us to judgment for it in England; and therefore if
you don't leave this difcoure, and not concern yonrel'f with
any of'onr aairs, I wiii leave the hip, and not fail in uch
dangerous company. '
At] this I heard very patiently, tili at length I toid him
what concern I had on board was none-'of his buines ; that,
however, I was a coniderable owner of the hip, and therefore
had: right to peak in common, and that I was no way' ac-
countahie to him, nor to any body ele. Weii, this pat on, and
I thought ali had been over. At this time we were in the rood-
OF Bmgal ; where, going on than: withthe upercatgo one day
towardt-evening, as I was preparing to go on board, one of the
men came to me, and toid me, I-need- not trouble myeii to
Come to the boat, for that the cockwain and othershad order-
ed him not to carry me on board any more. This inoient
meage much urpried me, yet I gave him no anwer to t it,
but went directiy, and acquainted the upercargo, entreating
him to go on board, and, by acquaintingthe captain with tt,
to prevent themutiny which I perceived would happen. But,
before I hadupoke this, the matter was eected on board 2 For, *
no,
J

no ooner was [gone o in the boat, but the boatfwain, gone
ner, carpenter, 'and all the ineriororers, came to the quar-
ter derk, deiring to peak with the captain 3 and there it was
the boatwain made along harangue, exelaiming againt me
as before mentioned 5 that if I had not gone peaceably for my
own diverion, they would have compelled . me by violence
or their atisfaction z that, as they had h'ipped with the
captain, o they would faithfully erve him 5 but, if] did not
quit the hip, or the captain oblige me to it, they would leave
the hip immediately : Heteupcton, turning his' face 'about b
way of ignal, they all cried out, One and All, one and All.
v You may be ure, that though my nephew was a man of
great courage,- yet he could not but he lurpried arthcir udden
and unexpected behaviour : And, though he talkediotttly to
them, and atterwards expoulated with them that, in com-
mon jutice to me, who was a coniderable owner in the hip,
they could not turn me out, as it were out of my own houe,
which might bring their lives in danger hould they ever be
taken in Engiand: Nay, though he invited the boatwain on
there to accommodxte matters with me, yet all this, I ayyig-
nied nothing : They would have nothing to do (with me :
And they were refolvedto go on there if I came on board.
YVcll, aid my nephew, if you are o reolved, permit me to
talk with him, and then I have done : And o he came to me,
giving me an account of theirzreloiution, how one and all de-
tigned to orake the hipif l came on board, for which he was
mightily concerned. I amvery glad to ee you, nephew, aid
I, and rejoice it is no wore, nceiithey have not rebelled again
you : I only deire you to lend my neceary things on there,
with a ucient him of money, and I will nd my way to Eng-
land aswell 'as I can. Though this grieved my nephew to the
heart, yet there was no remedy but compliance, and, in hort,
going on board. all my neceiaries'were ent me, and o this
matter was over in a few hours.
- I think Iwas now near a thouand leagues farther o Eng-
[and by en, than at my little kingdom, except this dierence,
that I might travel by land over the Great Mogul's country to
sum', from thence up to Baon: by ea up the Pera'z gvlph,
then take the way ofthe caravans o'er the Arabian defer' to
ctlepþa and Srandaraon, there take hipping to my, and, o trav-

-M'y nephew let me two rerons to attend me, onei of them

gaged tn he mine. i tents. lodging-s in an Englh womanis-
houe, where ieverai Trmr'b, one it'rzgliz, and two Italian mer-

here, occaioned me to ay hule mouths, conidering what
coure
coure i hould take. Iliad ome Englih goods, with me, of
great value, beides aitooo pieces of eight, and a letter of credit
for more, it there were occaion. The goods I oon dipoed
of to advantage, and bought here everal good diamonds,
which I couid eaily carry about me. One morning the Eng-
lj/l) merchant came to me, and, being very intimate together,
countryman, aid he, l have a project to communicate to you,
which I hope will lutt to both our advamage. To be hort,
Sir, we are both in a remote part of the world from our coun-
try ; but yet in a place where men of buines may get a great
deal of money. Now if you wiii put a thouand ponnds to
my thouand pounds we will hire a 'hip to our arisfaction ;
you (hall be captain, l'll be merchant, and we'll go a tradiog
voyage to China ; for why hould we lie till like drones, when
all the world is in continual motion P
This propoal oon got 'my conent, being very agreeable to
my ramhling genius ; and the more o, becaue I looked upon
my countryman to be a very tincere peron : It required ome
time before me could get a veel to our minds, and lailors to
man it accordingly : At length, we got an Englih mate, boat-
wain and gunner, a Dutch carpenter, and three Per/aged?
forema men, and, for want of others, made hift with Indian
eamen. From hence we r failed to Aabin, in the iand of
surnarra, and then to Siam, where we bartered our wares for
ome arraek and opium, the la of which bore a great price
among the Cbine .' in a word, we went up to Sutam,
making a verv great voyage; and after eight mouths time,
1 returned to Bengal, very well atised with this adventure,
having not only gotten a ucient lum of money, buten inight
of getting a great deal more.
The next voyage my friend propoed to me, was to go a-
mong the pice ilands, and bring home a lead of Cloves from
the Manz'llar, or thereabouts ; iands belonging partly to
Spain, but yet places where the Dutch trade very much. XVe
were not long;r preparing for this voyage, which we made no
les uccesful than the lat, touching at Bow-Yea, and everal oth-
er places which I do not perfectly remember, returning home
in about. ve months time. We oon told our pices, which
were chiey Cloves, and ome nutmegs, to a Perian merchant,
who carried them away for the gul; and in hort, making,
ve to one advantage, we were loaded with money.
Not long after my friend and I had made. up our accounts,
to our entire atisfaction, there came in a Dutch coafler, trom
Ram-vita, of above two hundred ton. All the men pretended
themelves o ill, that there were not hands ucient to under-
take a voyage, and the captain being, orooth, willing to go to
Europe, public notice was given that the hip was to be iold..
No tooner did this come to our ears, but we bought thedhip,
par

paid the manent-and took poeon. We would alo very wilt
lingly have enter-tained ome of' the men; but they, having reu
ceived their hare of the booty, were not to be ound ; being
ed all together, to gm, the city of the great Mogul's reli-
dence; and from thence were to tra-vel to Sarra', and o by
Sea to the Per/Far: gulph. And indeed they had reaon to y
in this manner z for the truth of it was, the pretended captain,
was the gunner only, and not the commander; that, having
been a trading voyage, they were attacked on there by the
M'actqyam, who killed three men and the captain ; after whoe
death, the other eleven men, running away with the hip to
the bay of Berzgal, let the mate and ve men more on hore,
or whom you will hear in the equel.
Let them come by the hip how they will, we thought we
bought 'tt honettly; neither did we upect any thing of the
matter, when the man hewed us a bill of ale for the hip (un-
doubtedly torged) to one Emanuel Maer/benign, which name
he went by. And o, without any more to do, we picked up
ome Dutch and Englzh eamen, reolving for another voyage
for Cloves among the Pbz'lippz'nc and I'Iourm iands; and, in
hort, we continued thus ve or ix years, trading from port
to port with extraordinary ucces ; and was now, in the ev-
enthvand lat year, going in the hip with my partner to China,
deigning to touch at Siam, and buy ome rice by the way.
But in this voyage, contrary winds beat us up and down for a
coniderable time among the ilands in the raights of Molurca 5
and no ooner were we clear of thee rugged teas, but we per-
ceived our hip had prung a leak, which obliged us to put into
the river Cum-Sattin, which lies northwardof the gulph, and
goes up to Sin/'i '
One day as I was on hare rerehing myel, there comes an
Evglf/lvman to me, who was a gunner's mate on board an
Englza Be-India hip, riding up the -r'iver, near the city of
Cambqdz'a. Sir, aid he, you may wonder at my buines, have
ing never een me in your life; but though l am a ranger, 1
have omething to tell you that very nearly concerns you; and
"indeed, it is the imminent danger you are in has moved me to
give you this timely notice. Danger! aid I, what danger t l
know of none, except my; hip being leaky, for which I deign
to have her run agmund to-morrow morning. Sir, aid he, I
hope you'll be better employed, when you hall hear What I
have to ay to you. You know the town of Cambadfa is about
15 leages up this river; and about three leagues on this ide,
there tie two Dutch, and three Englz'h hipsz and would you
venture here, without conidering what trength- you had to
engage them? I knew not what he meant by this d-iconre 5
an , turning hort upon him, Sir, aid l, I know no reaon I
have to be Maid eitherof any Englih or Betid) fhips ; I am no
* interlopeo,
interloper, and what buines have they then with me P Well,
Sir, aid the man, if you do think yourelf ecure, all I can ay
is, you mu take your chance: However, I am very orry
you are o deaf to good advice; but I aure you, if you don't
put to eat immediately, you will be attacked by ve long-boats
full of men, hanged yourell for a pirate, if you are taken, and
the particulars examined afterwards. I thought, Sir, added
he, I might have met with a better reception for ueh a ingu-
lar piece of ervice. Sir, aid i, I never was ungratetnl to any
man; but pray explain yourel and I'll go on board this mi-
nute, whether the leak be opped or no. Why, Sir, aid he,
to be hort, becaue time is precious, the matter is this : You
know well enough that you were with the hip at Sumatm,
where zour captain was murdered by the Male/ram, with
three of his lailors, and that either you, or ome who wereyon
board you, ran away with the hip, and are-inceturned pirates
at ea. Now, Sit, this is the tum of what I had to ay; and I
can poitively aure you, that if you be taken, you will be
executed without much ceremony ; for, undoubtedly, you
cannot but be enible 'what little law merchant thipvs hew to
pirates, whenever they fall' into their unmerctul hands. Sir,
aid l, I thank you for your kind information, and though I
am ure no man could come more honey by the hip than I
have done ; yet, atised with your hone intention, and
knowing their deigns, I'll be upon my defence. Prithee, Sir,
laid the man, don't talk of being upon your defence; the be
that you can make, is to be out of danger ; and therefore, if
you have any regard for your life, and the lives of your men,
take the advantage, without fail, of putting out to ea at high
water; by which means, as you have a whole tide before you,
you will be gone too far out 'of their reach before they can
come down; and o,.by the tide (not reckoning the length)
you will get two hours of them ; and as they iare only boats,
conequently they will not venture (epecially if the wind
blows) to follow you far out todl'eia. '
I am mighty well atised, aid I, in this partlcular, and of
your kindnes, which merits my greate efteegn: Pray, Sir,
what amends 'hall l make you P He replied, I know not what
amende" you are willing to make, becaue you may have hme
doubts þits certainty; but, to convince you of the truth of
what I ay, I'have one oer to make unto yo_u. On board
one of the Englih hips, il have nineteen mouths pay due to
me; and this Diztcbman that is with me, has even mouths pay
due to him, which, it' you will make good to us, we will go a-
long with you. And hould you nd nothing more in it, vi-hy
then we will deire no more 3 but when you ate convinced that
we have aved the hip, your life, and the lives of the men, we
will leave the ret to your generotty. *
R So
So reaonable did this every way appear, ans/to obtain my
immediate conenr, and o we went on board immediately. As
oon as we came on board, my partner calls joyfully out,
that they had iopped the leakl WeIL'IhanlCGOd, aid I, but
pray let us weigh anchor immediately. Weight aid he, what
is the meaning of this' hurry l Pray, aid l, atk 'do queions,
but all hands to Work without loing a moment? time :* Upon
which, the captain was called in great halle, who ordered the
anchor to be got up immediately z and, though the tide was
not quite down, yet being aed with 'a little land hreeze, we
ood out to 'ea : And then it was, that calling my partner in-
to the cabin, l related the ory at lar re, which was conrmed,
and more amplied by the two men l had brought on board.
But carce had we finited our dicoure upon this head, but a
ailor came to the cabin door, with a meage from the captain,
that we were chaed by ve oops full 'of armed men; Very
well, aid lie it is plain itow there is omething in it. And o,
going upon deck, I told the men there wash deign or eizing
the hip, and conequently executing us for pirates ; and all-zed
them, whether they would faithfully and by us, and one a-
mother ? To which they unanimony replied, that they would
ght for its to the la drop o theirwblood. And when l aked
the captain which way he thought be for us to manage the
battle ; Sir, laid he, the only method is to keep them o with
out' great hot as long we are able, and then have recoure to
our mall arms; and when both thee fail us, then to retire to
cloe quarter-5, when? perhaps the enemy, wanting materials,
can neither break open our built-heads, or get in upon us. in
the mean time, the gulnner was'ordered to bring two gtms to
bear ore and aft out of the teerage, and to load them with
muket bullets and mall pieces of old iron; and thus, the
deck being cleared, we were prepared for the engagement, liii
keeping out I) ee. But yet the þoats followed us. with all the
ail they cduld make; and we could perceive the two toremot
were Englih, which outailed the 're by two leagues, and
which we found would come up with us : ereupon we ired
a gun withoutþall; intimating that they hould bring'too, and

_ But all this ignied nothing to them, who, depending upon

if, upon alarm given, we hould he taken by the Dutch of Ba-

as to trade, we might dipoe of the hip ome way or other,
and return in one of the country Veels. This being general-

me more deirous of ecaping from its infamous hame, than
from death itelf. It was very eay to read a lad dejection in

by blaphemous and perjured evidences, wickedly reolved to

ighs, and prayers, and tears. My partner eeing me o cool'-
rerned, encouraged me as well as he could ; and after decrib-
ing to me the everal parts of that coa, told me he would
either put in on 'he coai of Carbz'ncbz'na, or ele in the bay of
'Haut-in, and from thence go to lhlacao, a town once poeedv
by the- Porruguee, and where there ill reided many European
tctz'tmilies. ' ' ,
. XYell, to this place we teered our coure, and early the next
morning we came in ight of the coa. But,_contdering on
pat circumances, we reolved to put into a mall river,
whereby we could know, either over the land, or by the hip's
pinnace, what Veels were in any' ports thereabouts ? And in-
deed this happy ep was out' ce: tain deliverance; the next
morning there came to the bay of Ybnquin two Dutcb hitz, zed
' i at it'
a third without any colours pread; and, in the evening, two
Enghh hips eered the ame courl'en"r The river where'we
were, was but mall, within a few, leagues of its limits north-
ward : The country was wild-and barbarous, and the people
all thieves, having no correpondence with any other nation, -
dealing only in h, oil, and'tuch gros commodities. One bar-

hipwrecked upon their coa, they make the men their prton-

ourelves urrounded by enemies both bytea and land.
As the hip had been leaky before, we took the opportunity
to cleane her in this place, and to op up the places which
let in the water. And when we had lightened her, and
brought our guns, and other moveable things, to one ide, we
eiayed to bring her down, that we might come at her bottom :

perceiving her men who were at work on her bottom, with
tages andwith boats on the o ide, they preently imagined
the hip had been ca away, and o lay on the ground. Agree-
able to this uppoition, they urrounded us with ten or twelve
large boars, with a reolution, undoubtedly, to plunder the:
hip, and to carry away thoe they found alive, for laves to
their king. But when they perceived our men hard at worlg
upon the hip's bottom and ide, wahing, graving, and op-
ping it, it lled them with uch urprize, that they flood gaz- .
ing as though they were confounded. Neither could we im-
agme what their deign was; however, for fear of danger, we
handed down armsand ammunition to thoe at work, in order
to defend themelves; and int-ed this preeaution was abolute--
ly neceary; for, in a quarter ot an hour alter, the native's'

know what belongs to ju-ice, nor how to behave themelves as
the laws of God and nature direct : Fellows that would prove
murderers to pnnih robbers ; and tak-e upon them to adjudgc .
mnocent meh to death, without any plain proof to conrm their -
guilt 3' but perhaps 1 may live to call them to account in a
place where they may learn how jutice hould be iexecuted.
And o I told him the ory of buying the hip : and how we
were aved by the means oftwo men : That the murder of the *
captain by the þalayarzs, as alo the running away with the
hip, I beliei'eito be true ; but that we who bought it were
turned pirates, was a mere ction, to cover their cowardice
and foolih behaviour when 'they attacked us; and the blood of
thoe men we killed in our own ju detence lay at their door
who ent them to attack us by urprize.
Sir, aid the old man amazed, you have taken 'be right coure
toeeri to tr'ze north ; and, I might ad-wie you, I would barue
jouellyourhip in China, and buy another-in zbat country 5 and I'll
procure people to big: one and el] the other. Well, but signior,
aid I; it I ell the hip in this manner, l may bring ome inno-
cent per-ons into the ame danger asl have gone through, per-t
haps wore, even death itelf, whereby I hould be as guilty
of their murder as their viilanous perecutors. That need'
not 'really/eyen, aid the old man, I 'II nd a rway to pry-vent that .'
For rbq/Z- rommanderryou tab't rf, I know may well, and [will irz-_

ended they will not only believe me, but act more cannot-y for me

'a't is not 'int own invention. HCtCUPOl] I wrote a large account cf_
their attacking me in their long boars, the pretended realozr
and nnjn deign ofit ; thatthey had done what they ought to
be ahamed of', and could not anwer, at any tribunal in Eng-
land' But this letter was written in vain, Providence ordering
things another way. We failed directly for Nanguin, and in
about 13 days lail came to an anchor at the ouih we point
of the great gulot that place, where we learned, that two
Dutrb lhips were gone the length before us', and that we hould
certainly fall into their hands. We were at a great los in'
this exigency, and would very gladly have been on hore al-
mo any where : But our old pilot told me, that if I would
ail to the onthward about 42 leagues, there was a little port
called Qgz'ncbang; where no European (hips ever came, and
where "we ighticonidcr what was further to be- done. Ac-
cordingly aye weighed anchor the next day, calling only twice,

with unpeakable joy. We reolved to dipoe of out-elves
and eects any way poible, rather than go on board that ill
ated Veel again. For no ate can be more mierable than a
continual ear, which. isa life of death, and a contounder of
our underandings, that ets the imagination at work to form ct
a thouand rightful things that may never happen. And in-
deed both my partner and I carce flept a night without dream-
ingot' halters, yard-arms, &e. of ghting and being taken,
killingandbemglkilled, nay, o violent were our apprehem,
ions, that we would bruie our hands and heads again the
cabin, as' though actually engaged. The ory of the Dutch
cruelty at Ambayza often came into our waking thoughts ; and,
for my par' l nled to think my condition very bad, that after
o many diculties, and ignal deliveranees, I hould be hang- '
ed in my old age, and innocent too; but then religion would
eem to reprehend me, as though the voice of it had aid,
Conider, O man l the ins you have been formerly guilty,
which now thou art called to account for, to expiate with thy
blood li And as to thy innocence, what art thou more than thy
bleed Redeemer, who uered for thy oences, and to whoe
Providence you ought to' ubmit, let what will'happen l After
this my natural courage would inpire me to rei tothe la, and
rather to die 'than be taken by boorih racally 'Dutcbmenwho
had arts to torment beyond the cruelty of death. ' *
But now, thanks to kind Heaven, being ahore, ourold pilot e
procured a lodging and a ware-houe : It was a little hntgwith *
a large warehone adjoining, all built with canes, and pallia- '
doed round with large ones, to keep out the þilferiing thieves,
which are very numerous in that country : 'But the magilrates '
allowed us a little guard, beides we employed a entry with a
kind of halbert, for three pence a day. The fair or mark had;
been over ome time; however there remained in the rivet'
fonrjnnks and two Yapazz hips,-the merchants of the latter
being ahore. In the' r place, our old pilot brought us ac-
quanted with three Romih mitonaries, who were Converting
the Cbz'rze: to Chriianity ; two of them were reerved, rigid;
and anere, applying themelves to the work they came about
with great earnenes; but the third, a Frencbmaa, called
Father Simon, was of a freer converation, yet not a wore'
Chriian than the other two, one of whom was a Pormgmjh, *
and the other a Came/e .' But Father Simon, it eems, was ap. I

ma to accompany him. We carce met, but he was prompting
me to go with him : Sir, aid he, I will hew-you the glorious
things of this mighty empire, and a city, the city of Patin, far
eiceeeding London or Paris, put them both together. One
day particularly, being at dinner with him, I hewed ome m.

partner alo, to gain our eon'ent : But fathergaid my partoer,
what atisfaelion can you have in out' company, When you
eeem us heretics, coolequently objects not worth your re-
gard? Qlt, aid he, you may be as good Catholics in time,
as_ thoe I hope to convert. And o, aid he, we hall have you
preaching to us all the way, intead of pleqing us with decrip-
tzotx of the potwlry. ' Sir, aid he, however our religion may
be viled, 'tis very certain it neither divels us of good mao- .
ner; or Chrlan charity ; and as we are gentlemen, as inch ,
we may eonvere, without nmkloz one anothee uneal'y. ,
Botjto leave him awlt'rle, let us conider our hip: andy
merchandize, that we had to dipoe of. There was but lit--
tle buinels in the iplace where we were; and once I was re-
olved to fail to the river Kz'ldbz, and o to the city of [Venom-Je; _
but Providence ordered ltothe'rwie, by our old pilot's bring- __
ing-a Jew merchant to us, to ee what goods izve had. Hei
immediately booght'our opium, for which he gave us at very t
good "rlee in gold by weight, ome Wedges 'of which weighed .
above xoor xt ounces. It cameinto my head; that be might 5
buy the hip too; and I ordered his'interpreter to propoes it

though, by the nay, they were a couple o' rogues, who thought

Upon thee hopes,we reolved to continue, and to divert
onrl'elves, took leveral, little journies into the country. Ten
days we travelledjo ee the city of Nanguin, about lat. 3o. N.

At our return, we loued the Prie was come from Blame that

Nor did we tail meeting with great advantage, as to nding
the way, havingthe'liberty to travel among the retinue of a

We were 25 days travelling through thismierahle country,

found him itting under a tree before his door, eating a mcs

conceitof our admiring his magnicence, 'which rather raied

At la we arrived at the great city of Pel-in, accompanied
by two ervants, and the old Partugzzee pilot', whoe charges we
bore, and who was our interpreter. We had carce been a
week at Pelez'n, but he comes laughing to us, Ah, Signior I/z-

altered his relolution, was reolved to go with the caravan to

This, hapzpy event, as I thoughtgityþf coming into aChri-
tiao country, made me congratulate the Scotch merchontupon
it : He-miled at that, telling me. not; to rejoice too oon ; for,
aid he, except the Ruan oldrers in garrionh and a few in-
habitants of the Cities upon the road, all the re of this coun-
try forabove a'thouand miles, is' inhabited by the mo igno-
rant and barbarous Pagans.
We advanced from the river A'rgun by moderate journeys ;
and ound convenient garrionsjn the land lled with Chri-
tian oldiers, for the ecurity of Commerce, and for the conve-
riient lodging of travellers; but the inhabitants of the country
were mere Pagans, worhipping the on, moon, and ars. And
this idolatry _we met near Argun, at a city of the Tartars and
Ruzms joined together, called Neriirziey: For being curious
fee their way of living, while-the caravan continued to ret
themelves in that city, I went to one of their villages, when
there was to be one of their olemn acrices. There behold
Upon the temper' an old tree, was placed an idol of wood,
more ugly than the reprceotation of the devil himelf; its
head was uch as reiemhled no living creature; its ears were
'as big and high as goats' horns, a crooked noe, four-corner.-
ed.mouth,-aod horrible teeth : It was clothed in heeps' ities,
had agreen Tartar bonoet,-with two horns growing through
izzxmd was eight feet high ; without feet, legs, or proportion.
Bere this idoiz-there lay 36 or 17 people, who brought their
rnerings, and-were making their prayers ; while at a diance
ood three men and one bullock, as victims to their ugly
monter. £
Such upendous acrilege as this, in rohbing the true God
of'his honour, filled' me with the greate aonihment and re-
exioog'ewhich- oon turning to rage and fury, I rode up to
die-image, and cut in pieces the bonnet that was upon his head
with my word, o that it hung down by one of the horns;
While' one of my men that was with me, pulled at it by its
weep-(kin garment : But immediately an hideous howling and
outcry man through the village, and two orthree hundred peo-
ple coming about our ears, we were obliged to y for it.
But I had not done with the' moner ;. for the caravan be-
ing to'ret three nights in the town, I told the Scotch merchant
what I had een, and I was rcolved to take four or ve men
well armed with me, in order to deroy the idol, and (hew the
People-how little reaon they had to tr-u to it, who Could not
ave' Melt', At r he laughed at me, repreenting the danger
ofit; and when it was detroyed, what time had We to preach
(0
vto them better things, whoe zeal and ignorance were in the
highet degree, and both unparalelled ; that if I hould be tak'-
en by them, l hould be erved like a poor Rzan, who con-
temned their worhip; that is, be tripped naked, and tied to
the top of the idol, there (hot at with arrows till my body wa:
full of them, and then burnt as a acrice to the moner: But,
Sir, aid he, ince your zeal carries you o Far, rather than you
hould be alone, l will accompany you, and bring a out tel-
low, equal to yonrlelt, if he will ai us in this deign: And
accordingly he brought one called Captain Ricbarcion, who
hearing the tory, readily contented; but my partner declined
it, being altogether out of his way : And o we three, and my
man lervant, reolved to execnte this exploit, about midnight;
but upon econd thoughts we deferred it to the next night,
by reaon the car-avan being to go from thence next morn-
ing, we hould be out of the Goverour's power. Well,
-I procured a YZzrtar's (keep-(kin robe, a bonnet, with bows
and arrows, and every one of us got the like habits. The
r night we pent in mixing combuible matter with aqua-
vitee, gunpowden, &c. having a good quantity of tar in a little
pot. And the la night coming to the idol about eleven
o'clock, the moon being up, we found none guarding ; but we
perceived a light in the houe, where we aw the pries be-
tore. One man was for ring the but, another for killing the
people, and a third for making them prioners, while the idol
was deroyed. And, in hort, to the latter we agreed ; o that
knocking at the door, we eized the r that opened it, then.
ftopping his mouth, and tying his feet together, let him with
the idol. In this manner did we erve two others, but the
valiant Scotch merchant being dicovered at length, ruhed in
upon them, being backed by us', and let re to the compoe-
tion, which frightened them o much, tltattwe brought them
all away, as priloners to their wooden god. Then we- fell to
work with him, danbing him all over with tar, mixed with
tallow and brimione, opping his eyes, ears and mouth full of
gunpowder, with a great piece of wildre in his bonnet, and
environed it with dry forage. All this being:- done, wound
looened and ungagged the prioners, 'and let the idol on fire,
which the gunpowder blowing up, the 'hape of it was deform-
ed, rent and lplit, which the furagelutterly conumed ;* for me:
ayed to lee its deruction, le the ignorant idolatrous people *
hould have thrown themelves into the ame. And thus we:
* came away nndicovered, appearing o bny'in the morning-a-
mong our lellow-travellers, that nobody coold have nt'pected,
but that we had been in our beds all night.
But after we were et out, and had got ome mall dil'lnnc-e
i from the city, there came-a great multitude of the country
People to the gates',demandinguntisfaction of the Ruae GoV-Y
A S a ernonr,
'Rib
ernonr, for innlting their prie'ls, and burning their great
'Cbam Cbz' Tbauwgu, who dwelt in the Sun, and that no mortal
would violate his image, but ome Chriiao micreants : And
therefore, being already 3o,ooo trong, they denounced war
Bg'aini him and all his Chri-ans.
The Governour aured them he was ignorant of the matter,
and that none o his garrion had been out ; that indeed there
was a caravan that went away that morning, that he would end
after them to inquire into it, and whoever were the oenders,
hould be delivered into their hands. This atised them for
the preent; but the Governour ent to inform us, that if any
ot us had done it, we hould make our ecape; or if not, make
all the hae away poble, while ne kept them in play as long
as he could. Hereupon we marched two days and two nights,
tonping but very little, till at la we reied at a village called
-P/otbu:, and halied to &am-wem, another of the Czar's colo-
n-ies. But on the econd day's march from the former, hav-
ing entered the deert, and paed the lake Sbakr-Or, we be-
held a numerous body of hore on the other ide o it to the
north, who uppoed we had paed that ide ofthe lake : And
in three days atter, having found their miake, or being in-
formed which way we went, they came upon us toward the
dulk of the evening, ju as we had pitched our camp between-
two little but very thick woods, with a little river running be-
fore our front, and we cut down lome trees to place in one
rear, but before we had finihed our ituation, the enemy were
at hand. But not falling on us immediately, they ent three
meengers, who demanded the men who had inlulted their
pries, and burnt their god Cbam C/ni T'mzmgu, that they might
be burnt, and then they would peaceably depart ; but
'if not, they would deroy them all. Hereupon our men
tared at one another, but nobody was the word, as in-
deed nobody knew it but thoe who did it. Upon which the
leader of the caravan anwered, that they were peaceable
imerehants, who meddled with none of their priets or gods;
and therefore deired them not to diurb us, andput us to the
neceity of defending ou-relves. But o far was this from
atisfying them, that the next morning, coming to our right,
zhey let y a votley of arrows at us, but hurt not any, becaue
ewe theltered ourelves under the baggage : But as we expected
Lo come to an engagement, a cunning father, a Cick, obtain-
zing leave of the leader to go to thee people, mounts his hor',
and rides directly from our rear; when taking a circuit, he
comes back as though he had been ent expres ; tells them a
formal tory, that the villains who burnt the Cbanz Cbi aungv,
weregone to sibz'eþa, with a relolution to burn the god Shal-
Far, belonging to the Ybnguefes. Upon which, believing this
cunning Tartar, who was crvant to our Mtg/'caz/cta, awc'fiy they
IOVC
drove' to SiHeL/Ia, and in les than three hours were out of
ght, nor did we ever hear of them more. \
When we came to the city of j'dravwena, we reed there ve
days, and then entered into a righttul delert, which held us
twenty three days march, infeed with everal mall compa-
nies of robbers or Mogul Writers, who never-'had the courage
to attack us. But after we had paed over this place, we
found everal Tartars: In particular the governour of Aa'irz/Eay
oered us a guard of fty men, to the next ation; if we ap-
prehended any danger. All this way the natives retained the
ame Paganim and barbarity,only not o dangerous, being con'-
quered by the Muowitcr. _The clothing, both of rnen and
women, are the kins of beais, living under ground in vanlts
and caves, which run into one another. They have idols in
almo every family; beides, they adore the un and dare,
water and now ; and the lea uncommon thingthat happens
in the elements, alarms them as much as thunder and lightning
does the unbelieving Jaws. *
Through all the country nothing more remarkable occurred :
'When we had got through this great deert I before mention-
ed, after two days farther travel, we came to janeza, a Mzzca.
tvile city, on the great river o called, which we are told, parts
Europe from Aia. Neither here are the Pagans much better,
though internnxed with the Ille/'rownen but the wonder will
ceae, when l inform my reader ofwhat was oberved to me,
that the Czar cunverts the Tartars with oldie-rs, not clergymen,
and is more aiduous to make them faithful (objects than good
Chriians.
From this city to the river Oby, we travelled over a þleaant,
fruitful, but very uncultivatxed country, for want ot good,man-
agement and people, and thoe few are moly Pagans. This
is the place where the Mucoruite criminals are banihed to, if
they are not put to death. The next city we came to, was the
capital city of Siberia, called Tobat/ti, when having been a'mo
even mouths on our journey, and winter drawing on apace,
my parmer and I conult'ed about our particular aairs, in what
manner we hould dipoe ofourelves. We had been told of'
iledgesand 'rein deer, to carry us over the now in the winter
eaon, the inow being frozen very hard, making an entire
covering to the ground, o that the edges'can, run upon the
urface without any regard to what is beneath. But l, being
bound to England, molt either go with the caravan to j'erq/Iaqo,
thence well to Nun-va, and theigulf of Fz'm'arzd, and o by land
or lea to Denmark ; or ele I mu leave the caravan at a little

But about two hours after he came to my apartment, Dear

hall have this atistaclion in parting, that you leave me an
hone man ill z but as a teitimony of my aection to you, be

I tent my lervant the next morning to his Lordhip, with
'afmall preent of tea, two pieces of China dam-alle, and four
little Wedges of gold ; But be only accepted the tea, one piece
of damah, and a Wedge of gold, for the Curioity of the Fapar:

that what he had reft-led himelf, he hoped, upon his account,
I would grant to another whom he hould name : In hort, it
was his only on, who was above aco miles diant from him
on the other ide of the Oby, whom he could end for, if I gave
my conent. This I oon complied with, upon which he tent
his [servants the next day for his ton, who returned in twenty
days time, bringing even hores loaded with valuable furs.
At night the young Lord was conducted incognito to our
apartrnent, where his father preented him to me. We then
eonulted the bet way for travelling, and, after buying a con-
iderable quantity of fables, black fox hine, ne ermines, &c.
(which I lold at Arcbangel at a good price) we et out from this
city the beginning of jane, making a mall caravan, being
about 32 hores and camels, of which I repreemed the head.
My young Lord had with him a very, faithful Sit-crime lervant,
well acquainted with the roads : We hunncd the principal
towns and Cities, as Tumen, SaI-Kamchty, and everal others,
by reaon of their rictnels in examining travellers, le any of
the baniihed perlons of dillinction hould ecape. Having pa-
ed the river Kama, we came to a city on the European de
called Sole) Kamchoy, where we fonnddhe people moly Pa-
gans asbclore. We then paied a deert about zoo miles
over, but in other places it is near 700 : In pang this wild
place, We were beet by a troop of men on horeback, about
forty-'vgarmed with bows and arrows. At i'rlt they looked
earneily on us, and then placed themelves in our way. WVe
were alight ixteen men, and drew up in a little line before-out'
camels. My young:a Lord iem'out his'lervant to know t'lwho
t ey
'dun-'-
theyiwere; *butwhen* he approached-them, 'he neither knewu
a word they aid, nor would- they admit him to ectome'near-
them at hiis'peril, but prepared to hoot him. At his >returrt>
he told us, he believed them to-be Cain-mal- Y'artars, and than
he thought there were more of them upon 'the deert. - Ttriez
was buta mall comfort or us, yet 'eeing a little=grtove at
about a quarter of a mile ditance, we moved to it lby'th'eold
Portugm pilot's' advice, without meeting any oppoition. In-
this placelwe ound 'a pringy piece of ground, a great s pring'-
running from a little brook on one ide, joined with anothert
like it a little farther, which in hort was the head ofTKthe river
Writ/La. We went to work, immediately cutting down great
arms o trees, and laid them hanging (not quite cut o) rom-
one tree to another. And thus we waited the motions of the-
enemy, without perceiving any advance they made towards us r
But about two hours before night, being joined by ome othi-Þ
ers, they made about 80 hore, amongwhom we fancied were-
ome women, and coming to us with great fury, we. &rede-with-
out ball, calling tothem in the Ruan tongue to know their
buines; but they not underanding ns,®--oi*- pretending o;
came directly to the wood ide, not conidering that we were
o fortied, that they- could 'not break in. Our old pilot prov-
ed both our captain and engineer, and deire'd; us not- to re-
till they came within pi-ol hot, and he gave the word o com-
mand; then to take the ure aim: But he did not bid us
re, till they were within two pikes of us 3 and then we killed
15 othem, wounded everal, as alo their hores, having eve-
ry one charged with two or three balls at lea. So much
were they urprized at our undauntednes, that they tell back
about one hundred rods from us. In the mean time we loaded
again, and all allying out, ecured our or ve of their hores,
whoe riders we ound were killed, and perceived them to be
Tartars. About an hour alter they made another attempt to
break in, but nding us ready to receive them, they retired.
All that night we worked hardin irengthening our itua-
tion, and barricadoing the entrances into the woods ; but
when day light came, we made a very unweleome dicovery ;
for the enemy being encouraged by their aliance, had et up
eleven or twelve tents, in the orm of a camp, about three
quarters oa mile from us. I mu confes, I was never more
concerned in my life, giving myelf, and all that Ihad, over
for lo : As for my partner, as the los of his goods would be
his ruin, before they hould be taken from him, he would
ght to the la drop of his blood. But to ecape their num-
hers, l had recoure to a tratagem, by kindling a large ame
to burn all night; and no ooner was it dark, but we purlued
our journey towards the pole, or the north ttar, and o travel ..
liu all night, by ix o'clock in the morning we came to altzz.

Of Suring Aicti'am.
FFLICTlON-S are very common to all mankind, and
whether they proceed from loes and diappointments,
or the malice of men, they often bring their advantages along
with them: For this hews men the vanity and deeeitulnes
of this life, and is an occaion orectiying out' meaures, and
bringing us to a more mode opinion of ourelves : It tells us
how neceary the atance of Divine Grace is to us, when life
itelf becomes a burthen, and'death even delirable. But when
the greate oppreion cornes upon us, we mu' have 'recoure
to Patience, begging of God to give us that virtue. And the
more compoed we are in any trouble, the more commendaz
bleis our widom ; and the 'larger will be ourrecompence.
And let the provoeation be what it will, whether from a good
natured and Concientious, ora wicked, preverie, and vexatious
man, all this we hould take as from the over ruling hand of
God, as a punihment for our ins. Many times injnred inno-
rence may be abued by fale oaths, or the power of wicked,
jealous, or malicious men ; but we often nd it, like the
palm, rie the higher, the more it is depreed, while the ju-
tice ofGod is eminentlzr remarkable in punihing thoe, one
way or other, who deire or endeavour to procure the dewnfal
of an innocent man : Nor does God fail Comforting an aict-'-
ed pe.ron,who with tears and prayers olieits the throne of heav-
en for deliverance and protection. David ays, (flat bis nd
'was full qftrauble, and bis life drew near unto ti'zeg"server But cer-
tainly David's aicttons made him eminently remarkable, par-
ticular-ly when purued by King Soal, and hunted as a par-
tridge over the mountains. But one thing which ands' by
innocence, isthe love of God : For were we to uer diigrace,
nay, an ignominious death itel, what conolation does inno.

As converation is a great part of human happines, o it is
a pleaant ight to behold a weet temper-ed man, who is
always t for it 3 to ee an air ofhumour and pleaantnes it
upon every brow, and even omething angelic upon every
countenance: VVhereas-if we obervea deigning man, we
hall nd a mark of involuntary adnes breaks in an his) joy,
and

and a certain innrtcction in the oul again the 'tyranny of'
prn-igate principles.
They err very much, who think religion, ora rict moral-
ity dicompoes the mind, and renders it unt for convera-
tion ; for it is rather that which inpires us to innocent mirth,
indeed, without a counterfeit joy, as vicious men appear with :
And indeed wit is as conient with religion, as religion is with
good manners ; nor is there any thing in the limitation of
virtue and religion, that hould abate the pleaure of it, but
on the contrary increae it.
But on the other hand, many men by their own vice and
intemperance, diqualify themelves for converation, in being
of cynical, ttrly and rude tempers, though they boa them-
elves otherwie. Converation is immoral, where dicoure
is indecent, immode, candalous, landerous orx abuive.
How great is their folly, and how much it is expoed, by af;
ronting vtheir be friend, even God himelf, before men,
whoe notions are uncertain, and yet who laugh at the fool
'when bisear cometh !
The great candal atheilical and immoral dicourle gives
to virtue, ought, methinks, to be punihed by the judges:
Make a man once ceae to believe a God, and he has nothing
left to limit his oul but mere Philoophy. And how incon-
grous is this to government, that a man hould be punihed for
drunkennes or t'Wearing, and yet have liberty to aront and
even deny the Majey of Heaven ? If a man gives the lie to
a gentleman in company, or perhaps peaks a word without
any oenive meaning, he ies into a paon, quarrels, ghts,
and perhaps murders him ; or afterwards proecutes him at
Jaw with the utmo villany and oppreion.
T he next thing to be refrained from is obcene diconre,
whichis the language only of the procients in debauehery, who
never repent but in a gaol or an hopital ; and whoe caicaes
ink as had as their difcoure, till the body becomes too hay
for' the foul to ay any longer in it. ,
Nor is fale talking les to be avoided: For lying is the
jheep's clothing hung upon the wolf's back ; 'tis the Pbariee's
prayer, the whore's bluh, the hypocrite's paint, the murderer's
Imile, the thieFs cloak, 'tis Joab's-t embrace, and ji'udas's kis ;
in a word. 'tis mankinds' dat-ling in, and the devil's diin-
guihing charaier. Some add lies to lies, till it not only comes
'o be improbable, but even impoble too : Others lie for
gain, to deceive, delude, and betray : And a third ort lie for
zt'port, or for m. There are other liars, who are peronal and
malicious ; who foment dier-ences, and carry tales from onc-
houe to another, in order to gratify their own envious temp-
crs, without any regard or reverence for truth.

Of tbeprent State a Religwn in the World.
DOUBT, indeed, there is much more devotion than reli-
gion in the world, more adoration than' upplication, and.
more hypocrily than incerity : And it is very melancholy to
conider, what numbers of people there are, furnihed with
the powers of reaon and the gifts of nature, and yet abana
doned to the groe ignorance'and depravity. But it wontd
be uncharitable for us to imagine, (as ome Papit'ls abounding
with too much ill-nature. the only l'candal to religion, do) that
they will certainly be in the tate of damnation after this 'life :
for how can we think it condent with the mercy and goodneis
of an innite being, to damn thoe creatures, when he has not
furnihed them with the light of his gopelt Or how can
uch proud, conceited, and cruel bigots precribe rules to the
juice and mercy of God ?
We are told by ome people, that the great image which King
Nebuebadnezzar et up to be adored by his people, held the re-
prelentation of the (an in his right hand, as the principal object
of adoration. But to wave this dicourfe of Heathens, how many
elf contradicting principles are held among Chriians t And
how do we doom one another to the devil, while all profels to
worhip the ame Deity, and to expect the ame salvation t
' 'Whenl was at Portugul there was held at that time the
court of juice of the inqnition. All the criminals were
carried in proceon to the great church 3 where eight of them
were habited in gowns and caps of canvas, whereon the tor-
ments of hell were diplayedz and they were condemned and
burnt for crimes again the Catholic faith and BleedVirgin.
I am orry to make any reexions upon Chriians; but
indeed in Italy the Ramzh religion eems the mot cruel and
mercenary upon earth : And a very judicious peron, who
travelled through Italy from Turkcy, tells us, U That there is
only the iace, and outward pomp of religion there; that the
church protects murderers and aaiins, and then delivers the
civil magirates over to Satan for doing juice z interdicis
whole kingdoms, and huts up the churches tor want of paying
a few eccleiaiiic dues, and o puts a op to religion for twant
of their money : That the Court of Inqoiition burnt two men
for peaking dihonourably of the Bleed Virgin, and the mi-
ionaries of China tolerated the worhipping the devil by their
new converts : That Italy, was the theatre, where religion was
the grand opera; and that the Popih clergy were no other
than the (lage players." =
As to religion in Paland, they deny Chri to be the Meah,
or that the Meiah was come in the eh- And as to their
Proteltants, they are the followers of Lelius soraz'mrr, whoil dee-
me
Ysaac
nied our Saviour's divinity ; and have no concern about 'the
divine inpiration ot the Holy Gho.
In Muwy their churches are built of' wood, and indeed
they have but wooden priets, though of the Greek church :
They pray as much to St. Nirbalar,-as Papis do to the Virgin
.Mo-'3', for protection in all their diculties or aictions.
As to Luther-am', they only dier from the Roman: in believ-
ing Conubantation, inead of Tranubantation 5 but, like
vthem, they are much pleaed with the external gallantry and
pomp, more than the true and real practice of religion.
ln France l found a world of pries, the reets every where
crowded with them, and the chuches full of women ; but
urely never was a nation o full of blind guides, o ignorant
'Of religion, and even as void of morals, as thoe people who
confes their msto them.
Now it eems trange, that while all, men own the Divine
Being, there hould be o many dierent entiments about pay-
ing him obedience in the Chritian church : I know not what
reaon to aign for this, except it be their dierent capacities
and faculties. '
And indeed upon this account, awe have perceived in all
Chriian countries what-mortal ends have been about relig-
Son : zwhat wars and bloodhed have moleed Europe, till the
general pacication of the German troubl'es at the treaty of
Mpdalz'a ; and ince, bem een the Lutbemn churches? And
ihould Jtake a propect at home, what unhappy diviions arte
between C-hriians in this kingdom about EpiFcopacy, Prefby-
tery, the Church of England men and the Dienters; and
"where they withand one another like St. Paul and St. Peter,
even to the face; as much as to ay, carry on the dipute to
the utmo extremity.
It might be aqueiion, why there are uch dier-ences in
religious points, and why thee breaches hould be o hot and
irreconcileable? .All the anwer I can give to this, is, that w
inquire more 'concerning the truth of religion, than any other
mation in the worid; and the anxious concern we have about
it, makes usjeaious of every opinion; and tenacious of our
own: And this is not-becaue we are more furious and rah
than other people ; but the truth is, we are more concerned
about them, aznd being enible that the cripture is the great
rule of aith, the tiandard for life and doctrine, we have re-
coure to it out-elves, without ubmitting to the pretended in-
Faihbie judge upon earth.
There is another dwell-inn pertinent to the former, what
remedy can we apply to this malady l And to this I mu neg-
atinely anwer, not to have us be les religious, that we
might dier les about it t And this is riking at the very root
ctof elleeligiotu dierencesz for certainly, were they to 'be
' - carried
carried on with a peaceable pirit, willing to be informed, our
variety of opinions wouldnot have the name of dierences ;
nor hould we eparate in communion of charity, though we did
not agree in everal articles of religion.
Nor is there a les ucf'ul queion to art, namely, where
will our unhappy religious dierences end t To which I hope I
may anwer, In Heart/m : There all unchriian and unbroth-
erly dierences will nd a period; there we hall embrace
many a inner that here we think it a dihonour to convere
with ; and perceive many a heart we have broken here with
cenures, reproaches and revilings, made whole again by the
balm of the Redeemer's blood. Here we hall perceive theie
have been other ocks than thoe of our fold ; that thoe we
have excommunicated have been taken into that uperiour
communion ; and, in a word, that thoe contra-dicting notions
and principles, which we thought inconilent with true relig-
ion, we hall ndreconcileable to themelves, to one another,
and to the fountain of truth. Ifany man ,ak me, why our
dierences-cannot be ended on earth t I atiwer, were we all
thoroughly convinced, that then they would be reconciled,
we would put an end to them before ; but this is impoible'
to be done : for as men's certain convictions of truth are not
equal to one another, or to the weight and ignicancy of uch
veracity ; o neither can a general eect of this aair be ex-
pected on this ide of time, this ide othe grave.
Before I conclude this chapter, I hallibeg leave to dicoure
a little of the wonderful excellcncy of negative religion and
negative virtue. The latter ets out like the Pþa-riise with God,
I 'bank thee z 'tis a piece of religious pageantry, the hypocrite's
hope ; and in a word, 'tis a politive vice : For it iis either a
mah to deceive others, or a mi to deceive ourelves. A man
thus clothed 'with negatives, thus argues r I am not uch a.
drunkard as my landlord, uch a thief as my tenant, uch a
wearer as my neithbour ; neither am 1 a cheat, an- athei, a
rakih fellow, or a highwayma-n : No! I live a ober, regular,
retired life ; I am a good man, I go to church, God I 'bank
thee Now though a man boas of his virtue in contradtction
to the vices mentioned, yet a= peron had better be them all to-
gether than the man bimhg- for he is o full of himelf, o per-
uaded that he is good and religious enough already, that he has
no thoughts of any thing, except it be to pull o his hat to
God Almighty now and then, and thank him, that he has no
occaion for him; and has the vanity to think that his neigh-
bours mu imagine well of him too _
Now the negative man, though he is no drunkard, yet is in-
toxicited with the pride ofhis own worth : A good neighbour
and peacemaker in other families, but a tyrantin his own : ap-
Pears 'in church for a hew, but never falls upon his knees in
'I a his
m
his cloet ; does all his alms before men to he een by 'them ;
eager in the duties of the econd table, but regardlets-of the
r 2; agpears religious torbe taken notice of by men, but with-
out intercoure or communication between God and his own
foul. Pray what is "this man? Or what comfort is there of
thelif'e he lives *? He is lenible of faith, repentance, anda
chriiian mortied life: In a word, he is perfectly a range:
to theeential Pa rt of religion.
Let tus, for-a while, enter intothe private and retired part
of his eonveration : What notions has he of his miiþent
h0urs,.and the natural reux of all outr minutes on to the great
centre and gulph of life, Ere-mit)- P Dues he know how to put
a right value on time, or eieem me life blood qf Isis foul, as it
really is, and act in all the moments o't'it, as one that mu ac-
count for them P Ithen you cannot form an equality between
'what he can do, and what he (hall receive; les can it be
founded upon his negative virtue, or what he forhore to do;
and it neither his xnegative or poitive-piety can tie-equal to the
reward, and to the eternity that reward is to la on, what then
is to become of the Pbarz'he, when he is to be judged by the
incerity of his repentance, and rewarded, according to the in-
nitezgrace of God, with a litate of bleednels to an endlels
cternity =P
When the negati-ve man converes with the inviible world,
he is lled with as much hot-rout' and dread, as Felix when St.
Paul reaoned to him of temperance, righteounes, and of
judgment to come 2 For Felix, though agreat philolctophcr of
great power and reverence, was a negetive man; and he was
made enible, by the apole, that as a life of virtue and tem-
Penance was its own reward, by giving a healthy body, a
clear head, andacompofed life; o eternal happinel's mu
proceed from another pring ; namely, theinnite unbounded
grace of a provoked God, who having erected a righteous tri-
i burial, Jeus Chri would eparate uch as by aith and repent-
zncehe had brought home and united to himelf by the grace
of-adoption ; and on the foot of his having laid down his life as
a ranom for them, had appointed, them to alvation, when
all the Philoophy, temperance, and righteoune' in the world
beides, was ineec'tuai 5 and this, I ay, it was, that made Felix,
that negztive man, tremble.

Of Life-ning 'a 'be Voice of Providence.
HE magnfcent and wie King Solomon bids, us by after
knowledge, and lift up our 'voice for underanding ; which
int-spurned to us as a religion: knowledge by the tialtowing
* wor s:
words : Then hall' thou under/land 'be enr-aftbe Lard, arzdnd
the knowledge of God. By which undoubtedly he meant to in-
quire after every thing he has permitted us to know, and not
to earch into thoe ways that are unearcha-ble, and are eec-
tually locked up from our knowledge. Now, at [le-'sin to rþe-
twice of Providence is my preent ubject, I am very wil ing in
the r place, touppoe that I am writing to thoe who own,
1. That there is a God, ar great moving caue of all things,
an eternal power, prior, and conequently uperior, to all
power and being. 2. That thiseternal power, which is God,
is the overeign Creator and governour of heaven and earth.
To avoid all needles ditinctions what Perons in the God-
head exercie the creating, and what the governing power, I
oer that glorious text, Palm xxxiii. 6. Where the whole
Trinity is entitled to the whole creating work ; and therefore in
the next place, l hall lay down thee two propoisionst
I. That rbe Eternal God guide: by bie Providence the whole um'-
vyere, 'which 'ZOEJ created by bis power.
il. War xbz's Providence manz: a particular care war, and
cat-wem in 'be gave-ming and directing man, the mu noble creature
upon earth. L
Now it is plain, that natural religion proves the r, by in-
timating the necety oa Providence guiding and governing
the world, from the conequence of the wildom, juice, pre-
eience, and goodnels of the Almighty Creator: For other-
wie it would be aburd to think that God hould create a
world, without any care or Providence over it, in guiding the
operations of nature, lo as to preerve the order of his crea-
anon.
Rcvealed religion gives us light into the care and concern of
his Providence, by the climates being made habitable, the
creatures ubjected and made nourihing, and all vegetative
life _made med-icmal ; and all this for the ake of man', who is
made viceroy to the king of the earth. The hort decription
I hall give of Providence is this, that it is that opera'zon of
the power, of the wildom, juice and goodnes ot God, by
which he tnoences, governs and directs, not only the means,
but the events of all things, which concern us in this ubluna-
ry world; the overeigmy ol which we ought always to re-
Verence, obey its motions, oberve its dictates; and lzen to its
voice. He prudent man forgiveth evil and hideth bmynlfz that
is, as I take it, there is a ecret Providence lnlltndles to us,
that ome danger threatens, il we llrive not to hun it,
The ame day at the month llu 'Sir Tat-'2 Hotþam kept out
- Hull again the royal marzyr King Charles La. the tame day Sir
John Hotbam was put to death of, the Parliament for that very
action; The ame day that the King himel' tgned the war-
rant for the execution otf_ the Earl of Sir-aord, the lameleay of
I
1
the month was he barbarouly murdered by the blood thiriy
Oliverz'an crew : And the ame day that King James II. came
to the crown again the bill oexcluion, the ame day he was
voted abdicated by the parliament, and the throne lled with
King William and (Lzeen jldarj.
The voice of ignal deliverances from udden dangers, is not
only a ju call to repentance, but a caution again falling into
the like danger: But uch, who are utterly careles of them-
elves ater, hew a lethargy of the wor nature, which eems
to me to be a kind of practical atheim, or at leaf-i a living in a
contempt of heaven, when he receives good at the hand of his
Maker, but is unconcerned at the nature and original of it;
neither when he receives evil does it bring him to any ate of
humiliation.
We have a remarkable ory of two oldiers being condemn-
ed to death in Flanders, the general being prevaized upon to
pare one of them, ordered them to cat dice upon the drum-
head or their lives :. The r throwing two xes, wrung his
hands, but was urprized when the other threw two ixes alo.
The ocer appointed to ee the execution ordered them to
throw again; they did o, and each of them threw two tives ;
at which the oldiers that tood round houted, and aid neith-
er of them was to die. Hereupon the ocer acquainted the
council of war, who ordered them to throw again, and then
came up two ours : The general being made aeq-uainted with
it, ends for the men, and pardoned them : flame, ays he, in
uch extraordinary eaes; to lzm to the voice of Prmzidencet
We read in the holy Writings, how God peaks to men, by
appearance of angels, or by dreams and viions of the night.
As God appeared to Abrabam, Lot, and Jacob; o angels have
appeared' to many in other caes, as Manoab and his wife, Zar-
barz'ab, the Virgin Mary, and to the apolles z others have been
warned in a dream, as King Abimilecb, the fale prophet Befa-
am, and many others.
It is certainly a very great and noble inquiry, what we hall
be after this life, being aured that there is a place reerved
for the reception of our louls after death : For if we are to be,
"we mu' have a rwbere, which the criptures aer-t by the ex-
amples of Dives and Lazarus; The doctrine-of pirits was
long believed before our Saviour's time ; for even the dilc'r-
pies of the-bleed Jeus perceiving our Saviour walk-ing on the
Yea, they were much urprized, as though they had een a pi-
riti Nay, in thoe ages of the world, it was believed that pi-
rits interineddied in the aairs of mankind: And throughout
the Old-Teiament I do not nd any initution, that in the
lea contradicts it. All the pains and labour that ome learn-
ed men have taken to conute the ory of the witch of Endar,

And it is plain, that, lwas it either a good or bad pirit, it pre-
phetically told the unfortunate king what hould happen the
next day : For, aid the  pi rit, The Lard rwz'll deliver tbee into

Abundance of range notions poeed me when I was in th
deolate iland 5 epecially of a moonhiny night, when every
buh eemed a man, and every tree a man on horteback. When
I crept into the dimal cave, where the old goat lay expiring,
whoe articulate groans even reembled thoe of a man, how
was [urprized on this occaion, when my blood chilled in my
Veins, a cold weaty dew at on my forehead, my hair tood
upright, and my joints, like Belhazzar's knees, [hook again
one another. And indeed, thonghl atterwards ound what
it was, the remains of this urprize did not wear o me for-a
great while 5 and l had frequently ome returns of thee 'ea-
pours on dierent occaions, and ometimes without any occa-
on at all.
eOne night, after having een ome appearance in the air, as I
had ju laid down in my bed, one of my feet pained me ; after
that came a numbnes ucceeded with a tiogling in my blood z
when on a udden I thought' omething alive lay upon me,
from my knee to above half my leg. Hereupon immediately-I
ung myel out of bed in the dark, where I thought the crea-
ture lay: But nding nothing, Lord deliver me from an mail
jþirit, aid l, 'what um this be? And when I lighted a candle,
-I could perceive no living creature in the place with me, but
the poor parrot, who being frighted, "cried out, Held jMf'
tongue, and Wbat': the matter 'with jeu? which words 1 had
taught him, by aying lo to "him, when he made tich tream-
ing noies that I did not like. Lard, aid l aloud, uret'y 'be

mad at the bird, and putting on my clothes, cried, I am terri-
bly frighted. V'bat's the matter 'with you? ays Fell. Youi
toad, aid I, I'll knock your brains out. Holdymr tongue, cri-
ed he again, and o tell a chattering, and cal-'ting Robin/on Cru-

went to bed again, I began plainly to ee it was a dit'emper
that aected the nerves, and o my terrors vanihed at one-e.
How intelligences are given or received, we do not know ;

The more particular dicoveries of the convere of (pit-its,
eem to me as follow :
Dreams, voices, noiles, impules, hints, apprehenions, in-

Dreams of old were the ways by. which God himelf was
pleaed to warn men what ervices to perform, and what to
hun. Jut-jub was directed of God in a dream to go to Egypt,
and o were the wie men warned in a dream to depart into
their own country another way, to avoid the fury of Herod. I
am not like thoe who think dreams are the mere doings of a
delirious head, or the reliets of a day's- perplexities or plea-
ures ; but on the contrary, I mu take leave to ay, I never
had any capital michief befel me' in my life, but I had ome
notice ol it by a dream; and had I not been a thoughtles un-
believing creature, I might have taken many a warning, and
avoided many of the evils I afterwards tell into, merely by a
total neglect ofthoe dreams. _ -
1 remember, I was preent at a dipute between a layman
and aclergyman upon the ubject of dreams: The r,thought
no regard hould be given unto them, that their communica-
tion from the inviible to the viible world was a mere chimera,
without any olid foundation : For, I. (aid he) ifdreams were
from the agency of any prelcient being, the motives would be
more direct, and; the dilcoveries more plain ; and not by al-
Jegories and emblematic fancies expreng things imperfect
and Obcure. 2.. Since, with the notice of cVll, there was not
a power given to. avoid it, it is not likely to proceed fron'ia
pirit, but merely fortmtous. 3. That the inconiancy of
uch notices, in caes equally important, prove, they did not
proceed from any uch agent. '4. That as our molt dillizilit
dreams had nothing in them of any ignicancy, 'it would be
irrational and vain to think that they came from heavqi.
And, 5. That as men were not always thus warned or 'uppli-
ed with notice of good or evil, to all men' are not alike uppli-
ed with them; and what reaon could we give, why one man
or one woman hould not have the ame hints as another.
To all this the clergyman gave anwer, 1. That as to the
ignication ofdreams, and the objections again them, as be-
ing dark and doubtful, they are exprecd generally by hiero-
glyphical reprelentations, imilies, alluons, and ght-ative
emblematic ways, by which means, for want of interpretation,
the, thing was not undertood, and conequently the, evil not
hunned. z. Thatywe charge God foolihly, to ay he has giv-
en the notice of evil without the power to avoid it; for if any
one had not power to avoid the evil, it was no notice to him;
and itwas want of giving due heed to that notice, that men r
neglected themelves, and then charged the Judz * 
earth with injuice. 3. That we ought not to ll!
the inconancy of thee notices, but rather our crazy under-
iiandings, by pretending dreams were not to be regarded, and
neglectedxwhen the voice really lpoke to us for our good. It
was a great miake to ay dreams had no import at all ; it
might rather be aid, none that we could perceive the reaon
of, which was owing to our blindnes and upine negligence to
be ecure at one time, and our heads too much alarmed at a-
nother; o that the pirit which we might be aid to be con-
vering with in a dream, was conantly and equally kind and
careful 3 but our powers not always in the ame ate of action,
nor equally attentive to or retentive of the hints that were giv-
en. And, 5. To anwer the la queion, 1Why people are
not equally tn-pplied? This eemed to be no queion ; tor
Providence itel might have ome hare in the direction of it,
and then that Providence might be limited by ome uperiour
direction : That as to the converie of pirits, he could not tie
up to a (lated convere: Such a thing there was, but why
there was o much of it, and no more, was none of his bui-
nels, and that no uch dicovery had ever been made yet to
mankind. Nor are we les to imagine of walking dreams,
trances, viions, noies, hints, impulies, and all the waking
tellimonies of an inviible world, and of the communication
that th he is between us and them, which commonly entertain
us with'ur eyes open.
One time my fancy oared on high, to ee. what dicoveries I
could makein thoe clearer regions. I found that uch immene
bodies as the un,tlars, planets and moonsin the great circle of
the lower heaven, is far from being ound in the tludy of na-
ture, on the urface of the earth : Here I aw many things that
'we can entertain little or no notion of in a ate of commonct o-
percial life, and the emptines of our notion that the planets
were made habitable worlds; that is, I mean, for the ubi-
ence and exience of man and bea, and the Preervation of
the vegetative and enitive life: No no, this is, I aure you, a
world of pirits : For here I aw a clear demonration o Sa-
tan being the prince of the power of the air, keeping his court
or camp, with innumerable angels to attend him: But his
power is not o great as we imagine, he can tempt us to the
crime, but cannot force us to commit it: Humanum epeccare.
Neither has the devil power to force the world into a rebel-
lion again heaven, though his legions are employed in the
avage nations to et up their maler for a god, and who made
the heathens either worhip him in peron, or byhis repreen-
tatives, idols, and monters, with the cruel acrices of human
blood. Now as to the limitations of the devil's power, you
mu underand, that there are numbers of good angels ent
from the higher and ble abodes, to diconcert and oppoe
their meaures: And this, I hope, every Chriian tilelievcs,
W en
when he prays go God, the Father of Spirits, to give his angels'
eharge over him while he umbereth and fleepeth. For if by
thee preventing powers the devil was not rerained, the earth'
would be ubject to dearth, droughts and famine; the air in-
fected with obnoxious fumes 3 and, in a word, mankind would
be utterly deroyed, which might oblige our Maker to the ne-
ceflity of a new Fiat, or ele have no more creatures to honou
and war-hip him. "'
As the devil never wanted ininuate-re, I hall oberve, that I
learned a way how to make a man dream of what I pleaed.
For intance, let us uppoe one to be found aeep, let another
lay his mouth cloe to his ear, and whifper any thing o oftly
as not to awake him, the leeping man hall dream of what has
Leen o whipered in his ear; nay, l can aure you, thee in-
inuating devils can do this even when we are awake, which I
call impule: eftbe mind .* For from whence, but from thee in-
iinuators, come our caueles paons, involuntary wickednes,
or tinful deires? Who ele forms ideas in the mind of man
when he is alleep, or preents terrible or beautiful gures to
the fancy? Mr. Milton repreents the devil tempting Eve in
the hape ofa toad lying ju at her ear, when in her bower he
lay fa aeep; and brings in Eeve telling Adam what an uneay
night's re he had, and relating her dream to him. And like-
wie I believe that good pirits have the fame intercoure with
us, in warning us again thoe things that are evil, and prompt-
ing us to thoe whidh are good.
Were we to have the eyes of our fouls opened through the
eyes of our bodies, we hould ee this very immediate region
of air which we breathe in, thronged with l'pirits now invii-
ble, and which otherwie would he the mo terrible: We
hould view the ecret tranfactions of thoe meengers who are
employed when the parting foul takes its leave of the reluct-
ant body, and perhaps ee things, nature would art back from
with the utmo terrour and amazement. In'a word, the rur-
tain of Providence for the dipoition of things here, and the
curtain of judgment for the determination of the ate of fouls
hereafter would be alike drawn back ; and what heart could
upport here its future ate in life, much les that of its fu-
ture ate after lie, even good or had.
A 'gentleman of my acquaintance, being about even miles
diant from London, a friend that came to dine with him, olic-
itedhim to go to the city. What for, aid the gentleman, is
there any occaion for me I No, Sir, aid the other, nothing

returned to London that night.
The obeying of everal hints, or eoret impules, argues
great widom. I knew a man that was under misortunes,
Being guilty of midemeanors again the government; when
ab-cond-i-ng for ear of his ruin, all his friend's adviing him no
to put himelfin the hands of the law, one morning as he'

Wrin- a ltttermtbem : And' this was repeated everal times' to
his mind, and at la he anwered to it as ifithad been a voice,
Who/ball I write to ? lmmediately it returned, Writ: tetbejndge:
And this impule purued him for everal days, till at length
he took pen, ink, and paper, and at down to write to him -,-,
when immediately words owed from his pen like re-ame
from a fair fountain, that even charmed himelf with expec-
tation of ucces :' In hort, the letter was o renuous in argu-
ment, o pathetic in its eloquence, and peruaively moving,
that when the judge had read it, he ent him an anwer he
might he eay, for he would endeavour to make the matter
light to him ; and indeed never let exerting himelf, till he
Pad topt the proccution, and retored him to his liberty and

I. knew a peron, who had o rong an impreliion upon her

While I am mentioning thee things, 'methinks it is very
hard, that we hould obey the whipers of evil pirits, and not
much rather receive the noticcs which good ones are pdleaed
to give. NVe never perceive the misfortune of this, but when
in real danger z and then we cry, my mind mz'game me, when I
'was going about it : But if o, why did you light the caution t

no reaon to make this complaint.
3 I remember about fourteen or fteen years ago (as to time I
cannot' be very poisive) there was a young clergyman in the
gcity of Dublz'n, in Leland, who had a very uncommon dream.
"That a gentleman had killed his wie (who was a relation of
' his) by (labbing her in everal places. The tright of this oon
awaked him; he then fell aeep a econd- time,,dreamt the
Fame dream; and, in hort, a third time alo. So troubled
washe in his mind, that he aroe, and knocking at his moth-
"et-'s chamber,-told his concern,.and of his aporehenions that
all was not right at his relation's houe. Dear ion, ays the
good old gentlewoman, mind not thee foolih dreams : And I
very Ymuch wonder that you, being a peron in holy orders,

Jlept and dreamt as before, And then indeed he put on his
nightugown, and, went to SmitbeM, the place where his-relax
tion dwelt- Here it was, alas! he perceived his dream too
radly ullled,i___bbyueeing his rclation, the. young lady, big with

by all tender 'and religious people. And this tragical relatiom
I have mentioned upon the account ot thatim-pule, or dream,
that the clergyman had at the fatal time o-k the' bloody act.
lt might be expected I hould enter upon the ubject of ap-
paritions, and dicourle concerning the reality ot them ; and
whether they can reviit the place of their former exience, and
relume-thoe facultiesv of peech and hape which they had
when living ; but, as thee are very doubtful. matters, I hall"
only make a few Obervations upon them.
I once heard of a man who would allow the reality of app
paritions, but laid it all on the devil, and thinking the ouls of
men departed did never appear ;\ yet to this very man ome'-
thing did appear, and then he aid he aw the hape, of an an-i
cient man pas by him in' the duit, who holding up his hand in
a threatening poure, cried out, 0 wicked man repent, repent.
Terriied with this apparition, he conulted everal friends,
who advied him to take the advice. But, after all, it was not
an apparition, but a grave and pious gentleman, who met him
by mere accident, and had been made enible of his. wicked-
nes; and who never undeceived hini,_lel it hould hinder his
refer-mation: Were we always willing to make good ue of
Satan's real appearances, I know not' but it would go a greate
way to banih- him from the viible world; for I am very poh
tive he would eldom viit, if hethought his coming would do-v
us any good :. But o abolutely is he at the commando heav-
en, that he mu go, even to do the work he abhors.
Some people make a very ill ue of the general notion, that?
there are noiapparitions, not' pirits at all ;_ which is wore:
