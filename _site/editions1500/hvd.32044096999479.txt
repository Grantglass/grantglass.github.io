PREFACE.
PROGRESS and improvement characterize almost every art and
science; and within the last few years the science of Arithmetic has
received many important additions and improvements, which have
appeared from time to time successively in the different treatises pub-
lished upon this subject.
In the preparation of this work it has been the author's aim to com-
bine, and to present in ons harmonious whole, all these modern im-
provements, as well as to introduce some new methods and practical
operations not found in other works of the same grade; in short, to
present the subject of Arithmetic to the pupil more as a science than
an art; to teach him methods of thought, and how to reason, rather
than tchat to do; to give unity, system, and practical utility to the
science and art of computation.
The author believes that both teacher and pupil should have the
privilege, as well as the benefit, of performing at least a part of the
thinking and the labor necessary to the study of Arithmetic; hence
the present work has not been encumbered with the multiplicity of
"notes," "suggestions," and superfluous operations so common to
most Practical Arithmetics of the present day, and which prevent the
cultivation of that self-reliance, that clearness of thought, and that
vigor of intellect, which always characterize the truly educated mind.
The author claims for this treatise improvement upon, if not superi-
ority over, others of the kind in the following particulars, viz.: In
t/ie mechanical and typographical style of the icork; the open and
attractive page; the progressive and scientific arrangement of the
subjects; clearness and conciseness of definitions; fullness and accu-
racy in the new and improved methods of operations and analyses;
brevity and perspicui'y of rules; and in the very largo number of

examples prepared and arranged with special reference to their practical
utility, and their adaptation to the real business of active life. The an-
swers to a part of the examples have been omitted, that the learner may
acquire the discipline resulting from verifying the operations.
Particular attention is invited to improvements in the subjects of Com-
mon Divisors, Multiples, Fractions, Percentage, Interest, Proportion, An-
alysis, Alligation, and the Roots, aa it ia believed these articles contain
some practical features not common to other anthors upon these subjects.
The improvements in Percentage made necessary by the financial
changes of the last few years are especially noticable. The different
kinds of United States' Securities, Bonds, and Treasury Notes are de-
scribed, and their comparative value in commercial transactions illus-
trated by practical examples. The difference between Gold and Currency,
and the corresponding difference in prices, exhibited in trade, are taught
and illustrated, and many other things that every commercial student
and business man ought to know and understand.
There has also been added a fall and practical presentation of the
Metric System of Weights and Measures, containing many new and orig-
inal improvements in the arrangement, notation, and applications, not
before presented to the public, and which greatly simplify and adapt the
system to general use.
It is not claimed that this is a perfect work, for perfection is impossi-
ble; but no effort has been spared to present a clear, scientific, compre-
hensive, and complete system, sufficiently full for the business man and
the scholar; not encumbered with unnecessary theories, and yet com-
bining and systematizing real improvements of a practical and useful
nature. How nearly this cud has been attained the intelligent and ex-
perienced teacher and educator must determine.

DEFINITIONS.
1. Quantity is any thing that can be increased, diminished,
or measured.
2. Mathematics is the science of quantity.
3. A Unit is one, or a single thing.
•4. A Number is a unit, or a collection of units.
5. An Integer is a whole number.
G. The Unit of a Number is one of the same kind or
name as the number. Thus, the unit of 23 is 1; of 23 dollars,
1 dollar; of 23 feet, 1 foot.
7. like Numbers have the same kind of unit. Thus, 74,
16,and 250; 7 dollars and 62 dollars; 19 pounds, 320 pounds,
and 86 pounds; 4 feet 6 inches, and 17 feet 9 inches.
8. An Abstract Number is a number used without refer-
ence to any particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17 ; 365 ; 8540.
0. A Concrete Number is a number used with reference
to some particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17 dollars; 365
days; 8540 men.
NOTES. 1. The unit of an abstract number is 1, and is called Unity.
2. Concrete numbers are, by some, called Denominate Numbers.
Denomination means the name of the unit of a concrete number.
10. Arithmetic is the Science of numbers, and the Art of
computation.
11. A Sign is a character indicating an operation to be
performed.
12. A Rule is a prescribed method of performing an op-
eration.
Define quantity. Mathematics. A unit. A number. An integer.

NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
13. Dotation is a method of writing or expressing numbers
by characters; and,
S4. Numeration is a method of reading numbers expressed
by characters.
15. Two systems of notation are in general use — the
Human and the Arabic.
NOTE. The Roman Notation is supposed to have been first used
by the Romans; hence its name. The Arabic Notation was intro-
duced into Europe by the Arabs, by whom it was supposed to have
been invented. But investigations have shown that it was adopted by
them about 600 years ago, and that it has been in use among the Hin-
doos more than 2000 years. From this latter fact it is sometimes
called the Indian Notation.
THE ROMAN NOTATION
16. Employs seven capital letters to express numbers,
thus:
Letters, I V X L C D M
Values, one, five, ten, fi-y, hu°d«ed- iJJ™^ ^^
17. The Roman notation is founded upon five principles,
as follows:
1st. Repeating a letter repeats its value. Thus, II repre-
sents two, XX twenty, CCC three hundred.
2d. If a letter of any value be placed after one of greater
value, its value is to be united to that of the greater. Thus,
XI represents eleven, LX sixty, DC six hundred.
3d. If a letter of any value be placed before one of greater
value, its value is to be taken from that of the greater. Thus,
IX represents nine, XL forty, CD four hundred.
Define notation. Numeration. What systems of notation are now
in general use? From what are their names derived? What are used
to express numbers in the Roman notation? What is the value of each?
What is the first principle of combination? Second? Third?
NOTATION AND NUMERATION. 9
4th. If a letter of any value be placed between two letters,
each of greater value, its value is to be taken from the united
value of the other two. Thus, XIV represents fourteen,
XXIX twenty-nine, XCIV ninety-four.
5th. A bar or dash placed over a letter increases its value
one thousand fold. Thus, V signifies five, and V five thou-
sand; L fifty, and L fifty thousand. .

Notz. The system of Roman notation is not well adapted to the
purposes of numerical calculation; it is principally confined to the
numbering of chapters and sections of books, public documents, &c.
Express the following numbers by letters:
1. Eleven. Ans.
2. Fifteen. Ans.
XI.
Fourth? Fifth? Repeat the table. What is the value of LVTI?
CLxxin? xcvni? cdxxxh? xcix? dcxix?

Roman notation now principally confined?
1*
3. Twenty-five.
4. Thirty-nine.
5. Forty-eight.
6. Seventy-seven.
7. One hundred fifty-nine.
8. Five hundred ninety-four.
9. One thousand five hundred thirty-eight.
10. One thousand nine hundred ten.
11. Express the present year.
THE ARABIC NOTATION
18. Employs ten characters or figures to express numbers.
Thus,
Figures, 0123456789
Names and 5 naught onei two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
, f or
values, $ ciphor-
19. The first character is called naught, because it has no
value of its own. The other nine characters are called signif-
icant figures, because each has a value of its own.
20. The significant figures are also called Digits, a word de-
rived from the Latin term digitus, which signifies finger.
21. The naught or cipher is also called nothing, and zero.
The ten Arabic characters are the Alphabet of Arithmetic,
and by combining them according to certain principles, all
numbers can be expressed. We will now examine the most
important of these principles.*
22. Each of the nine digits has a value of its own; hence
any number not greater than 9 can be expressed by one
figure.
* Fractional ami uecimal notation, and the notation of compound numbers, will bo
discussed in their appropriate places.
What are used to express numbers in the Arabic notation? What
U the value of each? What general name is given to the significant
figures? Why? Numbers less than ten, how expressed?
23. As we have no single character to represent ten, we
express it by writing the unit, 1, at the left of the cipher, 0,
thus, 10. In the same manner we represent
2 tens, 3 tens, 4 tens, 5 tens, 6 tens, 7 tens, 8 tens, 9 tens,
or or or or or or or or
twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety,
20; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80; 90.
ii-1. When a number is expressed by two figures, the right
band figure is called units, and the left hand figure tens.
We express the numbers between 10 and 20 by writing
the 1 in the place of tens, with each of the digits respectively
in the place of units. Thus,
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fi-een, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
In like manner we express the numbers between 20 and
30, between 30 and 40, and between any two successive tens.
Thus, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 47, 56, 72, 93.
The greatest number that can be expressed by two figures
is 99.
25. We express one hundred by writing the unit, 1, at the
left hand of two ciphers, or the number 10 at the left hand of
one cipher; thus, 100. In like manner we write two hun-
dred, three hundred, &c., to nine hundred. Thus,
one two three four five six seven eight nine
hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred,
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900.
26. When a number is expressed by three figures, the
right hand figure is called units, the second figure tens, and
the left hand figure hundreds.
As the ciphers have, of themselves, no value, but are always
used to denote the absence of value in the places they occupy,
Tens, how expressed? The right hand figure called what > left
hand figure, what? What is the greatest number that can be expressed
by two figures? One hundred, how expressed? When numbers are
expressed by three figures, what names are given to each?
we express tens and units with hundreds, by writing, in place
of the ciphers, the numbers representing the tens and units.
To express one hundred fifty we write 1 hundred, 5 tens, and
0 units; thus, 150. To express seven hundred ninety-two,
we write 7 hundreds, 9 tens, and 2 units; thus,
1 § I

The greatest number that can be expressed by three figures
is 999.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Write one hundred twenty-five.
2. Write four hundred eighty-three.
3. Write seven hundred sixteen.
4. Express by figures nine hundred.
5. Express by figures two hundred ninety.
6. Write eight hundred nine.
7. Write five hundred five.
8. Write five hundred fifty-seven.
27. We express one thousand by writing the unit, 1, at
the left hand of three ciphers, the number 10 at. the left hand
of two ciphers, or the number 100 at the left hand of one
cipher; thus, 1000. In the same manner we write two
thousand, three thousand, &c., to nine thousand; thus,
one two three four five six seven eight nine
thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand.
1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000.
28. When a number is expressed by four figures, the
places, commencing at the right hand, are units, tens, hundreds,
thousands.
Use of the cipher, what? Greatest number that can be expressed by
three figures? One thousand, how expressed? How many figures
used? Names of each?
To express hundreds, tens, and units with thousands, we
write in each place the figure indicating the number we wish
to express in that place. To write four thousand two hun-
dred sixty-nine, we write 4 in the place of thousands, 2 in the
place of hundreds, 6 in the place of tens, and 9 in the place of
units; thus,
il

The greatest number that can be expressed by four figures
is 9999.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
Express the following numbers by figures : —
1. One thousand two hundred.
2. Five thousand one hundred sixty.
3. Three thousand seven hundred forty-one.
4. Eight thousand fifty-six.
5. Two thousand ninety.
6. Seven thousand nine.
7. One thousand one.
8. Nine thousand four hundred twenty-seven.
9. Four thousand thirty-five.
10. One thousand nine hundred four.
Read the following numbers : —
11. 76; 128; 405; 910; 116; 3416; 1025.
12. 2100; 5047; 7009; 4670; 3997; 1001.
2O. Next to thousands come tens of thousands, and next
to these come hundreds of thousands, as tens and hundreds
come in their order after units. Ten thousand is expressed
by removing the unit, 1, one place to the left of the place
Greatest number expressed by four figures? Tens of thousands, how
expressed? Hundreds of thousands?
of thousands, or by writing it at the left hand of four ci-
phers; thus, 10000; and one hundred thousand is expressed
by removing the unit, I, still one place further to the left, or
by writing it at the left hand of five ciphers; thus, 100000.
We can express thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of
thousands in one number, in the same manner as we express
units, tens, and hundreds in one number. To express five
hundred twenty-one thousand eight hundred three, we write 5 in
the sixth place, counting from units, 2 in the fifth place, 1 in
the fourth place, 8 in the third place, 0 in the second place,
(because there are no tens,) and 3 in the place of units;
thus,

20. 200200; 75620; 90402; 218094; 100101.
For convenience in reading large numbers, we may point
them off, by commas, into periods of three figures each, count-
ing from the right hand or unit figure. This pointing enables
us to read the hundreds, tens, and units in each period with
facility.
3O. Next above hundreds of thousands we have, succes-
sively, units, tens, and hundreds of millions, and then follow
units, tens, and hundreds of each higher name, as seen in the
following
NUMERATION TABLE.

88,765,432,109,876,556,789,012,345
ninth eighth seventh sixth fi-h fourth third second first
period. period* period, period, period, period, period. period, period.
How may figures be pointed off? One million, how expressed?
Next period above millions, what? Give the name of each successive
period.
Note. This is called the French method of pointing off the peri-
ods, and is the one in general use in this country.
31. Figures occupying different places in a number, as
units, tens, hundreds, &c, are said to express different orders
of units.
Simple units are called units of the first order.
Tens "" """ second'"
Hundreds "" """ third"
Thousands "" """fourth"
Tens of thousands"" "« "fifth"
and so on. Thus, 452 contains 4 units of the third order, 5
units of the second order, and 2 units of the first order.
1,030,600 contains 1 unit of the seventh order, (millions,) 3
units of the fifth order, (tens of thousands,) and 6 units of the
third order, (hundreds.)
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
Write and read the following numbers :—
1. One unit of the third order, four of the second.
2. Three units of the fifth order, two of the third, one of the
first.
3. Eight units of the fourth order, five of the second.
4. Two units of the seventh order, nine of the sixth, four
of the third, one of the second, seven of the first.
5. Three units of the sixth order, four of the second.
6. Nine units of the eighth order, six of the seventh, three
of the fifth, seven of the fourth, nine of the first.
7. Four units of the tenth order, six of the eighth, four of
the seventh, two of the sixth, one of the third, five of the sec-
ond.
8. Eight units of the twelfth order, four of the eleventh, six
of the tenth, nine of the seventh, three of the sixth, five of the
fifth, two of the third, eight of the first.
Units of different orders are what?
33. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations, we
derive several important principles, which we will now pre-
sent.
1st. Figures Lave two values, Simple and Local.
The Simple Value of a figure is its value when taken alone;
thus, 2, 5, 8.
The Local Value of a figure is its value when used with an-
other figure or figures in the same number; thus, in 842 the
simple values of the several figures are 8, 4, and 2; but the
local value of the 8 is 800 ; of the 4 is 4 tens, or 40; and of
the 2 is 2 units.
NOTE. When a figure occupies units' place, its simple and local
values are the some.
2d. A digit or figure, if used in the second place, expresses
tens; in the third place, hundreds; in the fourth place, thou-
sands; and so on.
3d. As 10 units make 1 ten, 10 tens 1 hundred, 10 hun-
dreds 1 thousand, and 10 units of any order, or in any place,
make one unit of the next higher order, or in the next place
at the left, \ve readily see that the Arabic method of notation
is based upon the following
TWO GENERAL LAWS.
I. Th: different orders of units increase from right to left,
and decrease from left to right, in a tenfold ratio.
II. Every removal of a figure one place to the left, increases
its local value tenfold; and every removal of a figure one place
to the right, diminishes its local value tenfold.
Thus,
6 is 6 units.
60 is 10 times 6 units.
600 is 10 times 6 tens.
6000 is 10 times 6 hundreds.
60000 is 10 times 6 thousands.
First principle derived? What is the simple value of a figure? Local r
Second principle? Third? First law of Arabic notation? Second?
4th. The local value of a figure depends upon its place from
units of the first order, not upon the value of the figures at the
right of it . Thus, in 425 and 400, the value of the 4 is the
same in both numbers, being 4 units of the third order, or 4
hundred.
NOTE. Care should be taken not to mistake the local value of a
figure for the value of the whole number. For, although the. value of
the 4 (hundreds) is the same in the two numbers, 425 and 400, the value
of the whole of the first number is greater than that of the second.
5th. Every period contains three figures, (units, tens, and
hundreds,) except the left hand period, which sometimes con-
tains only one or two figures, (units, or units and tens.)
33. As we have now analyzed all the principles upon
which the writing and reading of whole numbers depend, we
will present these principles in the form of rules.
RULE FOR NOTATION.
I. Beginning at the left hand, lorite the figures belonging to
the highest period.
II. Write the hundreds, lens, and units of each successive
period in their order, placing a cipher wherever an order of
units is omitted.
RULE FOR NUMERATION.
I. Separate the number into periods of three figures each,
commencing at the right hand. .
II. Beginning at the left hand, read each period separately,
and give the name to each period, except the last, or period
of units.
34. Until the pupil can write numbers readily, it may be
well for him to write several periods of ciphers, point them off.
over each period write its name, thus,
Trillions, Dilliona, Millions, Thousands, Units.
000, 000, 000, 000, 000
Fourth principle? What caution is given? Fifth principle? Rule
for notation? Numeration?
and then write the given numbers underneath, in their appro-
priate places.

MENTAL EXERCISES.
35. 1. Henry gave 5 dollars for" a vest, and 7 dollars for
a coat; how much did he pay for both?
Analysis. He gave as many dollars as 5 dollars and 7 dollars,
which are 12 dollars. Therefore he paid 12 dollars for both.
2. A farmer sold a pig for 3 dollars, and a calf for 8 dol-
lars; how much did he receive for both?
3. A drover bought 5 sheep of one man, 9 of another, and
3 of another; how many did he buy in all?
4. How many are 2 and 6? 2 and 7? 2 and 9? 2 and 8?
2 and 10?
5.~ How many are 4 and 5? 4 and 8? 4 and 7? 4 and 9?

7. How many are 7 and 7? 7 and G? 7 and 8? 7 and 10?
7 and 9?
8. How many are 5 and 4 and G? 7 and 3 and 8? 6 and 9
and 5?
30. From the preceding operations we perceive that
Addition is the process of uniting several numbers of the
same kind into one equivalent number.
37. The Sum or Amount is the result obtained by the
process of additipn.
38. The sign, -)-, is called plus, which signifies more.
When placed between two numbers, it denotes that they are
to be added; thus, 6 -}- 4, shows that 6 and 4 are to be added.
39. The sign, =, is called the sign of equality. When
placed between two numbers, or sets of numbers, it signifies
that they are equal to each other; thus, the expression
6 -}- 4 r= 10, is read 6 plus 4 is equal to 10, and denotes that
the numbers 6 and 4, taken together, equal the number 10.
Define addition. The sum or amount? Sign of addition? Of
equality?
ADDITION. 21
CASE I.
40. When the amount of each column is less
than 10.
1. A farmer sold some hay for 102 dollars, six cows for
162 dollars, and a horse for 125 dollars; how much did he re-
ceive for all?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We arrange the numbers so
4 .^ that units of like order shall stand in the
--i;= same column. We then add the columns
102 separately, for convenience commencing at
162 the right hand, and write each result under
125 the column added. Thus, we have 5 and 2
and 2 are 9, the sum of the units; 2 and 6
Amount, 389 are 8, the sum of the tens; 1 and 1 and I
are 3, the sum of the hundreds. Hence, 'he
entire amount is 3 hundreds 8 tens and 9 units, or 389, the Answer.

9. A drover bought three droves of sheep. The first con-
tained 230, the second 425, and the third 340; how many
sheep did he buy in all? Ans. 99,5.
CASE II.
41. When the amount of any column equals or
exceeds 10.
1. A merchant pays 725 dollars a year for the rent of a
Case I is what? Give explanation. Case II is what?
store, 475 dollars for a clerk, and 367 dollars for other ex-
penses; what is the amount of his expenses?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Arranging the num-
l^a bers as in Case I, we first add the
=11 column of units, and find the sum
725 to be 17 units, which is 1 ten and
475 7 units. We write the 7 units in
367 the place of units, and the 1 ten in
the place of tens. The sum of the
Snm of the nnits, 17 figures in the column of tens is 15
Sum of the tens, 15 tens, which is 1 hundred, and 5
Sum of the hundreds, 14 tens. We write the 5 tens in the
Total amount, 1567 placG of tenS' atld the 1 hun<lred '»
the place of hundreds. We next
add the column of hundreds, and find the sum to be 14 hundreds,
which is 1 thousand and 4 Hundreds. AVe write the 4 hundreds in
the place of hundreds, and 1 thousand in the place of thousands.
Lastly, by uniting the sum of the units with the sums of the tens
and hundreds, we find the total amount to be 1 thousand 5 hundreds
G tens and 7 units, or 1567.
This example may be performed by another method, which
is the common one in practice. Thus:
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Arranging the numbers as before, we
725 add the first column and find the sum to be 17 units;
475 writing the 7 units under the column of units, we add
gg7 the 1 ten to the column of tens, and find the sum to be
16 tens; writing the 6 tens under the column tens, we
1567 a(1d the i hundred to the column of hundreds, and find
the sum to be 15 hundreds; as this is the last column,
we write down its amount, 15; and we have the lekole amount, 1567,
as before.
NOTES. 1. Units of the same order are written in the Fame column;
and when the sum in any column is 10 or more than 10, it producer.
one or more units of a higher order, which must be added to the next
column. This process is sometimes called "carrying the tens."
2. In adding, learn to pronounce the partial results without naming
the numbers separately; thus, instead of saying 7 and 5 are 12, and
6 are 17, simply pronounce the results, 7, 12, 17, &c.
Give explanation. Second explanation. What is meant by carry-
Ing the tens?
. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following
KULE. I. Write the numbers to be added so that all the units
of the same order shall stand in the same column; that is, units
under units, tens under tens, fyc.
II. Commencing at units, add each column separately, and
write the sum underneath, if it be less than ten.
III. Jf the sum of any column be ten or more than ten, write
the unit figure only, and add the ten or tens to the next column.
IV. Write the entire sum of the last column.
PROOF. 1st. Begin with the right hand or unit column, and
add the figures in each column in an opposite direction from
that in which they were first added; if the two results agree,
the work is supposed to be right. Or,
2d. Separate the numbers added into two sets, by a hori-
zontal line; find the sum of each set separately; add these
sums, and if the amount be the same as that first obtained, the
work is presumed to be correct.
NOTE. By the methods of proof here given, the numbers are united
in new combinations, which render it almost impossible for two pre-
cisely similar mistakes to occur.
The first method is the one commonly used in businesj.

SUBTRACTION. 29
47. The Difference or Remainder is the result obtained
by the process of subtraction.
Note. The minuend and subtrahend must be like numbers; thus,
5 dollars from 9 dollars leave 4 dollars; 5 apples from 9 apples leave 4
apples; but it would be absurd to say o apples from 9 dollars, or a
dollars from 9 apples.
48. The sign, —, is called minus, which signifies less.
When placed between two numbers, it denotes that the one
after it is to be taken from the one before it. Thus, 8 — 6 = 2
is read 8 minus 6 equals 2, and denotes that 6, the subtrahend,
taken from 8, the minuend, equals 2, the remainder.

Remainder, 251 the right hand, we subtract separately
each figure of the subtrahend from the

difference of the units; 2 from 7 leaves 5, the difference of the tens;
3 from 5 leaves 2, the difference of the hundreds. Hence, we have
for the whole difference, 2 hundreds 5 tens and 1 unit, or 251.

50. When any figure in the subtrahend is greater
than the corresponding figure in the minuend.
1. From 846 take 359.
Analysis. In this example we
cannot take 9 units from 6 units.
From the 4 tens we take 1 ten, which
equals 10 units, and add to the 6
units, making 16 units; 9 units from
16 units leave 7 units, which we
write in the remainder in units' place. As we have taken 1 ten
from the 4 tens, 3 tens only are left. We cannot take 5 tens from
3 tens; so from the 8 hundreds we take 1 hundred, which equals 10
tens, and add to the 3 tens, making 13 tens; 5 tens from 13
tens leave 8 tens, which we write in the remainder in tens' place.
As we have taken 1 hundred from the 8 hundreds, 7 hundreds only
are left; 3 hundreds from 7 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, which we
write in the remainder in hundreds' place, and we have the whole
remainder, 487.
Note. The numbers written over the minuend are used simply to
explain more clearly th* method of subtracting; in practice the pro-
cess should be performed mentally, and these numbers omitted.
The following method is more in accordance with prac-
tice.
operation. Analysis. Since we cannot take 9 units from 6
I^J units, we add 10 units to 6 units, making 16 units;
Sis 9 units from 16 units leave 7 units. But as we have
"46 added 10 units, or 1 ten, to the minuend, we shall
359 have a remainder 1 ten too large, to avoid which, we
ioy add 1 ten to the 5 tens in the subtrahend, making 6
tens. We can not take 6 tens from 4 tens; so we add
10 tens to 4, making 14 tens; 6 tens from 14 tens
leave 8 tens. Now, having added 10 tens, or 1 hundred, to the
minuend, we shall have a remainder 1 hundred too large, unless we
add 1 hundred to the 3 hundreds in the subtrahend, making 4 hun-
dreds; 4 hundreds from 8 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, and we have
for the total remainder, 487, the same as before.
Case U is what? Give explanation. Second explanation.

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
Note. The process of adding 10 to the minuend is sometimes called
borrowing 10, and that of adding 1 to the next figure of the subtrahend,
carrying one.
51. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
have the following general
Rule. I. Write the less number under (lie greater, placing
units of the same order in the same column.
II. Begin at the right hand, and lake each figure of the sub-
trahend from the figure above it, and write the result under-
neath.
III. If any figure in the subtrahend be greater than the cor-
responding figure above it. add 10 to that upper figure be-
fore subtracting, and then add 1 to the next left hand figure of
the subtrahend.
Proof. Add the remainder to the subtrahend, and if their
sum be equal to the minuend, the work is supposed to be right.

54L. Multiplication is the process of taking one of two
given numbers as many times as there are units in the other.
55. The Multiplicand is the number to be taken.
56. The Multiplier is the number which shows how
many times the multiplicand is to be taken.
57. The Product is the result obtained by the process of
multiplication.
58. The Factors are the multiplicand and multiplier.
Notes. 1. Factors are producers, and the multiplicand and mul-
tiplier are called factors because they produce the product.
2. Multiplication is a short method of performing addition when
the numbers to be added are equal.
59. The sign, X, placed between two numbers, denotes
that they are to be multiplied together; thus 9 X G = 54, is
read 9 times 6 equals 54.

CASE I.
60. When the multiplier consists of one figure. •
1. Multiply 374 by 6.
Analysis. In this example it i?
required to take 374 six times. If we
take the units of each order 6 times,
we shall take the entire number 6
times. Therefore, writing the multi-
plier under the unit figure of the mul-
tiplicand, we proceed as follows: 6
times 4 units are 24 units; 6 times 7
tens are 42 tens; 6 times 3 hundreds
are 18 hundreds; and adding these
partial products, we obtain the entire
product, 2244.

The operation in this example may be performed in another

OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Writing the numbers as before, we
374 begin at the right hand or unit figure, and say: 6
P times 4 units are 24 units, which is 2 tens and 4
• wiits; write the 4 units in the product in units'
2244 place, and reserve the 2 tens to add to the next prod-
uct; 6 times 7 tens are 42 tens, and the two tens re-
served in the last product added, are 44 tens, which is 4 hundreds
and 4 tens; write the 4 tens in the product in tens' place, and reserve
the 4 hundreds to add to the next product; 6 times 3 hundreds are
18 hundreds, and 4 hundreds added are 22 hundreds, which, being
written in the product in the places of hundreds and thousands,
gives, for the entire product, 2244.
01. The unit value of a number is not changed by re-
peating the number. As the multiplier always expresses
times, the product must have the same unit value as the mul-
tiplicand. But, since the product of any two numbers will be
the same, whichever factor is taken as a multiplier, either
factor may be taken for the multiplier or multiplicand.
NOTE. In multiplying, learn to pronounce the partial results, as in
addition, without naming the numbers separately; thus, in the last
example, instead of saying 6 times 4 are 24, 6 times 7 are 42 and 2 to
carry are 44, 6 times 3 are 18 and 4 to carry are 22, pronounce only
the results, 24, 44, 22, performing the operations mentally, This will
greatly facilitate the process of multiplying.

Case I. We then multiply by the 2 tens. 2 tens times 6 units, or 6

2 tens under the tens figure in the product already obtained, and add
the 1 hundred to the next hundreds produced. 2 tens times 4 tens
are 8 hundreds, and the 1 hundred of the last product added are 9
hundreds; we write the 9 in hundreds' place in the product. 2 tens

times 7 hundreds are 14 thousands, equal to 1 ten thousand and 4
thousands, which \ve write in their appropriate places in the product.
Then adding the two products, we have the entire product, 17158.
NOTES. 1. When the multiplier contains two or more figures, the
several results obtained by multiplying by each figure are called partial
products.
2. When there are ciphers between the significant figures of the
multiplier, pass over them, and multiply by the significant figures only.
63. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following general
RULE. I. Write the multiplier under the multiplicand,placing
units of the same order tinder each other.
II. Multiply the multiplicand by each figure of the multi-
plier successively, beginning with the unit figure, and write the
first figure of each partial product under the figure of the mul-
tiplier used, writing down and carrying as in addition.
III. If there are partial products, add them, and their sum
will be the product required.
64. PROOF. 1. Multiply the multiplier by the multipli-
cand, and if the product is. the same as the first result, the
work is correct. Or,
2. Multiply the multiplicand by the multiplier diminished
by 1, and to the product add the multiplicand; if the sum be
the same as the product by the whole of the multiplier, the
work is correct.

CONTRACTIONS.
CASE I.
65. When Iho multiplier is a composite mimber.
A Composite Number is one that may be produced by
multiplying together two or more numbers; thus, 18 is a com-
posite number, since 6 X 3 = 18; or, 9 X 2 = 18 • or, 3 X
aX 2 = 18.
66. The Component Factors of a number are the sev-
eral numbers which, multiplied together, produce the given
number; thus, the component factors of 20 are 10 and 2,
(10 X 2 = 20 ;) or, 4 and 5, (-1 X 5 = 20 ;) or, 2 and 2 and
5, (2 X 2 X 5 = 20.)
Note. The pupil.must not confound the factors with the ports of a
numbir. Thus, the factors of which 12 is composed, arc 4 and 3,
(IX 3= 12 ;) whde the parts of which 12 is composed are 8 and 4,

68. When the multiplier is 10, 100, 1000, &c.
If we annex a cipher to the multiplicand, each figure is re-
moved one place toward the left, and consequently the value of
the whole number is increased tenfold, (33.) If two ciphers
are annexed, each figure is removed two places toward the
left, and the value of the number is increased one hundred
fold; and every additional cipher increases the value tenfold.

one number is contained in another.
73. The Dividend is the number to be divided.
74:. The Divisor is the number to divide by.
75. The Quotient is the result obtained by the process of
division, and shows how many timed the divisor is contained
in the dividend.
NOTES. 1. When thed .vidend does not contain the divisor an exact
number of times, the part of the dividend left is called the remainder,
and it must be less than the" divisor.
2. As the remainder is always a part of the dividend, it is always
of the same name or kind.
3. When there is no remainder the division is said to be complete.
7C. The sign, -H, placed between two numbers, denotes
division, and shows that the number on the left is to be divided
by the number on the right. Thus, 20 -j- 4 = 5, is read, 20
divided by 4 is equal to 5.
Division is also indicated by writing the dividend above, and
12
the divisor below a short horizontal line; thus, — — 4, shows
that 12 divided by 3 equals 4.

!! then 6 is contained in 2 tens no times, and we write

units together, 6 is contained in 24 units 4 units times, which wo
write in units' place in the quotient, and we have 304 for the entirs

4. How many times is 4 contained in 943?

make 23 units; 4 in 23 units 5 units times and 3 units over. The
3 which is left after performing the division, should be divided by 4;
but the method of doing it cannot be explained until we reach
Fractions; so we merely indicate the division by placing the divisor
under the dividend, thus, -|. The entire quotient is written 235|,
which may be read, two hundred thirty-five and three divided by
four, or, two hundred thirty-five and a remainder of three.
From the foregoing examples and illustrations, we deduce

II. Beginning at the left hand, divide each figure of the

dend.
III. If there be a remainder after dividing any figure, re-
gard it as prefixed to the figure of the next lower order in the
dividend, and divide as before.
IV. Should any figure or part of the dividend be less than
the divisor, write a cipher in the quotient, and prefix the num-
ber to the figure of the next lower order in the dividend, and
divide as before.
V. If there be a remainder after dividing the last figure,
place it over the divisor at the right hand of the quotient.
PROOF. Multiply the divisor and quotient together, and to
the product add the remainder, if any; if the result be equal
to the dividend, the work is correct.
NOTES. 1. This method of proof depends on the fact that division is
the reverse of multiplication. The dividend answers to the product, the
iimsor to one of the factors, and the quotient to the other.
2. In multiplication the two factors are given, to find the product:
in division, the product and one of the factors are given to find the
other factor.

CASE II.
78. When the divisor consists of two or more figures.
Note. To illustrate more clearly the method of operation, we will
first take an example usually performed by Short Division.
Case II is what}
1. How many times is 8 contained in 2528?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. As 8 is not contained in 2 thou-
8 ) 2528 f 316 sands, we take 2 and 5 as one number, and con-
-. sider how many times 8 is contained in this
partial dividend, 25 hundreds; and find that it
12 is contained 3 hundreds times, and a remainder.
8 To find this remainder, we multiply the divisor,
~~7T 8, by the quotient figure, 3 hundreds, and sub-
° tract the product, 24 hundreds, from the par-
48 ^ dividend, 25 hundreds, and there remains
1 hundred. To this remainder we bring down
the 2 tens of the dividend, and consider the 12 tens a second partial
dividend. Then, 8 is contained in 12 tens 1 ten time and a remain-
der; 8 multiplied by 1 ten produces 8 tens, which, subtracted from
12 tens, leave 4 tens. To this remainder we bring down the 8 units,
and consider the 48 units the third partial dividend. Then,8 is con-
tained in 48 units 6 units times. Multiplying and subtracting as
before, we find that nothing remains, and we have for the entire
quotient, 316.
2. How many tirnes is 23 contained in 4807?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first find how
Divisor. Divid.d. Quotient. many times 23 is contained in 48,
23 ) 4807 ( 209 the first partial dividend, and place
46 the result in the quotient on ths
right of the dividend. We then
multiply the divisor, 23, by tho
^"' quotient figure, 2, and subtract the
produc.t, 46, from the part of ths
dividend used, and to the remainder bring down the next figure of
the dividend, which is 0, making 20, for the second partial dividend.
Then, since 23 is contained in 20 no times, we place a cipher in the
quotient, and bring down the next figure of the dividend, making a
third partial dividend, 207; 23 is contained in 207, 9 times; multi-
plying and subtracting as before, nothing remains, and we have for
the entire quotient, 209.
NOTES. 1. When the process of dividing is performed mentally, and
the results only are written, as in Case I, the operation is termed Short
Division.
2. When the whole process of division is written, the operation is
termed Long Division.
Give first explanation. Second. What is long division? What is
short division? When is each used?
3. Short Division is generally used when the divisor is a number
that will allow the process of dividing to be performed mentally.
From the preceding illustrations we derive the following
general
RULE. I. Write the divisor at the left of the dividend, as
in short division.
II. Divide the least number of the left hand figures in the
dividend that will contain the divisor one or more times, and
place the quotient at the right of the dividend, with a line be-
tween them.
III. Multiply the divisor by this quotient figure, subtract
the product from the partial dividend used, and to the remain-
der bring down the next figure of the dividend.
IV. Divide as before, until all the figures of the dividend
have been brought down and divided.
V. If any partial dividend will not contain the divisor,
place a cipher in the quotient, and bring down the next figure
of the dividend, and divide as before.
VI. If there be a remainder after dividing all the figures of
the dividend, it must be written in the quotient, with the divi-
sor underneath.
NOTES. 1. If any remainder be equal to, or greater than the divisor,
the quotient figure is too small, and must be increased.
2. If the product of the divisor by the quotient figure be greater
than the partial dividend, the quotient figure is too large, and must be
diminished.
79. PROOF. 1. The same as in short division. Or,
2. Subtract the remainder, if any, from the dividend, and
divide the difference by the quotient; if the result be the same
as the given divisor, the work is correct.

operation. Analysis. If 3270 dollars be divided

as many dollars as 30 is contained times in
6)654 327o dollars. 30 may be resolved into the
109 Ans. factors 5 and 6; and we may suppose the 30
men divided into 5 groups of 6 men each;
dividing the 3270 dollars by 5, the number of groups, we have
654, the number of dollars to be given to each group; and dividing
the 654 dollars by 6, the number of men in each group, we have
109, the number of dollars that each man will receive. Hence,
Rule. Divide the dividend by one of the factors, and the

Analysis. Divid-
ing 1143 by 2, we
have a quotient of
571, and a remainder
of 1 undivided, which,
being a part of the
given dividend, must
also be a part of the
true remainder. The
571 being a quotient arising from dividing by 2, its units are
2 times as great in value as the units of the given dividend, 1143.
Dividing the 571 by 8, we have a quotient of 71, and a remainder
of 3 undivided. As this 3 is a part of the 571, it must be multiplied
by 2 to change it to the same kind of units as the 1. This makes a
true remainder of 6 arising from dividing by 8. Dividing the 71 by
4, we have a quotient of 17, and a remainder of 3 undivided. This
3 is a part of the 71, the units of which are 8 times as great in value
as those of the 571, and the units of the 571 are 2 times as great
in value as those of the given dividend, 1143; therefore, to change
this last remainder, 3, to units of the same value as the dividend,
we multiply it by 8 and 2, and obtain a true remainder of 48 arising
from dividing by 4. Adding the three partial remainders, we obtain
55, the true remainder. Hence,
Rule. I. Multiply each partial remainder, except the first,
by all the preceding divisors.
II. Add the several products with the first remainder, and
the sum will be the true remainder.

one place toward the right, and, consequently, the value of each is
diminished tenfold, or divided by 10, (32.)
For similar reasons, if we cut off two figures, we divide by
100, if three, we divide by 1000, and so on. Hence the

mainder. But this remainder consists of the last remainder, 5, pre-
fixed to the figures 16, cut off from the dividend. Hence,
85. When there is a remainder after dividing by the sig-

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIVISION.
86. The quotient in Division depends upon the relative
values of the dividend and divisor. Hence any change in the
value of either dividend or divisor must produce a change in
the value of the quotient. But some changes may be produced
upon both dividend and divisor, at the same Vime, that
will not affect the quotient. The laws which govern these
changes are called General Principles of Division, which we
will now examine.
I. 54H-9 = 6.
If we multiply the dividend by 3, we have
54 X 3 4- 9 = 162 4- 9 = 18,
and 18 equals the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence,
Multiplying the dividend by any number, multiplies the quotient
by the same number.
II. Using the same example, 54 -±- 9 = 6.
If we divide the dividend by 3 we have
V -T- 9 = 18 -H 9 = 2>
and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Dividing the
dividend by any number, divides the quotient by the samp
number.
III. If we multiply the divisor by 3, we have
54 _i. 9 X 3 = 54 4- 27 = 2,
and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Multiplying
the divisor by any number, divides the quotient by the same
number.
V. If we divide the divisor by 3, we have
54 -H § = 54 4- 3 = 18,
Upon what does the value of the quotient depend? What is the
first general principle of division 8 Second? Third? Fourth t
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIVISION. 65
and 18 = the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence, Dividing
the divisor by any number, multiplies the quotient by the same
number.
V. If we multiply both dividend and divisor by 3, we have
54 X 3 -H 9 X 3 = 162 H- 27 = 6.
Hence, Multiplying both dividend and divisor by the same num-
ber, does not alter the value of the quotient.
VI. If we divide both dividend and divisor by 3, we have
V-7- |=18-t-8 = 6.
Hence, Dividing both dividend and divisor by the same num-
ber, does not alter the value of the quotient.
87. These six examples illustrate all the different changes
we ever have occasion to make upon the dividend and divisor
in practical arithmetic. The principles upon which these
changes are based may be stated as follows:
Prin. I. Multiplying the dividend multiplies the quotient;
and dividing the dividend divides the quotient. (86. I and II.)
Prin. II. Multiplying the divisor divides the quotient; and
dividing the divisor multiplies the quotient. (8G. Ill and IV.)
Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both dividend and
divisor by the same number, does not alter the quotient. (86.
V and VI.)
88. These three principles may be embraced in one
-
GENERAL LAW.
A change in the dividend produces a like change in the
quotient; but a change in the divisor produces an opposite
change in the quotient.
Note. If a number be multiplied and the product divided by the
same number, the quotient will be equal to the number multiplied.
Thus, 15X4 = 60, and 60 -H 4 = 15.

EXACT DIVISORS.
S9-, An Exact Divisor of a number is one that gives
k whole number for a quotient.
As it is frequently desirable to know if a number has an exact
divisor, we will present a few directions that will be of assistance,
particularly in finding exact divisors of large numbers.
NOTE. A number whose unit figure is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is called an
Even Number. And a number whose unit figure is 1, 3, 5, 7- or 9, is
called an Odd Number.
2 is an exact divisor of all even numbers.
4 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the tens
and units of a number. Thus, 4 is an exact divisor of 268,
756, 1284.
5 is an exact divisor of every number whose unit figure is
0 or 5. Thus, 5 is an exact divisor of 20, 955, and 2840.
8 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the hun-
dreds, tens, and units of a number. Thus, 8 is an exact
divisor of 1728, 5280, and 213560.
9 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the sum of
the digits of a number. Thus, in 2486790, the sum of the
digits 2 + 4+8 +6.+ 7+9 + 0 = 36, and 36 -=- 9 = 4.
10 is an exact divisor when 0 occupies units' place.
100 when 00 occupy the places of units and tens.
1000 when 000 occupy the places of units, tens, and hun-
dreds, &c.
A composite number is an exact divisor of any number,
when all its factors are exact divisors of the same number.
Thus, 2, 2, and 3 are exact divisors of 12; and so also are 4
(=2X2) and 6 (= 2 X 3).
An even number is not an exact divi=or of an odd number.
If an odd number is an exact divisor of an even number,
What is an exact divisor? What is an even number? An odd num-
ber? When is 2 an exact divisor? 4? 5? 9? 10? 100 > 1000?
When .is a composite number an exact divisor? An even number is
not an exact divisor of what? An odd number is on exact divisor of
what?
FACTORING NUMBERS.

twice that odd number is also an exact divisor of the even
number. Thus, 7 is an exact divisor of 42; so also is 7 X 2,
or 14.

1. What are the prime factors of 2772?
operation. Analysis. We divide the given number by
2. the least prime factor, and the result by 2;
this gives an odd number for a quotient, divisible
by the prime factor, 3, and the quotient resulting
from this division is also divisible by 3. The
n :xt quotient, 77, we divide by its ieast prime
factor, 7, and we obtain the quotient 11; this be-
ing a prime number, the division can not be car-
ried further. The divisors and last quotient, 2,
2, 3, 3, 7, and 11 are all the prime factors of the
I | given number, 2772. Hence the
Rule. Divide the given number by any prime factor; di-
vide the quotient in the same manner, and so continue the
division until the quotient is a prime number. The several
divisors and the last quotient will be the prime factors required.
Proof. The product of all the prime factors will be tha
given number.

CANCELLATION.
93. Cancellation is the process of rejecting equal factors
from numbers sustaining to each other the relation of dividend
and divisor.
It has been shown (77) that the dividend is equal to the
product of the divisor multiplied by the quotient. Hence, if
the dividend can be resolved into two factors, one of which is
the divisor, the other factor will be the quotient.
1. Divide 63 by 7.
operation. Analysis. We see in
DiTisor, <jtyjt X 9 Dividend. this example that 63 is
composed of the factors 7
9 Quotient. and o,, and tnat the factor
7 is equal to the divisor.
Therefore we reject the factor 7, and the remaining factor, 9, is the
quotient.

it based r Give first explanation.
94. Whenever the dividend and divisor are each composite
numbers, the factors common to both may first be rejected
without altering the final result. (875 Prin. III.)

7 X 48 # X 0 X # eration to be
performed by
writing the numbers which constitute the dividend above a line, and
those which constitute the divisor below it. Instead of multiplying
24 by 56, in the dividend, we resolve 24 into the factors 4 and 6,
and 56 into the factors 7 and 8; and 48 in the divisor into the fac-
tors 6 and 8. We next cancel the factors 6, 7, and 8, which are
common to the dividend and divisor, and we have left the factor 4
in the dividend, which is the quotient.
Note. When all the factors or numbers in the dividend are can-
celed, 1 should be retained.
95. If any two numbers, one in the dividend and one in
the divisor, contain a common factor, we may reject that factor.
3. In 54 times 77, how many times G3?
operation. Analysis. In this example we see that 9 will
6 11 divide 54 and 63; so we reject 9 as a factor of 54,
*j -f-i and retain the factor 6, and also as a factor of 63,
pfl X // and reta;n the factor 7. Again, 7 will divide 7 in
$tf the divisor, and 77 in the dividend. Dividing
rf both numbers by 7, 1 will be retained in the
divisor, and 11 in the dividend. Finally, the
product of 6 X 11 = 66, the quotient.

and we have remaining the factor 7 in the divisor, and the factors 5 and
4 in the dividend. Completing the work, we have ty r= 28, Aw.
From the preceding examples and illustrations we derive
the following
RULE. I. Write the numbers composing the dividend above
a horizontal line, and the numbers composing the divisor
below it.
II. Cancel all the factors common to both dividend and
divisor.
III. Divide the product of the remaining factors of the div-
idend by the product of the remaining factors of the divisor,
and the result will be the quotient.
NOTES. 1. Rejecting a factor from any number is dividing the number
by that factor.
2. When a factor is canceled, the unit, 1, is supposed to take its
place.
3. One factor in the dividend will cancel only one equal factor in the
divisor.
4. If all the factors or numbers of the divisor are canceled, the
product of the remaining factors of the dividend will be the quotient.
5. By many it is thought more convenient to write the factors of
the dividend on the right of a vertical line, and the factors of the divisor
on the left.

will exactly divide each of the given
numbers, and that 7 will exactly
divide each of the resulting quo-
tients. Hence, each of the given
numbers can be exactly divided by 3
™ X ' — 21, Ans. times 7; and these numbers must be
component factors of the greatest
common divisor. Now, if there were any other component factor of
the greatest common divisor, the quotients, 2,3, 5, would be exactly
divisible by it. But these quotients are prime to each other Hence
3 and 7 are all the component factors of the greatest common divisor
sought.
3. What is the greatest common divisor of 28,140, and 280?
operation. Analysis. We first divide by 4;
then the quotients by 7. The re-
sulting quotients, 1, 5, and 10, are
prime to each other. Hence 4 and
7 are all the component factors of
the greatest common divisor.
4 X 7 = 28, Ans.
From these examples and analyses we derive the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers in a line, with a vertical line
at the left, and divide by any factor common to all the numbers.

1. What is the greatest common divisor of 84 and 203?
ANALYSIS. We draw two vertical
lines, and place the larger number on
the right, and the smaller number on
the left, one line lower down. We
then divide 203, the larger number, by
84, the smaller, and write 2, the quo-
tient, between the verticals, the prod-
uct, 168, opposite, under the greater
number, and the remainder, 35, below.
We next divide 84 by this remainder,
writing the quotient, 2, between the verticals, the product, 70, on the
left, and the new remainder, 14, below the 70. We again divide the
last divisor, 35, by 14, and obtain 2 for a quotient, 28 for a product,
and 7 for a remainder, all of which we write in the same order as in
the former steps. Finally, dividing the last divisor, 14, by the last
remainder, 7, and we have no remainder. 7, the last divisor, is the
greatest common divisor of the given numbers.
In order to show that the last divisor in such a process is
the greatest common divisor, we will first trace the work in the
reverse order, as indicated by the arrow line below.
OPERATION.
7 divides the 14, as proved
by the last division; it will
also divide two times 14, or 28,
(I.) Now, as 7 divides both
itself and 28, it will divide 35,
their sum, (II.) It will also
divide 2 times 35, or 70, (I;)
and since it is a common
divisor of 70 and 14, it must
divide their sum, 84, which
is one of the given numbers,
(II.) It will also divide 2
times 84, or 168, (I;) and
since it is a common divisor of 168 and 35, it must divide their
sum, 203, the larger number, (II.) Hence 7 is a common divisor
of the given numbers.
Again, tracing the work in the direct order, as indicated below, we

203

Give analysis.
know that the greatest common divisor, -whatever it be, must divide
^ 2 times 84, or 168, (I.) Then
203 since it will divide both 168
and 203, it must divide their
84
70
14
Ifi8 difference, 35, (III.) It will
also divide 2 times 35, or 70,
(I ;) and as it will divide both
35 70 and 84, it must divide their
difference, 14, (III.) It will
28
also divide 2 times 14 or 28,
(I;) and as it will divide both
28 and 35, it must divide their
difference, 7, (III;) hence, it
cannot be greater than 7.
Thus we have shown,
1st. That 7 is a common divisor of the given numbers.
2d. That their greatest common divisor, whatever it be,
cannot be greater than 7. Hence it must be 7.
From this example and analysis, we derive the following
RULE. I. Draw two verticals, and write the two numbers,
one on each side, the greater number one line above the less.
II. Divide the greater number by the less, writing the quo-
tient between the verticals, the product under the dividend, and
the remainder below.
III. Divide the less number by the remainder, the last divisor
by the last remainder, and so on, till nothing remains. The
last divisor will be the greatest common divisor sought.
IV. If more than two numbers be given, first find the greatest
common divisor of two of them, and then of this divisor and one
of the remaining numbers, and so on to the last; the last common
divisor found will be the greatest common divisor of all the
given numbers.
NOTES. 1 . When more than two numbers are given, it is better to
begin with the least two.

FIRST METHOD.
From the nature of prime numbers we derive the follow-
ing principles: —
I. If a number exactly contain another, it will contain all
the prime factors of that number.
II. If a number exactly contain two or more numbers, it
will also contain all the prime factors of those numbers.
III. The least number that will exactly contain all the
prime factors of two or more numbers, is the least common
multiple of those numbers.

factors of 30 except the factor 5. Annexing 5 to the series of factors,
2X3X 13 X 11 X 7X5,
and we have all the prime factors of each of the given numbers; and
hence the product of the series of factors is a common multiple of
the given numbers, (II.) And as no factor of this series can be
omitted without omitting a factor of one of the given numbers, the
product of the series is the least common multiple of the given
numbers, (III.)
From this example and analysis we deduce the following
RULE. I. Resolve the given numbers into their prime factors.
II. Take all the prime factors of the largest number, and
such prime factors of the other numbers as are not found in the
largest number, and their product will be the least common
multiple.
NOTE. When a prime factor is repeated in any of the given numbers,
it must be used as many times, as a factor of the multiple, as the
greatest number of times it appears in any of the given numbers.

OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first write
4 .. 6 .. S .. 12 fae given numbers in a series,
with a vertical line at the left.
Since 2 is a factor of some of
2..3..9.. 6
3 the given numbers, it must be
- a factor of the least common
multiple sought. Dividing as
2X2X3X3= 36, Ans. manv of *p numbers as are
divisible by 2, we write the
quotients and the undivided number, 9, in a line underneath. We
now perceive that some of the numbers in the second line contain
the factor 2; hence the least common multiple must contain another
'2, and we again divide by 2, omitting to write down any quotient
when it is 1. We next divide by 3 for a like reason, and still again
by 3. By this process we have transferred all the factors of each
of the numbers to the left of the vertical; and their product, 36,
must be the least common multiple sought, (1O4, III.)
2. What is the least common multiple of 10, 12,15, and 75?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Weread-
6.. 3.. 15
10 . . 12 .. 15 .. 75 ily see that 2 and 5 are
among the factors of the
given numbers, and must
be factors of the least

2X5X2X3X5 = 300, Ans. we divide number

5
that is divisible by either of these factors or by their product; thus,
we divide 10 by both 2 and 5; 12 by 2; 15 by 5; and 75 by 5.
We next divide the second line in like manner by 2 and 3; and
afterwards the third line by 5. By this process we collect the
factors of the given numbers into groups; and the product of the
factors at the left of the vertical is the least common multiple sought.

Analysis. In this oper-
ation we omit the 6 and 35,
because they are exactly con-
tained in some of the other
3X7X2X5 = 210, Ans. given numbers; thus, 6 is
contained in 42, and 35 in
70; and whatever will contain 42 and 70 must contain 6 and 35.
Hence we have only to find the least common multiple of the re-
maining numbers, 15, 42, and 70.
From these examples we derive the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers in a line, omitting any of the
smaller numbers that are factors of the larger, and draw a
vertical line at the left.
II. Divide by any prime factor, or factors, that may be con-
tainedin one or more of the given numbers, and write the quotients
and undivided numbers in a line underneath, omitting the Vs.
III. In like manner divide the quotients and undivided num-
bers, and continue the process till all the factors of the given
numbers have been transferred to the left of the vertical. Then
multiply these factors together, and their product will be the least
common multiple required.

CLASSIFICATION OF NUMBERS.
Numbers may be classified as follows:
106. I. As Even and Odd.
107. II. As Prime and Composite.
What is the first classification of numbers? What is an even num-
ber? An odd number? Second classification? A prime number}
A composite number?
CLASSIFICATION OF NUMBERS. 85
108. III. As Integral and Fractional.
An Integral Number, or Integer, expresses whole things.
Thus, 281; 78 boys; 1000 books.
A Fractional Number, or Fraction, expresses equal parts
of a thing. Thus, half a dollar; three-fourths of an hour;
seven-eighths of a mile.
100. IV. As Abstract and Concrete.
110. V. As Simple and Compound.
A Simple Number is either an abstract number, or a
concrete number of but one denomination. Thus, 48, 926;
48 dollars, 926 miles.
A Compound Number is a concrete number whose value is
expressed in two or more different denominations. Thus, 32
dollars 15 cents; 15 days 4 hours 25 minutes; 7 miles 82
rods 9 feet 6 inches.
111. VI. As Like and Unlike.
Like Numbers are numbers of the same unit value.
If simple numbers, they must be all abstract, as 6, 62, 487;
or all of one and the same denomination, as 5 apples, 62 ap-
ples, 487 apples; and, if compound numbers, they must be
used to express the same kind of quantity, as time, distance,
&c. Thus, 4 weeks 3 days 16 hours; 1 week 6 days 9
hours; 5 miles 40 rods; 2 miles 100 rods.
Unlike Numbers are numbers of different unit values. Thus,
75, 140 dollars, and 28 miles; 4 hours 30 minutes, and 5
bushels 1 peck.
What is the third classification? What is an integral number? A
fractional number? What is the fourth classification? An abstract
number? A concrete number? What is the fifth classification? A
simple number? A compound number? Sixth classification? What
are like numbers? Unlike numbers?

DEFINITIONS, NOTATION, AND NUMERATION.
112. If a unit be divided into 2 equal parts, one of the
parts is called one half.
If a unit be divided into 3 equal parts, one of the parts is
called one third, two of the parts two thirds.
If a unit be divided into 4 equal parts, one of the parts is
called one fourth, two of the parts two fourths, three of the
parts three fourths.
If a unit be divided into 5 equal parts, one of the parts is
called one fifth, two of the parts two fifths, three of the parts
three fifths, Sec.
The parts are expressed by figures; thus,
One half is written
One third"
Two thirds"
One fourth"
Two fourths"
Three fourths"
One fifth is written -j
Two fifths " |
One seventh " f
Three eighths" f
Five ninths " f
Eight tenths " •&
Hence we see that the parts into which a unit is divided take
their name, and their value, from the number of equal parts
into which the unit is divided. Thus, if we divide an orange
into 2 equal parts, the parts are called halves; if into 3 equal
parts, thirds; if into 4 equal parts, fourths, &c.; and each
third is less in value than each half, and each fourth less than
each third; and the greater the number of parts, the less
their value.
When a unit is divided into any number of equal parts, one
or more such parts is a fractional part of the whole number,
and is called a fraction. Hence
1156. A Fraction is one or more of the equal parts of a
unit.
Define a fraction.
87
To write a fraction, two integers are required, one
to express the number of parts into which the whole number
is divided, and the other to express the number of these parts
taken. Thus, if one dollar be divided into 4 equal parts,
the parts are called fourths, and three of these parts are
called three fourths of a dollar. This three fourths may be
written
3 the number of parts taken.
4 the number of parts into which the dollar is divided.
115. The Denominator is the number below the line.
It denominates or names the parts; and
It shows how many parts are equal to a unit.
116. The Numerator is the number above the line.
It numerates or numbers the parts; and
It shows how many parts are taken or expressed by
the fraction.
liy. The Terms of a fraction are the numerator and de-
nominator, taken together.
118. Fractions indicate division, the numerator answering
to the dividend, and the denominator to the divisor. Hence,
A119. The Value of a fraction is the quotient of the nu-
merator divided by the denominator.
ISO. To analyze a fraction is to designate and describe
its numerator and denominator. Thus, f is analyzed as fol-
lows : —
4 is the denominator, and shows that the unit is divided
into 4 equal parts; it is the divisor.
3 is the numerator, and shows that 3 parts are taken; it is
the dividend, or integer divided.
3 and 4 are the terms, considered as dividend and divisor.
The value of the fraction is the quotient of 3 -=- 4, or £.

121. Fractions are distinguished as Proper and Improper.
A Proper Fraction is one whose numerator is less than its
denominator; its value is less than the unit, 1. Thus, ^i, -fa,
•f-y, Jf are proper fractions.
An Improper Fraction is one whose numerator equals or
exceeds its denominator; its value is never less than the
unit, 1. Thus, ^, §, -\$-, 3f-, £g, J^Q. are improper fractions.
132. A Mixed Number is a number expressed by an in-
teger and a fraction; thus, 4^, 17£f, 9^ aro mixed numbers.
123. Since fractions indicate division, all changes in the
terms of a fraction will affect the value of that fraction according
to the laws of division; and we have only to modify the lan-
guage of the General Principles of Division (87) by substi-

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF FRACTIONS.
124. PRIN. I. Multiplying the numerator multiplies the
fraction, and dividing the numerator divides the fraction.
PRIN. II. Multiplying the denominator divides the fraction,
and dividing the denominator multiplies the fraction.
PRIN. III. Multiplying or dividing both terms of the frac-
tion by the same number does not alter the value of the fraction.
These three principles may be embraced in one
GENERAL LA\V.
125. A change in the NUMERATOR produces a LIKE change
in the value of the fraction; but a change in the DENOMINA-
TOR produces an OPPOSITE change in the value of the fraction.

126. To reduce fractions to their lowest terms.
A fraction is in its lowest terms when its numerator and de-
nominator are prime to each other; that is, when both terms
have no common divisor.
1. Reduce the fraction Jf to its lowest terms.
FIRST OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Dividing both
45 — £ A =r f 2 — i Ans. terms of a fraction by the same
number does not alter the value
of the fraction or quotient, (124, III;) hence, we divide both
terms of ||, by 2, both terms of the result, ||, by 2, and both terms
of this result by 3. As the terms of -| are prime to each other, the
lowest terms of |$ are ^. We have, in effect, canceled all the fac-
tors common to the numerator and denominator.

13O. To reduce a fraction to a given denominator.
As fractions may be reduced to lower terms by division,
they may also be reduced to higher terms by multiplication;
and all higher terms must be multiples of the lowest terms.

1. Reduce £ to a fraction whose denominator is 20.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first divide 20, the
20 _i_ 4 — 5 required denominator, by 4, the denomi-
nator of the given fraction, to ascertain
_^ X 5 _ , 5^ ^ns^ if it be a multiple of this term, 4. The
4X5" division shows that it is a multiple, and
that 5 is the factor which must be em-
ployed to produce this multiple of 4. We therefore multiply both
terms of £ by 5, (124,) and obtain $, the desired result. Hence the

The Least Common Denominator of two or more fractions

it must be the least common multiple of the lowest denom-
inators.
1. Reduce £, |, and -i^ to the least common denominator.
operation. Analysis. We first find
the least common multiple
of the given denominators,
which is 24. This must be
the least common denom-
inator to which the frac-
tions can be reduced. (III.)
We then multiply the terms
of each fraction by such a
number as will reduce the fraction to the denominator, 24. Re-
ducing each fraction to this denominator, by Case V, we have the
answer.
Since the common denominator is already determined, it is
only necessary to multiply the numerators by the multipliers.
Hence the following
Rule. I. Find the least common multiple of the given de-
nominators, for the least common denominator.
II. Divide this common denominator by each of the given
denominators, and multiply each numerator by the correspond-
ing quotient. The products will be the new numerators.

OPERATION. ANALYSIS.
As in whole
numbers, we
can subtract like numbers only, or those having the same unit value,
so, we can subtract fractions only when they have a common de-
nominator. As f and | have not a common denominator, we first
reduce them to a common denominator, and then subtract the
less numerator, 30, from the greater, 32, and write the difference, 2,
over the common denominator, 36. We thus obtain fa = fa, the
required difference. Hence the following
RULE. I. When necessary, reduce the fractions to a
common denominator.

OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first reduce the frac-

2? = 2-?. inator, 12. Since we cannot take ^ from
- - fa we add 1 = \% to ^, which makes }$,
6/j vlws. and T^f from ^-f leaves ^j. We now add 1
to the 2 in the subtrahend, (SO,) and sayi
3 from 9 leaves 6. We thus obtain 6^, the difference required.
Hence, to subtract mixed numbers, we may reduce the
fractional parts to a common denominator, and then subtract
the fractional and integral parts separately. Or,
We may reduce the mixed numbers to improper fractions,
and subtract the less from the greater by the usual method.

We see in the operation that we have multiplied the dividend by
the denominator of the divisor, and divided the result by the numer-
ator of the divisor, which is in accordance with 140 for dividing a
fraction. Hence, by inverting the terms of the divisor, the two
fractions will stand in such relation to each other that we can mul-
tiply together the two upper numbers for the numerator of the quo-
tient, and the two lower numbers for the denominator, as shown in
the operation. For division of fractions, we have this general
Rule. I. Reduce integers and mixed numbers to improper
fractions.
II. Invert the terms of the divisor, and proceed as in multi-
plication.
Notes. 1. The dividend and divisor may be reduced to a common
denominator, and the numerator of the dividend be divided by the nu-
merator of the divisor; this will give the same result as the rule.

116 DECIMALS.
DECIMAL FRACTIONS.
- 143. Decimal Fractions are fractions which have for
their denominator 10, 100, 1000, or 1 with any number of
ciphers annexed.
NOTES. 1. The word decimal is derived from the Latin decem,
which signifies ten.
2. Decimal fractions are commonly called decimals.
3. Since ^ = T1^, yj-ii- — TOTJJ-I &c-. the denominators of decimal
fractions increase and decrease in a tenfold ratio, the same as simple
numbers.
DECIMAL NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
144. Common Fractions are the common divisions of a
unit into any number of equal parts, as into halves, fifths,
twenty-fourths, &c.
Decimal Fractions are the decimal divisions of a unit, thus:
A unit is divided into ten equal parts, called tenths; each of
these tenths is divided into ten other equal parts called hun-
dredths; each of these hundredths into ten other equal parts,
called thousandths; and so on. Since the denominators of
decimal fractions increase and decrease by the scale of 10, the
same as simple numbers, in writing decimals the denomina-
tors may be omitted.
In simple numbers, the unit, 1, is the starting point of
notation and numeration; and so also is it in decimals. We
extend the scale of notation to the left of units' place in
writing integers, and to the right of units' place in writing
decimals. Thus, the first place at the left of units is tens,
and the first place at the right of units is tenths; the second
place at the left is hundreds, and the second place at the
right is hundredths; the third place at the left is thousands,
and the third place at the right is thousandths; and so on.
What are decimal fractions? How do they differ from common
fractions? How are they written?
The Decimal Point is a period ( . ), which must always be
placed before or at the left hand of the decimal. Thus,
T6j is expressed .6
Tfo" " -54
"-279
NOTE. The decimal point is also called the Separatrix. This is a
correct name for it only when it stands between the integral and deci-
mal parts of the same number.
.5 is 5 tenths, which = -fa of 5 units;
.05 is 5 hundredths, "— T'ir of 5 tenths;
,005 is 5 thousandths, "= TV of 5 hundredths.
And universally, the value of a figure in any decimal place
is ^r the value of the same figure in the next left hand place.
The relation of decimals and integers to each other is clear-
ly shown by the following
-- NUMERATION TABLE.
.Si
4753.62418695
Inifgfi-s. Decimals.
By examining this table we see that
Tenths are expressed by one figure.
Hundredths " " "two figures.
Thousandths " " "three"
Ten thousandths" " "four"
And any order of decimals by one figure less than the corre-
sponding order of integers.
145. Since the denominator of tenths is 10, of hun-
What is the decimal point? What is it sometimes called? What is
the value of a figure in any decimal place?
dredths 100, of thousands 1000, and so on, a decimal may be
expressed by writing the numerator only; but in this case
the numerator or decimal must always contain as many
decimal places as are equal to the number of ciphers in the
denominator; and the denominator of a decimal will always
be the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as are equal to
the number of figures in the decimal or numerator.
The decimal point must never be omitted.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Express in figures thirty-eight hundredths.
2. Write seven tenths.
3. Write three hundred twenty-five thousandths.
4. Write four hundredths. Ans. .04.
5. Write sixteen thousandths.
6. Write seventy-four hundred-thousandths. Ans. .00074.
7. Write seven hundred forty-five millionths.
8. Write four thousand two hundred thirty-two ten-thou-
sandths.
9. Write five hundred thousand millionths.
10. Bead the following decimals:
.05 .681 .9034 .19248
.24 .024 .0005 .001385
.672 .8471 .100248 .1000087
NOTE. To read a decimal, we first numerate from left to right, and
the name of the right hand figure is the name of the denominator. We
then numerate from right to left, as in whole numbers, to read the
numerator.
146. A mixed number is a number consisting of integers
and decimals; thus, 71.406 consists of the integral part, 71,
and the decimal part, .406; it is read the same as
71 and 406 thousandths.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Write eighteen, and twenty-seven thousandths.
2. Write four hundred, and nineteen ten-millionths.
How many decimal places must there be to express any decimal?
3. Write fifty-four, and fifty-four millionths.
4. Eighty-one, and 1 ten-thousandth.
5. One hundred, and 67 ten-thousandths.
6. Read the following numbers:
18.027 100.0067 400.0000019
81.0001 54.000054 3.03
75.075 9.2806 40.40404
147. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations
we derive the following important
PRINCIPLES OP DECIMAL NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
1. The value of any decimal figure depends upon its place
from the decimal point: thus .3 is ten times .03.
2. Prefixing a cipher to a decimal decreases its value the
same as dividing it by ten; thus, .03 is -i^ the value of .3.
3. Annexing a cipher to a decimal does not alter its value,
since it does not change the place of the significant figures of
the decimal; thus, -f^, or .6, is the same as -ffa, or .60.
4. Decimals increase from right to left, and decrease from
left to right, in a tenfold ratio; and therefore they may be
added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided the same as whole
numbers.
5. The denominator of a decimal, though never expressed,
is always the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as there
are figures in the decimal.
6. To read decimals requires two numerations; first, from
units, to find the name of the denominator, and second, towards
units, to find the value of the numerator.
148. Having analyzed all the principles upon which the
writing and reading of decimals depend, we will now present
these principles in the form of rules.
RULE FOR DECIMAL NOTATION.
I. Write the decimal the same as a whole number, placing
"What is the first principle of decimal notation? Second? Third?
Fourth f Fifth? Sixth? Rule for notation, first step?
ciphers where necessary to give each significant figure.its true
local value.
II. Place the decimal point before the first figure,
RULE FOR DECIMAL NUMERATION.
I. Numerate from the decimal point, to determine the de-
nominator.
II. Numerate towards the decimal point, to determine the
numerator.
III. Read the decimal as a whole number, giving it the name
or denomination of the right hand figure.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Write 425 millionths.
2. Write six thousand ten-thousandths.
3. Write one thousand eight hundred finy-nine hundred-
thousandths.
4. Write 260 thousand 8 billionths.
5. Bead the following decimals:

REDUCTION:
~- CASE I.
149. To reduce decimals to a common denomina-
tor.
1. Reduce .5, .375, 3.25401, and 46.13 to their least com-
mon decimal denominator.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Tha given decimals must contain
.50000 as many places each, as are equal to the greatest
37500 number of decimal figures in any of the given
o n^iM decimals. A\"o find that tho third number con-
, . tains fivo decimal places, and hence 100000 must
bo a common denominator. As annexing ciphers
to decimals does not alter their value, (144., 3) we give to each number
five decimal places by annexing ciphers, and thus reduco the given
decimals to a common denominator. Hence,
RULE. Give to each number the same number of decimal
places, by annexing ciphers.
NOTES. 1. If the numbers be reduced to the denominator of that
one of the given numbers having the greatest number of decimal places,
they will have their least common decimal denominator.
2. A whole number may readily be reduced to decimals by placing
the decimal point after units, and annexing ciphers; one cipher re-
ducing it to tenths, two ciphers to hundredths, three ciphers to thou-
sandths, and so on.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
2. Reduce .17, 24.6, .0003, 84, and 721.8000271 to their
least common denominator.

dred millionths, and 10845 hundredths to their least common
denominator.

151. To reduce a common fraction to a decimal.
1. Reduce £ to its equivalent decimal.
FIRST OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first annex
f = £$g = jjg — .75, Ans. the same number of ciphers
to both terms of the fraction;
SECOND OPERATION. this does not alter its value.
A \ o nn ^e then divide both resulting
—-— terms by 4, the significant fig-
.75 ure of the denominator, to ob-
tain the decimal denominator,
100. Then the fraction is changed to the decimal form by omitting
the denominator. If the intermediate steps be omitted, the true
result may be obtained as in the second operation.
2. Reduce -fa to its equivalent decimal.
Case II is what? Give explanation. Rule. Case EH is what?
Explain first operation. Second.
THIRD OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Dividing as in the former
1 6 ) 1 .0000 example, we obtain a quotient if 3 fig-
T ~ ures, 625. But since we annexed 4
.062o, Ant. ciphers, there must be 4 places in the
required decimal; hence we prefix 1 cipher. This is made still
plainer by the following operation; thus,
rfSfa = 0625.
From these illustrations we derive the following
RULE. I. Annex ciphers to the numerator, and divide by
the denominator.
II. Point off as many decimal places in the result as are
equal to the number of ciphers annexed.
NOTE. A common fraction can be reduced to an exact decimal when
its lowest denominator contains only the prime factors 2 and 5, and
not otherwise.

operation. Analysis. We write the numbers so that fig-
3.703 ures of like orders of units shall stand in the same
G21 57 columns; that is, units under units, tenths under
P„, tenths, hundredths under hundredths, &c. This
"brings the decimal points directly under each
other. Commencing at the right hand, we add
045.9524 each column separately, and carry as in whole
numbers, and in the result we place a decimal
point between units and tenths, or directly under the decimal point
in the numbers added. From this example we derive the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers so that the decimal points
shall stand directly under each other.
II. Add as in whole numbers, and place the decimal point,
in the result, directly under the- points in the numbers added.

DECIMALS.
SUBTRACTION.
Analysis. In each of these
three examples, we write the
subtrahend under the minu-
end, placing units under
units, tenths under tenths,
&c. Commencing at the
right hand, we subtract as
in whole numbers, and in
the remainders we place the
decimal points directly under
those in the numbers above.
In the second example, the
number of decimal places in
the minuend is greater than
the number in the subtra-
hend, and in the third exam-
ple the number is less. In
both cases, we reduce both
minuend and subtrahend to
the same number of decimal
places, by annexing ciphers;
or we suppose the ciphers to
be annexed, before performing the subtraction. Hence the
Rule. I. Write the numbers so that the decimal points
shall stand directly under each other.
II. Subtract as in whole numbers, and place the decimal
point in the result directly under the points in the given numbers.

\ MULTIPLICATION.
154. 1. What is the product of .35 multiplied by .5?
operation. Analysis. We perform the multiplication the
.35 same as in whole numbers, and the only difficulty
jj we meet with is in pointing off the decimal places
in the product. To determine how many places to
.170, Ans. point off, we may reduce the decimals-to common
fractions; thus, .35 = ^ and "5 = ^. Perform-
ing the multiplication, and we have ffo X -fa = iV^y ana tms
product, expressed decimally, is .175. Here we see that the prod-
uct contains as many decimal places as are contained in both mul-
tiplicand and multiplier. Hence the following
Rule. Multiply as in whole numbers, and from the right
hand of the product point off as many figures for decimals as
there are decimal places in both factors.
Notes. 1. If there be not as many figures in the product as there
are decimals in both factors, supply the deficiency by prefixing ciphers-
2. To multiply a decimal by 10, 100, 1000, &c, remove the point as
many places to the right as there are ciphers on the right of the multi-
plier.

\ DIVISION.
lS5o 1. What is the quotient of .175 divided by .5?
operation. Analysis. We perform the division the same as
.5 ) .175 m whole numbers, and the only difficulty we meet
with is in pointing off the decimal places in the quo-
Ans. coo tient. To determine how many places to point off,
we may reduce the decimals to common fractions; thus, .175 =
-fflfc, and .5 = ^-. Performing the division, and we have

X
1000 10 1000 $ 100
and this quotient, expressed decimally, is .35. Here we see that the
dividend contains as many decimal places as are contained in both
divisor and quotient . Hence the following
Rule. Divide as in whole numbers, and from the right
hand of the quotient point off as many places for decimals
as ihe decimal places in the dividend exceed those in tha
divisor.
Explain division of decimals. Give rule.
NOTES. 1. If the number of figures in the quotient be less than the
excess of the decimal places in the dividend over those in the divisor,
the deficiency must be supplied by prefixing ciphers.
2. If there be a remainder after dividing the dividend, amlix ciphers,
and continue the division: the ciphers annexed are decimals of the
dividend.
3. The dividend must always contain at least as many decimal places

DECIMAL CURRENCY.
Coin is money stamped, and has a given value es-
tablished by law.
-^ 157. Currency is coin, bunk bills, treasury notes, &c., in
circulation as a medium of trade.
158. A Decimal Currency is a currency whose denom-
inations increase and decrease in a tenfold ratio.
NOTE. The currency of the United States is decimal currency, and
ia sometimes called Federal Money; it was adopted by Congress in 1786.
NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
BY THE " COINAGE ACT OP 1873"
The Coin of the United States consists of gold, silver,
nickel, and bronze.
The Gold Coins are the double-eagle, eagle, half-eagle,
quarter-eagle, three-dollar and one-dollar pieces.
The Silver Coins are the trade-dollar, half-dollar,
quarter-dollar, and the dime.
The Nickel Coins are the five-cent and three-cent pieces.
The Bronze Coins are the oue-cent pieces.

NOTES 1.—The- mill is a denomination used only in computa-
tions: it is uot a coin.
2. The trade-dollar is designed solely for commerce, and not for
currency. Its weight is 420 grains.

the denominations of U. S. currency? What is the sign of dollars?
From what derived?
132 DECIMAL CURRENCY.
159. The gold dollar is the unit of United States
money; dimes, cents, and mills are fractions of a dollar, and
are separated from the dollar by the decimal point; thus,
two dollars one dime two cents five mills, are written $2.125.
By examining the table, we see that the dime is a tenth part
of the unit, or dollar; the cent a tenth part of the dime or a
hundredth part of the dollar; and the mill a tenth part of the
cent, a hundredth part of the dime, or a thousandth part of the
dollar. Hence the denominations of decimal currency increase
and decrease the same as decimal fractions, and are expressed
according to the same decimal system of notation; and they
may be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided in the same
manner as decimals.
Dimes are not read as dimes, but the two places of dimes
and cents are appropriated to cents; thus, 1 dollar 3 dimes
2 cents, or $1.32, are read one dollar thirty-two cents; hence,
When the number of cents is less than 10, we write a cipher
before it in the place of dimes.
NOTE. The half cent is frequently -written as 5 mills; thus, 24J cents,
written $.245.
160. Business men frequently write cents as common
fractions of a dollar; thus, three dollars thirteen cents are
written $3-j^, and read, three and thirteen hundredths dollars.
In business transactions, when the final result of a computation
contains 5 mills or more, they are called one cent, and when
less than 5, they are rejected.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Write four dollars five cents. Ans. $4.05.
2. Write two dollars nine cents.
3. Write ten dollars ten cents.

What is the unit of II. S. currency? What is the general law of
increase and decrease? In practice, how many decimal places are given
to cents? In business transactions, how are cents frequently written?
What is done if the mills exceed 5? If less than 5?
5. Write sixty-four cents. Am. $0.64.
6. Write three cents two mills.
7. Write one hundred dollars one cent one mill.
8. Read $7.93; $8.02; $6,542.

172. To find the cost of articles sold by the 100,
1000, &c.
1. What cost 475 feet of limber, at $5.24 per 100 feet?
FIRST OPERATION.'
$5.24 ANALYSIS. If the price were $5.24 per
475 foot, the cost of 475 feet would be 475 X
$5.24 = $2489. But since $5.24 is the
2620 price of 100 feet, $2489 is 100 times the true
3668 value. Therefore, to obtain the true value,
2096 we divide $2489 by 100, which we may do
bv cutting off two figures from the right, and
100 ) $2489.00 the resuh is $24.89. Or,
Ans. $24.89
Give explanation. Rule. Case V is what? Give first explanation.
second operation. Analysis. Since 1 foot costs T^, or. 01,
$5.24 of $5-24, 475 feet will cost $£$, or 4.75 times
4 j5 $5.24, which is $24.89.
2620 Note. For the same reasons, when the price
ooca *3 Per thousand, we divide the product by 1000,
""™ or, which is more convenient in practice, we re-
2096 duce the given quantity to thousands and deci-
."' mals of a thousand, by pointing off three figures
$24.8900 from the right hand. Hence the
Rule. I. Reduce the given quantity to hundreds and deci-
mals of a hundred, or to thousands and decimals of a thousand.
II. Multiply the price by the quantity, and point off in the
result as in multiplication of decimals.
Note. The letter C is used to indicate hundreds, and Mto indicate
thousands.

operation. Analysis. Since 1 ton, or 2000 pounds, cost
2 ) $9.50 $9.50,1000 pounds, or \ ton, will cost £ of $9.50,
——- or $9.50 -^2 = $4,75. One pound will cost
* TjW or -001' of $4-75' and 2376 pounds will
2-370 cost f £1$, or 2.376 times $4.75, which is $11.286.

REDUCTION.
"IT'S. A Compound Number is a concrete number whoso
value is expressed iu two or more different denominations.
176. Reduction is the process of changing a number from
»ne denomination to another without altering its value.
Reduction 13 of two kinds, Descending and Ascending.
\ B77. Reduction Descending is changing a number of one
denomination to another denomination of less unit value; thus,
$1 = 10 dimes =100 cents = 1000 mills.
178. Reduction Ascending is changing a number of one
denomination to another denomination of greater unit. value;
thus, 1000 mills = 100 cents = 10 dimes = $1.
179. A Scale is a scries of numbers, descending or as-
cending, used in operations upon compound numbers.

II. Proceed in the same manner with the results obtained in
each lower denomination, until the reduction is brought to the
denomination required.
CASE II.
183. To perform reduction ascending.
1. Reduce 21066 farthings to pounds.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first divide
4 1 2 1066 far tlie 21066 far. by 4, because
there are \ as many pence as
12)5266d.+ 2 far. farthings, and we find that
2;o ) 43|8 s. + 10 d. 21066 far. = 5266 d. + a re-
mainder of 2 far. We next
-,
divide 5266 d. by 12, because
Ans. 21 £ 18 s. 10 d. 2 far. there are ^ as many shmings
as pence, and we find that 5266 d. = 438 s. + 10 d. Lastly we
divide the 438 s. by 20, because there are -^ as many pounds as
shillings, and we find that 438 s. = 21 £ + 18 s. The last quotient
with the several remainders annexed in the order of the succeeding
denominations, gives the answer 21 £ 18s. 10 d. 2 far. Hence,
RULE. I. DIVIDE the given number by that number of the
scale which will reduce it to the next higher denomination.
II. Divide the quotient bi/ the next higher number in the
scale; and so proceed to the highest denomination required.
The last quotient, with the several remainders annexed in a
reversed order, will be the answer.
NOTE. Reduction descending and reduction ascending mutually
prove each other.

STANDARD OP WEIGHT.
188. In the year 1834 the U. S. government adopted a
uniform standard of weights and measures, for the use of the
custom houses, and the other branches of business connected with
the general government. Most of the States which have adopt-
ed any standards have taken those of the general government
180. The United States standard unit of weight is the
Troy pound of the mint, which is the same as the imperial
standard pound of Great Britain, and is determined as fol-
lows: A cubic inch of distilled water in a vacuum, weighed
by brass weights, also in a vacuum, at a temperature of 62°
Fahrenheit's thermometer, is equal to 252.458 grains, of which
the standard Troy pound contains' 5760.
190. The U. S. Avoirdupois pound is determined from
the standard Troy pound, and contains 7000 Troy grains.
Hence, the Troy pound is fyJ§# = -J4£ of an avoirdupois
pound. But the Troy ounce contains -6i££ = 480 grains, and
the avoirdupois ounce ^^ = 437.5 grains ; and an ounce Troy
is 480—437.5 = 42.5 grains greater than an ounce avoirdu-
pois. The pound, ounce, and grain, Apothecaries' weight,
are the same as the like denominations in Troy weight, the only
difference in the two tables being in the divisions of the ounce.

NOTES. 1. For the purpose of measuring cloth and other goods sold
by the yard, the yard is divided into halves, fourths, eighths, and six-
teenths. The old table of cloth measure is practically obsolete.
2. The geographic mile is^ of 5Jy or -jitTff of the distance round
the center of the earth. It is a small fraction more than 1.16 statute
miles.
3. The length of a degree of latitude varies, being 68.72 miles at the
equator, 68.9 to 69.05 miles in middle latitudes, and 69.30 to 69.34 miles
in the polar regions. The mean or average length is as stated in the
table. A degree of longitude is greatest at the equator, where it is
69.16 miles, and it gradually decreases toward the poles, where it ia 0.

II. Square Measure.
\ 195. A Square is a figure having four equal sides, and
four equal angles or corners.
1 square foot is a figure having four
sides of 1 ft. or 12 in. each, as shown
in the diagram. Its contents are 12
X 12 = 144 square inches. Hence
The contents or area of a square, or
of any other figure having a uniform
length and a uniform breadth, is found
by multiplying the length by the breadth.
Thus, a square foot is 12 in. long and 12 in. wide, and the con-
tents are 12 X 12 = 144 square inches. A board 20 in. long
and 10 in. wide, is a rectangle, containing 20 X 10 = 200
square inches.
IDG. Square Measure is used in computing areas or sur-
faces; as of land, boards, painting, plastering, paving, &c.

III. Cubic Measure.
I 108. A Cube is a solid, or body,
having six equal square sides, or
faces. If each side of a cube be 1
yard, or 3 feet, 1 foot in thickness
of this cube will contain 3X3X1
s= 9 cubic feet, and the whole cube will
contain 3 X 3 X 3 = 27 cubic feet.
A solid, or body, may have the
three dimensions all alike or all different. A body 4 ft. long,
3 ft. wide, and 2 ft. thick contains 4X3X2 = 24 cubic or
solid feet. Hence we see that
The cubic or solid contents of a body are found by multiply-
ing the length, breadth, and thickness together.
199. Cubic Measure, also called Solid Measure, is used
in estimating the contents of solids, or bodies; as timber, wood,
stone, &c.

Notes. 1. A cubic yard of earth is called a load.
2. Railroad and transportation companies estimate light freight by
the space it occupies in cubic feet, and heavy freight by weight.
3. A pile of wood 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 4 feet high, contains
1 cord; and a cord foot is 1 foot in length of such a pile.
4. A perch of stone or of masonry is 164 feet long, 1.J feet wide, and
1 foot high.
Define a cube. How are the contents of a cube or rectangular
solid found? For what is cubic measure used? Repeat the table.
Give the scale. How is railroad freight estimated? What is under-
stood by a cord foot? By a perch of stone or masonry?
5. Joiners, bricklayers, and masons make no allowance for windows,
doors, &c. Bricklayers and masons, in estimating their work by
cubic measure, make no allowance for the corners of the walls of
houses, cellars, &c, but estimate their work by the girt, that is, the
entire length of the wall on the outside.
6. Engineers, in making estimates for excavations and embankments,
take the dimensions with a line or measure divided into feet and deci-
mals of a foot. The estimates are made in feet and decimals, and the
results are reduced to cubic yards.

i STANDARD OP EXTENSION.
202. The U. S. standard unit of measures of extension,
whether linear, superficial, or solid, is the yard of 3 feet, or 36
inches, and is the same as the imperial standard yard of
Great Britain. It is determined as follows: The rod of a
pendulum vibrating seconds of mean time, in the latitude of
London, in a vacuum, at the level of the sea, is divided into
391393 equal parts, and 360000 of these parts are 36 inches,
or 1 standard yard. Hence, such a pendulum rod is 39.1393
inches long, and the standard yard is ff$%$$ of the length of
the pendulum rod.
203. The V. S. standard unit of liquid measure is the old
English wine gallon, of 231 cubic inches, which is equal to
8.33888 pounds avoirdupois of distilled water at its maximum
density, that is, at the temperature of 39.83° Fahrenheit, the
barometer at 30 inches.

ish Winchester bushel, which is 18£ inches in diameter and 8
inches deep, and contains 2150.42 cubic inches, equal to
77.6274 pounds avoirdupois of distilled water, at its maximum
density. A gallon, dry measure, contains 268.8 cubic inches.

Circular Measure.
207. Circular Measure, or Circular Motion, is used prin-
cipally in surveying, navigation, astronomy, and geography,
for reckoning latitude and longitude, determining locations of
places and vessels, and computing difference of time.
Every circle, great or small, is divisible into the same num-
ber of equal parts, as. quarters, called quadrants, twelfths,
called signs, 360ths, called degrees, &c. Consequently the
parts of different circles, although having the same names, are
of different lengths.

1. Reduce .78125 of a pound Troy to integers of lower de-
nominations.
Give explanation. Rule. Case V is what?
operation. Analysis. We first multiply
.78125 lb. ty 12 to reduce the given number
jo from pounds to ounces, and the
result is 9 ounces- and the decimal
9.37500 oz. .375 0f an oz. We then multiply
20 this decimal by 20 to reduce it to
7.50000 pwt. pennyweights, and get 7 pwt. and
a a .5 of a pwt. This last decimal we
multiply by 24, to reduce it to
12.0000 gr. grains, and the result is 12 gr.
r, _ . . „ . Hence the answer is 9 oz. 7 pwt.
9 oz. 7 pwt. 12 gr., Ans. 12 r
Rule. I. Multiply the given decimal by that number in the
scale which will reduce it to the next lower denomination, and

er, we first add the units in the
right hand column, or lowest de-
nomination, and find the amount to
be 51 grains, which is equal to 2
Ans. 39 1 17 3 pwt. 3gr. We write the 3 gr. under
the column of grains, and add the 2
pwt. to the column of pwt. Wc find the amount of the second col-
umn to be 37 pwt., which is equal to 1 oz. 17 pwt. Writing the 17
pwt. under the column of pwt., we add the 1 oz. to the next column.
Adding this column in the same manner as the preceding ones, we
find the amount to be 25 oz., equal to 2 lb. 1 oz. Placing the 1 oz.
under the column of oz., we add the 2 lb. to the column of lb.
Adding the last column, we find the amount to be 39 lb. Hence

18 3 0 2 we begin at the right hand, or lowest
Ant fi 3 0 3 denomination; since we cannot take
2 gi. from 1 gi., we add 1 pt. or 4 gi. to
1 gi., making 5 gi.; and taking 2 gi. from 5 gi., we write the remain-
der, 3 gi., underneath the column of gills. Having added 1 pt. or
4 gi. to the minuend, we now add 1 pt. to the 0 pt. in the subtra-
hend, making 1 pt.; and 1 pt. from 1 pt. leaves 0 pt., which we write
in the remainder. Next, as we cannot take 3 qt. from 2 qt., we add
1 gal. or 4 qt. to 2 qt., making 6 qt., and taking 3 qt. from 6 qt., we
write the remainder, 3 qt., under the denomination of quarts. Add-

Rule. I. ' Write the subtrahend under the minuend, so that
units of the same denomination shall stand under each other.
II. Beginning at the right hand, subtract each denomination
separately, as in simple numbers.
III. If the number of any denomination in the subtrahend
exceed that of the same denomination in the minuend, add to
the number in the minuend as many units as make one of the
next higher denomination, and then subtract; in this case add
1 to the next higher denomination of the subtrahend before
subtracting. Proceed in the same manner with each denomi-

If the days of the different months are not the same, the
number of days of difference should be added when the earlier
day belongs to the month from which we reckon, and subtracted
when it belongs to the month to which we find the time. If
the 29th of February is to be included in the time computed,
one day must be added to the result.

4 2 27 under the lowest denomination of the mul-
8 tiplicand, and proceed thus; 8 times 27 P«
——. — are 216 P., equal to 5 R. 16 P.; and we
write the 16 P. under the number multiplied.
Then 8 times 2 R. are 16 R., and 5 R. added make 21 R., equal to
4 A. 1 R.; and we write the 1 R. under 'the number multiplied.
Again, 8 times 4 A are 32 A., and 4 A. added make 36 A., which we
write under the same denomination in the multiplicand, and the

operation. Analysis. One acre will produce $-
pt. bu. pk. qt. pts. as much as 4 acres. Writing the divi-
4)102 3 2 sor on the left of the dividend, we divide
9g261 ^^ ^u" ^ 4, and we obtain a quotient of
25 bu., and a remainder of 2 bu. We
write the 25 bu. under the denomination of bushels, and reduce the
2 bu. to pecks, making 8 pk., and the 3 pk. of the dividend added
makes 11 pk. Dividing 11 pk. by 4, we obtain a quotient of 2 pk.
and a remainder of 3 pk.; writing the 2 pk. under the order of
pecks, we next reduce 3 pk. to quarts, adding the 2 qt. of the
dividend, making 26 qt., which divided by 4 gives a quotient of 6 qt
.
and a remainder of 2 qt. Writing the 6 qt. under the order of
quarts, and reducing the remainder, 2 qt., to pints, we have 4 pt.,
which divided by 4 gives a quotient of 1 pt., which we write under
the order of pints, and the work is done.

NOTES. 1. When the divisor is large and is a composite number,
we may shorten the work by dividing by the factors.
2. When the divisor and dividend are both compound numbers, they
must both be reduced to the same denomination before dividing, and
then the process is the tame as in simple numbers.

time. Hence the
Rule. Multiply the difference of longitude in degrees and
minutes by 4, and the product will be the difference of time in
minutes and seconds, which may be reduced to hours.
Note. If one place be in east, and the other in west longitude, the
difference of longitude is found by adding them,- and if the sum be
greater than 180°, it must be subtracted from 360°.

(/ DUODECIMALS.
227. Duodecimals are the divisions and subdivisions of
a unit, resulting from continually dividing by 12, as 1, ^, T^f
ttVb, &c- In practice, duodecimals are applied to the meas-
urement of extension, the foot being taken as the unit.
If the foot be divided into 12 equal parts, the parts are
called inches, or primes; the inches divided by 12 give sec-
onds; the seconds divided by 12 give thirds; the thirds di-
vided by 12 give fourths; and so on.
From these divisions of a foot it follows that
V (inch or prime) is ^ of R foot,
1 (second) or ^ of A, « ^ of „ foot
1 (third) or ^ of tV of A, . . « ^ of a foot, &c.

1 How many square feet in a board 11 feet 8 inches long
and 2 feet 7 inches wide?
Analysis. We first multiply by the 7'.
7 twelfths times 8 twelfths equals 56 one
hundred forty-fourths, which equals 4
twelfths and 8 one hundred forty-fourths.
We write the 8 144ths — marked with two
indices — to the right, and add the 4 12ths
30 ft 1' 8" to tne nex*; product. 7' times 11 equals
77', which added to 4/ equals 81', equal to
6 feet and 9'. We write the 9' under the
inches, or 12ths, and the 6 under the feet, or units. 2 times 8'
equals 16', or 1 foot and 4'. We write the 4' under the &, and
add the 1 foot to the next product. 2 times 11 feet are 22 feet, and
1 foot added make 23 feet, which we write under the 6 feet. Add-

PERCENTAGE.

PERCENTAGE.
230. Per cent is a term derived from the Latin words per
centum, and signifies by the hundred, or hundredths, that is, a cer-
tain number of parts of each one hundred parts, of whatever de-
nomination. Thus, by 5 per cent, is meant 5 cents of every 100
cents, $5 of every $100, 5 bushels of every 100 bushels, &c.
Therefore, 5 per cent, equals 5 hundredths = .05 = Tg-5 = 2^y.
8 per cent, equals 8 hundredths = .08 = T§g- = g$.
•A 232. Percentage is such a part of a number as is indi-
cated by the per cent. »•-<* " V-.'"A A jn.tn
233. The Base of percentage is the number on which
the percentage is computed.
234. Since per cent, is any number of hundredths, it is
usually expressed in the form of a decimal; but it may be
expressed either as a decimal or a common fraction, as in. the

by a certain per cent, of itself, is given.
1. A man's income this year is $525, which is 5 per cent,
move than it was last year; what was it last year?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Fiuce his income
$525 H- 1.05 = $500. this year is .05 more than it
was last year, this year's income must be 1.05 times the income of
last year; therefore divide this year.s income by 1.05 and it gives the
income of last year. Hence the
RULE. Divide the amount by 1 plus the rate expressed
decimally, and the quotient will be the base or number re-
quired. Or,
Take as many times 100 as the amount is times 1 plus the
rate per cent.

239. To find a number when the number, diminished
by a certain per cent, of itself, is given.
1. A man lost 8 per cent, of his sheep and had 368 left;
how many had he at first?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since the man lost
368 -f- .92 = 400. 8 per cent. of his sheep, he has
92 per cent, left; hence 368 is .92 times his original flock. We
therefore divide 368 by .92 and obtain the required number of sheep.
Hence the
RULE. Divide the given number by 1 minus the rate ex-
pressed decimally, and the quotient will be the base or number

COMMISSION AND BROKERAGE. 213
CASE I.
343. To find the commission or brokerage on any
sum of money.
1. A commission merchant sells butter and cheese to tho
amount of $1540; what is his commission at 5 per cent.?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.
1540 X -05 = $77, Ans. Since the com-
Or, T^ = Jj , and ^ X 1540 r= $77. mission on $l is
5 cents or .05 or
a dollar, on $1540 it is $1540 X .05 = $77. Or, since 5 per cent
is T^=^j. of the sum received, the commission is -fa of $1540
= $77. Hence the
RULE. Multiply the given sum by the rate per cent, ex-
pressed decimally, and the result will be the commission or bro-
kerage. Or,
Take such a part of the given sum as the number expressing
the per cent, is part of 100.

to the amount of $19814.15; how much commission does he
receive during the year? Ans. $2253.084.
CASE II.
214. To find the commission or brokerage, -when
it is to be deducted from the given sum, and the bal-
ance invested.
1. A merchant sends his agent $1260 with which to buy
merchandise, after deducting his commission of 5 per cent.;
what is the sum invested, and how much is the commission?
OPERATION.
$1260-4- 1-05 = $1200, invested.
$1260 — $1200= $60, commission.
Or, iSS + -rSff = U; $1260 -H |J = $1200, invested.
And $1260 — $1200 = $60, commission.
Case II is what? Give explanation. Rule.
ANALYSIS. Since the commission is 5 per cent., the agent must
receive $1.05 for every $1 he expends; he can invest as many
dollars as $1.05 is contained times in $1260, which is $1200; and
the difference between the given sum and the sum invested is his
commission.
Or, the money expended is ^$f of itself, the commission is T$-j- of
this sum, and the commission added to the sum expended is {$f of
the whole sum. Since $1260 is }ff = |^,$1260 -^ |J = $1200,
the sum expended; and $1260 — $1200=$60 the commission.

CASE I.
261. To find the value of stock, when at an advance,
or discount.
1. What will $3240 of Bank Stock cost at 8 per cent.
advance, brokerage ^ per cent.?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. To find the
$1 + .08 = $1.08. price ? sJt0ck, We add the
rate of advance to, or sub-
$1.08 + .0025 = $1.0825. tract the discount from, $1:
$1.0825 x 3240 = $3507.30. to this result add the
brokerage, and we have the cost of $1. Hence $3240 stock will cost
8240 times $1.0825. Hence the

STOCK INVESTMENTS.
363. The net earnings of a corporation are usually divid-
ed among the stockholders, in semi-annual dividends. The
income of capital stock is therefore fluctuating, being depend-
ent upon the condition of business; while the income arising
from bands, whether of government or corporations, is fixed,
being a certain rate per cent., annually, of the par value, or
f;ice of the bonds.
Case II is what? Give explanation. Explain difference between
income of capital stock, and of bonds.
364. Federal or United States Securities are of two
kinds; viz., Bonds and Notes.
Bonds are of two kinds.
First, Those which are payable at a fixed date, and are
known and quoted in commercial transactions by the rate of
interest they bear, thus: U. S. 6's, that is, United States
Bonds bearing 6 $ interest. *
Second, Those which are payable at a fixed date, but which
may be paid at an earlier specified time, as the Government
may elect. These are known and quoted in commercial transac-
tions by a combination of the two dates, thus: U. S. 5-20's;
or a combination of the rate of interest and the two dates,
thus: U. S. 6's 5-20; that is, bonds bearing 6 % interest,
-which are payable in twenty years, but may be paid in five
years, if the Government so elect.
When it is necessary, in any transaction, to distinguish from
each other different issues which bear the same rate of interest,
this is done by adding the year in which they become due,
thus: U. S. 6's of '71; U. S. 5's of '74; U. S. 6's 5-20 of
'84; U. S. 6's 5-20 of '85.
Notes are of two kinds.
First. Those payable on demand, without interest, known
as United States Legal-tender Notes, or, in common language,
"Greenbacks."
Second, Notes payable at a specified time, with interest,
known as Treasury Notes. ' Of these there are two kinds,—,
6 f Compound-interest Notes, and Notes bearing 7T35 % in-
terest, the latter known and quoted in commercial transac-
tions as 7.30's.
The nomenclature here explained is that used in com-
* The character SS generally employed In business transactions signifies per
cent,; thus 6 % signifies 6 per cent.
What are United States Securities composed of? Explain the
different kinds of bonds. Of Notes. In what is the interest on
each payable?
X
mercial transactions, which involve similar Securities of States
or Corporations.
The interest on all bonds is payable in gold.
The interest on notes is payable in Legal-tender Notes.
When Bonds or Stocks are sold, a revenue stamp must be
used equal in value to one cent on each $100, or fraction of
$100, of their currency value. If sold by a broker, this is
charged to the person for whom they are sold.
The following are the principal United States Securities: —

GOLD INVESTMENTS.
Currency is a terra used in commercial language,
First, To denote the aggregate of Specie and Bills of Ex-
change, .Bank Bills, Treasury Notes, and other substitutes for
money employed in buying, selling, and carrying on exchange
of commodities between various nations. Second, To denote
whatever circulating medium is used in any country as a sub-
stitute for the government standard. In this latter sense, the
paper circulating medium, when below par, is called Currency,
to distinguish it from gold and silver. If, from any cause, the
paper medium depreciates in value, as it has done in the
United States, gold becomes an object of investment, the same
as stocks. In commercial language, gold is represented as
rising and falling; but gold being the standard of value, it
can not vary. The variation is in the medium of circulation
substituted for gold; hence, when gold is said to be at a
premium, the currency, or circulating medium, is made the
standard, while it is virtually below par.
CASE I.
JS7O. To change gold into currency.

be as many times $1.70 of currency
bought as there are dollars of gold. Therefore, $1.70 X 150 = $255
is the amount of currency which can be purchased for $150 in gold.
RULE. Multiply the value of one dollar of gold in currency
by the number of dollars of gold.

CASE II.
274. To find the gain or loss per cent., when the
cost and selling price are given.
1. Bought wool at 32 cents a pound, and sold it for 40 cents
a pound; what per cent, was gained?
Case n is whatf Give explanation. Rule.
OPERATION.
40 _ 32 = 8 ; 8 -T- 32 = & = .25, Arts.
Or, 40 — 32 = 8; 8 -^ 32 = & = £; £ X 100 = 25 £
Analysis. Since the gain on 32 cents is 40 — 32 = 8 cents, the
whole gain is -fa = \ of the purchase money; and -J- reduced to a
decimal is 25 hundredths, equal to 25 per cent. Or, if the gain were
equal to the purchase money, it would be 100 per cent.; but since
the gain is -fa = £ of the purchase money, it will be \ of 100 per
cent, equal to 25 per cent. Hence the following
Rule. Make the difference between the purchase and selling
prices the numerator, and the purchase price the denominator;
reduce to a decimal, and the result will be the per cent. Or,
Take such a part of 100 as the gain or loss is part of the
purchase price.

276. To find the cost, when the selling price and
the gain or loss per cent, are given.
1. A merchant sold cloth for $4.80 a yard, and by so doing
made 33^ per cent.; how much did it cost?
OPERATION. .
1 + .331 - 1.33A,; $4.80 -f-1.38£ = $3.60, Am.
Or, $4.80 = $ of the cost; $4.80 -=- j = $3.60.
Case IV is what?
Analysis. Since the gain is 33J per cent. of the cost, $1 of the
cost, increased by 33£ per cent., will be what $1 of cost sold for:
therefore there will be as many dollars of cost, as 1.33J is con-
tained times in $4.80, or $3.60. Or, since he gained 33J per cent.
= | of the cost, $4.80 is f of the cost; $4.80 -f- £ = $3.60.
Note. If the rate per cent. be loss, we subtract it from 1, instead
of adding it. Hence the following
Role. Divide the selling price by 1 increased by the gain
or diminished by the loss per cent., expressed decimally, or in
the form of a common fraction, and the quotient will be the
cost.

277. Insurance on property is security guaranteed by
one party to another, for a stipulated sum, against the loss of
that property by fire, navigation, or any other casualty.
278. The Insurer or Underwriter is the party taking the
risk.
279. The Insured is the party protected.

TAXES.
2S8JS. A Tax is a sum of money assessed on the person
or property of an individual, for public purposes.
284. When a tax is assessed on property, it is apportioned
at a certain per cent, on the estimated value.
When assessed on the person, it is apportioned equally
among the male citizens liable to assessment, and is called a
poll lax. Each person so assessed is called a poll.

TAXES. 235
985. Property is of two kinds — real estate, and personal
property.
386. Eeal Estate consists of immovable property, such
as lands, houses, &c.
287. Personal Property consists of movable property,
such as money, notes, furniture, cattle, tools, &c.
288. An Inventory is a written list of articles of proper-
ty, with their value.
28O. Before taxes are assessed, a complete inventory of all
the taxable property upon which the tax is to be levied must
be made. If the assessment include a poll tax, then a complete
list of taxable polls must also be made out.
I. A lax of $3165 is to be assessed on a certain town;
the valuation of the taxable property, as shown by the as-
sessment roll, is $600,000, and there are 220 polls to be as-
sessed 75 cents each; what will be the tax on a dollar, and
how much will be A's tax, whose property is valued at $3750,
and who pays for 3 polls?
OPERATION.
$.75 X 220 = $165, amount assessed on the polls.
$3165 — $165 = $3000, amount to be assessed on the property.
$3000 -f- $600,000 = .005, tax on $1.
$3750 X -005 = $18.75, A's tax on property.
$.75 X 3 = $2.25, A's tax on 3 polls.
$18.75 -j- $2.25 =. $21, amount of A's tax.
Hence the following
RULE. I. Find the amount of poll tax, if any, and subtract
this sum from the whole amount of tax to be assessed.
II. Divide the sum to be raised on property, by tJie whole
amount of taxable property, and the quotient will be the per
cent., or the tax on one dollar.
III. Multiply each man's taxable property by the per cent.,
or the tax ore $1, and to the product add his poll tax, if any;
the result will be the whole amount of his tax.
What is real estate? Personal property? An inventory? Explain
the process of levying a state or other tax. IluU.
PERCENTAGE.
Note. Having found the tax on $1, or the per cent., which in the
preceding example we find to be 5 mills, or A per cent., the operation
of assessing taxes may be greatly facilitated by rinding the tax on $2,
$3, &c, to $10, and then on $20, $30, &c, to $100, and arranging
the numbers as in the following

CUSTOM HOUSE BUSINESS.
29O, Duties, or Customs, are taxes levied on imported
goods, for the support of government and the protection of home
industry.

of its cargo, for the privilege of coming into a port of entry.
294. Revenue is the income to government from dutief
and tonnage.
Duties are of two kinds — ad valorem and specific.
295* Ad Valorem Duty is a sum computed on the cost
of goods in the country from which they were imported.
296. Specific Duty is a sum computed on the weight or
measure of goods, without regard to their cost.
297. An Invoice is a bill of goods imported, showing
the quantity and price of each kind.
298. By the New Tariff Act, approved March 2, 1857,
all duties taken at the U. S. custom houses, are ad valorem.
In collecting customs, it is the design of government to tax
only so much of the merchandise as will be available to the
importer in the market. The goods are weighed, measured,
gauged, or imported, in order to ascertain the actual quantity
and value received in port; and an allowance is made in every
case of waste, loss, or damage.
299. Tare is an allowance of the weight of the package
or covering that contains the goods. It is ascertained by
actually weighing one or more of the empty boxes, casks, or
coverings. In common articles of importation, it is sometimes
computed at a certain per cent, previously ascertained by
frequent trials.
300. Leakage is an allowance on liquors imported in
casks or barrels.
301. Breakage is an allowance en liquors imported in
bottles.
NOTE. Actual leakage or breakage is allowed, there being no fixed
or legal rate.
302. Gross Weight or Value is the weight or value of
the goods before any allowance has been made.
303. Net Weight or Value is the weight or value after
all allowances have been deducted.
Define Tonnage. Revenue. Ad valorem duty. Specific duty. An

C. CASE I.
311. To find the interest on any sum, at any rate
per cent., for years and mouths.
In percentage, any per cent, of any given number is so
many hundredths of that number; but in interest, any rate per
cent, is confined to 1 year, and the per cent, to be obtained
of any given number is greater than the rate per cent, per
annum if the time be more than 1 year, and less than the rate
per cent, per annum if the time be less than 1 year. Thus,

CASE II.
313. To lind the interest on any sum, for any
time, at any rate per cent.
The analysis of our rule is based upon the following
Obvious Relations between Time and Interest.
I. The interest on any sum, for 1 year, at 1 per cent., is
.01 of that sum, and is equal to the principal with the separatrix
removed two places to the left.
II. A month being TV of a year, -rV of the interest on any
sum for 1 year is the interest for 1 month.
AVhat is Case II? Give the first relation between time and interest.

III. The interest on any sum for 3 days is fo = ^g = .1
of the interest for 1 month, and any number of days may
readily be reduced to tenths of a month by dividing by 3.
IV. The interest on any sum, for 1 month, multiplied by
any given time expressed in months and tenths of a month,
will produce the required interest.

CONTRACTIONS. After removing the separatrix in the principal
two places to the left, the result may be regarded either as the in-
terest on the given principal for 12 months at 1 per cent., or for 1
month at 12 per cent. If we regard it as for 1 month at 12 per
cent., and if the given rate be an aliquot part of 12 per cent., the
interest on the given principal for 1 month may readily be found by
taking such an aliquot part of the interest for 1 month as the given
rate is part of 12 per cent. Thus,
To find the interest for 1 month at 6 per cent., remove the sep-
aratrix two places to the left, and divide by 2.
To find it at 3 per cent., proceed as before, and divide by 4; at 4
per cent., divide by 3; at 2 per cent., divide by 6, &c.
\ SIX PER CENT. METHOD.
313. By referring to 3O9 it will be seen that the legal
rate of interest in 21 States is 6 per cent. This is a sufficient
reason for introducing the following brief method into this work:
ANALYSIS. At C per cent per annum the interest on $1
For 12 months is $.06.
"2 months (T*5=i of 12 mo.) ".01.
"lmonth,or30days(,Lof 12 mo.)" .00}=$.005 (^of $.06).
"6 days ('- of 30 days) ".001.
"1 " (Jof 6da.=3\yof30days)" .000'.
Hence we conclude that,
1st. The interest on $1 is $.005 per month, or $.01 for every
2 months;
2d. The interest on $1 is $.000i per day, or $.001 for every
6 days.
From these principles we deduce the
KULE. I. To find the rate:— Call every year $.06, every
2 months $.01, every 6 days $.001, and any less number of days
sixths of 1 mill.
II. To find the interest:—Multiply the principal by the rate.
NOTES.—1. To find the interest at any other rate per cent. by this
me^uod, first find it at 6 per cent., and then increase or diminish the
result by as many times itself as the given rate is greater or less than 6
per cent. Thus, for 1 per cent, add £, for 4 per cent, subtract J, &c»
What contractions are given? G ive analysis of the 6 per cent, method.
Rule. Its application to any other rate per cent.
2. The interest of $10 for 6 days, or of $1 for GO days, is $.01.
Therefore, if the principal be 'ess than $10 and the time less than 6
days, or the principal less than $1 and the time less than 60 days, the
interest will be less than $.01, and may be disregarded.
3. Since the interest of $1 for 00 days is $.01, the interest of $1 for
any number of clays is as many cents as 60 is contained times in the
number of days. Therefore, if any principal be multiplied by the num-
ber of days in any given number of months and days, and the product
divided by 60, the result will be the interest in cents. That is, Multi-
ply the principal by the number of days, divide the product by 60, and point
off two decimal places in the quotient. The result will be the interest in the
tame denomination as the principal

per cent., will amount to $1,175, the principal that will amount to
$88-125, at the same rate and time, must be as many dollars as
$1,175 is contained times in $88.125; dividing, we obtain $75, the
required principal. Hence the
Rule. Divide the given amount by the amount of $1 for
the given time and rate, and the quotient will be the principal
required.

EXCHANGE.
IIIJ8. Exchange is a method of remitting money from one
place to another, or of making payments by written orders.
339. A Bill of Exchange is a written request or order
upon one person to pay a certain sum to another person, or to
his order, at a specified time.
34 O. A Sight Draft or Bill is one requiring paymen' to
be made "at sight," which means, at the time of its presenta-
tion to the person ordered to pay. In other bills, the time
specified is usually a certain number of days "after sight."
There are always three parties, and usually four, to a trans-
action in exchange:
341. The Drawer or Maker is the person who signs the
order or bill.
Give the rule. Define exchange. A bill of exchange. A sight draft. •
Ihe drawer, t
EXCHANGE. 267
34S. The Drawee is the person to whom the order is
addressed.
343. The Payee is the person to whom the money is or-
dered to be paid.
344. The Buyer or Remitter is the person who purchases
the bill. He may be himself the payee, or the bill may be
drawn in favor of any other person.
345. The Indorsement of a bill is the writing upon its
back, by which the payee relinquishes his title, and transfers
the payment to another. The payee may indorse in blank by
writing his name only, which makes the bill payable to the
bearer, and consequently transferable like a bank note; or he
may accompany his signature by a special order to pay to
another person, who in his turn may transfer the title in like
manner. Indorsers become separately responsible for the
amount of the bill, in case the drawee fails to make payment.
A bill made payable to the bearer is transferable without in-
dorsement.
346. The Acceptance of a bill is the promise which the
drawee makes when the bill is presented to him to pay it at
maturity; this obligation is usually acknowledged by writing
the word "Accepted," with his signature, across the face of
the bill.
NOTE. Three days of grace are usually allowed for the payment of
a bill of exchange after the time specified has expired. But in New
York State no grace is allowed on sight drafts.
From these definitions, the use of a bill of exchange in mon-
etary transactions is readily perceived. If a man wishes to
make a remittance to a creditor, agent, or any other person
residing at a distance, instead of transporting specie, which is
attended with expense and risk, or sending bank notes, which
are liable to be uncurrent at a distance from the banks that
issued them, he remits a bill of exchange, purchased at a bank
or elsewhere, and made payable to the proper person in or

near the place where he resides. Thus a man by paying
Boston funds in Boston, may put New York funds into the
hands of his New York agent.
IE 17. The Course of Exchange is the variation of the
cost of sight bills from their par value, as affected by the rela-
tive conditions of trade and commercial credit at the two places
between which exchange is made. It may be either at & pre-
mium or discount, and is rated at a certain per cent, on th.e
face of the bill. Bills payable a specified time after sight are
subject to discount, like notes of hand, for the term of credit
given. Hence their value in the money market is affected by
both the course of exchange and the discount for time.
IM8. Foreign Exchange relates to remittances made be-
tween different countries.
349. Domestic or Inland Exchange relates to remit-
tances made between different places in the same country.
An inland bill of exchange is commonly called a Draft.
In this work we shall treat only of Inland Exchange.

Then, multiplying $480 by 1.0245, we obtain $491.76, the Ans.
From these examples we derive the following
Rule. I. For sight drafts. — Multiply the face of the draft
by 1 plus the rate when exchange is at a premium, and by
1 minus the rate when exchange is at a discount.
II. For drafts payable after sight. — Find the proceeds of $1
at bank discount for the specified time, at the legal rate where
the draft is purchased; then add the rate of exchange when
at a premium, or subtract it when at a discount, and multiply
the face of the draft by this result.

being at 3| per cent, premium?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We find,
$369.72-^-1.027 = $360. Ans. bv Case T-that a draft
for $1 will cost $1.027;
hence the draft that will cost £369.72 must be for as many dollars as

6. A Philadelphia manufacturer is informed by his agent in
Buffalo that $3600 is due him on the sale of some property.
He instructs the agent to remit by a draft payable in 60 days
after sight, exchange being at £ per cent. premium. The agent,
by mistake, remits a sight draft, which, when received in Phila-
delphia, is accepted, and paid after the expiration of the three
days of grace. If the manufacturer immediately puts this
money at interest at the legal rate, will he gain or lose by the
blunder of his agent? Ans. He will lose $8.24-)-.
EQUATION OF.PAYMENTS.
352. Equation of Payments is the process of finding the
mean or equitable time of payment of several sums, due at
different times without interest.
:{•">:{. The Term of Credit is the time to elapse before a
debt becomes due.
Rule. Define equation of payments. Terra of credit.
334. The Average Term of Credit is the time to elapse
before several debts, due at different times, may all be paid
at once, without loss to debtor or creditor. -
'15S, The Equated Time is the date at which the several
debts may be canceled by one payment.
CASE I.
356. When all the terms of credit begin at the
.same date.
1. On the first day of January I find that I owe Mr. Smith-
8 dollars, to be paid in 5 months, 10 dollars to be paid in 2
months, and 12 dollars to be paid in 10 months; at what time
may I pay the whole amount?
OPERATION.
$ 8 X 5 = 40

12 X 10= 120
SO 180 -=- 30 = 6 mo., average time of credit.
Jan. 1. -)- 6 mo. = July 1, equated time of payment.
ANALYSIS. The whole amount to be paid, as seen above, is $30:
and we are to find how long it shall be withheld, or what term of
credit it shall have, as an equivalent for the various termsof credit
on the different items. Now, the value of credit on any sum is meas-
ured by the product of the money and time. And we say, the credit
on $8 for 5 mo. = the credit on $40 for 1 mo., because 8 X 5 = 40
X !• In the same manner, we have, the credit on $10 for 2 mo.=
the credit on $20 for 1 mo.; and the credit on $12 for 10mo. =
the credit on $120 for 1 mo. Hence, by addition, the value of the
several terms of credit on their respective sums equals a credit of 1
month on $180; and this equals a credit of 6 months on $30, be-
cause
30 X 6=180 X I-
RULE. I. Multiply each payment by its term of credit, and
divide the sum of the products by the sum of the payments; the
quotient will be the average term of credit.

AVERAGING CREDITS. 273
II. Add the average term of credit to the date at which, all
the credits begin, and the result will be the equated time of
payment.
NOTES. 1. The periods of time used as multipliers must all be of
the same denomination, and the quotient will be of the same denomi-
nation as the terms of credit; if these be months, and there be a re-
mainder after the division, continue the division to days by reduction,
always taking the nearest unit in the last result.
2. The several rules in equation of payments are based upon the
principle of bank discount; for they imply that the discount of a sum
paid before it is due equals the interest of the same, amount paid after
it is due.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
2. On the 25th of September a trader bought merchandise,
as follows: $700 on 20 days' credit; $400 on 30 days' credit;
$700 on 40 days' credit: what was the average term of credit,
and what the equated time of payment?

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
359. The Items of an account may be sums due at the
date of the transaction, or on credit for a specified time.
An account may have both a debit and a credit side, the
former marked Dr., the latter Cr. Suppose A and B have
dealings in which there is an interchange of money or prop-
erty; A keeps the account, heading it with B's name; the Dr.
side of the account shows what B has received from A; the
Cr. side shows what he has parted with to A.
360. The Balance of account is the difference of the two
eides, and may be in favor of either party.
If, in the transactions, one party has received nothing from
the other, the balance is simply the whole amount, and the
account has but one side. Bills of purchase are of this class.
Note. Book accounts bear interest after the expiration of the term
of credit, and notes after they become due.

Define items. Balance. To average an account. A focal date.
ANALYSIS. By reference to the example, it will be seen that the
items are due June 1, Oct. 12, and Aug. 16, as shown in the two
operations. In the first operation we use the earliest date, June 1,
as a focal date, and find the difference in days between this date and
each of the others, regard being had to the number of days in cal-
endar months. From June 1 to Oct. 12 is 133 da.; from June 1 to
Aug. 16 is 76 da. Hence the first item has no credit from June 1,
the second item has 133 days' credit from June 1, and the third
item has 76 days' credit from June 1, as appears in the column
marked da. After this we proceed precisely as in Case I, and find
the average credit,71 da., and the equated time.Aug. 11.
In the second operation, the latest date, Oct. 12, is taken for a
focal date; the work is explained thus: Suppose the account to be
settled Oct. 12. At that time the first item has been due 133 days;
and must therefore draw interest for this time. But interest on
$450 for 133 days = the interest on $59850 for 1 da. The second
item draws no interest, because it falls due Oct. 12. The third item
must draw interest 57 days. But interest on $250 for 57 days =
the interest on $14250 for 1 day. Taking the sum of the products,
we find the whole amount of interest due on the account, at Oct. 12,
equals the interest on $74100 for 1 day; and this, by division, is
found to be equal to the interest on $1200 for 62 days, which time
is the average term of interest. Hence the account would be settled
Oct. 12, by paying $1200 with interest on the same for 62 days. This
shows that 1200 has been due 62 days; that is, it falls due Aug. 11,
without interest. Hence the following
RULE. I. Find the time at which each item becomes due,
by adding to the date of each transaction the term of credit, ij
any be specified, and write these dates in a column.
II. Assume either the earliest or the latest date for a focal
date, and find the difference in days between the focal date and
each of the other dates, and write the results in a second column.
III. Write the items of the account in a third column, and

preceding column, writing the products in a final column.

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
ANALYSIS. In the above operation we have written the dates,
showing when the items become due on either side of the ac-
count, adding 3 days' grace to the time allowed to the draft. The
latest date, Oct. 20, is assumed as the focal date for both sides, and
the two columns marked da. show the difference in days between
each date and the focal date. The products are obtained as in the
last case, and a balance is struck between the items charged and the
products. These balances, being on the Dr. side, show that David
Ware, on the day of the focal date, Oct. 20, owes $600 with interest
on $35450 for 1 day. By division, this interest is found to be equal
to the interest on $600 for 59 days. The balance, $600, therefore,
has been due 59 days. Reckoning back from Oct. 12, we find the
date when the balance fell due, Aug. 22. Hence the following
RULE. I. Find the time when each item of the account is
due; and write the dates, in two columns, on the sides of the
account to which they respectively belong.
II. Use either the earliest or the latest of these dates as the
focal date for both sides, and find the products as in the last
case.
III. Divide the balance of the products by the balance of the
account; the quotient will be the interval of time, which must
be reckoned from the focal date TOWARD the other dates when
both balances are on the same side of the account, but FROM
the other dates when the balances are on opposite sides of the
account.

RATIO.
364. Eatio is the comparison with each other of two num-
bers of the same kind. It is of two kinds — arithmetical and
geometrical.
365. Arithmetical Eatio is the difference of the two
numbers.
366. Geometrical Eatio is the quotient of one number
divided by the other.
367. When we use the word ratio alone, it implies geo-
metrical ratio, and is expressed by the quotient arising from
dividing one number by the other. Thus, the ratio of 4 to 8
is 2, of 10 to 5 is £, &c.
368. Ratio is indicated in two ways.
1st. By placing two points between the numbers compared,
writing the divisor before and the dividend after the points.
Thus, the ratio of 5 to 7 is written 5:7; the ratio of 9 to
4 is written 9 : 4.
2d. In the form of a fraction; thus, the ratio of 9 to 3 is f;
the ratio of 4 to 6 is f.
369. The Terms are the two numbers compared.
370. The Antecedent is the first term.
371. The Consequent is the second term.
373. No comparison of two numbers can be fully ex-
plained but by instituting another comparison; thus, the com-
NOTE. It is thought best to omit the questions at the bottom of the passes, in the
remaining part of this work, leaving the teacher to use such as may be deemed ap-
propriate.
parison or relation of 4 to 8 cannot be fully expressed by 2,
nor of 8 to 4 by 4-. If the question were asked, what relation
4 bears to 8, or 8 to 4, in respect to magnitude, the answer 2,
or £, would not be complete nor correct. But if we make
unity the standard of comparison, and use it as one of the
terms In illustrating the relation of the two numbers, and
say that the ratio or relation of 4 to 8 is the same as 1 to 2,
or the ratio of 8 to 4 is the same as 1 to £, unity in both cases
being the standard of comparison, then the whole meaning is
conveyed.
373. A Direct Ratio arises from dividing the consequent
by the antecedent.
374. An Inverse or Reciprocal Ratio is obtained by di-
viding the antecedent by the consequent. Thus, the direct
ratio of 5 to 15 is -i^ = 3; and the inverse ratio of 5 to 15 is~
A = i-
375. A Simple Ratio consists of a single couplet; as
3:12.
376. A Compound Ratio is the product of two or more
simple ratios. Thus, the compound ratio formed from the
simple ratios of3:6and8:2is|X§ = 3X8:6X2 =
*! = *•
377. In comparing numbers with each other, they must
be of the same kind, and of the same denomination.
378. The ratio of two fractions is obtained by dividing
the second by the first; or by reducing them to a common de-
nominator, when they are to each other as their numerators.
Thus, the ratio of TV : f is f -7- -fa = •}% = 2, which is the
same as the ratio of the numerator 3 to the numerator 6 of
the equivalent fractions -^ and T6,r.
Since the antecedent is a divisor and the consequent a divi-
dend, any change in either or both terms will be governed by
the general principles of division, (87.) We have only to
substitute the terms antecedent, consequent, and ratio, for divi-
sor, dividend, and quotient, and these principles become
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RATIO.
PRIN. I. Multiplying the consequent multiplies the ratio;
dividing the consequent divides the ratio.
PRIN. II. Multiplying the antecedent divides the ratio; di-
viding the antecedent multiplies the ratio.
PKIN. III. Multiplying or dividing both antecedent and con-
sequent by the same number does not alter the ratio.
These three principles may be embraced in one
GENERAL LAW.
A change in the consequent produces a LIKE change in the
ratio; but a change in the antecedent produces an OPPOSITE
change in the ratio.
•$7O. Since the ratio of two numbers is equal to the con-
sequent divided by the antecedent, it follows, that
1. The antecedent is equal to the consequent divided by
the ratio; and that,
2. The consequent is equal to the antecedent multiplied by
the ratio.

PROPORTION.
380. Proportion is an equality of ratios. Thus, the ratios
6 : 4 and 12 : 8, each being equal to §, form a proportion.
381. Proportion is indicated in two ways.
1st. By a double colon placed between the two ratios i thus,
2 : 5 :: 4 : 10.
2d. By the sign of equality placed between the two ratios;
thus, 2 : 5 = 4 : 10.
383. Since each ratio consists of two terms, every pro-
portion must consist of at least four terms.
383. The Extremes are the first and fourth terms.
384. The Means are the second and third terms.
385. Three numbers may be in proportion when the first
is to the second as the second is to the third. Thus, the num-
bers 3, 9, and 27 are in proportion since 3 : 9 :: 9 : 27, the
ratio of each couplet being 3.
In such a proportion the second term is said to be a mean
proportional between the other two.
386. In every proportion the product of the extremes is
equal to the product of the means. Thus, in the proportion
3 : 5 :: 6 : 10 we have 3 X 10 = 5 X 6.
SIMPLE PROPORTION. 283
387. Four numbers tliat-are proportional in the direct
order are proportional by inversion, and also by alternation, or
by inverting the means. Thus, the proportion 2 : 3 :: 6 : 9,
by inversion becomes 8 : 2 :: 9 : G, and by alternation 2 : 6 : s
3:9.
J| $8 From the preceding principles and illustrations, it
follows that, any three terms of a proportion being given, the
fourth may readily be found by the following
Rule. I. Divide the product of the extremes by one of the
means, and the quotient will be the other mean. Or,
II. Divide the product of the means by one of the extremes,
and the quotient will be the other extreme.

SIMPLE PROPORTION.
389. Simple Proportion is an equality of two simple
ratios, and consists of four terms, any three of which being
given, the fourth may readily be found.
300. Every question in simple proportion involves the
principle of cause and effect.
301. Causes may be regarded as action, of whatever
kind, the producer, the consumer, men, animals, time, distance,
weight, goods bought or sold, money at interest, &c.
302* Effects may be regarded as whatever is accom-
plished by action of any kind, the thing produced or consumed,
money paid, &c.
3*13. Causes and effects are of two kinds — simple and
compound.
394. A Simple Cause, or Effect, contains but one element;
as goods purchased or sold, and the money paid or received
for them.
395. A Compound Cause, or Effect, is the product of two
or more elements; as men at work taken in connection with
time, and the result produced by them taken in connection
with dimensions, length and breadth, &c. -
39G. Causes and effects that admit of computation, that
is, involve the idea of quantity, may be represented by num-
bers, which will have the same relation to each other as the
things they represent. And since it is a principle of philoso-
phy that like causes produce like effects, and that effects are
always in proportion to their causes, we-have the following
proportions:
1st Cause : 2d Cause : : 1st Effect : 2d Effect.
Or, 1st Effect : 2d Effect :: 1st Cause : 2d Cause;
in which the two causes, or the two effects forming one coup-
let, must be like numbers, and of the same denomination.
Considering all the terms of the proportion as abstract num-
bers, we may say that
1st Cause : 1st Effect : : 2d Cause : 2d Effect,
•which will produce the same numerical result.
But as ratio is the result of comparing two numbers or
things of the same kind (377), the first form is regarded as
the most natural and philosophical.
397. Simple causes and simple effects give rise to simple
ratios; compound causes and compound effects to compound
ratios.

Since the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the
means (373), and the product of the means divided by one of the
extremes will give the other; (blank) dollars will be equal to the
product oT3 X 30 divided by 5, which is $18, Ans.
2. If 15 barrels of flour cost $90, how many barrels can be
bought for $30?
Analysis. In this ex-
ample a cause is required,
and the statement may be
read thus: If 15 barrels'
cost $90, how many or
(blank) barrels will cost
$30? The; roduct of the
extremes, 30 X 15, di-
vided by the given mean,
90, will give the required
term, 5, as shown in the operation. Hence we deduce the following
Rule. I. Arrange the terms in the statement so that the
causes shall compose one couplet. and the effects the other, put-
ting ( ) in the place of the required term. .
II. If the required term be an extreme, divide the product
of the means by the given extreme; if the required term be a
mean, divide the product of the extremes by the given mean.
Notes. 1. If the terms of any couplet be of different denominations,
they must be reduced to the same unit value.
2. If the odd term be a compound number, it must be reduced to its
lowest unit.
3. If the divisor and dividend contain one or more factors common
to both, they should be canceled. If any of the terms of a proportion
contain mixed numbers, they should first be changed to improper frac-
tions, or the fractional part to a decimal.
i. When the vertical line is used, the divisor and the required term
are written on the left, and the terms of the dividend on the right.
39O. We will now give another method of solving ques-
tions in simple proportion, without making the statement, and
which may be used, by those who prefer it, to the one already
given. We will term it the
SECOND METHOD.
Every question which properly belongs to simple propor-
tion must contain four numbers, at least three of which must
be given (38O). Of the three given numbers, one must
always be of the same denomination as the required number.
The remaining two will be like numbers, and bea.r.the same
relation to each other that the third does to the required num-
ber; in other words, the ratio of the third to the required
number will be the same as the ratio of the other two num-r
bers.
Regarding the third or odd term as the antecedent of the sec-
ond couplet of a proportion, we find the consequent or required
term by multiplying the antecedent by the ratio (37O).
By comparing the two like numbers, in any given question,
•with the third, we may readily determine whether the answer,
or required term, will be greater or less than the third term;
if greater, then the ratio will be greater than 1, and the two
like numbers may be arranged in the form of an improper
fraction as a multiplier; if the answer, or required term, is to
be less than the third'term, then the ratio will be less than 1,
and the two like numbers may be arranged in the form of a
proper fraction, as a multiplier.
1. If 4 cords of wood cost $12, what will 20 cords cost?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. It will
I^3 X 20 be readily seen in this
12 X ^, written — = $60. example,"that 4 cords
^ and 20 cords are the
like terms, and that
$12 is the third term, and of the same denomination as the answer
or required term.
If 4 cords cost $12, will 20 cords cost more, or less, than 4 cords?
evidently more: then the answer or required term will be greater
than the third term, and the ratio greater than 1. The ratio of 4
cords to 20 cords is ^, or 5; hence the ratio of $12 to the answer
must be 5, and the answer will be %£ or 5 times $12, which is $60.
2. If 12 yards of cloth cost $48, what will 4 yards cost?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. In this example we
48 X -fa — $16, Ans. see that 12 yards and 4 yards are
the like terms and $48 the third
term, and of the same denomination as the required answer.
If 12 yards cost $48, will 4 yards cost more or less than 12 yards?
less: then the ratio will be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper
fraction. The ratio of 12 yards to 4 yards is ^; hence the ratio of
$48 to the answer is fa, and the answer will be fa times $48, which
is $16. Hence the following
RULE. I. With the two given numbers, which are of the
same name or kind, form a ratio greater or less than 1, accord-
ing as the answer is to be greater or less than the third given
number.
II. Multiply the third number by this ratio, and the product
•will be the required number or answer.
NOTE. 1. Mixed numbers should first be reduced to improper frac-
tions, and the ratio of the fractions found according to (378 )•
2. Reductions and cancellation may be applied as in the first method.
The following examples may be solved by either of the
foregoing methods.

will dig a ditch how many, or
(blank) feet long, 3 feet wide,

Hence we have the following

the causes, and those which constitute the effects, and arrange
them in couplets, putting ( ) in place of the required term.

product of the extremes a divisor; but if the blank term occur
in either mean, make the product of the extremes a dividend,
and the product of the means a divisor.
NOTES. 1. The causes must be exactly alike in the number and kind
of their terms; the same is true of the effects.
2. The same preparation of the terms by reduction is to be observed
as in simple proportion.
1O1. We will now solve an example according to the
Second Method given in Simple Proportion.
1. If 18 men can build 42 rods of wall in 16 days, how
many men can build 28 rods in 8 days?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We see in
$$4 ^02 this example that all the
X&t X — X = 24.-men. terms appear in couplets,
4$ ^ except one, which is 18
men, and that is of the same kind as the required answer.
Since compound proportion is made up of two or more simple
proportions, if this third or odd term be multiplied by the compound
ratio, or by the simple ratio of each couplet successively, the prod-
uct will be the required term.
By comparing the terms of each couplet with the third term we
may readily determine whether the answer, or term sought, will be
greater or less than the third term; if greater, then the ratio will be
greater than 1, and the multiplier an improper fraction; if less, the
ratio will be less than 1, and the multiplier a.proper fraction.
First we will compare the terms composing the first couplet, 42
rods and 28 rods, with the third term, 18 men. If 42 rods require
18 men, how many men will 28 rods require? less men; hence the
ratio is less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction, £|; next,
if 16 days require 18 men, how many men will 8 days require?
more men; hence the ratio is greater than 1, and the multiplier an
improper fraction, *£. Regarding the third term as the antecedent
of a couplet, the consequent being the term sought, if we multiply
this third term by the simple ratios, or by their product, we shall
have the required term or answer, thus: 18 X ff X -^ = 24, as
shown in the operation.
2. 5 compositors, in 16 days, of 14 hours each, can compose
20 sheets of 24 pages in each sheet, 50 lines in a page, and
40 letters in a line; in how many days, of 7 hours each, will
10 compositors compose a volume to be printed in the same
letter, containing 40 sheets, 16 pages in a sheet, 6O lines in a
page, and 50 letters in a line? Ans. 32 days.

BY CANCELLATION. ANALYSIS. The required term or an-
16 swer is to be in days; and we see that
«j all the terms appear in pairs or couplets,
r. except the 16 days, which is of the same
* kind as the answer sought.'
^0 We will proceed to compare the terms
^02 of each couplet with the 16 days. First,
rf*j if 5 compositors require 16 days, how
^ many days will 10 compositors require?
ft" less days; hence the multiplier is the
32 days, Ans. proper fraction ^, and we have 16 X &•
Next, if 14 hours a day require 16 days,
how many days will 7 hours a day require? more days; hence the
multiplier is the improper fraction ty, and we have 16 X fy X ty-
Next, if 20 sheets require 16 days, how many days will 40 sheets
require? more days; hence the multiplier is the improper fraction
$%, and we have 16 X (5j X V X f J- Pursuing the same method
with the other couplets, we obtain the result as shown in the opera-
tion. Hence we have the following
RULE. I. Of the terms composing each couplet form a
ratio greater or less than 1, in the same manner as if the
answer depended on those two and the third or odd term.
II. Multiply the third or odd term by these ratios successively,
and the product will be the answer'sought.
NOTE. By the odd term is meant the one that is of the same kind
as the answer.
The following examples may be solved by either of the
given methods.

294 PARTNERSHIP.
PARTNERSHIP.
402. Partnership is a relation established between two
or more persons in trade, by which they agree to share the
profits and losses of business.
403. The Partners are the individuals thus associated.
404. Capital, or Stock, is the money or property invested
i:i trade.
4 05. A Dividend is the profit to be divided.
400. An Assessment is a tax to meet losses sustained.
CASE I.
407. To find each partner's share of the profit or
loss, when their capital is employed for equal periods of
time.

the profit or loss will have the same ratio to the whole profit or
loss that his share of the stock has to the whole stock, A will have
i of the entire profit, and B ^, as shown in the operation.
We may also regard the whole capital as the first cause,
find each man's share of the capital as the second cause, the
whole profit or loss as theirs* effect, and each man's share of the
profit or loss as the second effect, and solve by proportion thus:

CASE II.
408. To find each partner's share of the profit or
loss when their capital is employed for unequal periods
of time.
It is evident that the respective shares of profit and loss will
depend upon two conditions, viz.: the amount of capital in-
vested by each, and the time it is employed.
1. Two persons -form a partnership; A puts in $450 for
7 months, and B $300 for 9 months; they lose $156; how.
much is each man's share of the loss?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. The

tire capital for 1 month is equivalent to $3150 -f- $2700 = $5850.
If the loss, $156, be divided between the two partners, according to
Case I, the results will be the loss of each as shown in the operation.

Examples of this kind may also be solved by proportion as in
Case I, the causes being compounded of capital and time; thus,

Hence the following
RULE. Multiply each man's capital by the time it is em-
ployed in trade, and add the products. Then multiply the
entire profit or loss by the ratio of the sum of the products to
each product, and the results will be the respective shares of
profit or loss of each partner. Or,
Multiply each man.s capital by tfte time it is employed in
trade, and regard each product as his capital, and the sum of
the products as the entire capital, and solve by proportion, as in
Case I.

ANALYSIS.
409. Analysis, in arithmetic, is the process of solving
problems independently of set rules, by tracing the relations
of the given numbers and the reasons of the separate steps of
the operation according to the special conditions of each question.
41 Ot In solving questions by analysis, we- generally reason
from the given number to unity, or 1, and then from unity, or
1, to the required number.
411. United States money is reckoned in dollars, dimes,
cents,andmills(180),one dollar being uniformly valued in all
the States at 100 cents; but in most of the States money is
sometimes still reckoned in pounds, shillings, and pence.
Note. At the time of the adoption of our decimal currency by
Congress, in 1786, the colonial currency, or bills of credit, issued by the
colonies, had depreciated in value, and this depreciation, being unequal
in the different colonies, gave rise to the different values of the State
currencies; and this variation continues wherever the denominations of
shillings and pence are in use.

the expressions containing both wheat and corn, we readily find the
cost of 1 bushel of corn to be 64 cents.

Now, if we take what any two of them do in 1 day from what the

thus find that A does -fa, B -f^, and C ^y.
Next, if we denote the whole work by 1, and divide it by the part
each does in 1 day, we have the number of days that it will take
each to do it alone, viz.: A 26§ days, B 40 days, and C 20 days.
And each should receive such a part of $270 as would be ex-
pressed by the part he does in 1 day, multiplied by the number of
days he works, which will give to A $90, B $60, and C $120.

ALLIGATION MEDIAL. 307
ALLIGATION.
413.. Alligation treats of mixing or compounding two or
more ingredients of different values. It is of two kinds — Alli-
gation Medial and Alligation Alternate.
414. Alligation Medial is the process of finding the aver-
age price or quality of a compound of several simple ingredi-
ents whose prices or qualities are known.
1. A miller mixes 40 bushels of rye worth 80 cents a
bushel, and 25 bushels of corn worth 70 cents a bushel, with
15 bushels of wheat worth $1.50 a bushel; what is the value
of a bushel of the mixture?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since 40 bushels
80 X 40 = $32.00 of rye at 80 cents a bushel is
70X25=' 17.50 worth $32, and 25 bushels of corn
1 50 X 15 = 22 50 a* "^ cents a bushel is worth
— — $17.50, and 15 bushels of wheat
80 ) 72.00 at $1.50 a bushel is worth $22.50,'
therefore the entire mixture, con-
.
sisting 01 80 bushels, is worth
$72, and one bushel is worth -fa of $72, or 72 -=- 80 = $.90.
Hence the following
RULE. Divide the entire cost or value of the ingredients
by the sum of the simples.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
2. A wine merchant mixes 12 gallons of wine, at $1 per
gallon, with 5 gallons of brandy worth $1.50 per gallon, and
3 gallons of water of no value; what is the worth of one gal-
lon of the mixture? Ans. $.975.
3. An innkeeper mixed 13 gallons of water with 52 gallons
of brandy, which cost him $1.25 per gallon; what is the value
of 1 gallon of the mixture, and what his profit on the sale of
the whole at 6£ cents per gill? Ans. $1 a gallon ; $65 profit.
4. A grocer mixed 10 pounds of sugar at 8 cts. with 12
pounds at 9 cts. and 16 pounds at 11 cts., and sold the mixture
at 10 cents per pound; did he gain or lose by the sale, and
how much? Ans. He gained 16 cts.
308 ALLIGATION ALTERNATE.
5. A grocer bought 71 dozen of eggs at 12 cents a dozen,
8 dozen at 10^- cents a dozen, 9 dozen at 11 cents a dozen,
and 10£ dozen at 10 cents a dozen. lie sells them so as to
make 50 per cent. on the cost; how much did he receive per
dozen? Ans. 16£ cents.
6. Bought 4 cheeses, each weighing 50 pounds, at 13 cents
a pound; 10, weighing 40 pounds each, at 10 cents a pound;
j,nd. 24, weighing 25 pounds each, at 7 cents a pound; I sold
the whole at an average price of 9£ cents a pound; how much
v.'as my whole gain? Ans. $6.
41.5. Alligation Alternate is the process of finding the
proportional quantities to be taken of several ingredients,
whose prices or qualities are known, to form a mixture of a
required price or quality.
CASE I.
416. To find the proportional quantity to be used
of each ingredient, when the mean price or quality of
the mixture is given.
1. What relative quantities of timothy seed worth $2 a
bushel, and clover seed worth $7 a bushel, must be used to
form a mixture worth $5 a bushel?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since on every in-
2 -J 2 ") gradient used whose price or qual-
7 JL 3 ) ity is less than the mean rate there
will be a gain, and on every in-
gredient whose price or quality is greater than the mean rate
there will be a loss, and since the gains and losses must be exactly
equal, the relative quantities Used of each should be such as repre-
sent the unit of value. By selling one bushel of timothy seed worth
$2, for $5, there is a gain of $3; and to gain $1 would require £ of
a bushel, which we place opposite the 2. By selling one bushel of
clover seed worth $7, for $5, there is a loss of $2; and to lose $1
would require \ of a bushel, which we place opposite the 7.
In every case, to find the unit of value we must divide $1 by the
gain or loss per bushel or pound, &c. Hence, if, every time we take
\ of a bushel of timothy seed, we take \ of a bushel of clover seed,
the gain and loss will be exactly equal, and we shall have £ and \
for the proportional quantities.

If we wish to express the proportional numbers in integers, we
may reduce these fractions to a common denominator, and use their
numerators, since fractions having a common denominator are to
each other as their numerators. ( 37§ ) thus, J and \ are equal to
| and |, and the proportional quantities are 2 bushels of timothy
seed to 3 bushels of clover seed.
2. What proportions of teas worth respectively 3, 4, 7 and
10 shillings a pound, must be taken to form a mixture worth
6 shillings a pound?
ANALYSIS. To preserve the
equality of gains and losses, we
must always compare two prices
or simples, one greater and one
less than the mean rate, and
treat each pair or couplet as a
separate example. In the given
example we form two couplets,
and may compare either 3 and 10, 4 and 7, or 3 and 7, 4 and 10.
We find that J of a Ib. at 3 s. must be taken to gain 1 shilling,
and ^ of a Ib. at 10 s. to lose 1 shilling ; also £ of a Ib. at 4 s. to gain
1 shilling, and 1 Ib. at 7 s. to lose 1 shilling. These proportional
numbers, obtained by comparing the two couplets, are placed in
columns 1 and 2. If, now, we reduce the numbers in columns 1 and
2 to a common denominator, and use their numerators, we obtain
the integral numbers in columns 3 and 4, which, being arranged in
column 5, give the proportional quantities to be taken of each.*
It will be seen that in comparing tha simples of any couplet, one
of which is greater, and the other less than the mean rate, the pro-
portional number finally obtained for either term is the difference
between the mean rate and the other term. Thus, in comparing 3
and 10, the proportional number of the former is 4, which is the
difference between 10 and the mean rate 6; and the proportional
number of the latter is 3, which is the difference between 3 and the
mean rate. The same is true of every other couplet. Hence, when
the simples and the mean rate are integers, the intermediate steps
taken to obtain the final proportional numbers as in columns 1, 2, 3,
and 4, may be omitted, and the same results readily found by taking
the difference between each simple and the mean rate, and placing
it opposite the one with which it is compared.
* Prof. A. B. Canfleld, of Oneida Conference Seminary, N. Y., used this method ol
Alligation, essentially, In the instruction of his classes as early as 1846, and he was
doubtless the author of it.
From the foregoing examples and analyses we derive the following
Rri.i;. I. Write the several prices or qualities in a column,
and the mean price or quality of the mixture at the left.
II. Form couplets by comparing any price or quality less,
with one that is greater than the mean rale, placing the part
which must be used to gain 1 of the mean rate opposite the less
simple, and the part that must be used to lose 1 opposite the
greater simple, and do the same for each simple in every couplet.
HI. If the proportional numbers are fractional, they may be
reduced to integers, and if two or more stand in the same hori-
zontal line, they must be added; the final results will be the pro-
portional quantities required.
NOTES. 1. If the numbers in any couplet or column have a com-
mon factor, it may be rejected.
2. We may also multiply the numbers in any couplet or column by
any multiplier we choose, without affecting the equality of the gains
and losses, and thus obtain an indefinite number of results, any one of
which being taken will give a correct final result.

and barley worth 84 cents per bushel; he desires to form a

•he take?

5J5
Ans.
the same process
as in Case I we
find the propor-
tional quantities
cf each to be 4 bushels of oats, 8 of corn, and 10 of barley. But
•we wish to use 40 bushels of corn, which is 5 times the propor-
tional number 8, and to preserve the equality of gain and loss we
must take 5 times the proportional quantity of each of the other
simples, or 5 X 4 r= 20 bushels of oats, and 5 X 10 = 50 bushels
of barley. Hence the following
RULE. Find the proportional quantities as in Case I.
Divide the given quantity by the proportional quantity of the
same ingredient, and multiply each of the other proportional
quantities by the quotient thus obtained.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
2. A merchant has teas worth 40, 60, 75, and 90 cents per

6. A merchant mixed 80 pounds of sugar worth 6£ cents
per pound' with some worth 8^ cents and 10 cents per pound,
so that the mixture was worth 7£ cents per pound; how much
of each kind did he uso?
CASE III.
418. When the quantity of the whole compound is
limited.
1. A grocer has sugars worth 6 cents, 7 cents, 12 cents,
and 13 cents per pound. He wishes to make a mixture of
120 pounds worth 10 cents a pound; how many pounds of
each kind must he use?
ANALYSIS. By Case
I we find the propor-
tional quantities of each
to be 31bs. at 6 cts., 2
Ibs. at 7 cts., 3 Ibs at 12
cts., and 4 Ibs. at 13 cts.
By adding the propor-
tional quantities, we find
that the mixture would be but 12 Ibs. while the required mixture is
120, or 10 times 12. If the whole mixture is to be 10 times as much
as the sum of the proportional quantities, then the quantity-of each
simple used must be 10 times as much as its respective proportion-
al, which would require 30 Ibs. at 6 cts., 20 Ibs. at 7 cts., 30 Ibs. at
12 cts., and 40 Ibs. at 13 «ts. Hence we deduce the following
RULE. Find the proportional numbers as in Case I. Di-
vide the given quantity by the sum of the proportional quan-
tities, and multiply each of the proportional quantities by the
quotient thus obtained. ^-

419. A Power is the product arising from multiplying a
number by itself, or repeating it several times as a factor;
thus, in 2 X 2 X 2 = 8, the product, 8, is a power of 2.
420. The Exponent of a power is the number denoting
how many times the factor is repeated to produce the power,
and is written above and a little to the right of the factor; thus,
2 X 2 X 2 is written 23, in which 3 is the exponent. Exponents
likewise give names to the powers, as will be seen in the
following illustrations:
3 = 3l r= 3, the first power of 3;
3X3 = 32 = 9, the second power of 3
3X3X3 = 33 = 27, the third power of 3.
421. The Square of a number is its second power.
432. The Cube of a number is its third power.

434. A Perfect Power is a number that can be exactly
produced by the involution of some number as a root; thus, 25
and 32 are perfect powers, since 25 = 5 X 5, and 32 = 2 X
2X2X2X2.

times as a factor. Hence, we have the following
Rule. Multiply the number by itself as many times, less 1,
as there are units in the exponent of the required power.

SQUARE BOOT. 315
426. Evolution is the process of extracting the root of a
number considered as a power, and is the reverse of Involution.
437. The Eadical Sign is the character, •>/, which, placed
before a number, denotes that its root is to be extracted.
428. The Index of the root is the figure placed above the
radical sign, to denote what root is to be taken. When no
index is written, the index 2 is always understood.
429. A Surd is the indicated root of an imperfect power.
430. Roots are named from the corresponding powers, as
will be seen in the following illustrations:
The square root of 9 is 3, written ^/9 = 3.
The cube root of 27 is 3, written ^27 = 3.
The fourth root of 81 is 3, written ^81 = 3.
431« Any number whatever may be considered a power
whose root is to be extracted; but only the perfect powers can
have exact roots.
SQUARE ROOT.
432. The Square Eoot of a number is one of the two
equal factors that produce the number; thus the square root
of 49 is 7, for 7 X 7 = 49.
433. In extracting the square root, the first thing to be
determined is the relative number of places in a given number
and its square root. The law governing this relation is exhib-
ited in the following examples : —
Root?. Squares. Roots. Squares.
Ill 1
9 81 10 1,00
99 98,01 100 1,00,00
999 99,80,01 1000 1,00,00,00
From these examples we perceive
1st. That a root consisting of 1 place may have 1 or 2
places in the square.
2d. That in all cases the addition of 1 place to the root
adds 2 places to the square. Hence,
If we point off a number into two-figure periods, commen-
cing at the right hand, the number of full periods and the left
hand full or partial period will indicate the number of places
in the square root; the highest period answering to the highest
figure of the root.
434. 1. What is the length of one side of a square plat
containing an area of 5417 sq. ft.?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since the given figure is
54,17 | 73 6 a square, its side will be the square root
49 of its area, which we will proceed to com-
pute. Pointing off the given number, the
"2 periods show that. there will be two in-
143 429 tegral figures, tens and units, in the root.
146.0 8800 Tne tens of tne root inust be extracted
1466 87 96 from the first or left hand period, 54 hun-
• dreds. The greatest square in 54 hun-
4 dreds is 49 hundreds, the square of 7 tens;
we therefore write 7 tens in the root, at
the right of the given number.
Since the entire root is to be the side of a square, let us form a
Fig. I. square (Fig. I), the side of which is 70 feet long.
The area of this square is 70 X 70 = 4900 sq. ft.,
which we subtract from the given number. Tin's
is done in the operation by subtracting the
square number, 49, from the first period, 54,
and to the remainder bringing down the sec-
ond period, making the entire remainder 517.
If we now enlarge our square (Fig. I) by the addition of 517
square feet, in such a manner as to preserve the square form, ita
size will be that of the required square. To preserve the square
form, the addition must be so made as to extend the square equally
in two directions ; it will therefore be composed of 2 oblong figures
at the sides, and a little square at the corner (Fig. II). Now, the
width of this addition will be the additional length to the side of the
square, and consequently the next figure in the root. To find width
we divide square contents, or area, by length. But the length of
one side of the little square cannot be found till the width of the
addition be determined, because it is equal to this width. We will
therefore add the lengths of the 2 oblong figures, and the sum will
be sufficiently near the whole length to be used as a trial divisor.

Fig. II.
Each of the oblong figures is equal in length to the side of the
square first formed; and their united length
is 70 + 70 = 140 ft. (Fig. III). This num-
ber is obtained in the operation by doubling
the 7 and annexing 1 cipher, the result being
written at the left of the dividend. Dividing
517, the area, by 140, the approximate length,
we obtain 3, the probable width of the addi-
tion, and second figure of the root. Since 3 is
also the side of the little square, we can now
Fig. III.

a
Trial Divisor — 140
Complete Divisor= 143
find the entire length of the addition, or the complete divisor, which
is 70 + 70 + 3 = 143 (Fig. III).
This number is found in the oper-
ation by adding 3 to the trial di-
visor, and writing the result un-
derneath. Multiplying the com-
plete divisor, 143, by the trial
quotient figure, 3, and subtracting
the product from the dividend, we
obtain another remainder of 88 square feet. With this remainder,
for the same reason as before, we must proceed to make a new
enlargement; and we bring down two decimal ciphers, because the
next figure of the root, being tenths, its square will be hundredths.
The trial divisor to obtain the width of this new enlargement,
or the next figure in the root, will be, for the same reason as
before, twice 73, the root already found, with one cipher annexed.
But since the 7 has already been doubled in the operation, we have
only to double the last figure of the complete divisor, 143, and
annex a cipher, to obtain the new trial divisor, 146.0. Dividing, we
obtain .6 for the trial figure of the root; then proceeding as before,
we obtain 146.6 for a complete divisor, 87.96 for a product; and
there is still a remainder of .04. Hence, the side of the given
square plat is 73.6 feet, nearly. From this example and analysis
we deduce the following
RULE. I. Point off the given number into periods of two
figures each, counting from unit's place toward the left and
right.
II. Find the greatest square number in the left hand period,
and write its root for the first figure in the root; subtract the
square number from the left hand period, and to the remainder
dawn the next period for a dividend.
III. At the left of the dividend write twice the first figure of
the root, and annex one cipher, for a trial divisor; divide the
dividend by the trial divisor, and write the quotient for a trial
figure in the root.
IV. Add the trial figure of the root to the trial divisor for a
complete divisor; multiply the complete divisor by the trial
figure in the root, and subtract the product from the dividend,
and to the remainder bring down the next period for a new
dividend.
V. To the last complete divisor add the last figure of the
root, and to the sum annex one cipltcr, for a new trial divisor,
with which proceed as before.
NOTES. 1. If at any time the product be greater than the dividend,
diminish the trial figure of the root, and correct the erroneous work.
2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex another cipher to the trial
divisor, and another period to the dividend, and proceed as before.

CUBE BOOT.
442. The Cube Boot of a number is one of the three
equal factors that produce the number. Thus,"the cube root
of 27 is 3, since 3 X 3 X 3 = 27.
443. In extracting the cube root, the first thing to be
determined is the relative number of places in a cube and its
root. The law governing this relation is exhibited in the fol-
lowing examples : —
Hoots. Cubes. Roots. Cubes.
Ill 1
9 729 10 1,000
99 907,299 100 1,000,000
999 997,002,999 1000 1,000,000,000
From these examples, we perceive,
1st . That a root consisting of 1 place may have from 1 to
3 places in the cube.
2d. That in all cases the addition of 1 place to the root
adds three places to the cube. Hence,
If we point off a number into three-figure periods, com-
mencing at the right hand, the number of full periods and the
left hand full or partial period wibl indicate the number of
places in the cube root, the highest period answering to the
highest figure of the roof.
444. 1. What is the length of one side of a cubical block
containing 413494 solid inches?
OPERATION — COMMENCED. ANALYSIS. Since the block is a
413494 | 74 cube, its side will be the cube root of
343 its solid contents, which we will pro-
compute. Pointing off the
1470070494 •
given number, the two periods show
that there will be two figures, tens and
units, in the root. The tens of the root must be extracted from the
first period, 413 thousands. The greatest cube in 413 thousands is
343 thousands, the cube of 7 tens; we therefore write 7 tens in the
root at the right of the given number.
323

Since the entire root is to be the side of a cube, let us form a
cubical block (Fig. I), the side
of which is 70 inches in length.
The contents of this cube are
70 X 70 X 70 = 343,000 solid
inches, which we subtract from
the given number. This is done
in the operation by subtracting
the cube number, 343, from the
first period, 413, and to the re-
mainder bringing down the sec-
JS oud period, making the entire
'remainder 70494.
If we now enlarge our cubical
block, (Fig. I), by the addition of 70494 solid inches, in such a
manner as to preserve the cubical form, its size will be that of
the required block. To preserve the cubical form, the addition
must be made upon three adjacent sides or faces. The addition
will therefore be composed of 3 flat blocks to cover the 3 faces,
(Fig. II); 3 oblong blocks to fill the vacancies at the edges,
(Fig. Ill); and 1 small cubical block to fill the vacancy at the cor-
ner, (Fig. IV). Now, the thickness of this enlargement will be the
additional length of the side of the cube, and, consequently, the
second figure in the root. To find thickness, we may divide solid
- 'I- contents by surface, or area.
But the area of the 3 oblong
blocks and little cube cannot
be found till the thickness of
the addition be determined, be-
cause their common breadth is
equal to this thickness. We will
therefore find the area of the
three flat blocks, which is suffi-
ciently near the whole area to bo
used as a trial divisor. As these
are each equal in length and
breadth to the side of the cube
whose faces they cover, the whole
area of the three is 70 X 70 X
3 = 14700 square inches. This number is obtained in the operation
by annexing 2 ciphers to three times the square of 7; the result
being written at the left hand of the dividend. Dividing, we obtain

4, the probable thickness of the addition, and second figure of the
root. With this assumed figure,
we will complete our divisor by
adding the area of the 4 blocks,
before undetermined. The 3 ob-
long blocks are each 70 inches
long; and the little cube, being
equal in each of its dimensions
to the thickness of the addition,
must be 4 inches long. Hence,
their united length is 70 + 70
+ 70 + 4 = 214. This number
is obtained in the operation by
multiplying the 7 by 3, and an-
nexing the 4 to the product, the
result being written in column
I, on the next line below the
trial divisor. Multiplying 214,
the length, by 4, the common
width, we obtain 856, the area of
the four blocks, which added to
14700, the trial divisor, makes
15556, the complete divisor; and
multiplying this by 4, the second
figure in the root, and subtract-
ing the product from the divi-
dend, we obtain a remainder of
0270 solid inches. With this re-
mainder, for the same reason as
before, we must proceed to make
a new enlargement. But since
we have already two figures in
the root, answering to the two
periods of the given number,
the next figure of the root must
be a decimal; and we therefore
annex to the remainder a period
of three decimal ciphers, mak-
ing 8270.000 for a new dividend.
The trial divisor to obtain the
thickness of this second enlarge-
ment, or the next figure of the root, will be the area of three new flat
blocks to cover the threa sides of the cube already formed; and this

surface, (Fig. IV,) is composed of 1 face of each of the flat blocks
already used, 2 faces of each of the oblong blocks, and 3 faces of
the little cube. But we have in the complete divisor, 15556, 1
face of each of the flat blocks, oblong blocks, and little cube;
and in the correction of the trial divisor, 856, 1 face of each of
the oblong blocks and of the little cube; and in the square of
the last root figure, 16, a third face of the little cube. Hence, 16

thus: 16, 6, and 6 are 28, and we write the unit figure in the new
trial divisor; then 2 to carry, and 5 and 5 are 12, &c. We annex
2 ciphers to this trial divisor, as to the former, and dividing, obtain
5, the third figure in the root. To complete the second trial di-
visor, after the manner of the first, the correction may be found by
annexing .5 to 3 times the former figures, 74, and multiplying this
number by .5. But as we have, in column I, 3 times 7, with 4
annexed, or 214, we need only multiply the last figure, 4, by 3,
and annex .5, making 222.5, which multiplied by .5 gives 111.25,
the correction required. Then we obtain the complete divisor,
16539.25, the product, 8269.625, and the remainder, .375, in the
manner shown by the former steps. From this example and analysis
we deduce the following
RULE. I. Point off the given number into periods of three
figures each, counting from units' place toward the left and right.

period, and write its root for the first figure in the required
root; subtract the cube from the left hand period, and to the
remainder bring down the next period for a dividend.

the complete divisor.
V. Multiply the complete divisor by the trial figure, and
subtract the product from the dividend, and to the remainder
bring down the next period for a new dividend.
VI. Add the square of the last figure of the root, the last
term in column II, and the complete divisor together, and annex
two ciphers, for a new trial divisor; with which obtain an-
other trial figure in the root.

by 3, and annex the trial figure of the root for the next term

for the next term of column II; add this term to the trial
divisor for a complete divisor, with which proceed as before.
NOTES. 1. If at any time the product be greater than the dividend,
diminish the trial figure of the root, and correct the erroneous work.
2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex two more ciphers to the
trial divisor, and another period to the dividend; then proceed as be-
fore with column I, annexing both cipher and trial figure.

ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION.
44tf. An Arithmetical Progression, or Series, is a series
of numbers increasing or decreasing by a common difference.
Thus, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c., is an arithmetical progression with an
ascending series, and 13, 10, 7, 4, &c., is an arithmetical pro-
gression with a descending series.
4-1:6. The Terms of a series are the numbers of which it
is composed.
447. The Extremes are the first and last terms.
448. The Means are the intermediate terms.
44!). The Common Difference is the difference between
any two adjacent terms.
450. There are jive parts in an arithmetical series, any
three of which being given, the other two may be found.
They are as follows: the first term, last term, common differ'
ence, number of terms, and sum of all the terms.
CASE I.
451. To find the last term when the first .term,
common difference, and number of terms arc given.
Let 2 be the first term of an ascending series, and 3 the
common difference; then the series will be written, 2, 5, 8, 11,
14, or analyzed thus: 2, 2 + 3, 2 + 3 +3, 2 + 3 + 3 + 3,
2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.
Here we see that, in an ascending series, we obtain the
second term by adding the common difference once to the first
term; the third term, by adding the common difference twice
to the first term; and, in general, we obtain any term by
adding the common difference as many times to the first term
as there are terms less one.
NOTE. The analysis for a descending series would be similar.
Hence,
RULE. Multiply the common difference by the number of
terms less one, and add the product to the first term, if the
series be ascending, and subtract it iflhe series be descending.
EXAMPLES.
1. The first term of an ascending series is 4, the common
difference 3, and the number of terms 19; what is the last
term? Ans. 58.
2. What is the 13th term of a descending series whose first
term is 75, and common difference 5? • Ans. 15.

Ans. 10£.
5. A man travels 9 days; the first day he goes 20 miles,
the second 25 miles, increasing 5 miles each day; how far
does he travel the last day of his journey? Ans. 60 miles.
6. What is the amount of $100, at 7 per cent., for 45
years? $100 + $7 X 45 = $415, Ans.
CASE II.
452. To find the common difference when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
Referring to the series, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, analyzed in 4.38,
we readily see that, by subtracting the first term from any
term, we have left the common difference taken as many times
as there are terms less one; thus, by taking away 2 in the
fifth term, 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, we have 3 taken 4 times.
Hence,
RULE. Divide the difference of the extremes by the number
of terms less one.
EXAMPLES.
1. The first term is 2, the last term is 17, and the number
of terms is 6; what is the common difference? Ans. 3.
2. A man has seven children, whose ages are in arithmetical
progression; the youngest is 2 years old, and the eldest 14;

did he walk each day?
NOTE. When we have found the common difference we may add it
once, twice, &c., to the first term, and we have the series, and conse-
quently the means.
Ans. 3, 3i, 4, 4£, 5, 5£, &c.
CASE III.
4«"»J8. To find the number of terms when the ex-
tremes and common difference are given.
Examining the series, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, analyzed in 438,
we also see that after taking away the first term from any
term, we have left the common difference taken as many
times as the number of terms, less 1. Hence,
RULE. Divide the difference of the extremes by the common
difference, and add 1 to the quotient.
EXAMPLES.
1. The extremes are 7 and 43, and the common difference
is 4; what is the number of terms? Ans. 10.
2. The first term is 2£, the last term is 40, and the common
difference is 74-; what is the number of terms? Ans. 6.
3. A laborer agreed to build a fence on the following con-
ditions: for the first rod he was to have 6 cents, with an

to 226 cents; how many rods did he build? Ans. 56 rods.
CASE IV.
454. To find the sum of all the terms when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
To deduce a rule for finding the sum of all the terms, we
will take the series 2, 5, 8,11, 14, writing it under itself in an
inverse order, and add each term; thus,
2-f- 5+ 8+11+14=40, once the sum.
14 + 11+ 8 + 5+ 2 = 40," " «
16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 —80, twice the sum.
Here we perceive that 16, the sum of the extremes, multi-
plied by 5, the number of terms, equals 80, which is twice the
sum of the series. Dividing 80 by 2 gives 40, which is the
sum required. Hence,
RULE. Multiply the sum of the extremes by the number of
terms, and divide the product by 2.
EXAMPLES.
1. The extremes are 5 and 32, and the number of terms 12;
what is the sum of all the terms? Ans. 222.
2. How many strokes does a common clock make in 12
hours? Ans. 78 strokes.

and a basket 2 yards from the first apple; how far would a
boy travel to gather them up singly, and return with each

GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION.
455. A Geometrical Progression is a series of numbers
increasing or decreasing by a constant multiplier.
When the multiplier is greater than a unit, the series is
ascending; thus, 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, is an ascending series, in
which 3 is the multiplier.
When the multiplier is less than a unit, the series is descend-
ing; thus, 162, 54, 18, 6, 2, is a descending series, in which ^
is the multiplier.
J.10. The Ratio is the constant multiplier.
457. In every geometrical progression there are five
parts to be considered, any three of which being given, the
other two may be determined. They are as follows: The first
term, last term, ratio, number of terms, and the sum of all the
terms.
The first and last terms are the extremes, and the interme-
diate terms are the means.
CASE I.
458. To find any term, the first term, the ratio,
and number of terms being given.
The first term is supposed to exist independently of the
ratio. Using the ratio once as a factor, we have the second
term; using it twice, or its second power, we have the third
term; using it three times, or its third power, we have the
fourth term; and, in general, the power of the ratio in any
term is one less than the number of the term. The ascending
series, 2, 6, 18, 54, may be analyzed thus: 2, 2 X 3, 2 X
3X3, 2X3X3X3.
In this illustration we see that
1st term, 2, is independent of the ratio.
2d " 6 = 2X3 = the first term into the 1st power of
(he ratio.
3d term, 18 = 2 X 32 = the first term into the 2d power
of the ratio.
4th term, 54 = 2 X 3 3 = the first term into the 3d power
of the ratio. Hence
Rule. Multiply the first term by that power of the ratio
denoted by the number of terms less 1.
EXAMPLES.
1. The first term of a geometrical series is 4, the ratio is 3;
what is the 9th term? Ans. 4 X 38 = 26244.
2. The first term is 1024, the ratio ^, and the numher of
terms 8; what is the last term? Ans. ^. A
3. A boy bought 9 oranges, agreeing to pay 1 mill for the
first orange, 2 mills for the second, and so on; what did the
last orange cost him? Ans. $.256.
4. The first term is 7, the ratio ^-, and the number of terms
7; what is the last term? Ans. Ysi^j.
5. What is the amount of $1 at compound interest for 5
years, at 7 per cent. per annum? . Ans. $1.40255 -4-
Note. In the above example the first term is $1, the ratio is $1.07,
and the number of terms is 6.
6. A drover bought'7 oxen, agreeing to pay $3 for the first
ox, $9 for the second, $27 for the third, and so on; what did
the last ox cost him? Ans. $2187.
case n.
459. To find the sum of all the terms, the ex-
tremes and ratio being given.
If we take the series 2, 8, 32, 128, 512, in which the ratio
is 4, multiply each term by the ratio, and add the terms thus
multiplied, we shall have
GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION. 333
But 2 + 8 + 32 + 128 + 512 = 682 = j ^terms.8""1 °f *"
Hence, by subtracting, we get 2048 - 2 = 2046 = { ^J^Z^T
Dividing by 3, the ratio less one, 2046 -^ 3=682={ ^"^B'um of aU
The subtraction is performed by taking the lower line or
series from the upper. All the terms cancel except 2048 and
2. Taking their difference, which is 3 times the sum, and di-
viding by 3, the ratio less one, we must have the sum of all
the terms. Hence
RULE. Multiply the greater extreme by the ratio, subtract
the less extreme from the product, and divide the remainder
by the ratio less 1.
NOTE. Let every decreasing series be inverted, and the first term
called the last; then the ratio will be greater than a unit. . If the series
A infinite, the first term is a cipher.
EXAMPLES.
1. The first term is 2, the last term 512, and the ratio 3;
what is the sum of all the terms? Ans. 767.
2. The first term is 4, the last term is 262144, and the
ratio is 4; what is the sum of the series? Ans. 349524.
3. The first term of a descending series is 162, the last
term 2, and the ratio ^; "what is the sum? Ans. .242.
4. What is the value of |, ^, y^, &c., to infinity? Ans. £.
NOTE. In the following examples we first find the last term by the
Rule under Case I.
5. What yearly debt can be discharged by monthly pay-
ments, the first being $2, the second $6, and the third $18,
and so on, in geometrical progression? Ans. $531440.

MENSURATION OF LINES AND SUPERFICIES.
460. In taking the measure of any line, surface, or solid, we are
always governed by some denomination, a unit of which is called the
Unit of Measure. Thus, if any lineal measure be estimated in feet,
the unit of measure is 1 foot; if in inches, the unit is 1 inch. If any
superficial measure be estimated in feet, the unit of measure is 1
square foot; if in yards, the unit is 1 square yard.
461. If any solid or cubic measure be estimated in feet, the
unit ot measure is 1 cubic foot; if in yards, the unit is 1 cubic yard.
462. The area of a figure is its superficial contents, or the
surface included within any given lines,
without regard to thickness.
463. An Oblique Angle is an angle
greater or less than a right angle; thus,
ABC and C B D are oblique angles.

THE METRIC SYSTEM
OF
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.*
INTRODUCTION.
The metric system of weights and measures — so called, because
the metre is the unit from which the other units of the system are
derived—had its origin in France during the Revolution, a time when
all regard for institutions of the past was repudiated. In the year
1790, the French government resolved to introduce a new system;
and, in order that it might be received with general favor, other
countries were invited to join with it in the choice of new units.
In response to this invitation, a large number of scientific men, com-
missioned by various countries, met in Paris, in consultation with the
principal men of France. . In the year 1791, a commission, nomi-
nated by the Academy of Sciences, was appointed by the Government
to prepare the new system. The first work of the commission was to
select a standard of lengths from which the system of units adopted
might at any time be restored if from any cause the original unit
should be lost. A quadrant of the earth's meridian was chosen as
the standard, and the ten-millionth part of it taken as the unit of
lengths, which was called a metre. In 1795, this standard and a
provisional metre whose length was determined from measurements
* ST. McViCAR, A.M., Principal of the State Normal and Training School at
Brockport, N.Y., a most thorough and critical scholar as well as teacher, prepared
this article, which contains many practical improvements in Notation, Nomencla*
ture, and Applications, not before presented to the public.
Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1867, by D. W. Frsn, A. M., In the Clerk.s
Office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.
15*
of the earth's meridian, which had already been made, was adopted
by the government.
In the meantime, two eminent astronomers, Mechain and Delambre,
were engaged in determining the exact length of the arc of the meri-
dian between Dunkirk in the north of France, and Barcelona in
Spain. At a later period, Biot and Arago measured the prolonga-
tion of the same meridian as for as the island of Formentara. From
these measurements, together with one formerly made in Peru, they
deduced, as they supposed, the exact distance from the equator to
the pole, which differed slightly from the standard assumed in 1795.
In 1799, a law was passed changing the length of the metre adopted
in 1795 so as to conform with this difference. The metre thus de-
termined was marked by two very fine parallel lines drawn on a pla-
tinum bar, and deposited for preservation in the national archives.
While a part of the commission were engaged in establishing the
exact length of the metre, other members pursued a course of inves-
tigation for the purpose of determining a.unit of weights, which would
sustain an invariable relation to the unit of lengths. As the result
of their investigations, the weight of a cube of pure water whose edge
was one-hundredth part of a metre was the unit chosen. The water
was weighed in a vacuum, at a temperature of 4° C., or 39.2° F.,
which was supposed to be the temperature of greatest density. This
weight was called a gramme; and a piece of platinum weighing one
thousand grammes was deposited as the standard of weights in the
national archives.
Had the work of the commission ended in determining these
standards of lengths and weights, their labor would have been futile.
For, while the conception of basing their system upon an absolute
standard in nature was good, the execution proved a failure. Later
investigations have shown that the metre is less than the ten-millionth
part of the earth's meridian; consequently the metric system of
weights and measures is referable not to an invariable standard in
nature, but to the platinum metre deposited in the national archives
of France. The great benefits which result from the labors of the
commission arise from the adoption of the decimal scale of units, and
a simple yet general and expressive nomenclature. The amount of
time and money used in carrying on exchanges between different coun
tries, which would bo saved by the universal adoption of this system,
is incalculable. The system was declared obligatory throughout the
whole of France after Nov. 2, 1801; but, owing to the prejudices
of the people in favor of established customs, and the confusion con-
sequent upon the use of the new measures, the Government, iu 1812,
adopted a compromise, in the sysleme usuel, whose principal units
were the new ones, while the divisions and names were nearly those
formerly in use, ascending commonly in the ratios of two, three, four,
eight, or twelve. In 1837, the government abolished this system,
and enacted a law attaching a penalty to the use of any other than
the metric system after Jan. 1, 1841. Since that time, the system
has been adopted by Spain, Belgium, and Portugal, to the exclusion
of other weights and measures. In Holland, other weights are used
only in Compounding medicines. In 18G4, the system was legalized
in Great Britain; and its use, either as a whole or in some of its parts,
has been authorized in Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Mexico,
Guatemala, Venezuela, Ecuador, United States of Columbia, Brazil,
Chili, San Salvador, and Argentine Republic. In 1866, Congress
authorized the metric system in the United States by passing the fol-
lowing bills and resolution : —

NOTE. — The spelling in the above tables is not the same as in
the tablos in the schedule annexed to the report of the committee of
the House of Representatives on weights and measures. The change
is not made to indicate any preference for any standard upon this
subject; but to carry out what the author believes to be an essential
condition to the utility and success of the system.
As remarked by a distinguished senator when the tables were
adopted by Congress, "T7ie names are cosmopolitan ;" and to re-
tain this character fully, the spelling must also be cosmopolitan.
The French introduced the nomenclature and spelling; arid, ,=o
long as the names remain unchanged, the spelling should be retained.

THE METRIC SYSTEM.
NOMENCLATURE AM) TABLES. • .
There are eight kinds of quantities for which tables are usually
constructed; viz., Lengths, Surfaces, Volumes or Solids, Capacities,
Weights, Values, Times, and Angles or Arcs. The table for Times
is the same in the metric as in the ordinary system. The table for
Angles is constructed upon a centesimal scale. The tables for the
other six kinds of quantities are constructed upon a decimal scale.
In each of the tables for Lengths, Surfaces, Volumes, Capacities, and
Weights, there are eight denominations of units, — one principal and
seven derivative. The principal units are the metre, which is the
base of the system, and those derived directly from it. The two
following tabular views present the facts regarding the principal and
derivative units, which should be fixed in the memory.
1. Principal unit of Lengths. .
2. The base of the metric system, and nearly
one ten-millionth part of a quadrant of
the earth's meridian.
. 3. Equivalent, £9.3708 inches.
1. Principal unit of surfaces.
2. A square whost side is ten metres.
3. Equivalent, 119 6 square yards.
1. Principal unit of volumes or solids.
2. A cube whose edge is one metre.
3. Equivalent, 1.308 cubic yards.
1. Principal unit of capacities.
2. A vessel whose volume is equal to a cube
whose edge is one-tenth of a metre.
3. Equivalent, .908 quart dry measure, or
1.0567 quarts wine measure,
f 1. Principal unit of weights.
2. The weight of a cube of pure water whose
edge is .01 of a metre.
3. The water must be weighed in a vacuum
4° C., or 39.2° P.
4. Equivalent, 15.432 grains.

1. Three orders of smaller units, or submultiples of each
kind, are formed by dividing each of the principal units
into tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.
2. Four orders of larger units, or multiples of each kind,
are formed by considering as a unit ten times, one
hundred times, one thousand times, and ten thousand
times, each of the principal units.
The names of derivative units are formed by
attaching a prefix to the name of the princi-
pal unit from which they are derived, which
indicates their relation to the principal unit.
1. Millesimus, one thousandth, contracted
Milli. Example, Millilitro = risW of a litre;
8 millilitrcs = -nsW of a ^ltre-
2. Centesimus, one hundredth, contracted
centi. Ex., Centiare = TJT of an are; 4
contiares = Tg5 of an are.

2. Hecaton, one hundred, contracted hecto.
Ex., Hectolitre = 100 litres; 7 hectolitres
= 700 litres.
a- ° 2-^3. Kilioi, one thousand, contracted kilo. Ex.
Kilogramme = 1000 grammes.
4. Myria, ten thousand. Ex., Myriastere =
10,000 steres; 3 myriasteres = 30,000 steres.
5. The a in deca and myra, and the o in hecto
and kilo, are dropped when prefixed to are.
'The tables being constructed upon a decimal scale, ten
units of a lower order make one of the next higher,
thus: 10 millimetres = 1 centimetre; 10 centimetres
= 1 decimetre; 10 decimetres
tres = 1 decametre, &c.
1 metre; 10 me-
THE METRIC SYSTEM.
The facts in the preceding views being mastered, the tables can be
constructed by the pupil at sight. For example: The names of the
derivative units are formed by attaching the seven prefixes, in their
order, to the principal units of the tables. The order of progression
being ten, the table of capacities will be written thus : —
10 Millilitres = 1 Centilitre. 10 Litres — 1 Decalitre.
10 Centilitres = 1 Decilitre. 10 Decalitres = 1 Hectolitre.
10 Decilitres = 1 Litre. 10 Hectolitres = 1 Kilolitre.
10 Kilolitres = 1 Myrialitre.
All the tables peculiar to the Metric System are presented together
in a convenient form in the two following tables : —

ABBREVIATED NOMENCLATURE.
To secure the fullest advantage to business men by the universal
adoption of the new system of weights and measures, it is necessary
that the names used should be short and easy to write and pronounce,
that they should express clearly the relation of the different denomi-
nations of the same table to each other, and that they should be
identical in all languages.
The last two of these requirements would be secured by the uni-
versal use of the nomenclature adopted by tho French. It is cosmo-
politan in its character : it belongs to their language no more than to
any other. The former, however, is not secured. It is evident to
all, that, for business purposes, the long names of the metric system
are inconvenient, and that to shorten them would prove a great
advantage. Efforts have been made to introduce short names;
but these efforts have invariably sacrificed their universal and expres-
sive character, which is of more importance to the business world
than their shortness.
The only true course which seems to be open, is to abbreviate the
names already introduced, in such a way as to retain their peculiar
characteristics.
To secure this, the following plan of abbreviation is suggested : —
First. Let the prefixes be abbreviated thus: Myr, kil, hect, dec,
des, cent. mil.
Second. Let the initial letter of the names of the five principal
units be used, instead of the names themselves, thus: For metre, use
a capital M; for are, use a capital A; for stere, a capital S; for
litre, a capital L; and, for gramme, a capital G.
Third. For the names of multiples and sub-multiples, attach to
these initial capital letters the abbreviated prefixes, thus: Kil M, pro-
nounced kill-em'; Kil S, pronounced kill-ess', &c.
By this method of abbreviation, the elements of the original terms
are retained in such a form that each part is clearly indicated. The
capital letter used after the prefix will always point to the base-word
of which it is the initial, although the pronunciation is changed.

NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
In the practical application of the metric system, it is not always
convenient to use the principal units as the unit of number. For
example: Should the gramme, the principal unit of weight, be used
as the unit of number, in the grocery or any similar business, small
quantities would be expressed by inconveniently large numbers.
Example: 386 Ibs. are expressed by 175,000 grammes. To avoid
this inconvenience, the higher denominations are used as the unit of
number when large quantities are measured.
No general system of notation is yet' agreed upon. The same
quantity is written in various ways by different authors. Example:
42 metres, 8 decimetres, and 5 centimetres, are written
m cm
42.85 M. 42? 85. 42.85. M 42.85. &c.
Inasmuch as the principal units of measure are not always used as
the unit of number, it is important that a system of notation be adopt-
ed, which will apply equally well to both principal and derivative
units.
It is believed that the system given below, while simple and con-
venient, expresses clearly the relation of the unit of number to the
principal unit of measure; and, hence, has an advantage over any
contractions of the names of the derivative units or arbitrary signs
which might be adopted.
GENEKAL PRINCIPLES OF NOTATION.
I. The scale in the metric system being decimal, the consecutive
denominations are expressed by the consecutive orders of units in a
number. Thus, 781)42.358 metres is an expression for 7 myria-
metres, 8 kilometres, G hectometres, 4 decametres, 2 metres, 3 deci-
metres, 5 centimetres, 8 millimetres.
II. Whichever one of the eight denominations of units of measure
is used as the unit of a number, the higher denominations are ex-
pressed as tens, hundreds, and so on; and the lower as tenths, hun-
dredths, and so o.n. Example: 784:50 decametres. Here the unit
of the number is a decametre; consequently the tens and hundreds
are, respectively, hectometres and kilometres, and the tenths and
hundredths are metres and decimetres.
From these principles and illustrations, we derive the following rule
for notation : —
KULE. Write the consecutive denominations in their order, com-
mencing with the higher, and placing a cipher wherever a denomi-
nation is omitted, and the decimal point after the denomination
which is the unit of the number.
RULES FOR INDICATING TUB DENOMINATION.
RULE I. When a principal unit of measure is the unit of num-
ber, place the initial letter of the unit used before the number, thus:
M 342.5. Read, three hundred and forty-two and five-tenths
metres; or, 3 hectometres, 4 decametres, 2 metres, 5 decimetres.
EXAMPLES. FOR PRACTICE.

centimetres. Ans. M 70430.08.
2. Thirty-four kilometres and forty-three millimetres.
Ans. M 34000.043.

steres. Ans. S 53147203.
RULE II. When a multiple of a principal unit of measure is the
unit of number; — First, Place before the number the initial letter
of the principal unit from which the multiple is derived. Second,
Indicate the order of multiple used b'j a small figure placed to the
left and above the letter prefixed to the number. (See symbols in
table of multiples.)
Example. 42.5 kilometres, is written 3M42.5.
The M before the number indicates that the metre is the unit of
measure from which the unit of the number is derived. The small
3 indicates that the third order of multiple, or kilometre, is the unit
of number.

EEDUCTION.
Rule for Reduction Descending. Multiply the given quantity
by the number of the required denomination which makes a unit of
the given denomination.
Since the multiplier is always 10, 100, 1000, &c, the operation
is performed by removing the decimal point as many places to the
right as there are ciphers in the multiplier, annexing ciphers when
necessary.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Reduce "M 32.58 to millimetres.
2. Reduce 4M 5 to decimetres.
3. Reduce G402 to milligrammes.

Rule for Reduction Ascending. Divide the given quantity
by the number of its own denomination which makes a unit of the
required denomination.
Since the divisor is always 10, 100, 1000, &c, the operation is
performed by removing the decimal point as many places to the left
as there are ciphers in the divisor, prefixing ciphers when necessary.

NUMERAL EXPRESSION FOR SURFACE.
The contents of a plane figure la expressed numerically by giving
the number of times it contains some given area, which is assumed as
the unit of surface.
The following illustrations will show how the various denomina-
tions of the table are used in numerical expressions of surface : —
ILLUSTRATION FIRST.
Length 6 metres.
It will be seen, by examining this figure, that the lines drawn
parallel to the sides, at the supposed distance of a metre from each
other, divide the surface into square metres, and that there are as
many rows of square metres as there are metres in the breadth, each
row containing as many square metres as there are metres in the
length. Hence the number of square metres in the area of the figure
is equal to the product of the two numbers which indicate the length
and breadth; and A 0.21 is a numerical expression for its contents.
THE METRIC SYSTEM.
ILLUSTRATION SECOND.
In this figure, the lines drawn parallel to the sides divide the
figure into 36 mllliares, or oblongs, whose length is one metre and
breadth one decimetre. It is evident that ten of these oblongs put
together will constitute a centiare, or square metre. Hence the ex-
pression, 36 milliares, may be written 3.6 centiares; and read, three
and six tenths centiares, or three centiares and six milliares.
By reducing the length to decimetres, the numerical expression of
the contents will be, by Illustration First, 60 x 6, or 360 decimilliares
or square decimetres.

From these illustrations, wo derive the following rule for finding a
numerical expression for a given surface of uniform length and
breadth : —
RULE. Reduce the length and breadth to the same denomination;
find the product of the two dimensions after reduction, and point
off as many decimal places in this product as there are decimal
places in the two dimensions.
The unit of the numerical expression thus found will be a decimil-
liare when the unit of length is a decimetre, a centiare when the
unit of length is a metre, an are when the unit of length is a deca-
metre, a hectare when the unit of length is a hectometre, and a
myriare when the unit of length is a kilometre.

NUMERICAL EXPRESSION FOB VOLUME, OR SOLIDITY.
The solidity, or contents, of a volume is expressed numerically by
giving the number of times it contains some given solid as the unit
of volume.
The following illustrations.will show how the various denominations
of the table are used in numerical expressions of volume.
llillistere, or Cubic Decimetre.
10 millisteres, placed side by side, make a volume whose length
is one metre, and breadth and thickness each one decimetre, thus, —
Ceatistere = 10 Millisteres.
10 centistere, placed side by side, make a volume whose length
and breadth is each one metre, and thickness one decimetre, thus, —

Decistre = 10 Ccntisteres = 100 Millisteres.
10 decisteres, placed face to face, make a cube whose edge is one
metro, thus,—

Sterc = 10 Dccistercs = 100 Centistcres = 1000 Millisteres.
From these illustrations, it is evident that the contents of a cubic
metre may be expressed numerically, as S 1, tS 10,2S 100, 3S 1000.
THE METRIC SYSTEM.

Milliare.

The following figures illustrate the use of
the same four denominations in expressing
the contents of a cubic volume whose edge
is one metre and one decimetre. The sur-
face of one face of the volume contains
one centiare, two milliares, and one deci-
milliare, thus,—
Taking a slab of the face one decimetre thick, thus, —
and we have one decistere, two
centisteres, and one millistere.
But the volume is eleven deci-
metres thick; therefore we have
eleven such slabs, or eleven times one decistere, two centisteres, and
one millistere.
f 11 millisteres = 1 centistere and 1 millistere = S 0.011
= -< 22 centisteres = 2 decisteres and 2 centisteres = S 0.22
( 11 decisteres = 1 stere and 1 decistere — S 1.1
M 1.1 X M 1.1 X M 1.1 = S1.331
From these illustrations, we derive the following rule for finding a
numerical expression for a given volume of uniform length, breadth,
and thickness: —
ROLE. Reduce the length, breadth, and thickness -to the same
denomination ; find the product of the three dimensions, after re-
duction, and point off" as many decimal places in this product as
there are decimal places in the three dimensions.
The unit of the numerical expression thus found will be a millistere
when the unit of length is a decimetre, a stere when the unit of length
is a metre, a kilostere when the unit of length is a decametre.

MEASUREMENT OF ANGLES.
In the ordinary or sexagesimal system, a right-angle, which is used
as the measure of all plane angles, is divided into 90 equal parts,
called degrees; a degree is divided into GO equal parts, called
minutes; and a minute into CO equal parts, called seconds.
In the centesimal or French system, a right-angle is divided into
100 equal parts, called grades; a grade into 100 equal parts, called
minutes; and a minute into 100 equal parts, called seconds.
The former is called the sexagesimal system, on account of the
occurrence of the number sixty in forming the subdivisions of a de-
gree; and the latter centesimal, on account of the occurrence of the
number one hundred.
Grades, minutes, and seconds are usually written thus: 35s 42X
24 v; read, thirty-five grades, forty-two minutes, twenty-four seconds.
Since the scale is centesimal, minutes may be expressed as hun-
dredths, and seconds as ten-thousandths; hence any number of grades,
minutes, and seconds may be expressed decimally thus: 73* 4569;
read, seventy-three grades, forty-five minutes, sixty-nine seconds.
In a right-angle, there are 100 grades, or 90 degrees; hence, for
every 10 grades there are 9 degrees. Dividing the 10 grades into
9 equal parts or degrees, each part will contain 1^ grades; therefore
a degree s equal to 1L grades. Hence, in any number of grades
there are as many degrees as 1^ is contained times in the given
number of grades; and, conversely, in any number of degrees there
are l1 times as many grades as thero are degrees. Hence the fol-
lowing rules: —
TO CHANGE THE CENTESIMAL MEASURE TO THE SEXAGESIMAL.
Rule. Express the minutes and seconds as a decimal of a
grade/ divide by lig: the quotient will express the number of de-
grees and decimals of a degree in the given number of grades, min-
utes, and seconds.

TO CHANGE TIIE SEXAGESIMAL MEASURE TO THE CENTESIMAL.
Rule. Reduce the minutes and seconds to a decimal of a de-
gree; multiply the degrees and decimal of a degree by \\: the pro-
duct is the number of grades, minutes, and seconds in the given
number of degrees, minutes, and seconds.

In the Clerk.s Office of the District Court of the United States, for the Northern
District of New York.

PROGRESS and improvement characterize almost every art and
science; and within the last few years the science of Arithmetic has
received many important additions and improvements, which have
appeared from time to time successively in the different treatises pub-
lished upon this subject.
In the preparation of this work it has been the author's aim to com-
bine, and to present in ons harmonious whole, all these modern im-
provements, as well as to introduce some new methods and practical
operations not found in other works of the same grade; in short, to
present the subject of Arithmetic to the pupil more as a science than
an art; to teach him methods of thought, and how to reason, rather
than tchat to do; to give unity, system, and practical utility to the
science and art of computation.
The author believes that both teacher and pupil should have the
privilege, as well as the benefit, of performing at least a part of the
thinking and the labor necessary to the study of Arithmetic; hence
the present work has not been encumbered with the multiplicity of
"notes," "suggestions," and superfluous operations so common to
most Practical Arithmetics of the present day, and which prevent the
cultivation of that self-reliance, that clearness of thought, and that
vigor of intellect, which always characterize the truly educated mind.
The author claims for this treatise improvement upon, if not superi-
ority over, others of the kind in the following particulars, viz.: In
t/ie mechanical and typographical style of the icork; the open and
attractive page; the progressive and scientific arrangement of the
subjects; clearness and conciseness of definitions; fullness and accu-
racy in the new and improved methods of operations and analyses;
brevity and perspicui'y of rules; and in the very largo number of
(W)
PREFACE.
examples prepared and arranged with special reference to their practical
utility, and their adaptation to the real business of active life. The an-
swers to a part of the examples have been omitted, that the learner may
acquire the discipline resulting from verifying the operations.
Particular attention is invited to improvements in the subjects of Com-
mon Divisors, Multiples, Fractions, Percentage, Interest, Proportion, An-
alysis, Alligation, and the Roots, aa it ia believed these articles contain
some practical features not common to other anthors upon these subjects.
The improvements in Percentage made necessary by the financial
changes of the last few years are especially noticable. The different
kinds of United States' Securities, Bonds, and Treasury Notes are de-
scribed, and their comparative value in commercial transactions illus-
trated by practical examples. The difference between Gold and Currency,
and the corresponding difference in prices, exhibited in trade, are taught
and illustrated, and many other things that every commercial student
and business man ought to know and understand.
There has also been added a fall and practical presentation of the
Metric System of Weights and Measures, containing many new and orig-
inal improvements in the arrangement, notation, and applications, not
before presented to the public, and which greatly simplify and adapt the
system to general use.
It is not claimed that this is a perfect work, for perfection is impossi-
ble; but no effort has been spared to present a clear, scientific, compre-
hensive, and complete system, sufficiently full for the business man and
the scholar; not encumbered with unnecessary theories, and yet com-
bining and systematizing real improvements of a practical and useful
nature. How nearly this cud has been attained the intelligent and ex-
perienced teacher and educator must determine.

DEFINITIONS.
1. Quantity is any thing that can be increased, diminished,
or measured.
2. Mathematics is the science of quantity.
3. A Unit is one, or a single thing.
•4. A Number is a unit, or a collection of units.
5. An Integer is a whole number.
G. The Unit of a Number is one of the same kind or
name as the number. Thus, the unit of 23 is 1; of 23 dollars,
1 dollar; of 23 feet, 1 foot.
7. like Numbers have the same kind of unit. Thus, 74,
16,and 250; 7 dollars and 62 dollars; 19 pounds, 320 pounds,
and 86 pounds; 4 feet 6 inches, and 17 feet 9 inches.
8. An Abstract Number is a number used without refer-
ence to any particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17 ; 365 ; 8540.
0. A Concrete Number is a number used with reference
to some particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17 dollars; 365
days; 8540 men.
NOTES. 1. The unit of an abstract number is 1, and is called Unity.
2. Concrete numbers are, by some, called Denominate Numbers.
Denomination means the name of the unit of a concrete number.
10. Arithmetic is the Science of numbers, and the Art of
computation.
11. A Sign is a character indicating an operation to be
performed.
12. A Rule is a prescribed method of performing an op-
eration.
Define quantity. Mathematics. A unit. A number. An integer.

NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
13. Dotation is a method of writing or expressing numbers
by characters; and,
S4. Numeration is a method of reading numbers expressed
by characters.
15. Two systems of notation are in general use — the
Human and the Arabic.
NOTE. The Roman Notation is supposed to have been first used
by the Romans; hence its name. The Arabic Notation was intro-
duced into Europe by the Arabs, by whom it was supposed to have
been invented. But investigations have shown that it was adopted by
them about 600 years ago, and that it has been in use among the Hin-
doos more than 2000 years. From this latter fact it is sometimes
called the Indian Notation.
THE ROMAN NOTATION
16. Employs seven capital letters to express numbers,
thus:
Letters, I V X L C D M
Values, one, five, ten, fi-y, hu°d«ed- iJJ™^ ^^
17. The Roman notation is founded upon five principles,
as follows:
1st. Repeating a letter repeats its value. Thus, II repre-
sents two, XX twenty, CCC three hundred.
2d. If a letter of any value be placed after one of greater
value, its value is to be united to that of the greater. Thus,
XI represents eleven, LX sixty, DC six hundred.
3d. If a letter of any value be placed before one of greater
value, its value is to be taken from that of the greater. Thus,
IX represents nine, XL forty, CD four hundred.
Define notation. Numeration. What systems of notation are now
in general use? From what are their names derived? What are used
to express numbers in the Roman notation? What is the value of each?
What is the first principle of combination? Second? Third?
4th. If a letter of any value be placed between two letters,
each of greater value, its value is to be taken from the united
value of the other two. Thus, XIV represents fourteen,
XXIX twenty-nine, XCIV ninety-four.
5th. A bar or dash placed over a letter increases its value
one thousand fold. Thus, V signifies five, and V five thou-
sand; L fifty, and L fifty thousand. .

Notz. The system of Roman notation is not well adapted to the
purposes of numerical calculation; it is principally confined to the
numbering of chapters and sections of books, public documents, &c.
Express the following numbers by letters:
1. Eleven. Ans.
2. Fifteen. Ans.
XI.
Fourth? Fifth? Repeat the table. What is the value of LVTI?
CLxxin? xcvni? cdxxxh? xcix? dcxix?
VMDCCXLLX? MDXXVCDLXXXIX? To what uses is tho
Roman notation now principally confined?

3. Twenty-five.
4. Thirty-nine.
5. Forty-eight.
6. Seventy-seven.
7. One hundred fifty-nine.
8. Five hundred ninety-four.
9. One thousand five hundred thirty-eight.
10. One thousand nine hundred ten.
11. Express the present year.
THE ARABIC NOTATION
18. Employs ten characters or figures to express numbers.
Thus,
Figures, 0123456789
Names and 5 naught onei two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
, f or
values, $ ciphor-
19. The first character is called naught, because it has no
value of its own. The other nine characters are called signif-
icant figures, because each has a value of its own.
20. The significant figures are also called Digits, a word de-
rived from the Latin term digitus, which signifies finger.
21. The naught or cipher is also called nothing, and zero.
The ten Arabic characters are the Alphabet of Arithmetic,
and by combining them according to certain principles, all
numbers can be expressed. We will now examine the most
important of these principles.*
22. Each of the nine digits has a value of its own; hence
any number not greater than 9 can be expressed by one
figure.
* Fractional ami uecimal notation, and the notation of compound numbers, will bo
discussed in their appropriate places.
What are used to express numbers in the Arabic notation? What
U the value of each? What general name is given to the significant
figures? Why? Numbers less than ten, how expressed?
23. As we have no single character to represent ten, we
express it by writing the unit, 1, at the left of the cipher, 0,
thus, 10. In the same manner we represent
2 tens, 3 tens, 4 tens, 5 tens, 6 tens, 7 tens, 8 tens, 9 tens,
or or or or or or or or
twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety,
20; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80; 90.
ii-1. When a number is expressed by two figures, the right
band figure is called units, and the left hand figure tens.
We express the numbers between 10 and 20 by writing
the 1 in the place of tens, with each of the digits respectively
in the place of units. Thus,
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fi-een, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
In like manner we express the numbers between 20 and
30, between 30 and 40, and between any two successive tens.
Thus, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 47, 56, 72, 93.
The greatest number that can be expressed by two figures
is 99.
25. We express one hundred by writing the unit, 1, at the
left hand of two ciphers, or the number 10 at the left hand of
one cipher; thus, 100. In like manner we write two hun-
dred, three hundred, &c., to nine hundred. Thus,
one two three four five six seven eight nine
hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred,
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900.
26. When a number is expressed by three figures, the
right hand figure is called units, the second figure tens, and
the left hand figure hundreds.
As the ciphers have, of themselves, no value, but are always
used to denote the absence of value in the places they occupy,
Tens, how expressed? The right hand figure called what > left
hand figure, what? What is the greatest number that can be expressed
by two figures? One hundred, how expressed? When numbers are
expressed by three figures, what names are given to each?
we express tens and units with hundreds, by writing, in place
of the ciphers, the numbers representing the tens and units.
To express one hundred fifty we write 1 hundred, 5 tens, and
0 units; thus, 150. To express seven hundred ninety-two,
we write 7 hundreds, 9 tens, and 2 units; thus,

The greatest number that can be expressed by three figures
is 999.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Write one hundred twenty-five.
2. Write four hundred eighty-three.
3. Write seven hundred sixteen.
4. Express by figures nine hundred.
5. Express by figures two hundred ninety.
6. Write eight hundred nine.
7. Write five hundred five.
8. Write five hundred fifty-seven.
27. We express one thousand by writing the unit, 1, at
the left hand of three ciphers, the number 10 at. the left hand
of two ciphers, or the number 100 at the left hand of one
cipher; thus, 1000. In the same manner we write two
thousand, three thousand, &c., to nine thousand; thus,
one two three four five six seven eight nine
thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand.
1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000.
28. When a number is expressed by four figures, the
places, commencing at the right hand, are units, tens, hundreds,
thousands.
Use of the cipher, what? Greatest number that can be expressed by
three figures? One thousand, how expressed? How many figures
used? Names of each?
To express hundreds, tens, and units with thousands, we
write in each place the figure indicating the number we wish
to express in that place. To write four thousand two hun-
dred sixty-nine, we write 4 in the place of thousands, 2 in the
place of hundreds, 6 in the place of tens, and 9 in the place of
units; thus,

Express the following numbers by figures : —
1. One thousand two hundred.
2. Five thousand one hundred sixty.
3. Three thousand seven hundred forty-one.
4. Eight thousand fifty-six.
5. Two thousand ninety.

12. 2100; 5047; 7009; 4670; 3997; 1001.
2O. Next to thousands come tens of thousands, and next
to these come hundreds of thousands, as tens and hundreds
come in their order after units. Ten thousand is expressed
by removing the unit, 1, one place to the left of the place
Greatest number expressed by four figures? Tens of thousands, how
expressed? Hundreds of thousands?
of thousands, or by writing it at the left hand of four ci-
phers; thus, 10000; and one hundred thousand is expressed
by removing the unit, I, still one place further to the left, or
by writing it at the left hand of five ciphers; thus, 100000.
We can express thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of
thousands in one number, in the same manner as we express
units, tens, and hundreds in one number. To express five
hundred twenty-one thousand eight hundred three, we write 5 in
the sixth place, counting from units, 2 in the fifth place, 1 in
the fourth place, 8 in the third place, 0 in the second place,
(because there are no tens,) and 3 in the place of units;
thus,

For convenience in reading large numbers, we may point
them off, by commas, into periods of three figures each, count-
ing from the right hand or unit figure. This pointing enables
us to read the hundreds, tens, and units in each period with
facility.
3O. Next above hundreds of thousands we have, succes-
sively, units, tens, and hundreds of millions, and then follow
units, tens, and hundreds of each higher name, as seen in the
following
NUMERATION TABLE.

period. period* period, period, period, period, period. period, period.
How may figures be pointed off? One million, how expressed?
Next period above millions, what? Give the name of each successive
period.
Note. This is called the French method of pointing off the peri-
ods, and is the one in general use in this country.
31. Figures occupying different places in a number, as
units, tens, hundreds, &c, are said to express different orders
of units.
Simple units are called units of the first order.
Tens "" """ second'"
Hundreds "" """ third"
Thousands "" """fourth"
Tens of thousands"" "« "fifth"
and so on. Thus, 452 contains 4 units of the third order, 5
units of the second order, and 2 units of the first order.
1,030,600 contains 1 unit of the seventh order, (millions,) 3
units of the fifth order, (tens of thousands,) and 6 units of the
third order, (hundreds.)
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
Write and read the following numbers :—
1. One unit of the third order, four of the second.
2. Three units of the fifth order, two of the third, one of the
first.
3. Eight units of the fourth order, five of the second.
4. Two units of the seventh order, nine of the sixth, four
of the third, one of the second, seven of the first.
5. Three units of the sixth order, four of the second.
6. Nine units of the eighth order, six of the seventh, three
of the fifth, seven of the fourth, nine of the first.
7. Four units of the tenth order, six of the eighth, four of
the seventh, two of the sixth, one of the third, five of the sec-
ond.
8. Eight units of the twelfth order, four of the eleventh, six
of the tenth, nine of the seventh, three of the sixth, five of the
fifth, two of the third, eight of the first.
Units of different orders are what?
33. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations, we
derive several important principles, which we will now pre-
sent.
1st. Figures Lave two values, Simple and Local.
The Simple Value of a figure is its value when taken alone;
thus, 2, 5, 8.
The Local Value of a figure is its value when used with an-
other figure or figures in the same number; thus, in 842 the
simple values of the several figures are 8, 4, and 2; but the
local value of the 8 is 800 ; of the 4 is 4 tens, or 40; and of
the 2 is 2 units.
NOTE. When a figure occupies units' place, its simple and local
values are the some.
2d. A digit or figure, if used in the second place, expresses
tens; in the third place, hundreds; in the fourth place, thou-
sands; and so on.
3d. As 10 units make 1 ten, 10 tens 1 hundred, 10 hun-
dreds 1 thousand, and 10 units of any order, or in any place,
make one unit of the next higher order, or in the next place
at the left, \ve readily see that the Arabic method of notation
is based upon the following
TWO GENERAL LAWS.
I. Th: different orders of units increase from right to left,
and decrease from left to right, in a tenfold ratio.
II. Every removal of a figure one place to the left, increases
its local value tenfold; and every removal of a figure one place
to the right, diminishes its local value tenfold.
Thus,
6 is 6 units.
60 is 10 times 6 units.
600 is 10 times 6 tens.
6000 is 10 times 6 hundreds.
60000 is 10 times 6 thousands.
First principle derived? What is the simple value of a figure? Local r
Second principle? Third? First law of Arabic notation? Second?
4th. The local value of a figure depends upon its place from
units of the first order, not upon the value of the figures at the
right of it . Thus, in 425 and 400, the value of the 4 is the
same in both numbers, being 4 units of the third order, or 4
hundred.
NOTE. Care should be taken not to mistake the local value of a
figure for the value of the whole number. For, although the. value of
the 4 (hundreds) is the same in the two numbers, 425 and 400, the value
of the whole of the first number is greater than that of the second.
5th. Every period contains three figures, (units, tens, and
hundreds,) except the left hand period, which sometimes con-
tains only one or two figures, (units, or units and tens.)
33. As we have now analyzed all the principles upon
which the writing and reading of whole numbers depend, we
will present these principles in the form of rules.
RULE FOR NOTATION.
I. Beginning at the left hand, lorite the figures belonging to
the highest period.
II. Write the hundreds, lens, and units of each successive
period in their order, placing a cipher wherever an order of
units is omitted.
RULE FOR NUMERATION.
I. Separate the number into periods of three figures each,
commencing at the right hand. .
II. Beginning at the left hand, read each period separately,
and give the name to each period, except the last, or period
of units.
34. Until the pupil can write numbers readily, it may be
well for him to write several periods of ciphers, point them off.
over each period write its name, thus,
Trillions, Dilliona, Millions, Thousands, Units.
000, 000, 000, 000, 000
Fourth principle? What caution is given? Fifth principle? Rule
for notation? Numeration?
and then write the given numbers underneath, in their appro-
priate places.

MENTAL EXERCISES.
35. 1. Henry gave 5 dollars for" a vest, and 7 dollars for
a coat; how much did he pay for both?
Analysis. He gave as many dollars as 5 dollars and 7 dollars,
which are 12 dollars. Therefore he paid 12 dollars for both.
2. A farmer sold a pig for 3 dollars, and a calf for 8 dol-
lars; how much did he receive for both?
3. A drover bought 5 sheep of one man, 9 of another, and
3 of another; how many did he buy in all?

30. From the preceding operations we perceive that
Addition is the process of uniting several numbers of the
same kind into one equivalent number.
37. The Sum or Amount is the result obtained by the
process of additipn.
38. The sign, -)-, is called plus, which signifies more.
When placed between two numbers, it denotes that they are
to be added; thus, 6 -}- 4, shows that 6 and 4 are to be added.
39. The sign, =, is called the sign of equality. When
placed between two numbers, or sets of numbers, it signifies
that they are equal to each other; thus, the expression
6 -}- 4 r= 10, is read 6 plus 4 is equal to 10, and denotes that
the numbers 6 and 4, taken together, equal the number 10.
Define addition. The sum or amount? Sign of addition? Of
equality?
CASE I.

than 10.
1. A farmer sold some hay for 102 dollars, six cows for
162 dollars, and a horse for 125 dollars; how much did he re-
ceive for all?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We arrange the numbers so
4 .^ that units of like order shall stand in the
--i;= same column. We then add the columns
102 separately, for convenience commencing at
162 the right hand, and write each result under
125 the column added. Thus, we have 5 and 2
and 2 are 9, the sum of the units; 2 and 6
Amount, 389 are 8, the sum of the tens; 1 and 1 and I
are 3, the sum of the hundreds. Hence, 'he
entire amount is 3 hundreds 8 tens and 9 units, or 389, the Answer.

store, 475 dollars for a clerk, and 367 dollars for other ex-
penses; what is the amount of his expenses?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Arranging the num-
l^a bers as in Case I, we first add the
=11 column of units, and find the sum
725 to be 17 units, which is 1 ten and
475 7 units. We write the 7 units in
367 the place of units, and the 1 ten in
the place of tens. The sum of the
Snm of the nnits, 17 figures in the column of tens is 15
Sum of the tens, 15 tens, which is 1 hundred, and 5
Sum of the hundreds, 14 tens. We write the 5 tens in the
Total amount, 1567 placG of tenS' atld the 1 hun<lred '»
the place of hundreds. We next
add the column of hundreds, and find the sum to be 14 hundreds,
which is 1 thousand and 4 Hundreds. AVe write the 4 hundreds in
the place of hundreds, and 1 thousand in the place of thousands.
Lastly, by uniting the sum of the units with the sums of the tens
and hundreds, we find the total amount to be 1 thousand 5 hundreds
G tens and 7 units, or 1567.
This example may be performed by another method, which
is the common one in practice. Thus:
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Arranging the numbers as before, we
725 add the first column and find the sum to be 17 units;
475 writing the 7 units under the column of units, we add
gg7 the 1 ten to the column of tens, and find the sum to be
16 tens; writing the 6 tens under the column tens, we
1567 a(1d the i hundred to the column of hundreds, and find
the sum to be 15 hundreds; as this is the last column,
we write down its amount, 15; and we have the lekole amount, 1567,
as before.
NOTES. 1. Units of the same order are written in the Fame column;
and when the sum in any column is 10 or more than 10, it producer.
one or more units of a higher order, which must be added to the next
column. This process is sometimes called "carrying the tens."
2. In adding, learn to pronounce the partial results without naming
the numbers separately; thus, instead of saying 7 and 5 are 12, and
6 are 17, simply pronounce the results, 7, 12, 17, &c.
Give explanation. Second explanation. What is meant by carry-
Ing the tens?
. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following
KULE. I. Write the numbers to be added so that all the units
of the same order shall stand in the same column; that is, units
under units, tens under tens, fyc.
II. Commencing at units, add each column separately, and
write the sum underneath, if it be less than ten.
III. Jf the sum of any column be ten or more than ten, write
the unit figure only, and add the ten or tens to the next column.
IV. Write the entire sum of the last column.
PROOF. 1st. Begin with the right hand or unit column, and
add the figures in each column in an opposite direction from
that in which they were first added; if the two results agree,
the work is supposed to be right. Or,
2d. Separate the numbers added into two sets, by a hori-
zontal line; find the sum of each set separately; add these
sums, and if the amount be the same as that first obtained, the
work is presumed to be correct.
NOTE. By the methods of proof here given, the numbers are united
in new combinations, which render it almost impossible for two pre-
cisely similar mistakes to occur.
The first method is the one commonly used in businesj.

SUBTRACTION.
MENTAL EXERCISES.
43. 1. A farmer, having 14 cows, sold 6 of them; how
many had he left?
Analysis. He had as many left as 14 cows less 6 cows, which
are 8 cows. Therefore, he had 8 cows left.
2. Stephen, having 9 marbles, lost 4 of them; how many
had he left?
S. If a man earn 10 dollars a week, and spend 6 dollars for
provisions, how many dollars has he left?
4. A merchant, having 16 barrels of flour, sells 9 of them;
how many has he left?
5. Charles had 18 cents, and gave 10 of them for a book;
how many had he left?
6. James is 17 years old, and his sister Julia, is 5 years
younger; how old is Julia?
7. A grocer, having 20 boxes of lemons, sold 11 boxes;
how many boxes had he left?
8. From a cistern containing 25 barrels of water, 15 bar-
rels leaked out; how many barrels remained?
9. Paid 16 dollars for a coat, and 7 dollars for a vest;
how much more did the coat cost than the vest?
10. How many are 18 less 5? 17 less 8? 12 less 7?
11. How many are 20 less 14? 18 less 12? 19 less 11?
12. How.many are 11 less 3? 16 less 11? 19 less 8?

44. Subtraction is the process of determining the difter-
ence, between two numbers of the same unit value.
45. The Minuend is the number to be subtracted from.
46. The Subtrahend is the number to be subtracted.
Define subtraction. Minuend, Subtrahend.
47. The Difference or Remainder is the result obtained
by the process of subtraction.
Note. The minuend and subtrahend must be like numbers; thus,
5 dollars from 9 dollars leave 4 dollars; 5 apples from 9 apples leave 4
apples; but it would be absurd to say o apples from 9 dollars, or a
dollars from 9 apples.
48. The sign, —, is called minus, which signifies less.
When placed between two numbers, it denotes that the one
after it is to be taken from the one before it. Thus, 8 — 6 = 2
is read 8 minus 6 equals 2, and denotes that 6, the subtrahend,
taken from 8, the minuend, equals 2, the remainder.
CASE I.
49. When no figure in the subtrahend is greater
than the corresponding figure in the minuend.

a line underneath. 1 hen, beginning at
Remainder, 251 the right hand, we subtract separately
each figure of the subtrahend from the
figure above it in the minuend. Thus, 3 from 4 leaves 1, which is the
difference of the units; 2 from 7 leaves 5, the difference of the tens;
3 from 5 leaves 2, the difference of the hundreds. Hence, we have
for the whole difference, 2 hundreds 5 tens and 1 unit, or 251.

CASE II.
50. When any figure in the subtrahend is greater
than the corresponding figure in the minuend.
1. From 846 take 359.
Analysis. In this example we
cannot take 9 units from 6 units.
From the 4 tens we take 1 ten, which
equals 10 units, and add to the 6
units, making 16 units; 9 units from
16 units leave 7 units, which we
write in the remainder in units' place. As we have taken 1 ten
from the 4 tens, 3 tens only are left. We cannot take 5 tens from
3 tens; so from the 8 hundreds we take 1 hundred, which equals 10
tens, and add to the 3 tens, making 13 tens; 5 tens from 13
tens leave 8 tens, which we write in the remainder in tens' place.
As we have taken 1 hundred from the 8 hundreds, 7 hundreds only
are left; 3 hundreds from 7 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, which we
write in the remainder in hundreds' place, and we have the whole
remainder, 487.
Note. The numbers written over the minuend are used simply to
explain more clearly th* method of subtracting; in practice the pro-
cess should be performed mentally, and these numbers omitted.
The following method is more in accordance with prac-
tice.
operation. Analysis. Since we cannot take 9 units from 6
I^J units, we add 10 units to 6 units, making 16 units;
Sis 9 units from 16 units leave 7 units. But as we have
"46 added 10 units, or 1 ten, to the minuend, we shall
359 have a remainder 1 ten too large, to avoid which, we
ioy add 1 ten to the 5 tens in the subtrahend, making 6
tens. We can not take 6 tens from 4 tens; so we add
10 tens to 4, making 14 tens; 6 tens from 14 tens
leave 8 tens. Now, having added 10 tens, or 1 hundred, to the
minuend, we shall have a remainder 1 hundred too large, unless we
add 1 hundred to the 3 hundreds in the subtrahend, making 4 hun-
dreds; 4 hundreds from 8 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, and we have
for the total remainder, 487, the same as before.
Case U is what? Give explanation. Second explanation.
SIMPLE NUMBERS.
Note. The process of adding 10 to the minuend is sometimes called
borrowing 10, and that of adding 1 to the next figure of the subtrahend,
carrying one.
51. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
have the following general
Rule. I. Write the less number under (lie greater, placing
units of the same order in the same column.
II. Begin at the right hand, and lake each figure of the sub-
trahend from the figure above it, and write the result under-
neath.
III. If any figure in the subtrahend be greater than the cor-
responding figure above it. add 10 to that upper figure be-
fore subtracting, and then add 1 to the next left hand figure of
the subtrahend.
Proof. Add the remainder to the subtrahend, and if their
sum be equal to the minuend, the work is supposed to be right.

54L. Multiplication is the process of taking one of two
given numbers as many times as there are units in the other.
55. The Multiplicand is the number to be taken.
56. The Multiplier is the number which shows how
many times the multiplicand is to be taken.
57. The Product is the result obtained by the process of
multiplication.
58. The Factors are the multiplicand and multiplier.
Notes. 1. Factors are producers, and the multiplicand and mul-
tiplier are called factors because they produce the product.
2. Multiplication is a short method of performing addition when
the numbers to be added are equal.
59. The sign, X, placed between two numbers, denotes
that they are to be multiplied together; thus 9 X G = 54, is
read 9 times 6 equals 54.

CASE I.
60. When the multiplier consists of one figure. •
1. Multiply 374 by 6.
Analysis. In this example it i?
required to take 374 six times. If we
take the units of each order 6 times,
we shall take the entire number 6
times. Therefore, writing the multi-
plier under the unit figure of the mul-
tiplicand, we proceed as follows: 6
times 4 units are 24 units; 6 times 7
tens are 42 tens; 6 times 3 hundreds
are 18 hundreds; and adding these
partial products, we obtain the entire
product, 2244.

The operation in this example may be performed in another
way, which is the one in common use.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Writing the numbers as before, we
374 begin at the right hand or unit figure, and say: 6
P times 4 units are 24 units, which is 2 tens and 4
• wiits; write the 4 units in the product in units'
2244 place, and reserve the 2 tens to add to the next prod-
uct; 6 times 7 tens are 42 tens, and the two tens re-
served in the last product added, are 44 tens, which is 4 hundreds
and 4 tens; write the 4 tens in the product in tens' place, and reserve
the 4 hundreds to add to the next product; 6 times 3 hundreds are
18 hundreds, and 4 hundreds added are 22 hundreds, which, being
written in the product in the places of hundreds and thousands,
gives, for the entire product, 2244.
01. The unit value of a number is not changed by re-
peating the number. As the multiplier always expresses
times, the product must have the same unit value as the mul-
tiplicand. But, since the product of any two numbers will be
the same, whichever factor is taken as a multiplier, either
factor may be taken for the multiplier or multiplicand.
NOTE. In multiplying, learn to pronounce the partial results, as in
addition, without naming the numbers separately; thus, in the last
example, instead of saying 6 times 4 are 24, 6 times 7 are 42 and 2 to
carry are 44, 6 times 3 are 18 and 4 to carry are 22, pronounce only
the results, 24, 44, 22, performing the operations mentally, This will
greatly facilitate the process of multiplying.

2 tens under the tens figure in the product already obtained, and add
the 1 hundred to the next hundreds produced. 2 tens times 4 tens

Then adding the two products, we have the entire product, 17158.
NOTES. 1. When the multiplier contains two or more figures, the
several results obtained by multiplying by each figure are called partial
products.
2. When there are ciphers between the significant figures of the
multiplier, pass over them, and multiply by the significant figures only.
63. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following general
RULE. I. Write the multiplier under the multiplicand,placing
units of the same order tinder each other.
II. Multiply the multiplicand by each figure of the multi-
plier successively, beginning with the unit figure, and write the
first figure of each partial product under the figure of the mul-
tiplier used, writing down and carrying as in addition.
III. If there are partial products, add them, and their sum
will be the product required.
64. PROOF. 1. Multiply the multiplier by the multipli-
cand, and if the product is. the same as the first result, the
work is correct. Or,
2. Multiply the multiplicand by the multiplier diminished
by 1, and to the product add the multiplicand; if the sum be
the same as the product by the whole of the multiplier, the
work is correct.

CONTRACTIONS.
CASE I.
65. When Iho multiplier is a composite mimber.
A Composite Number is one that may be produced by
multiplying together two or more numbers; thus, 18 is a com-
posite number, since 6 X 3 = 18; or, 9 X 2 = 18 • or, 3 X
aX 2 = 18.
66. The Component Factors of a number are the sev-
eral numbers which, multiplied together, produce the given
number; thus, the component factors of 20 are 10 and 2,
(10 X 2 = 20 ;) or, 4 and 5, (-1 X 5 = 20 ;) or, 2 and 2 and
5, (2 X 2 X 5 = 20.)
Note. The pupil.must not confound the factors with the ports of a
numbir. Thus, the factors of which 12 is composed, arc 4 and 3,
(IX 3= 12 ;) whde the parts of which 12 is composed are 8 and 4,

68. When the multiplier is 10, 100, 1000, &c.
If we annex a cipher to the multiplicand, each figure is re-
moved one place toward the left, and consequently the value of
the whole number is increased tenfold, (33.) If two ciphers
are annexed, each figure is removed two places toward the
left, and the value of the number is increased one hundred
fold; and every additional cipher increases the value tenfold.

Rule. Annex as many ciphers to the multiplicand as there
are ciphers in the multiplier; the number so formed will be

Product, 72000 several factors be multiplied together

74:. The Divisor is the number to divide by.
75. The Quotient is the result obtained by the process of
division, and shows how many timed the divisor is contained

NOTES. 1. When thed .vidend does not contain the divisor an exact
number of times, the part of the dividend left is called the remainder,
and it must be less than the" divisor.
2. As the remainder is always a part of the dividend, it is always
of the same name or kind.
3. When there is no remainder the division is said to be complete.
7C. The sign, -H, placed between two numbers, denotes
division, and shows that the number on the left is to be divided
by the number on the right. Thus, 20 -j- 4 = 5, is read, 20
divided by 4 is equal to 5.
Division is also indicated by writing the dividend above, and
12
the divisor below a short horizontal line; thus, — — 4, shows
that 12 divided by 3 equals 4.

— over, which, united to the 4 tens, makes
235... 3 Rem. 14 tens; 4 in 14 tens, 3 tens times and 2
tens over, which, united to the 3 units,
make 23 units; 4 in 23 units 5 units times and 3 units over. The
3 which is left after performing the division, should be divided by 4;
but the method of doing it cannot be explained until we reach
Fractions; so we merely indicate the division by placing the divisor
under the dividend, thus, -|. The entire quotient is written 235|,
which may be read, two hundred thirty-five and three divided by
four, or, two hundred thirty-five and a remainder of three.
From the foregoing examples and illustrations, we deduce
the following
RULE. I. Write the divisor at the left of the dividend, with
a line between them.
-. . ... . —

n.p 8
II. Beginning at the left hand, divide each figure of the
dividend by the divisor, and write the result under the divi-
dend.
III. If there be a remainder after dividing any figure, re-
gard it as prefixed to the figure of the next lower order in the
dividend, and divide as before.
IV. Should any figure or part of the dividend be less than
the divisor, write a cipher in the quotient, and prefix the num-
ber to the figure of the next lower order in the dividend, and
divide as before.
V. If there be a remainder after dividing the last figure,
place it over the divisor at the right hand of the quotient.
PROOF. Multiply the divisor and quotient together, and to
the product add the remainder, if any; if the result be equal
to the dividend, the work is correct.
NOTES. 1. This method of proof depends on the fact that division is
the reverse of multiplication. The dividend answers to the product, the
iimsor to one of the factors, and the quotient to the other.
2. In multiplication the two factors are given, to find the product:
in division, the product and one of the factors are given to find the
other factor.

CASE II.
78. When the divisor consists of two or more figures.
Note. To illustrate more clearly the method of operation, we will
first take an example usually performed by Short Division.
Case II is what}
1. How many times is 8 contained in 2528?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. As 8 is not contained in 2 thou-
8 ) 2528 f 316 sands, we take 2 and 5 as one number, and con-
-. sider how many times 8 is contained in this
partial dividend, 25 hundreds; and find that it
12 is contained 3 hundreds times, and a remainder.
8 To find this remainder, we multiply the divisor,
~~7T 8, by the quotient figure, 3 hundreds, and sub-
° tract the product, 24 hundreds, from the par-
48 ^ dividend, 25 hundreds, and there remains
1 hundred. To this remainder we bring down
the 2 tens of the dividend, and consider the 12 tens a second partial
dividend. Then, 8 is contained in 12 tens 1 ten time and a remain-
der; 8 multiplied by 1 ten produces 8 tens, which, subtracted from
12 tens, leave 4 tens. To this remainder we bring down the 8 units,
and consider the 48 units the third partial dividend. Then,8 is con-
tained in 48 units 6 units times. Multiplying and subtracting as
before, we find that nothing remains, and we have for the entire
quotient, 316.
2. How many tirnes is 23 contained in 4807?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first find how
Divisor. Divid.d. Quotient. many times 23 is contained in 48,
23 ) 4807 ( 209 the first partial dividend, and place
46 the result in the quotient on ths
right of the dividend. We then
multiply the divisor, 23, by tho
^"' quotient figure, 2, and subtract the
produc.t, 46, from the part of ths
dividend used, and to the remainder bring down the next figure of
the dividend, which is 0, making 20, for the second partial dividend.
Then, since 23 is contained in 20 no times, we place a cipher in the
quotient, and bring down the next figure of the dividend, making a
third partial dividend, 207; 23 is contained in 207, 9 times; multi-
plying and subtracting as before, nothing remains, and we have for
the entire quotient, 209.
NOTES. 1. When the process of dividing is performed mentally, and
the results only are written, as in Case I, the operation is termed Short
Division.
2. When the whole process of division is written, the operation is
termed Long Division.
Give first explanation. Second. What is long division? What is
short division? When is each used?
3. Short Division is generally used when the divisor is a number
that will allow the process of dividing to be performed mentally.
From the preceding illustrations we derive the following
general
RULE. I. Write the divisor at the left of the dividend, as
in short division.
II. Divide the least number of the left hand figures in the
dividend that will contain the divisor one or more times, and
place the quotient at the right of the dividend, with a line be-
tween them.
III. Multiply the divisor by this quotient figure, subtract
the product from the partial dividend used, and to the remain-
der bring down the next figure of the dividend.
IV. Divide as before, until all the figures of the dividend
have been brought down and divided.
V. If any partial dividend will not contain the divisor,
place a cipher in the quotient, and bring down the next figure
of the dividend, and divide as before.
VI. If there be a remainder after dividing all the figures of
the dividend, it must be written in the quotient, with the divi-
sor underneath.
NOTES. 1. If any remainder be equal to, or greater than the divisor,
the quotient figure is too small, and must be increased.
2. If the product of the divisor by the quotient figure be greater
than the partial dividend, the quotient figure is too large, and must be
diminished.
79. PROOF. 1. The same as in short division. Or,
2. Subtract the remainder, if any, from the dividend, and
divide the difference by the quotient; if the result be the same
as the given divisor, the work is correct.

1. If 3270 dollars be divided equally among 30 men, how

operation. Analysis. If 3270 dollars be divided
5)3270 equally among 30 men, each man will receive
as many dollars as 30 is contained times in
6)654 327o dollars. 30 may be resolved into the
109 Ans. factors 5 and 6; and we may suppose the 30
men divided into 5 groups of 6 men each;
dividing the 3270 dollars by 5, the number of groups, we have
654, the number of dollars to be given to each group; and dividing
the 654 dollars by 6, the number of men in each group, we have
109, the number of dollars that each man will receive. Hence,
Rule. Divide the dividend by one of the factors, and the
quotient thus obtained by another, and so on if there be more
than two factors, until every factor has been made a divisor.
The last quotient will be the quotient required.

Analysis. Divid-
ing 1143 by 2, we
have a quotient of
571, and a remainder
of 1 undivided, which,
being a part of the
given dividend, must
also be a part of the
true remainder. The
571 being a quotient arising from dividing by 2, its units are
2 times as great in value as the units of the given dividend, 1143.
Dividing the 571 by 8, we have a quotient of 71, and a remainder
of 3 undivided. As this 3 is a part of the 571, it must be multiplied
by 2 to change it to the same kind of units as the 1. This makes a
true remainder of 6 arising from dividing by 8. Dividing the 71 by
4, we have a quotient of 17, and a remainder of 3 undivided. This
3 is a part of the 71, the units of which are 8 times as great in value
as those of the 571, and the units of the 571 are 2 times as great
in value as those of the given dividend, 1143; therefore, to change
this last remainder, 3, to units of the same value as the dividend,
we multiply it by 8 and 2, and obtain a true remainder of 48 arising
from dividing by 4. Adding the three partial remainders, we obtain
55, the true remainder. Hence,
Rule. I. Multiply each partial remainder, except the first,
by all the preceding divisors.
II. Add the several products with the first remainder, and
the sum will be the true remainder.

trary, by cutting oft. or taking away
the right hand figure of a number, each of the other figures is removed
one place toward the right, and, consequently, the value of each is
diminished tenfold, or divided by 10, (32.)
For similar reasons, if we cut off two figures, we divide by
100, if three, we divide by 1000, and so on. Hence the
RULE, from the right hand of the dividend cut off as
many figures as there are ciphers in the divisor. Under the
figures so cut off", place the divisor, and the whole will form the
quotient.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIVISION.
86. The quotient in Division depends upon the relative
values of the dividend and divisor. Hence any change in the
value of either dividend or divisor must produce a change in
the value of the quotient. But some changes may be produced
upon both dividend and divisor, at the same Vime, that
will not affect the quotient. The laws which govern these
changes are called General Principles of Division, which we
will now examine.
I. 54H-9 = 6.
If we multiply the dividend by 3, we have
54 X 3 4- 9 = 162 4- 9 = 18,
and 18 equals the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence,
Multiplying the dividend by any number, multiplies the quotient
by the same number.
II. Using the same example, 54 -±- 9 = 6.
If we divide the dividend by 3 we have
V -T- 9 = 18 -H 9 = 2>
and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Dividing the
dividend by any number, divides the quotient by the samp
number.
III. If we multiply the divisor by 3, we have
54 _i. 9 X 3 = 54 4- 27 = 2,
and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Multiplying
the divisor by any number, divides the quotient by the same
number.
V. If we divide the divisor by 3, we have
54 -H § = 54 4- 3 = 18,
Upon what does the value of the quotient depend? What is the
first general principle of division 8 Second? Third? Fourth t
and 18 = the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence, Dividing
the divisor by any number, multiplies the quotient by the same
number.
V. If we multiply both dividend and divisor by 3, we have
54 X 3 -H 9 X 3 = 162 H- 27 = 6.
Hence, Multiplying both dividend and divisor by the same num-
ber, does not alter the value of the quotient.
VI. If we divide both dividend and divisor by 3, we have
V-7- |=18-t-8 = 6.
Hence, Dividing both dividend and divisor by the same num-
ber, does not alter the value of the quotient.
87. These six examples illustrate all the different changes
we ever have occasion to make upon the dividend and divisor
in practical arithmetic. The principles upon which these
changes are based may be stated as follows:
Prin. I. Multiplying the dividend multiplies the quotient;
and dividing the dividend divides the quotient. (86. I and II.)
Prin. II. Multiplying the divisor divides the quotient; and
dividing the divisor multiplies the quotient. (8G. Ill and IV.)
Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both dividend and
divisor by the same number, does not alter the quotient. (86.
V and VI.)
88. These three principles may be embraced in one
-
GENERAL LAW.
A change in the dividend produces a like change in the
quotient; but a change in the divisor produces an opposite
change in the quotient.
Note. If a number be multiplied and the product divided by the
same number, the quotient will be equal to the number multiplied.
Thus, 15X4 = 60, and 60 -H 4 = 15.
Fifth? Sixth? Into how many general principles can these be con-
densed r What is the first? Second i Third? In what general law
are these embraced:
EXACT DIVISORS.
S9-, An Exact Divisor of a number is one that gives
k whole number for a quotient.
As it is frequently desirable to know if a number has an exact
divisor, we will present a few directions that will be of assistance,
particularly in finding exact divisors of large numbers.
NOTE. A number whose unit figure is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 is called an
Even Number. And a number whose unit figure is 1, 3, 5, 7- or 9, is
called an Odd Number.
2 is an exact divisor of all even numbers.
4 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the tens
and units of a number. Thus, 4 is an exact divisor of 268,
756, 1284.
5 is an exact divisor of every number whose unit figure is
0 or 5. Thus, 5 is an exact divisor of 20, 955, and 2840.
8 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the hun-
dreds, tens, and units of a number. Thus, 8 is an exact
divisor of 1728, 5280, and 213560.
9 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the sum of
the digits of a number. Thus, in 2486790, the sum of the
digits 2 + 4+8 +6.+ 7+9 + 0 = 36, and 36 -=- 9 = 4.
10 is an exact divisor when 0 occupies units' place.
100 when 00 occupy the places of units and tens.
1000 when 000 occupy the places of units, tens, and hun-
dreds, &c.
A composite number is an exact divisor of any number,
when all its factors are exact divisors of the same number.
Thus, 2, 2, and 3 are exact divisors of 12; and so also are 4
(=2X2) and 6 (= 2 X 3).
An even number is not an exact divi=or of an odd number.
If an odd number is an exact divisor of an even number,
What is an exact divisor? What is an even number? An odd num-
ber? When is 2 an exact divisor? 4? 5? 9? 10? 100 > 1000?
When .is a composite number an exact divisor? An even number is
not an exact divisor of what? An odd number is on exact divisor of
what?
67
twice that odd number is also an exact divisor of the even
number. Thus, 7 is an exact divisor of 42; so also is 7 X 2,
or 14.
PRIME NUMBERS.
90. A Prime Number is one that can not be resolved
or separated into two or more integral factors.

1. What are the prime factors of 2772?
operation. Analysis. We divide the given number by
2. the least prime factor, and the result by 2;
this gives an odd number for a quotient, divisible
by the prime factor, 3, and the quotient resulting
from this division is also divisible by 3. The
n :xt quotient, 77, we divide by its ieast prime
factor, 7, and we obtain the quotient 11; this be-
ing a prime number, the division can not be car-
ried further. The divisors and last quotient, 2,
2, 3, 3, 7, and 11 are all the prime factors of the
I | given number, 2772. Hence the
Rule. Divide the given number by any prime factor; di-
vide the quotient in the same manner, and so continue the
division until the quotient is a prime number. The several
divisors and the last quotient will be the prime factors required.
Proof. The product of all the prime factors will be tha
given number.

CANCELLATION.
93. Cancellation is the process of rejecting equal factors
from numbers sustaining to each other the relation of dividend
and divisor.
It has been shown (77) that the dividend is equal to the
product of the divisor multiplied by the quotient. Hence, if
the dividend can be resolved into two factors, one of which is
the divisor, the other factor will be the quotient.
1. Divide 63 by 7.
operation. Analysis. We see in
DiTisor, <jtyjt X 9 Dividend. this example that 63 is
composed of the factors 7
9 Quotient. and o,, and tnat the factor
7 is equal to the divisor.
Therefore we reject the factor 7, and the remaining factor, 9, is the
quotient.
Give explanation. What is cancellation? Upon what principle is
it based r Give first explanation.
94. Whenever the dividend and divisor are each composite
numbers, the factors common to both may first be rejected
without altering the final result. (875 Prin. III.)
2. What is the quotient of 24 times 56 divided by 7 times
48?
operation. Analysis.
24 X 56 4 X 0 X 11 X $ We first in' = = 4, Ans. dicate the op-
7 X 48 # X 0 X # eration to be
performed by
writing the numbers which constitute the dividend above a line, and
those which constitute the divisor below it. Instead of multiplying
24 by 56, in the dividend, we resolve 24 into the factors 4 and 6,
and 56 into the factors 7 and 8; and 48 in the divisor into the fac-
tors 6 and 8. We next cancel the factors 6, 7, and 8, which are
common to the dividend and divisor, and we have left the factor 4
in the dividend, which is the quotient.
Note. When all the factors or numbers in the dividend are can-
celed, 1 should be retained.
95. If any two numbers, one in the dividend and one in
the divisor, contain a common factor, we may reject that factor.
3. In 54 times 77, how many times G3?
operation. Analysis. In this example we see that 9 will
6 11 divide 54 and 63; so we reject 9 as a factor of 54,
*j -f-i and retain the factor 6, and also as a factor of 63,
pfl X // and reta;n the factor 7. Again, 7 will divide 7 in
$tf the divisor, and 77 in the dividend. Dividing
rf both numbers by 7, 1 will be retained in the
divisor, and 11 in the dividend. Finally, the
product of 6 X 11 = 66, the quotient.
4. Divide 25 X 16 X 12 by 10 X 4 X 6 X 7.
operation. Analysis. In
5 4 $ this, as in the pre-
$6 X H X ift 5x4 cedinS example, we
— =—— =*n=2f reject all the fac-

fi mon to both divi-
dend and divisor,
Give second explanation.
and we have remaining the factor 7 in the divisor, and the factors 5 and
4 in the dividend. Completing the work, we have ty r= 28, Aw.
From the preceding examples and illustrations we derive
the following
RULE. I. Write the numbers composing the dividend above
a horizontal line, and the numbers composing the divisor
below it.
II. Cancel all the factors common to both dividend and
divisor.
III. Divide the product of the remaining factors of the div-
idend by the product of the remaining factors of the divisor,
and the result will be the quotient.
NOTES. 1. Rejecting a factor from any number is dividing the number
by that factor.
2. When a factor is canceled, the unit, 1, is supposed to take its
place.
3. One factor in the dividend will cancel only one equal factor in the
divisor.
4. If all the factors or numbers of the divisor are canceled, the
product of the remaining factors of the dividend will be the quotient.
5. By many it is thought more convenient to write the factors of
the dividend on the right of a vertical line, and the factors of the divisor
on the left.

will exactly divide each of the given
numbers, and that 7 will exactly
divide each of the resulting quo-
tients. Hence, each of the given
numbers can be exactly divided by 3
™ X ' — 21, Ans. times 7; and these numbers must be
component factors of the greatest
common divisor. Now, if there were any other component factor of
the greatest common divisor, the quotients, 2,3, 5, would be exactly
divisible by it. But these quotients are prime to each other Hence
3 and 7 are all the component factors of the greatest common divisor
sought.
3. What is the greatest common divisor of 28,140, and 280?
operation. Analysis. We first divide by 4;
then the quotients by 7. The re-
sulting quotients, 1, 5, and 10, are
prime to each other. Hence 4 and
7 are all the component factors of
the greatest common divisor.
4 X 7 = 28, Ans.
From these examples and analyses we derive the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers in a line, with a vertical line
at the left, and divide by any factor common to all the numbers.

division till a set of quotients is obtained that have no common
factor.

the right, and the smaller number on
the left, one line lower down. We
then divide 203, the larger number, by
84, the smaller, and write 2, the quo-
tient, between the verticals, the prod-
uct, 168, opposite, under the greater
number, and the remainder, 35, below.
We next divide 84 by this remainder,
writing the quotient, 2, between the verticals, the product, 70, on the
left, and the new remainder, 14, below the 70. We again divide the
last divisor, 35, by 14, and obtain 2 for a quotient, 28 for a product,
and 7 for a remainder, all of which we write in the same order as in
the former steps. Finally, dividing the last divisor, 14, by the last
remainder, 7, and we have no remainder. 7, the last divisor, is the
greatest common divisor of the given numbers.
In order to show that the last divisor in such a process is
the greatest common divisor, we will first trace the work in the
reverse order, as indicated by the arrow line below.
OPERATION.
7 divides the 14, as proved
by the last division; it will
also divide two times 14, or 28,
(I.) Now, as 7 divides both
itself and 28, it will divide 35,
their sum, (II.) It will also
divide 2 times 35, or 70, (I;)
and since it is a common
divisor of 70 and 14, it must
divide their sum, 84, which
is one of the given numbers,
(II.) It will also divide 2
times 84, or 168, (I;) and
since it is a common divisor of 168 and 35, it must divide their
sum, 203, the larger number, (II.) Hence 7 is a common divisor
of the given numbers.
Again, tracing the work in the direct order, as indicated below, we

know that the greatest common divisor, -whatever it be, must divide
^ 2 times 84, or 168, (I.) Then
203 since it will divide both 168
and 203, it must divide their
84

Ifi8 difference, 35, (III.) It will
also divide 2 times 35, or 70,
(I ;) and as it will divide both
35 70 and 84, it must divide their
difference, 14, (III.) It will
28
also divide 2 times 14 or 28,
(I;) and as it will divide both
28 and 35, it must divide their
difference, 7, (III;) hence, it
cannot be greater than 7.
Thus we have shown,
1st. That 7 is a common divisor of the given numbers.
2d. That their greatest common divisor, whatever it be,
cannot be greater than 7. Hence it must be 7.
From this example and analysis, we derive the following
RULE. I. Draw two verticals, and write the two numbers,
one on each side, the greater number one line above the less.
II. Divide the greater number by the less, writing the quo-
tient between the verticals, the product under the dividend, and
the remainder below.
III. Divide the less number by the remainder, the last divisor
by the last remainder, and so on, till nothing remains. The
last divisor will be the greatest common divisor sought.
IV. If more than two numbers be given, first find the greatest
common divisor of two of them, and then of this divisor and one
of the remaining numbers, and so on to the last; the last common
divisor found will be the greatest common divisor of all the
given numbers.
NOTES. 1 . When more than two numbers are given, it is better to
begin with the least two.

FIRST METHOD.
From the nature of prime numbers we derive the follow-
ing principles: —
I. If a number exactly contain another, it will contain all
the prime factors of that number.
II. If a number exactly contain two or more numbers, it
will also contain all the prime factors of those numbers.
III. The least number that will exactly contain all the
prime factors of two or more numbers, is the least common
multiple of those numbers.

factors of 30 except the factor 5. Annexing 5 to the series of factors,
2X3X 13 X 11 X 7X5,
and we have all the prime factors of each of the given numbers; and
hence the product of the series of factors is a common multiple of
the given numbers, (II.) And as no factor of this series can be
omitted without omitting a factor of one of the given numbers, the
product of the series is the least common multiple of the given
numbers, (III.)
From this example and analysis we deduce the following
RULE. I. Resolve the given numbers into their prime factors.
II. Take all the prime factors of the largest number, and
such prime factors of the other numbers as are not found in the
largest number, and their product will be the least common
multiple.
NOTE. When a prime factor is repeated in any of the given numbers,
it must be used as many times, as a factor of the multiple, as the
greatest number of times it appears in any of the given numbers.

OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first write

with a vertical line at the left.
Since 2 is a factor of some of

2X2X3X3= 36, Ans. manv of *p numbers as are
divisible by 2, we write the
quotients and the undivided number, 9, in a line underneath. We
now perceive that some of the numbers in the second line contain
the factor 2; hence the least common multiple must contain another
'2, and we again divide by 2, omitting to write down any quotient
when it is 1. We next divide by 3 for a like reason, and still again
by 3. By this process we have transferred all the factors of each
of the numbers to the left of the vertical; and their product, 36,
must be the least common multiple sought, (1O4, III.)

that is divisible by either of these factors or by their product; thus,
we divide 10 by both 2 and 5; 12 by 2; 15 by 5; and 75 by 5.
We next divide the second line in like manner by 2 and 3; and
afterwards the third line by 5. By this process we collect the
factors of the given numbers into groups; and the product of the
factors at the left of the vertical is the least common multiple sought.

Analysis. In this oper-
ation we omit the 6 and 35,
because they are exactly con-
tained in some of the other

contained in 42, and 35 in
70; and whatever will contain 42 and 70 must contain 6 and 35.
Hence we have only to find the least common multiple of the re-
maining numbers, 15, 42, and 70.
From these examples we derive the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers in a line, omitting any of the
smaller numbers that are factors of the larger, and draw a
vertical line at the left.
II. Divide by any prime factor, or factors, that may be con-
tainedin one or more of the given numbers, and write the quotients
and undivided numbers in a line underneath, omitting the Vs.
III. In like manner divide the quotients and undivided num-
bers, and continue the process till all the factors of the given
numbers have been transferred to the left of the vertical. Then
multiply these factors together, and their product will be the least
common multiple required.

CLASSIFICATION OF NUMBERS.
Numbers may be classified as follows:
106. I. As Even and Odd.
107. II. As Prime and Composite.
What is the first classification of numbers? What is an even num-
ber? An odd number? Second classification? A prime number}
A composite number?
108. III. As Integral and Fractional.
An Integral Number, or Integer, expresses whole things.
Thus, 281; 78 boys; 1000 books.
A Fractional Number, or Fraction, expresses equal parts
of a thing. Thus, half a dollar; three-fourths of an hour;
seven-eighths of a mile.
100. IV. As Abstract and Concrete.
110. V. As Simple and Compound.
A Simple Number is either an abstract number, or a
concrete number of but one denomination. Thus, 48, 926;
48 dollars, 926 miles.
A Compound Number is a concrete number whose value is
expressed in two or more different denominations. Thus, 32
dollars 15 cents; 15 days 4 hours 25 minutes; 7 miles 82
rods 9 feet 6 inches.
111. VI. As Like and Unlike.
Like Numbers are numbers of the same unit value.
If simple numbers, they must be all abstract, as 6, 62, 487;
or all of one and the same denomination, as 5 apples, 62 ap-
ples, 487 apples; and, if compound numbers, they must be
used to express the same kind of quantity, as time, distance,
&c. Thus, 4 weeks 3 days 16 hours; 1 week 6 days 9
hours; 5 miles 40 rods; 2 miles 100 rods.
Unlike Numbers are numbers of different unit values. Thus,
75, 140 dollars, and 28 miles; 4 hours 30 minutes, and 5
bushels 1 peck.
What is the third classification? What is an integral number? A
fractional number? What is the fourth classification? An abstract
number? A concrete number? What is the fifth classification? A

FRACTIONS.
DEFINITIONS, NOTATION, AND NUMERATION.
112. If a unit be divided into 2 equal parts, one of the
parts is called one half.
If a unit be divided into 3 equal parts, one of the parts is
called one third, two of the parts two thirds.
If a unit be divided into 4 equal parts, one of the parts is
called one fourth, two of the parts two fourths, three of the
parts three fourths.
If a unit be divided into 5 equal parts, one of the parts is
called one fifth, two of the parts two fifths, three of the parts
three fifths, Sec.
The parts are expressed by figures; thus,
One half is written
One third"
Two thirds"
One fourth"
Two fourths"
Three fourths"
One fifth is written -j
Two fifths " |
One seventh " f
Three eighths" f
Five ninths " f
Eight tenths " •&
Hence we see that the parts into which a unit is divided take
their name, and their value, from the number of equal parts
into which the unit is divided. Thus, if we divide an orange
into 2 equal parts, the parts are called halves; if into 3 equal
parts, thirds; if into 4 equal parts, fourths, &c.; and each
third is less in value than each half, and each fourth less than
each third; and the greater the number of parts, the less
their value.
When a unit is divided into any number of equal parts, one
or more such parts is a fractional part of the whole number,
and is called a fraction. Hence
1156. A Fraction is one or more of the equal parts of a
unit.
Define a fraction.
To write a fraction, two integers are required, one
to express the number of parts into which the whole number
is divided, and the other to express the number of these parts
taken. Thus, if one dollar be divided into 4 equal parts,
the parts are called fourths, and three of these parts are
called three fourths of a dollar. This three fourths may be
written
3 the number of parts taken.
4 the number of parts into which the dollar is divided.
115. The Denominator is the number below the line.
It denominates or names the parts; and
It shows how many parts are equal to a unit.
116. The Numerator is the number above the line.
It numerates or numbers the parts; and
It shows how many parts are taken or expressed by
the fraction.
liy. The Terms of a fraction are the numerator and de-
nominator, taken together.
118. Fractions indicate division, the numerator answering
to the dividend, and the denominator to the divisor. Hence,
A119. The Value of a fraction is the quotient of the nu-
merator divided by the denominator.
ISO. To analyze a fraction is to designate and describe
its numerator and denominator. Thus, f is analyzed as fol-
lows : —
4 is the denominator, and shows that the unit is divided
into 4 equal parts; it is the divisor.
3 is the numerator, and shows that 3 parts are taken; it is
the dividend, or integer divided.
3 and 4 are the terms, considered as dividend and divisor.
The value of the fraction is the quotient of 3 -=- 4, or £.

121. Fractions are distinguished as Proper and Improper.
A Proper Fraction is one whose numerator is less than its
denominator; its value is less than the unit, 1. Thus, ^i, -fa,
•f-y, Jf are proper fractions.
An Improper Fraction is one whose numerator equals or
exceeds its denominator; its value is never less than the
unit, 1. Thus, ^, §, -\$-, 3f-, £g, J^Q. are improper fractions.
132. A Mixed Number is a number expressed by an in-
teger and a fraction; thus, 4^, 17£f, 9^ aro mixed numbers.

terms of a fraction will affect the value of that fraction according
to the laws of division; and we have only to modify the lan-

FIRST OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Dividing both

of the fraction or quotient, (124, III;) hence, we divide both
terms of ||, by 2, both terms of the result, ||, by 2, and both terms
of this result by 3. As the terms of -| are prime to each other, the
lowest terms of |$ are ^. We have, in effect, canceled all the fac-

13O. To reduce a fraction to a given denominator.
As fractions may be reduced to lower terms by division,
they may also be reduced to higher terms by multiplication;
and all higher terms must be multiples of the lowest terms.
(103.)
1. Reduce £ to a fraction whose denominator is 20.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first divide 20, the
20 _i_ 4 — 5 required denominator, by 4, the denomi-
nator of the given fraction, to ascertain
_^ X 5 _ , 5^ ^ns^ if it be a multiple of this term, 4. The
4X5" division shows that it is a multiple, and
that 5 is the factor which must be em-
ployed to produce this multiple of 4. We therefore multiply both
terms of £ by 5, (124,) and obtain $, the desired result. Hence the
RULE. Divide the required denominator by the denominator
of the given fraction, and multiply both terms of the fraction by
the quotient.

A Common Denominator is a denominator common to two
or more fractions.
1. Reduce J and f to a common denominator.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We multiply the terms of the
3^5 first fraction by the denominator of the second,
— = £$ and the terms of the second fraction by the
4X5 denominator of the first, (124.) This must re-
- Y . duce each fraction to the same denominator,
— — a for each new denominator will be the product
5X4 of the given denominators. Hence the
RULE. Multiply the terms of each fraction by the denomina-
tors of all the other fractions.

132. To reduce fractions to the least common de-

The Least Common Denominator of two or more fractions
is the least denominator to which they can all be reduced, and
it must be the least common multiple of the lowest denom-
inators.
1. Reduce £, |, and -i^ to the least common denominator.
operation. Analysis. We first find
the least common multiple
of the given denominators,
which is 24. This must be
the least common denom-
inator to which the frac-
tions can be reduced. (III.)
We then multiply the terms
of each fraction by such a
number as will reduce the fraction to the denominator, 24. Re-
ducing each fraction to this denominator, by Case V, we have the
answer.
Since the common denominator is already determined, it is
only necessary to multiply the numerators by the multipliers.
Hence the following
Rule. I. Find the least common multiple of the given de-
nominators, for the least common denominator.
II. Divide this common denominator by each of the given
denominators, and multiply each numerator by the correspond-
ing quotient. The products will be the new numerators.

As in whole
numbers, we
can subtract like numbers only, or those having the same unit value,
so, we can subtract fractions only when they have a common de-
nominator. As f and | have not a common denominator, we first
reduce them to a common denominator, and then subtract the
less numerator, 30, from the greater, 32, and write the difference, 2,
over the common denominator, 36. We thus obtain fa = fa, the
required difference. Hence the following

the fractional and integral parts separately. Or,
We may reduce the mixed numbers to improper fractions,

add their products; or, we may reduce both numbers to
improper fractions, and then multiply as in the foregoing rule.

fourtlis; and 3 fourths is contained in 48
fourths 16 times, the required number of yards.
second operation. Analysis. Here we divide the integer
g \ j 2 by the numerator of the fraction, and mul-
tiply the quotient by the denominator,
* which produces the same result as in the

We see in the operation that we have multiplied the dividend by
the denominator of the divisor, and divided the result by the numer-
ator of the divisor, which is in accordance with 140 for dividing a
fraction. Hence, by inverting the terms of the divisor, the two
fractions will stand in such relation to each other that we can mul-
tiply together the two upper numbers for the numerator of the quo-
tient, and the two lower numbers for the denominator, as shown in
the operation. For division of fractions, we have this general
Rule. I. Reduce integers and mixed numbers to improper
fractions.
II. Invert the terms of the divisor, and proceed as in multi-
plication.
Notes. 1. The dividend and divisor may be reduced to a common
denominator, and the numerator of the dividend be divided by the nu-
merator of the divisor; this will give the same result as the rule.
2. Apply cancellation where practicable.

DECIMAL FRACTIONS.
- 143. Decimal Fractions are fractions which have for
their denominator 10, 100, 1000, or 1 with any number of
ciphers annexed.
NOTES. 1. The word decimal is derived from the Latin decem,
which signifies ten.
2. Decimal fractions are commonly called decimals.
3. Since ^ = T1^, yj-ii- — TOTJJ-I &c-. the denominators of decimal
fractions increase and decrease in a tenfold ratio, the same as simple
numbers.
DECIMAL NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
144. Common Fractions are the common divisions of a
unit into any number of equal parts, as into halves, fifths,
twenty-fourths, &c.
Decimal Fractions are the decimal divisions of a unit, thus:
A unit is divided into ten equal parts, called tenths; each of
these tenths is divided into ten other equal parts called hun-
dredths; each of these hundredths into ten other equal parts,
called thousandths; and so on. Since the denominators of
decimal fractions increase and decrease by the scale of 10, the
same as simple numbers, in writing decimals the denomina-
tors may be omitted.
In simple numbers, the unit, 1, is the starting point of
notation and numeration; and so also is it in decimals. We
extend the scale of notation to the left of units' place in
writing integers, and to the right of units' place in writing
decimals. Thus, the first place at the left of units is tens,
and the first place at the right of units is tenths; the second
place at the left is hundreds, and the second place at the
right is hundredths; the third place at the left is thousands,
and the third place at the right is thousandths; and so on.
What are decimal fractions? How do they differ from common
fractions? How are they written?
The Decimal Point is a period ( . ), which must always be
placed before or at the left hand of the decimal. Thus,
T6j is expressed .6
Tfo" " -54
"-279
NOTE. The decimal point is also called the Separatrix. This is a
correct name for it only when it stands between the integral and deci-
mal parts of the same number.
.5 is 5 tenths, which = -fa of 5 units;
.05 is 5 hundredths, "— T'ir of 5 tenths;
,005 is 5 thousandths, "= TV of 5 hundredths.
And universally, the value of a figure in any decimal place
is ^r the value of the same figure in the next left hand place.
The relation of decimals and integers to each other is clear-
ly shown by the following
-- NUMERATION TABLE.
.Si
4753.62418695
Inifgfi-s. Decimals.
By examining this table we see that
Tenths are expressed by one figure.
Hundredths " " "two figures.
Thousandths " " "three"
Ten thousandths" " "four"
And any order of decimals by one figure less than the corre-
sponding order of integers.
145. Since the denominator of tenths is 10, of hun-
What is the decimal point? What is it sometimes called? What is
the value of a figure in any decimal place?
dredths 100, of thousands 1000, and so on, a decimal may be
expressed by writing the numerator only; but in this case
the numerator or decimal must always contain as many
decimal places as are equal to the number of ciphers in the
denominator; and the denominator of a decimal will always
be the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as are equal to
the number of figures in the decimal or numerator.
The decimal point must never be omitted.

1. Express in figures thirty-eight hundredths.
2. Write seven tenths.
3. Write three hundred twenty-five thousandths.

5. Write sixteen thousandths.
6. Write seventy-four hundred-thousandths. Ans. .00074.
7. Write seven hundred forty-five millionths.
8. Write four thousand two hundred thirty-two ten-thou-
sandths.
9. Write five hundred thousand millionths.
10. Bead the following decimals:

.24 .024 .0005 .001385
.672 .8471 .100248 .1000087
NOTE. To read a decimal, we first numerate from left to right, and
the name of the right hand figure is the name of the denominator. We
then numerate from right to left, as in whole numbers, to read the
numerator.
146. A mixed number is a number consisting of integers
and decimals; thus, 71.406 consists of the integral part, 71,
and the decimal part, .406; it is read the same as
71 and 406 thousandths.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Write eighteen, and twenty-seven thousandths.
2. Write four hundred, and nineteen ten-millionths.
How many decimal places must there be to express any decimal?
3. Write fifty-four, and fifty-four millionths.
4. Eighty-one, and 1 ten-thousandth.
5. One hundred, and 67 ten-thousandths.
6. Read the following numbers:
18.027 100.0067 400.0000019
81.0001 54.000054 3.03
75.075 9.2806 40.40404
147. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations
we derive the following important
PRINCIPLES OP DECIMAL NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
1. The value of any decimal figure depends upon its place
from the decimal point: thus .3 is ten times .03.
2. Prefixing a cipher to a decimal decreases its value the
same as dividing it by ten; thus, .03 is -i^ the value of .3.
3. Annexing a cipher to a decimal does not alter its value,
since it does not change the place of the significant figures of
the decimal; thus, -f^, or .6, is the same as -ffa, or .60.
4. Decimals increase from right to left, and decrease from
left to right, in a tenfold ratio; and therefore they may be
added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided the same as whole
numbers.
5. The denominator of a decimal, though never expressed,
is always the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as there
are figures in the decimal.
6. To read decimals requires two numerations; first, from
units, to find the name of the denominator, and second, towards
units, to find the value of the numerator.
148. Having analyzed all the principles upon which the
writing and reading of decimals depend, we will now present
these principles in the form of rules.
RULE FOR DECIMAL NOTATION.
I. Write the decimal the same as a whole number, placing
"What is the first principle of decimal notation? Second? Third?

II. Place the decimal point before the first figure,
RULE FOR DECIMAL NUMERATION.
I. Numerate from the decimal point, to determine the de-
nominator.
II. Numerate towards the decimal point, to determine the
numerator.
III. Read the decimal as a whole number, giving it the name
or denomination of the right hand figure.

, . tains fivo decimal places, and hence 100000 must
bo a common denominator. As annexing ciphers
to decimals does not alter their value, (144., 3) we give to each number
five decimal places by annexing ciphers, and thus reduco the given
decimals to a common denominator. Hence,
RULE. Give to each number the same number of decimal
places, by annexing ciphers.
NOTES. 1. If the numbers be reduced to the denominator of that
one of the given numbers having the greatest number of decimal places,
they will have their least common decimal denominator.
2. A whole number may readily be reduced to decimals by placing
the decimal point after units, and annexing ciphers; one cipher re-
ducing it to tenths, two ciphers to hundredths, three ciphers to thou-
sandths, and so on.

1 mal, and then reduce the common fraction
thus formed to its lowest terms. Hence,
RULE. Omit the decimal point, and supply the proper
denominator.

151. To reduce a common fraction to a decimal.
1. Reduce £ to its equivalent decimal.
FIRST OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first annex
f = £$g = jjg — .75, Ans. the same number of ciphers
to both terms of the fraction;
SECOND OPERATION. this does not alter its value.
A \ o nn ^e then divide both resulting
—-— terms by 4, the significant fig-
.75 ure of the denominator, to ob-
tain the decimal denominator,
100. Then the fraction is changed to the decimal form by omitting
the denominator. If the intermediate steps be omitted, the true
result may be obtained as in the second operation.
2. Reduce -fa to its equivalent decimal.
Case II is what? Give explanation. Rule. Case EH is what?
Explain first operation. Second.
THIRD OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Dividing as in the former
1 6 ) 1 .0000 example, we obtain a quotient if 3 fig-
T ~ ures, 625. But since we annexed 4
.062o, Ant. ciphers, there must be 4 places in the
required decimal; hence we prefix 1 cipher. This is made still
plainer by the following operation; thus,
rfSfa = 0625.
From these illustrations we derive the following
RULE. I. Annex ciphers to the numerator, and divide by
the denominator.
II. Point off as many decimal places in the result as are
equal to the number of ciphers annexed.
NOTE. A common fraction can be reduced to an exact decimal when
its lowest denominator contains only the prime factors 2 and 5, and
not otherwise.

14. Reduce £f to a decimal. 'Ans. .513513+.
NOTE. The answers to the last two examples are called repeating
decimals; and the figure 3 in the 13th example, and the figures 513 in
the 14th, are called repetends, because they are repeated, or occur in
regular order,

operation. Analysis. We write the numbers so that fig-
3.703 ures of like orders of units shall stand in the same
G21 57 columns; that is, units under units, tenths under
P„, tenths, hundredths under hundredths, &c. This
"brings the decimal points directly under each
other. Commencing at the right hand, we add
045.9524 each column separately, and carry as in whole
numbers, and in the result we place a decimal
point between units and tenths, or directly under the decimal point
in the numbers added. From this example we derive the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers so that the decimal points
shall stand directly under each other.
II. Add as in whole numbers, and place the decimal point,

DECIMALS.
SUBTRACTION.
Analysis. In each of these
three examples, we write the
subtrahend under the minu-
end, placing units under
units, tenths under tenths,
&c. Commencing at the
right hand, we subtract as
in whole numbers, and in
the remainders we place the
decimal points directly under
those in the numbers above.
In the second example, the
number of decimal places in
the minuend is greater than
the number in the subtra-
hend, and in the third exam-
ple the number is less. In
both cases, we reduce both
minuend and subtrahend to
the same number of decimal
places, by annexing ciphers;
or we suppose the ciphers to
be annexed, before performing the subtraction. Hence the
Rule. I. Write the numbers so that the decimal points
shall stand directly under each other.
II. Subtract as in whole numbers, and place the decimal
point in the result directly under the points in the given numbers.

\ MULTIPLICATION.
154. 1. What is the product of .35 multiplied by .5?
operation. Analysis. We perform the multiplication the
.35 same as in whole numbers, and the only difficulty
jj we meet with is in pointing off the decimal places
in the product. To determine how many places to
.170, Ans. point off, we may reduce the decimals-to common
fractions; thus, .35 = ^ and "5 = ^. Perform-
ing the multiplication, and we have ffo X -fa = iV^y ana tms
product, expressed decimally, is .175. Here we see that the prod-
uct contains as many decimal places as are contained in both mul-
tiplicand and multiplier. Hence the following
Rule. Multiply as in whole numbers, and from the right
hand of the product point off as many figures for decimals as
there are decimal places in both factors.
Notes. 1. If there be not as many figures in the product as there
are decimals in both factors, supply the deficiency by prefixing ciphers-
2. To multiply a decimal by 10, 100, 1000, &c, remove the point as
many places to the right as there are ciphers on the right of the multi-

Ans. 22.7046 bushels.
\ DIVISION.
lS5o 1. What is the quotient of .175 divided by .5?
operation. Analysis. We perform the division the same as
.5 ) .175 m whole numbers, and the only difficulty we meet
with is in pointing off the decimal places in the quo-
Ans. coo tient. To determine how many places to point off,
we may reduce the decimals to common fractions; thus, .175 =
-fflfc, and .5 = ^-. Performing the division, and we have
175 5 tt$ 10 35
X
1000 10 1000 $ 100
and this quotient, expressed decimally, is .35. Here we see that the
dividend contains as many decimal places as are contained in both
divisor and quotient . Hence the following
Rule. Divide as in whole numbers, and from the right
hand of the quotient point off as many places for decimals
as ihe decimal places in the dividend exceed those in tha
divisor.
Explain division of decimals. Give rule.
NOTES. 1. If the number of figures in the quotient be less than the
excess of the decimal places in the dividend over those in the divisor,
the deficiency must be supplied by prefixing ciphers.
2. If there be a remainder after dividing the dividend, amlix ciphers,
and continue the division: the ciphers annexed are decimals of the
dividend.
3. The dividend must always contain at least as many decimal places
as the divisor, before commencing the division.
4. In most business transactions, the division is considered suffi-
ciently exact when the quotient is carried to 4 decimal places, unless
great accuracy is required.
0. To divide by 10, 100, 1000, &c., remove the decimal point as
many places to the left as there are ciphers on the right hand of the
divisor.

DECIMAL CURRENCY.
Coin is money stamped, and has a given value es-
tablished by law.
-^ 157. Currency is coin, bunk bills, treasury notes, &c., in
circulation as a medium of trade.
158. A Decimal Currency is a currency whose denom-
inations increase and decrease in a tenfold ratio.
NOTE. The currency of the United States is decimal currency, and
ia sometimes called Federal Money; it was adopted by Congress in 1786.
NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
BY THE " COINAGE ACT OP 1873"
The Coin of the United States consists of gold, silver,
nickel, and bronze.
The Gold Coins are the double-eagle, eagle, half-eagle,
quarter-eagle, three-dollar and one-dollar pieces.
The Silver Coins are the trade-dollar, half-dollar,
quarter-dollar, and the dime.
The Nickel Coins are the five-cent and three-cent pieces.
The Bronze Coins are the oue-cent pieces.
TABLE.
10 mills (?«.) make 1 cent, .... c.
10 cents "1 dime, d.
10 dimes "1 dollar, $.
10 dollars "1 eagle, E.
NOTES 1.—The- mill is a denomination used only in computa-
tions: it is uot a coin.
2. The trade-dollar is designed solely for commerce, and not for
currency. Its weight is 420 grains.
3 The character $ is supposed to be a contraction of U. 8.
(United States,) the U being placed upon the S.
What is coin? Currency? Decimal currency V Federal money?
What are the gold coins of U. S.? Silver? Copper? What are
the denominations of U. S. currency? What is the sign of dollars?
From what derived?
159. The gold dollar is the unit of United States
money; dimes, cents, and mills are fractions of a dollar, and
are separated from the dollar by the decimal point; thus,
two dollars one dime two cents five mills, are written $2.125.
By examining the table, we see that the dime is a tenth part
of the unit, or dollar; the cent a tenth part of the dime or a
hundredth part of the dollar; and the mill a tenth part of the
cent, a hundredth part of the dime, or a thousandth part of the
dollar. Hence the denominations of decimal currency increase
and decrease the same as decimal fractions, and are expressed
according to the same decimal system of notation; and they
may be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided in the same
manner as decimals.
Dimes are not read as dimes, but the two places of dimes
and cents are appropriated to cents; thus, 1 dollar 3 dimes
2 cents, or $1.32, are read one dollar thirty-two cents; hence,
When the number of cents is less than 10, we write a cipher
before it in the place of dimes.
NOTE. The half cent is frequently -written as 5 mills; thus, 24J cents,
written $.245.
160. Business men frequently write cents as common
fractions of a dollar; thus, three dollars thirteen cents are
written $3-j^, and read, three and thirteen hundredths dollars.
In business transactions, when the final result of a computation
contains 5 mills or more, they are called one cent, and when
less than 5, they are rejected.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Write four dollars five cents. Ans. $4.05.
2. Write two dollars nine cents.
3. Write ten dollars ten cents.
4. Write eight dollars seven mills. Ans. $8.007.
What is the unit of II. S. currency? What is the general law of
increase and decrease? In practice, how many decimal places are given
to cents? In business transactions, how are cents frequently written?
What is done if the mills exceed 5? If less than 5?
5. Write sixty-four cents. Am. $0.64.
6. Write three cents two mills.
7. Write one hundred dollars one cent one mill.
8. Read $7.93; $8.02; $6,542.
9. Read $5,272; $100,025; $17,005.
10. Read $16,205; $215,081; $1000.011; $4,002.
REDUCTION.
161* By examining the table of Decimal Currency, we set
that 10 mills make one cent, and 100 cents, or 1000 mills,

FIRST OPERATION.'
$5.24 ANALYSIS. If the price were $5.24 per
475 foot, the cost of 475 feet would be 475 X
$5.24 = $2489. But since $5.24 is the
2620 price of 100 feet, $2489 is 100 times the true
3668 value. Therefore, to obtain the true value,
2096 we divide $2489 by 100, which we may do
bv cutting off two figures from the right, and
100 ) $2489.00 the resuh is $24.89. Or,
Ans. $24.89
Give explanation. Rule. Case V is what? Give first explanation.
second operation. Analysis. Since 1 foot costs T^, or. 01,
$5.24 of $5-24, 475 feet will cost $£$, or 4.75 times
4 j5 $5.24, which is $24.89.
2620 Note. For the same reasons, when the price
ooca *3 Per thousand, we divide the product by 1000,
""™ or, which is more convenient in practice, we re-
2096 duce the given quantity to thousands and deci-
."' mals of a thousand, by pointing off three figures
$24.8900 from the right hand. Hence the
Rule. I. Reduce the given quantity to hundreds and deci-
mals of a hundred, or to thousands and decimals of a thousand.
II. Multiply the price by the quantity, and point off in the
result as in multiplication of decimals.
Note. The letter C is used to indicate hundreds, and Mto indicate
thousands.

REDUCTION.
"IT'S. A Compound Number is a concrete number whoso
value is expressed iu two or more different denominations.
176. Reduction is the process of changing a number from
»ne denomination to another without altering its value.
Reduction 13 of two kinds, Descending and Ascending.
\ B77. Reduction Descending is changing a number of one
denomination to another denomination of less unit value; thus,
$1 = 10 dimes =100 cents = 1000 mills.
178. Reduction Ascending is changing a number of one
denomination to another denomination of greater unit. value;
thus, 1000 mills = 100 cents = 10 dimes = $1.
179. A Scale is a scries of numbers, descending or as-
cending, used in operations upon compound numbers.

CANADA MONEY.
The currency of the Dominion of Canada is decimal, and
the table and denominations are the same as those of the
United States money.
NOTE The currency of the whole Dominion of Canada was made uniform
July 1, 1871. Before the adoption of the decimal system, pounds, shillings, and
pence were used.
The Si..ver Coins are the 50-cent piece, 25-cent piece, 10-cent piece,
and 5 cent piece. The 20-cent piece is no longer coined. The Bronze
Coin is the cent.
The Gold Coin used in Canada is the British sovereign, worth

183. To perform reduction ascending.
1. Reduce 21066 farthings to pounds.
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We first divide
4 1 2 1066 far tlie 21066 far. by 4, because
there are \ as many pence as
12)5266d.+ 2 far. farthings, and we find that
2;o ) 43|8 s. + 10 d. 21066 far. = 5266 d. + a re-
mainder of 2 far. We next
-,
divide 5266 d. by 12, because
Ans. 21 £ 18 s. 10 d. 2 far. there are ^ as many shmings
as pence, and we find that 5266 d. = 438 s. + 10 d. Lastly we
divide the 438 s. by 20, because there are -^ as many pounds as
shillings, and we find that 438 s. = 21 £ + 18 s. The last quotient
with the several remainders annexed in the order of the succeeding
denominations, gives the answer 21 £ 18s. 10 d. 2 far. Hence,
RULE. I. DIVIDE the given number by that number of the
scale which will reduce it to the next higher denomination.
II. Divide the quotient bi/ the next higher number in the
scale; and so proceed to the highest denomination required.
The last quotient, with the several remainders annexed in a
reversed order, will be the answer.
NOTE. Reduction descending and reduction ascending mutually
prove each other.

STANDARD OP WEIGHT.
188. In the year 1834 the U. S. government adopted a
uniform standard of weights and measures, for the use of the
custom houses, and the other branches of business connected with
the general government. Most of the States which have adopt-
ed any standards have taken those of the general government
180. The United States standard unit of weight is the
Troy pound of the mint, which is the same as the imperial
standard pound of Great Britain, and is determined as fol-
lows: A cubic inch of distilled water in a vacuum, weighed
by brass weights, also in a vacuum, at a temperature of 62°
Fahrenheit's thermometer, is equal to 252.458 grains, of which
the standard Troy pound contains' 5760.
190. The U. S. Avoirdupois pound is determined from
the standard Troy pound, and contains 7000 Troy grains.
Hence, the Troy pound is fyJ§# = -J4£ of an avoirdupois
pound. But the Troy ounce contains -6i££ = 480 grains, and
the avoirdupois ounce ^^ = 437.5 grains ; and an ounce Troy
is 480—437.5 = 42.5 grains greater than an ounce avoirdu-
pois. The pound, ounce, and grain, Apothecaries' weight,
are the same as the like denominations in Troy weight, the only
difference in the two tables being in the divisions of the ounce.
191. COMPARATIVE TABLE OF WEIGHTS.

NOTES. 1. For the purpose of measuring cloth and other goods sold
by the yard, the yard is divided into halves, fourths, eighths, and six-
teenths. The old table of cloth measure is practically obsolete.
2. The geographic mile is^ of 5Jy or -jitTff of the distance round
the center of the earth. It is a small fraction more than 1.16 statute
miles.
3. The length of a degree of latitude varies, being 68.72 miles at the
equator, 68.9 to 69.05 miles in middle latitudes, and 69.30 to 69.34 miles
in the polar regions. The mean or average length is as stated in the
table. A degree of longitude is greatest at the equator, where it is
69.16 miles, and it gradually decreases toward the poles, where it ia 0.

II. Square Measure.
\ 195. A Square is a figure having four equal sides, and
four equal angles or corners.
1 square foot is a figure having four
sides of 1 ft. or 12 in. each, as shown
in the diagram. Its contents are 12
X 12 = 144 square inches. Hence
The contents or area of a square, or
of any other figure having a uniform
length and a uniform breadth, is found
by multiplying the length by the breadth.
Thus, a square foot is 12 in. long and 12 in. wide, and the con-
tents are 12 X 12 = 144 square inches. A board 20 in. long
and 10 in. wide, is a rectangle, containing 20 X 10 = 200
square inches.
IDG. Square Measure is used in computing areas or sur-
faces; as of land, boards, painting, plastering, paving, &c.

Artificers estimate their work as follows:
By the square foot: glazing and stone-cutting.
By the square yard: painting, plastering, paving, ceiling, and
paper-hanging.
By the square of 100 feet: flooring, partitioning, roofing, slating,
and tiling.
Brick-laying is estimated by the thousand bricks; also by the
square yard, and the square of 100 feet.
Notes. 1. In estimating the painting of moldings, cornices, &c, the
measuring-line is carried into all the moldings and cornices.
2. In estimating brick-laying by the square yard or the square of
100 feet, the work is understood to be li bricks, or 12 inches, thick.

III. Cubic Measure.
I 108. A Cube is a solid, or body,
having six equal square sides, or
faces. If each side of a cube be 1
yard, or 3 feet, 1 foot in thickness
of this cube will contain 3X3X1
s= 9 cubic feet, and the whole cube will
contain 3 X 3 X 3 = 27 cubic feet.
A solid, or body, may have the
three dimensions all alike or all different. A body 4 ft. long,
3 ft. wide, and 2 ft. thick contains 4X3X2 = 24 cubic or
solid feet. Hence we see that
The cubic or solid contents of a body are found by multiply-
ing the length, breadth, and thickness together.
199. Cubic Measure, also called Solid Measure, is used
in estimating the contents of solids, or bodies; as timber, wood,
stone, &c.

regular scale, but are merely so many times 1 foot. The unit
equivalents, being fractional, are consequently omitted.
Notes. 1. A cubic yard of earth is called a load.
2. Railroad and transportation companies estimate light freight by
the space it occupies in cubic feet, and heavy freight by weight.
3. A pile of wood 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 4 feet high, contains
1 cord; and a cord foot is 1 foot in length of such a pile.
4. A perch of stone or of masonry is 164 feet long, 1.J feet wide, and
1 foot high.
Define a cube. How are the contents of a cube or rectangular
solid found? For what is cubic measure used? Repeat the table.
Give the scale. How is railroad freight estimated? What is under-
stood by a cord foot? By a perch of stone or masonry?
5. Joiners, bricklayers, and masons make no allowance for windows,
doors, &c. Bricklayers and masons, in estimating their work by
cubic measure, make no allowance for the corners of the walls of
houses, cellars, &c, but estimate their work by the girt, that is, the
entire length of the wall on the outside.
6. Engineers, in making estimates for excavations and embankments,
take the dimensions with a line or measure divided into feet and deci-
mals of a foot. The estimates are made in feet and decimals, and the
results are reduced to cubic yards.

i STANDARD OP EXTENSION.
202. The U. S. standard unit of measures of extension,
whether linear, superficial, or solid, is the yard of 3 feet, or 36
inches, and is the same as the imperial standard yard of
Great Britain. It is determined as follows: The rod of a
pendulum vibrating seconds of mean time, in the latitude of
London, in a vacuum, at the level of the sea, is divided into
391393 equal parts, and 360000 of these parts are 36 inches,
or 1 standard yard. Hence, such a pendulum rod is 39.1393
inches long, and the standard yard is ff$%$$ of the length of
the pendulum rod.
203. The V. S. standard unit of liquid measure is the old
English wine gallon, of 231 cubic inches, which is equal to
8.33888 pounds avoirdupois of distilled water at its maximum
density, that is, at the temperature of 39.83° Fahrenheit, the
barometer at 30 inches.

ish Winchester bushel, which is 18£ inches in diameter and 8
inches deep, and contains 2150.42 cubic inches, equal to
77.6274 pounds avoirdupois of distilled water, at its maximum
density. A gallon, dry measure, contains 268.8 cubic inches.

Circular Measure.
207. Circular Measure, or Circular Motion, is used prin-
cipally in surveying, navigation, astronomy, and geography,
for reckoning latitude and longitude, determining locations of
places and vessels, and computing difference of time.
Every circle, great or small, is divisible into the same num-
ber of equal parts, as. quarters, called quadrants, twelfths,
called signs, 360ths, called degrees, &c. Consequently the
parts of different circles, although having the same names, are
of different lengths.

numbers, and write the remainder, 6 gal., under the column of gal-
lons. Hence the following
Rule. I. ' Write the subtrahend under the minuend, so that
units of the same denomination shall stand under each other.
II. Beginning at the right hand, subtract each denomination
separately, as in simple numbers.
III. If the number of any denomination in the subtrahend
exceed that of the same denomination in the minuend, add to
the number in the minuend as many units as make one of the
next higher denomination, and then subtract; in this case add
1 to the next higher denomination of the subtrahend before
subtracting. Proceed in the same manner with each denomi-
nation.

If the days of the different months are not the same, the
number of days of difference should be added when the earlier
day belongs to the month from which we reckon, and subtracted
when it belongs to the month to which we find the time. If
the 29th of February is to be included in the time computed,
one day must be added to the result.

MULTIPLICATION.
222. 1. A farmer has 8 fields, each containing 4 A. 2 R.
27 P.; how much land in all?
operation. Analysis. In 8 fields are 8 times as much
a. u. p. land us in 1 field. We write the multiplier
4 2 27 under the lowest denomination of the mul-
8 tiplicand, and proceed thus; 8 times 27 P«
——. — are 216 P., equal to 5 R. 16 P.; and we
write the 16 P. under the number multiplied.
Then 8 times 2 R. are 16 R., and 5 R. added make 21 R., equal to
4 A. 1 R.; and we write the 1 R. under 'the number multiplied.
Again, 8 times 4 A are 32 A., and 4 A. added make 36 A., which we
write under the same denomination in the multiplicand, and the
work is done. Hence,

4)102 3 2 sor on the left of the dividend, we divide
9g261 ^^ ^u" ^ 4, and we obtain a quotient of
25 bu., and a remainder of 2 bu. We
write the 25 bu. under the denomination of bushels, and reduce the
2 bu. to pecks, making 8 pk., and the 3 pk. of the dividend added
makes 11 pk. Dividing 11 pk. by 4, we obtain a quotient of 2 pk.
and a remainder of 3 pk.; writing the 2 pk. under the order of
pecks, we next reduce 3 pk. to quarts, adding the 2 qt. of the
dividend, making 26 qt., which divided by 4 gives a quotient of 6 qt
.
and a remainder of 2 qt. Writing the 6 qt. under the order of
quarts, and reducing the remainder, 2 qt., to pints, we have 4 pt.,

quired.
NOTES. 1. When the divisor is large and is a composite number,
we may shorten the work by dividing by the factors.
2. When the divisor and dividend are both compound numbers, they
must both be reduced to the same denomination before dividing, and
then the process is the tame as in simple numbers.

334. Every circle is supposed to be divided into 360
equal parts, called degrees.
Since the sun appears to pass from east to west round the
earth, or through 360°, once in every 24 hours, it will pass

Rule. Multiply the difference of longitude in degrees and
minutes by 4, and the product will be the difference of time in
minutes and seconds, which may be reduced to hours.
Note. If one place be in east, and the other in west longitude, the
difference of longitude is found by adding them,- and if the sum be
greater than 180°, it must be subtracted from 360°.

(/ DUODECIMALS.
227. Duodecimals are the divisions and subdivisions of
a unit, resulting from continually dividing by 12, as 1, ^, T^f
ttVb, &c- In practice, duodecimals are applied to the meas-
urement of extension, the foot being taken as the unit.
If the foot be divided into 12 equal parts, the parts are
called inches, or primes; the inches divided by 12 give sec-
onds; the seconds divided by 12 give thirds; the thirds di-
vided by 12 give fourths; and so on.
From these divisions of a foot it follows that
V (inch or prime) is ^ of R foot,
1 (second) or ^ of A, « ^ of „ foot
1 (third) or ^ of tV of A, . . « ^ of a foot, &c.

Note. Duodecimals are really common fractions, and can always
be treated as such; but usually their denominators are not expressed,
and they are treated as compound numbers
Addition and Subtraction of Duodecimals.
228. We add and subtract duodecimals the same as other
compound numbers.

Multiplication op Duodecimals.
229. Length multiplied by breadth gives surface, and
surface multiplied by thickness gives solid contents (198).
1 How many square feet in a board 11 feet 8 inches long
and 2 feet 7 inches wide?
Analysis. We first multiply by the 7'.
7 twelfths times 8 twelfths equals 56 one
hundred forty-fourths, which equals 4
twelfths and 8 one hundred forty-fourths.
We write the 8 144ths — marked with two
indices — to the right, and add the 4 12ths
30 ft 1' 8" to tne nex*; product. 7' times 11 equals
77', which added to 4/ equals 81', equal to
6 feet and 9'. We write the 9' under the
inches, or 12ths, and the 6 under the feet, or units. 2 times 8'
equals 16', or 1 foot and 4'. We write the 4' under the &, and
add the 1 foot to the next product. 2 times 11 feet are 22 feet, and
1 foot added make 23 feet, which we write under the 6 feet. Add-

ing these partial products, and we have 30 ft. 1' and 8" for the
critire product.
It will be seen from the above that the number of indices to every
product of any two factors is equal to the sum of the indices of those
fectors i thus 7' X 8' = 56"; 4"X 5'" = 20"'". Hence the
Rule. I. Write the several terms of the multiplier under
the corresponding terms of the multiplicand.
XL Multiply each term of the multiplicand by each term of
the multiplier, beginning with the lowest term in each, and call
the product of any two denominations the denomination denoted
by the sum of their indices, carrying 1 for every 12.
III. Add the partial products, carrying 1 for every 12;
their sum will be the required answer.

2 2 3 the first quotient figure, we
consider how many times
3 ft. and something more is contained in nearly 21ft. (20 ft. 11');
we estimate it to be 5 times, and multiplying the divisor by this
quotient figure, we have 18 ft. !K, which, subtracted from 20 ft. 11',
leaves 2 ft. 2', to which we bring down 3", the last term of the divi-
dend. We next seek how many times the divisor is contained in
this remainder, and find by trial the quotient 7 } multiplying the
divisor by this figure, we obtain 2 ft. 2' 3", and there is no remain-

PERCENTAGE.
230. Per cent is a term derived from the Latin words per
centum, and signifies by the hundred, or hundredths, that is, a cer-
tain number of parts of each one hundred parts, of whatever de-
nomination. Thus, by 5 per cent, is meant 5 cents of every 100
cents, $5 of every $100, 5 bushels of every 100 bushels, &c.
Therefore, 5 per cent, equals 5 hundredths = .05 = Tg-5 = 2^y.
8 per cent, equals 8 hundredths = .08 = T§g- = g$.

cated by the per cent. »•-<* " V-.'"A A jn.tn
233. The Base of percentage is the number on which
the percentage is computed.
234. Since per cent, is any number of hundredths, it is
usually expressed in the form of a decimal; but it may be
expressed either as a decimal or a common fraction, as in. the

238. To find a number when the number, increased
by a certain per cent, of itself, is given.
1. A man's income this year is $525, which is 5 per cent,
move than it was last year; what was it last year?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Fiuce his income
$525 H- 1.05 = $500. this year is .05 more than it
was last year, this year's income must be 1.05 times the income of
last year; therefore divide this year.s income by 1.05 and it gives the
income of last year. Hence the
RULE. Divide the amount by 1 plus the rate expressed
decimally, and the quotient will be the base or number re-
quired. Or,
Take as many times 100 as the amount is times 1 plus the
rate per cent.
* The changes that have been wrought in financial and commercial operations
the past few years, require some new methods and applications in the subject of

CASE V.
239. To find a number when the number, diminished
by a certain per cent, of itself, is given.
1. A man lost 8 per cent, of his sheep and had 368 left;
how many had he at first?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since the man lost
368 -f- .92 = 400. 8 per cent. of his sheep, he has
92 per cent, left; hence 368 is .92 times his original flock. We
therefore divide 368 by .92 and obtain the required number of sheep.
Hence the
RULE. Divide the given number by 1 minus the rate ex-
pressed decimally, and the quotient will be the base or number
required. Or,
Take as mini/ time...' 100 as the given number is times 1
minus tne rate.

CASE I.
343. To find the commission or brokerage on any
sum of money.
1. A commission merchant sells butter and cheese to tho
amount of $1540; what is his commission at 5 per cent.?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS.
1540 X -05 = $77, Ans. Since the com-
Or, T^ = Jj , and ^ X 1540 r= $77. mission on $l is
5 cents or .05 or
a dollar, on $1540 it is $1540 X .05 = $77. Or, since 5 per cent
is T^=^j. of the sum received, the commission is -fa of $1540
= $77. Hence the
RULE. Multiply the given sum by the rate per cent, ex-
pressed decimally, and the result will be the commission or bro-
kerage. Or,
Take such a part of the given sum as the number expressing
the per cent, is part of 100.

CASE II.
214. To find the commission or brokerage, -when
it is to be deducted from the given sum, and the bal-
ance invested.
1. A merchant sends his agent $1260 with which to buy
merchandise, after deducting his commission of 5 per cent.;
what is the sum invested, and how much is the commission?
OPERATION.
$1260-4- 1-05 = $1200, invested.
$1260 — $1200= $60, commission.
Or, iSS + -rSff = U; $1260 -H |J = $1200, invested.
And $1260 — $1200 = $60, commission.
Case II is what? Give explanation. Rule.
ANALYSIS. Since the commission is 5 per cent., the agent must
receive $1.05 for every $1 he expends; he can invest as many
dollars as $1.05 is contained times in $1260, which is $1200; and
the difference between the given sum and the sum invested is his
commission.
Or, the money expended is ^$f of itself, the commission is T$-j- of
this sum, and the commission added to the sum expended is {$f of
the whole sum. Since $1260 is }ff = |^,$1260 -^ |J = $1200,
the sum expended; and $1260 — $1200=$60 the commission.
Hence the
RULE. I. Divide the given amount liy 1 increased by the rate
per cent, of commission, and the quotient is the sum invested.
II. Subtract the investment from the given amount, and the
remainder is the commission.

STOCK INVESTMENTS.
363. The net earnings of a corporation are usually divid-
ed among the stockholders, in semi-annual dividends. The
income of capital stock is therefore fluctuating, being depend-

being a certain rate per cent., annually, of the par value, or
f;ice of the bonds.
Case II is what? Give explanation. Explain difference between
income of capital stock, and of bonds.
364. Federal or United States Securities are of two
kinds; viz., Bonds and Notes.
Bonds are of two kinds.
First, Those which are payable at a fixed date, and are
known and quoted in commercial transactions by the rate of
interest they bear, thus: U. S. 6's, that is, United States
Bonds bearing 6 $ interest. *
Second, Those which are payable at a fixed date, but which
may be paid at an earlier specified time, as the Government
may elect. These are known and quoted in commercial transac-
tions by a combination of the two dates, thus: U. S. 5-20's;
or a combination of the rate of interest and the two dates,
thus: U. S. 6's 5-20; that is, bonds bearing 6 % interest,
-which are payable in twenty years, but may be paid in five
years, if the Government so elect.
When it is necessary, in any transaction, to distinguish from
each other different issues which bear the same rate of interest,
this is done by adding the year in which they become due,
thus: U. S. 6's of '71; U. S. 5's of '74; U. S. 6's 5-20 of
'84; U. S. 6's 5-20 of '85.
Notes are of two kinds.
First. Those payable on demand, without interest, known
as United States Legal-tender Notes, or, in common language,
"Greenbacks."
Second, Notes payable at a specified time, with interest,
known as Treasury Notes. ' Of these there are two kinds,—,
6 f Compound-interest Notes, and Notes bearing 7T35 % in-
terest, the latter known and quoted in commercial transac-
tions as 7.30's.
The nomenclature here explained is that used in com-
* The character SS generally employed In business transactions signifies per
cent,; thus 6 % signifies 6 per cent.
What are United States Securities composed of? Explain the
different kinds of bonds. Of Notes. In what is the interest on
each payable?
X
mercial transactions, which involve similar Securities of States
or Corporations.
The interest on all bonds is payable in gold.
The interest on notes is payable in Legal-tender Notes.
When Bonds or Stocks are sold, a revenue stamp must be
used equal in value to one cent on each $100, or fraction of
$100, of their currency value. If sold by a broker, this is
charged to the person for whom they are sold.

operation. Analysis.—
$600 -=- .05 = $12000, stock required. Since $1 of the
$12000 x .80 — $9600, cost or investment. stock will obtain
$.05 income, to
obtain $600 will require $600 -*- .05 = $12000 (Case 1). Multiply.
Ing the par value of the stock by the market price of $1, we have
$12000 X .80 = $9000, the cost of the required stock, or the sum to
be invested. Hence the
Kule. I. Divide the given income by the per cent, which the
stock pays; the quotient will be the par value of the stock re-

GOLD INVESTMENTS.
Currency is a terra used in commercial language,
First, To denote the aggregate of Specie and Bills of Ex-
change, .Bank Bills, Treasury Notes, and other substitutes for
money employed in buying, selling, and carrying on exchange
of commodities between various nations. Second, To denote
whatever circulating medium is used in any country as a sub-
stitute for the government standard. In this latter sense, the
paper circulating medium, when below par, is called Currency,
to distinguish it from gold and silver. If, from any cause, the
paper medium depreciates in value, as it has done in the
United States, gold becomes an object of investment, the same
as stocks. In commercial language, gold is represented as
rising and falling; but gold being the standard of value, it
can not vary. The variation is in the medium of circulation
substituted for gold; hence, when gold is said to be at a
premium, the currency, or circulating medium, is made the
standard, while it is virtually below par.
CASE I.
JS7O. To change gold into currency.
1. How much currency can be bought for $150 in gold
when gold is at 170 %1
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since a dollar of gold
$1.70 x 150 = $255. is worth $1.70 in currency, there can
be as many times $1.70 of currency
bought as there are dollars of gold. Therefore, $1.70 X 150 = $255
is the amount of currency which can be purchased for $150 in gold.
RULE. Multiply the value of one dollar of gold in currency
by the number of dollars of gold.
2. What is the value in current funds of $250 gold, when
gold is 14? %1 Ans. $367.50.

PROFIT AND LOSS,
272. Profit and Loss are commercial terms, used to ex-
press the gain or loss in business transactions, which is usually
reckoned at a certaiu oer cent, on the prime or first cost of
articles.
CASE I.
273. To find the amount of profit or loss, when the
cost and the gain or loss per cent. are given.
1. A man bought a horse for $135, and afterward sold him

CASE II.
274. To find the gain or loss per cent., when the
cost and selling price are given.
1. Bought wool at 32 cents a pound, and sold it for 40 cents
a pound; what per cent, was gained?
Case n is whatf Give explanation. Rule.
OPERATION.
40 _ 32 = 8 ; 8 -T- 32 = & = .25, Arts.
Or, 40 — 32 = 8; 8 -^ 32 = & = £; £ X 100 = 25 £
Analysis. Since the gain on 32 cents is 40 — 32 = 8 cents, the
whole gain is -fa = \ of the purchase money; and -J- reduced to a
decimal is 25 hundredths, equal to 25 per cent. Or, if the gain were
equal to the purchase money, it would be 100 per cent.; but since
the gain is -fa = £ of the purchase money, it will be \ of 100 per
cent, equal to 25 per cent. Hence the following
Rule. Make the difference between the purchase and selling
prices the numerator, and the purchase price the denominator;
reduce to a decimal, and the result will be the per cent. Or,
Take such a part of 100 as the gain or loss is part of the
purchase price.

the gain or loss per cent, are given.
1. A merchant sold cloth for $4.80 a yard, and by so doing
made 33^ per cent.; how much did it cost?
OPERATION. .
1 + .331 - 1.33A,; $4.80 -f-1.38£ = $3.60, Am.
Or, $4.80 = $ of the cost; $4.80 -=- j = $3.60.
Case IV is what?
Analysis. Since the gain is 33J per cent. of the cost, $1 of the
cost, increased by 33£ per cent., will be what $1 of cost sold for:
therefore there will be as many dollars of cost, as 1.33J is con-
tained times in $4.80, or $3.60. Or, since he gained 33J per cent.
= | of the cost, $4.80 is f of the cost; $4.80 -f- £ = $3.60.
Note. If the rate per cent. be loss, we subtract it from 1, instead
of adding it. Hence the following
Role. Divide the selling price by 1 increased by the gain
or diminished by the loss per cent., expressed decimally, or in
the form of a common fraction, and the quotient will be the
cost.

INSURANCE.
277. Insurance on property is security guaranteed by
one party to another, for a stipulated sum, against the loss of
that property by fire, navigation, or any other casualty.
278. The Insurer or Underwriter is the party taking the
risk.
279. The Insured is the party protected.

parties.
281. The Premium is the sum paid by the insured to the
insurer, and is estimated at a certain rate per cent, of the
amount insured, which rate varies according to the degree of
hazard, or class of risk.
NOTE. As a security against fraud, most insurance companies take
risks at not more than two thirds the full value of the property
insured.

TAXES.
2S8JS. A Tax is a sum of money assessed on the person
or property of an individual, for public purposes.
284. When a tax is assessed on property, it is apportioned
at a certain per cent, on the estimated value.
When assessed on the person, it is apportioned equally
among the male citizens liable to assessment, and is called a
poll lax. Each person so assessed is called a poll.
What is a tax r How is a tax on property apportioned? On the
person, how i
985. Property is of two kinds — real estate, and personal
property.
386. Eeal Estate consists of immovable property, such
as lands, houses, &c.
287. Personal Property consists of movable property,
such as money, notes, furniture, cattle, tools, &c.
288. An Inventory is a written list of articles of proper-
ty, with their value.
28O. Before taxes are assessed, a complete inventory of all
the taxable property upon which the tax is to be levied must
be made. If the assessment include a poll tax, then a complete
list of taxable polls must also be made out.
I. A lax of $3165 is to be assessed on a certain town;
the valuation of the taxable property, as shown by the as-
sessment roll, is $600,000, and there are 220 polls to be as-
sessed 75 cents each; what will be the tax on a dollar, and
how much will be A's tax, whose property is valued at $3750,
and who pays for 3 polls?
OPERATION.
$.75 X 220 = $165, amount assessed on the polls.
$3165 — $165 = $3000, amount to be assessed on the property.
$3000 -f- $600,000 = .005, tax on $1.
$3750 X -005 = $18.75, A's tax on property.
$.75 X 3 = $2.25, A's tax on 3 polls.
$18.75 -j- $2.25 =. $21, amount of A's tax.
Hence the following
RULE. I. Find the amount of poll tax, if any, and subtract
this sum from the whole amount of tax to be assessed.
II. Divide the sum to be raised on property, by tJie whole
amount of taxable property, and the quotient will be the per
cent., or the tax on one dollar.
III. Multiply each man's taxable property by the per cent.,
or the tax ore $1, and to the product add his poll tax, if any;
the result will be the whole amount of his tax.
What is real estate? Personal property? An inventory? Explain
the process of levying a state or other tax. IluU.
PERCENTAGE.
Note. Having found the tax on $1, or the per cent., which in the
preceding example we find to be 5 mills, or A per cent., the operation
of assessing taxes may be greatly facilitated by rinding the tax on $2,
$3, &c, to $10, and then on $20, $30, &c, to $100, and arranging
the numbers as in the following

CUSTOM HOUSE BUSINESS.
29O, Duties, or Customs, are taxes levied on imported
goods, for the support of government and the protection of home
industry.
391. A Custom House is an office established by govern-
ment for the transaction of business relating to duties.
292. A Port of Entry is a seaport town having a cus-
tom house.
Define duties. A custom bouse.
393. Tonnage is a tax levied upon a vessel, independent
of its cargo, for the privilege of coming into a port of entry.
294. Revenue is the income to government from dutief
and tonnage.
Duties are of two kinds — ad valorem and specific.
295* Ad Valorem Duty is a sum computed on the cost
of goods in the country from which they were imported.
296. Specific Duty is a sum computed on the weight or
measure of goods, without regard to their cost.
297. An Invoice is a bill of goods imported, showing
the quantity and price of each kind.
298. By the New Tariff Act, approved March 2, 1857,
all duties taken at the U. S. custom houses, are ad valorem.
In collecting customs, it is the design of government to tax
only so much of the merchandise as will be available to the
importer in the market. The goods are weighed, measured,
gauged, or imported, in order to ascertain the actual quantity
and value received in port; and an allowance is made in every
case of waste, loss, or damage.
299. Tare is an allowance of the weight of the package
or covering that contains the goods. It is ascertained by
actually weighing one or more of the empty boxes, casks, or
coverings. In common articles of importation, it is sometimes
computed at a certain per cent, previously ascertained by
frequent trials.
300. Leakage is an allowance on liquors imported in
casks or barrels.
301. Breakage is an allowance en liquors imported in
bottles.
NOTE. Actual leakage or breakage is allowed, there being no fixed
or legal rate.
302. Gross Weight or Value is the weight or value of
the goods before any allowance has been made.
303. Net Weight or Value is the weight or value after
all allowances have been deducted.
Define Tonnage. Revenue. Ad valorem duty. Specific duty. An
invoice. Tare. Leakage. Breakage. Gross weight or vnlue. Net

C. CASE I.
311. To find the interest on any sum, at any rate
per cent., for years and mouths.
In percentage, any per cent, of any given number is so
many hundredths of that number; but in interest, any rate per
cent, is confined to 1 year, and the per cent, to be obtained
of any given number is greater than the rate per cent, per
annum if the time be more than 1 year, and less than the rate
per cent, per annum if the time be less than 1 year. Thus,
the interest on any sum, at any rate per cent., for 3 years 6
months, is 3£ times the interest on the same sum for 1 year;
and the interest for 3 months is £ of the interest for 1 year.

CASE II.
313. To lind the interest on any sum, for any
time, at any rate per cent.
The analysis of our rule is based upon the following
Obvious Relations between Time and Interest.
I. The interest on any sum, for 1 year, at 1 per cent., is
.01 of that sum, and is equal to the principal with the separatrix
removed two places to the left.
II. A month being TV of a year, -rV of the interest on any
sum for 1 year is the interest for 1 month.
AVhat is Case II? Give the first relation between time and interest.
Second.
III. The interest on any sum for 3 days is fo = ^g = .1
of the interest for 1 month, and any number of days may
readily be reduced to tenths of a month by dividing by 3.
IV. The interest on any sum, for 1 month, multiplied by
any given time expressed in months and tenths of a month,
will produce the required interest.
1. What is the interest on $724.68 for 2 yr. 5 mo. 19 da.,

(IV.). And multiplying this product by 7 (7 times '1 per cent.),
we have $125.268 -4-, the interest on the given principal, for the

RULE. I. Remove the separatrix in the given principal
two places to the left; the result will be the interest for 1 year,

II. Divide this interest by 12; the result will be the interest
for 1 month, at 1 per cent.
III. Multiply this interest by the given time expressed in
months and tenths of a month; the result will be the interest
for the given time, at 1 per cent.
IV. Multiply this interest by the given rale; the product
will be the interest. required.
Give the third. Fourth. Give analysis. Rule.
CONTRACTIONS. After removing the separatrix in the principal
two places to the left, the result may be regarded either as the in-
terest on the given principal for 12 months at 1 per cent., or for 1
month at 12 per cent. If we regard it as for 1 month at 12 per
cent., and if the given rate be an aliquot part of 12 per cent., the
interest on the given principal for 1 month may readily be found by
taking such an aliquot part of the interest for 1 month as the given
rate is part of 12 per cent. Thus,
To find the interest for 1 month at 6 per cent., remove the sep-
aratrix two places to the left, and divide by 2.
To find it at 3 per cent., proceed as before, and divide by 4; at 4
per cent., divide by 3; at 2 per cent., divide by 6, &c.
\ SIX PER CENT. METHOD.
313. By referring to 3O9 it will be seen that the legal
rate of interest in 21 States is 6 per cent. This is a sufficient
reason for introducing the following brief method into this work:
ANALYSIS. At C per cent per annum the interest on $1
For 12 months is $.06.
"2 months (T*5=i of 12 mo.) ".01.
"lmonth,or30days(,Lof 12 mo.)" .00}=$.005 (^of $.06).
"6 days ('- of 30 days) ".001.
"1 " (Jof 6da.=3\yof30days)" .000'.
Hence we conclude that,
1st. The interest on $1 is $.005 per month, or $.01 for every
2 months;
2d. The interest on $1 is $.000i per day, or $.001 for every
6 days.
From these principles we deduce the
KULE. I. To find the rate:— Call every year $.06, every
2 months $.01, every 6 days $.001, and any less number of days
sixths of 1 mill.
II. To find the interest:—Multiply the principal by the rate.
NOTES.—1. To find the interest at any other rate per cent. by this
me^uod, first find it at 6 per cent., and then increase or diminish the
result by as many times itself as the given rate is greater or less than 6
per cent. Thus, for 1 per cent, add £, for 4 per cent, subtract J, &c»
What contractions are given? G ive analysis of the 6 per cent, method.
Rule. Its application to any other rate per cent.
2. The interest of $10 for 6 days, or of $1 for GO days, is $.01.
Therefore, if the principal be 'ess than $10 and the time less than 6
days, or the principal less than $1 and the time less than 60 days, the
interest will be less than $.01, and may be disregarded.
3. Since the interest of $1 for 00 days is $.01, the interest of $1 for
any number of clays is as many cents as 60 is contained times in the
number of days. Therefore, if any principal be multiplied by the num-
ber of days in any given number of months and days, and the product
divided by 60, the result will be the interest in cents. That is, Multi-
ply the principal by the number of days, divide the product by 60, and point
off two decimal places in the quotient. The result will be the interest in the
tame denomination as the principal

ficient to illustrate the following
UNITED STATES RULE.
I. Find the amount of the given principal to the time of the
first payment, and if this payment exceed the interest then due
subtract it from the amount obtained, and treat the remainder
as a new principal.
II. But if the interest be greater than any payment, cast the
interest on the same principal to a time when the sum of the
payments shall equal or exceed the interest due; subtracting the
sum of the payments from the amount of the principal, the re-
mainder will form a new principal, on which interest is to be
computed as before.

interest, the rate per
cent. at which the same
principal, in the same
time, will gain $67.50,
must be equal to the number of times $13.50 is contained in $67.50;
dividing, we obtain 5, the required rate per cent. Hence the
Rule. Divide the given interest by the interest on the prin-
cipal for the given time at 1 per cent., and the quotient will be
the rate per cent. required.

interest, when the interest is not paid when due.
NOTE. The simple interest may be added to the principal annually,
semi-annually, or quarterly, as the parties may agree; but the taking
of compound interest is not legal.

BANKING.
337. A Bank is a corporation chartered by law for the
purpose of receiving and loaning money, and furnishing a
paper circulation.
What is a bank?
'828. A Promissory Note is a written or printed engage-
ment to pay a certain sum, either on demand or at a specified
time.
829. Bank Notes, or Bank Bills, are the notes made
and issued by banks to circulate as money. They are payable
in specie at the banks.
330. The Face of a note is the sum made payable by
the note.
331. Days of Grace are the three days usually allowed
by law for the payment of a note alter the expiration of the
time specified in the note.
832. The Maturity of a note is the expiration of the
days of grace; a note is due at maturity.
333. Notes may contain a promise of interest, which will
be reckoned from the date of the note, unless some other time
be specified.
The transaction of borrowing money at banks is conducted
in accordance with the following custom: the borrower pre-
sents a note, either made or indorsed by himself, payable at
a specified time, and receives for it a sum equal to the face,
less the interest..for the time the note has to run. The amount
thus withheld by the bank is in consideration of advancing
money on the note prior to its maturity.
334. Bank Discount is an allowance made to a bank for
the payment of a note before it becomes due.
A 335. The Proceeds of a note is the sum received for it
when discounted, and is equal to the face of the note less the
discount.

EXCHANGE.
IIIJ8. Exchange is a method of remitting money from one
place to another, or of making payments by written orders.
339. A Bill of Exchange is a written request or order
upon one person to pay a certain sum to another person, or to
his order, at a specified time.
34 O. A Sight Draft or Bill is one requiring paymen' to
be made "at sight," which means, at the time of its presenta-
tion to the person ordered to pay. In other bills, the time
specified is usually a certain number of days "after sight."
There are always three parties, and usually four, to a trans-
action in exchange:
341. The Drawer or Maker is the person who signs the
order or bill.
Give the rule. Define exchange. A bill of exchange. A sight draft. •
Ihe drawer, t
34S. The Drawee is the person to whom the order is
addressed.
343. The Payee is the person to whom the money is or-
dered to be paid.
344. The Buyer or Remitter is the person who purchases
the bill. He may be himself the payee, or the bill may be
drawn in favor of any other person.
345. The Indorsement of a bill is the writing upon its
back, by which the payee relinquishes his title, and transfers
the payment to another. The payee may indorse in blank by
writing his name only, which makes the bill payable to the
bearer, and consequently transferable like a bank note; or he
may accompany his signature by a special order to pay to
another person, who in his turn may transfer the title in like
manner. Indorsers become separately responsible for the
amount of the bill, in case the drawee fails to make payment.
A bill made payable to the bearer is transferable without in-
dorsement.
346. The Acceptance of a bill is the promise which the
drawee makes when the bill is presented to him to pay it at
maturity; this obligation is usually acknowledged by writing
the word "Accepted," with his signature, across the face of
the bill.
NOTE. Three days of grace are usually allowed for the payment of
a bill of exchange after the time specified has expired. But in New
York State no grace is allowed on sight drafts.
From these definitions, the use of a bill of exchange in mon-
etary transactions is readily perceived. If a man wishes to
make a remittance to a creditor, agent, or any other person
residing at a distance, instead of transporting specie, which is
attended with expense and risk, or sending bank notes, which
are liable to be uncurrent at a distance from the banks that
issued them, he remits a bill of exchange, purchased at a bank
or elsewhere, and made payable to the proper person in or

acceptance. What of grace on bills of exchange?
near the place where he resides. Thus a man by paying
Boston funds in Boston, may put New York funds into the
hands of his New York agent.
IE 17. The Course of Exchange is the variation of the
cost of sight bills from their par value, as affected by the rela-
tive conditions of trade and commercial credit at the two places
between which exchange is made. It may be either at & pre-
mium or discount, and is rated at a certain per cent, on th.e
face of the bill. Bills payable a specified time after sight are
subject to discount, like notes of hand, for the term of credit
given. Hence their value in the money market is affected by
both the course of exchange and the discount for time.
IM8. Foreign Exchange relates to remittances made be-
tween different countries.
349. Domestic or Inland Exchange relates to remit-
tances made between different places in the same country.
An inland bill of exchange is commonly called a Draft.
In this work we shall treat only of Inland Exchange.

Then, multiplying $480 by 1.0245, we obtain $491.76, the Ans.
From these examples we derive the following
Rule. I. For sight drafts. — Multiply the face of the draft
by 1 plus the rate when exchange is at a premium, and by
1 minus the rate when exchange is at a discount.
II. For drafts payable after sight. — Find the proceeds of $1
at bank discount for the specified time, at the legal rate where
the draft is purchased; then add the rate of exchange when
at a premium, or subtract it when at a discount, and multiply
the face of the draft by this result.

delphia, is accepted, and paid after the expiration of the three
days of grace. If the manufacturer immediately puts this
money at interest at the legal rate, will he gain or lose by the
blunder of his agent? Ans. He will lose $8.24-)-.
EQUATION OF.PAYMENTS.

mean or equitable time of payment of several sums, due at
different times without interest.

.same date.
1. On the first day of January I find that I owe Mr. Smith-
8 dollars, to be paid in 5 months, 10 dollars to be paid in 2
months, and 12 dollars to be paid in 10 months; at what time
may I pay the whole amount?
OPERATION.
$ 8 X 5 = 40
10 X 2 = 20
12 X 10= 120
SO 180 -=- 30 = 6 mo., average time of credit.
Jan. 1. -)- 6 mo. = July 1, equated time of payment.
ANALYSIS. The whole amount to be paid, as seen above, is $30:
and we are to find how long it shall be withheld, or what term of
credit it shall have, as an equivalent for the various termsof credit
on the different items. Now, the value of credit on any sum is meas-
ured by the product of the money and time. And we say, the credit
on $8 for 5 mo. = the credit on $40 for 1 mo., because 8 X 5 = 40
X !• In the same manner, we have, the credit on $10 for 2 mo.=
the credit on $20 for 1 mo.; and the credit on $12 for 10mo. =
the credit on $120 for 1 mo. Hence, by addition, the value of the
several terms of credit on their respective sums equals a credit of 1
month on $180; and this equals a credit of 6 months on $30, be-
cause
30 X 6=180 X I-
RULE. I. Multiply each payment by its term of credit, and
divide the sum of the products by the sum of the payments; the
quotient will be the average term of credit.
Average term of credit. Equated time. Give Case I. Analysis.
Eule.
II. Add the average term of credit to the date at which, all
the credits begin, and the result will be the equated time of
payment.
NOTES. 1. The periods of time used as multipliers must all be of
the same denomination, and the quotient will be of the same denomi-
nation as the terms of credit; if these be months, and there be a re-
mainder after the division, continue the division to days by reduction,
always taking the nearest unit in the last result.
2. The several rules in equation of payments are based upon the
principle of bank discount; for they imply that the discount of a sum
paid before it is due equals the interest of the same, amount paid after
it is due.

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
359. The Items of an account may be sums due at the
date of the transaction, or on credit for a specified time.
An account may have both a debit and a credit side, the
former marked Dr., the latter Cr. Suppose A and B have
dealings in which there is an interchange of money or prop-
erty; A keeps the account, heading it with B's name; the Dr.
side of the account shows what B has received from A; the
Cr. side shows what he has parted with to A.
360. The Balance of account is the difference of the two
eides, and may be in favor of either party.
If, in the transactions, one party has received nothing from
the other, the balance is simply the whole amount, and the
account has but one side. Bills of purchase are of this class.
Note. Book accounts bear interest after the expiration of the term
of credit, and notes after they become due.
361. To Average an Account is to find the mean or
equitable time of payment of the balance.

Define items. Balance. To average an account. A focal date.
ANALYSIS. By reference to the example, it will be seen that the
items are due June 1, Oct. 12, and Aug. 16, as shown in the two
operations. In the first operation we use the earliest date, June 1,
as a focal date, and find the difference in days between this date and
each of the others, regard being had to the number of days in cal-
endar months. From June 1 to Oct. 12 is 133 da.; from June 1 to
Aug. 16 is 76 da. Hence the first item has no credit from June 1,
the second item has 133 days' credit from June 1, and the third
item has 76 days' credit from June 1, as appears in the column
marked da. After this we proceed precisely as in Case I, and find
the average credit,71 da., and the equated time.Aug. 11.
In the second operation, the latest date, Oct. 12, is taken for a
focal date; the work is explained thus: Suppose the account to be
settled Oct. 12. At that time the first item has been due 133 days;
and must therefore draw interest for this time. But interest on
$450 for 133 days = the interest on $59850 for 1 da. The second
item draws no interest, because it falls due Oct. 12. The third item
must draw interest 57 days. But interest on $250 for 57 days =
the interest on $14250 for 1 day. Taking the sum of the products,
we find the whole amount of interest due on the account, at Oct. 12,
equals the interest on $74100 for 1 day; and this, by division, is
found to be equal to the interest on $1200 for 62 days, which time
is the average term of interest. Hence the account would be settled
Oct. 12, by paying $1200 with interest on the same for 62 days. This
shows that 1200 has been due 62 days; that is, it falls due Aug. 11,
without interest. Hence the following

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
ANALYSIS. In the above operation we have written the dates,
showing when the items become due on either side of the ac-
count, adding 3 days' grace to the time allowed to the draft. The
latest date, Oct. 20, is assumed as the focal date for both sides, and
the two columns marked da. show the difference in days between
each date and the focal date. The products are obtained as in the
last case, and a balance is struck between the items charged and the
products. These balances, being on the Dr. side, show that David
Ware, on the day of the focal date, Oct. 20, owes $600 with interest
on $35450 for 1 day. By division, this interest is found to be equal
to the interest on $600 for 59 days. The balance, $600, therefore,
has been due 59 days. Reckoning back from Oct. 12, we find the
date when the balance fell due, Aug. 22. Hence the following
RULE. I. Find the time when each item of the account is
due; and write the dates, in two columns, on the sides of the
account to which they respectively belong.
II. Use either the earliest or the latest of these dates as the
focal date for both sides, and find the products as in the last
case.
III. Divide the balance of the products by the balance of the
account; the quotient will be the interval of time, which must
be reckoned from the focal date TOWARD the other dates when
both balances are on the same side of the account, but FROM
the other dates when the balances are on opposite sides of the
account.

is it due?

RATIO.
364. Eatio is the comparison with each other of two num-
bers of the same kind. It is of two kinds — arithmetical and
geometrical.
365. Arithmetical Eatio is the difference of the two
numbers.
366. Geometrical Eatio is the quotient of one number
divided by the other.
367. When we use the word ratio alone, it implies geo-
metrical ratio, and is expressed by the quotient arising from
dividing one number by the other. Thus, the ratio of 4 to 8
is 2, of 10 to 5 is £, &c.
368. Ratio is indicated in two ways.
1st. By placing two points between the numbers compared,
writing the divisor before and the dividend after the points.
Thus, the ratio of 5 to 7 is written 5:7; the ratio of 9 to
4 is written 9 : 4.
2d. In the form of a fraction; thus, the ratio of 9 to 3 is f;
the ratio of 4 to 6 is f.
369. The Terms are the two numbers compared.
370. The Antecedent is the first term.
371. The Consequent is the second term.
373. No comparison of two numbers can be fully ex-
plained but by instituting another comparison; thus, the com-
NOTE. It is thought best to omit the questions at the bottom of the passes, in the
remaining part of this work, leaving the teacher to use such as may be deemed ap-
propriate.
parison or relation of 4 to 8 cannot be fully expressed by 2,
nor of 8 to 4 by 4-. If the question were asked, what relation
4 bears to 8, or 8 to 4, in respect to magnitude, the answer 2,
or £, would not be complete nor correct. But if we make
unity the standard of comparison, and use it as one of the
terms In illustrating the relation of the two numbers, and
say that the ratio or relation of 4 to 8 is the same as 1 to 2,
or the ratio of 8 to 4 is the same as 1 to £, unity in both cases
being the standard of comparison, then the whole meaning is
conveyed.
373. A Direct Ratio arises from dividing the consequent
by the antecedent.
374. An Inverse or Reciprocal Ratio is obtained by di-
viding the antecedent by the consequent. Thus, the direct
ratio of 5 to 15 is -i^ = 3; and the inverse ratio of 5 to 15 is~
A = i-
375. A Simple Ratio consists of a single couplet; as
3:12.
376. A Compound Ratio is the product of two or more
simple ratios. Thus, the compound ratio formed from the
simple ratios of3:6and8:2is|X§ = 3X8:6X2 =
*! = *•
377. In comparing numbers with each other, they must
be of the same kind, and of the same denomination.
378. The ratio of two fractions is obtained by dividing
the second by the first; or by reducing them to a common de-
nominator, when they are to each other as their numerators.
Thus, the ratio of TV : f is f -7- -fa = •}% = 2, which is the
same as the ratio of the numerator 3 to the numerator 6 of
the equivalent fractions -^ and T6,r.
Since the antecedent is a divisor and the consequent a divi-
dend, any change in either or both terms will be governed by
the general principles of division, (87.) We have only to
substitute the terms antecedent, consequent, and ratio, for divi-
sor, dividend, and quotient, and these principles become
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RATIO.
PRIN. I. Multiplying the consequent multiplies the ratio;
dividing the consequent divides the ratio.
PRIN. II. Multiplying the antecedent divides the ratio; di-
viding the antecedent multiplies the ratio.
PKIN. III. Multiplying or dividing both antecedent and con-
sequent by the same number does not alter the ratio.
These three principles may be embraced in one
GENERAL LAW.
A change in the consequent produces a LIKE change in the
ratio; but a change in the antecedent produces an OPPOSITE
change in the ratio.
•$7O. Since the ratio of two numbers is equal to the con-
sequent divided by the antecedent, it follows, that
1. The antecedent is equal to the consequent divided by
the ratio; and that,
2. The consequent is equal to the antecedent multiplied by
the ratio.

PROPORTION.
380. Proportion is an equality of ratios. Thus, the ratios
6 : 4 and 12 : 8, each being equal to §, form a proportion.
381. Proportion is indicated in two ways.
1st. By a double colon placed between the two ratios i thus,
2 : 5 :: 4 : 10.
2d. By the sign of equality placed between the two ratios;
thus, 2 : 5 = 4 : 10.
383. Since each ratio consists of two terms, every pro-
portion must consist of at least four terms.
383. The Extremes are the first and fourth terms.
384. The Means are the second and third terms.
385. Three numbers may be in proportion when the first
is to the second as the second is to the third. Thus, the num-
bers 3, 9, and 27 are in proportion since 3 : 9 :: 9 : 27, the
ratio of each couplet being 3.
In such a proportion the second term is said to be a mean
proportional between the other two.
386. In every proportion the product of the extremes is
equal to the product of the means. Thus, in the proportion
3 : 5 :: 6 : 10 we have 3 X 10 = 5 X 6.
387. Four numbers tliat-are proportional in the direct
order are proportional by inversion, and also by alternation, or
by inverting the means. Thus, the proportion 2 : 3 :: 6 : 9,
by inversion becomes 8 : 2 :: 9 : G, and by alternation 2 : 6 : s
3:9.
J| $8 From the preceding principles and illustrations, it
follows that, any three terms of a proportion being given, the
fourth may readily be found by the following
Rule. I. Divide the product of the extremes by one of the
means, and the quotient will be the other mean. Or,
II. Divide the product of the means by one of the extremes,
and the quotient will be the other extreme.

SIMPLE PROPORTION.
389. Simple Proportion is an equality of two simple
ratios, and consists of four terms, any three of which being
given, the fourth may readily be found.
300. Every question in simple proportion involves the
principle of cause and effect.
301. Causes may be regarded as action, of whatever
kind, the producer, the consumer, men, animals, time, distance,
weight, goods bought or sold, money at interest, &c.
302* Effects may be regarded as whatever is accom-
plished by action of any kind, the thing produced or consumed,
money paid, &c.
3*13. Causes and effects are of two kinds — simple and
compound.
394. A Simple Cause, or Effect, contains but one element;
as goods purchased or sold, and the money paid or received
for them.
395. A Compound Cause, or Effect, is the product of two
or more elements; as men at work taken in connection with
time, and the result produced by them taken in connection
with dimensions, length and breadth, &c. -
39G. Causes and effects that admit of computation, that
is, involve the idea of quantity, may be represented by num-
bers, which will have the same relation to each other as the
things they represent. And since it is a principle of philoso-
phy that like causes produce like effects, and that effects are
always in proportion to their causes, we-have the following
proportions:
1st Cause : 2d Cause : : 1st Effect : 2d Effect.
Or, 1st Effect : 2d Effect :: 1st Cause : 2d Cause;
in which the two causes, or the two effects forming one coup-
let, must be like numbers, and of the same denomination.
Considering all the terms of the proportion as abstract num-
bers, we may say that
1st Cause : 1st Effect : : 2d Cause : 2d Effect,
•which will produce the same numerical result.
But as ratio is the result of comparing two numbers or
things of the same kind (377), the first form is regarded as
the most natural and philosophical.
397. Simple causes and simple effects give rise to simple
ratios; compound causes and compound effects to compound
ratios.

Since the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the
means (373), and the product of the means divided by one of the
extremes will give the other; (blank) dollars will be equal to the
product oT3 X 30 divided by 5, which is $18, Ans.
2. If 15 barrels of flour cost $90, how many barrels can be
bought for $30?
Analysis. In this ex-
ample a cause is required,
and the statement may be
read thus: If 15 barrels'
cost $90, how many or
(blank) barrels will cost
$30? The; roduct of the
extremes, 30 X 15, di-
vided by the given mean,
90, will give the required
term, 5, as shown in the operation. Hence we deduce the following
Rule. I. Arrange the terms in the statement so that the
causes shall compose one couplet. and the effects the other, put-
ting ( ) in the place of the required term. .
II. If the required term be an extreme, divide the product
of the means by the given extreme; if the required term be a
mean, divide the product of the extremes by the given mean.
Notes. 1. If the terms of any couplet be of different denominations,
they must be reduced to the same unit value.
2. If the odd term be a compound number, it must be reduced to its
lowest unit.
3. If the divisor and dividend contain one or more factors common
to both, they should be canceled. If any of the terms of a proportion
contain mixed numbers, they should first be changed to improper frac-
tions, or the fractional part to a decimal.
i. When the vertical line is used, the divisor and the required term
are written on the left, and the terms of the dividend on the right.
39O. We will now give another method of solving ques-
tions in simple proportion, without making the statement, and
which may be used, by those who prefer it, to the one already
given. We will term it the
SECOND METHOD.
Every question which properly belongs to simple propor-
tion must contain four numbers, at least three of which must
be given (38O). Of the three given numbers, one must
always be of the same denomination as the required number.
The remaining two will be like numbers, and bea.r.the same
relation to each other that the third does to the required num-
ber; in other words, the ratio of the third to the required
number will be the same as the ratio of the other two num-r
bers.
Regarding the third or odd term as the antecedent of the sec-
ond couplet of a proportion, we find the consequent or required
term by multiplying the antecedent by the ratio (37O).
By comparing the two like numbers, in any given question,
•with the third, we may readily determine whether the answer,
or required term, will be greater or less than the third term;
if greater, then the ratio will be greater than 1, and the two
like numbers may be arranged in the form of an improper
fraction as a multiplier; if the answer, or required term, is to
be less than the third'term, then the ratio will be less than 1,
and the two like numbers may be arranged in the form of a
proper fraction, as a multiplier.
1. If 4 cords of wood cost $12, what will 20 cords cost?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. It will
I^3 X 20 be readily seen in this
12 X ^, written — = $60. example,"that 4 cords
^ and 20 cords are the
like terms, and that
$12 is the third term, and of the same denomination as the answer
or required term.
If 4 cords cost $12, will 20 cords cost more, or less, than 4 cords?
evidently more: then the answer or required term will be greater
than the third term, and the ratio greater than 1. The ratio of 4
cords to 20 cords is ^, or 5; hence the ratio of $12 to the answer
must be 5, and the answer will be %£ or 5 times $12, which is $60.
2. If 12 yards of cloth cost $48, what will 4 yards cost?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. In this example we
48 X -fa — $16, Ans. see that 12 yards and 4 yards are
the like terms and $48 the third
term, and of the same denomination as the required answer.
If 12 yards cost $48, will 4 yards cost more or less than 12 yards?
less: then the ratio will be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper
fraction. The ratio of 12 yards to 4 yards is ^; hence the ratio of
$48 to the answer is fa, and the answer will be fa times $48, which
is $16. Hence the following
RULE. I. With the two given numbers, which are of the
same name or kind, form a ratio greater or less than 1, accord-
ing as the answer is to be greater or less than the third given
number.
II. Multiply the third number by this ratio, and the product
•will be the required number or answer.
NOTE. 1. Mixed numbers should first be reduced to improper frac-
tions, and the ratio of the fractions found according to (378 )•
2. Reductions and cancellation may be applied as in the first method.
The following examples may be solved by either of the
foregoing methods.

COMPOUND PROPORTION.
4OO. Compound Proportion embraces that class of ques-
tions in which the causes, or the effects, or both, are compound.
The required term may be a cause,.or a single element of a
cause; or it may be an effect, or a single element of an effect.

Analysis. In
0 X 02 tn's example the
= 80 ft., Ans. required term is
the length of the
ditch, and is an element of the
second effect. The question,
as stated, will read thus: if 7
men, in 12 days, dig a ditch 60
feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6
feet deep, 21 men, in 2$ days,
will dig a ditch how many, or
(blank) feet long, 3 feet wide,
and 8 feet deep?
Hence we have the following
Rule. I. Of the given terms, select those which constitute
the causes, and those which constitute the effects, and arrange
them in couplets, putting ( ) in place of the required term.

II. Then, if the blank term ( ) occur in either of the ex-
tremes, make the product of the means a dividend, and the
product of the extremes a divisor; but if the blank term occur
in either mean, make the product of the extremes a dividend,
and the product of the means a divisor.
NOTES. 1. The causes must be exactly alike in the number and kind
of their terms; the same is true of the effects.
2. The same preparation of the terms by reduction is to be observed
as in simple proportion.
1O1. We will now solve an example according to the
Second Method given in Simple Proportion.
1. If 18 men can build 42 rods of wall in 16 days, how
many men can build 28 rods in 8 days?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We see in
$$4 ^02 this example that all the
X&t X — X = 24.-men. terms appear in couplets,
4$ ^ except one, which is 18
men, and that is of the same kind as the required answer.
Since compound proportion is made up of two or more simple
proportions, if this third or odd term be multiplied by the compound
ratio, or by the simple ratio of each couplet successively, the prod-
uct will be the required term.
By comparing the terms of each couplet with the third term we
may readily determine whether the answer, or term sought, will be
greater or less than the third term; if greater, then the ratio will be
greater than 1, and the multiplier an improper fraction; if less, the
ratio will be less than 1, and the multiplier a.proper fraction.
First we will compare the terms composing the first couplet, 42
rods and 28 rods, with the third term, 18 men. If 42 rods require
18 men, how many men will 28 rods require? less men; hence the
ratio is less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction, £|; next,
if 16 days require 18 men, how many men will 8 days require?
more men; hence the ratio is greater than 1, and the multiplier an
improper fraction, *£. Regarding the third term as the antecedent
of a couplet, the consequent being the term sought, if we multiply
this third term by the simple ratios, or by their product, we shall
have the required term or answer, thus: 18 X ff X -^ = 24, as
shown in the operation.
2. 5 compositors, in 16 days, of 14 hours each, can compose
20 sheets of 24 pages in each sheet, 50 lines in a page, and
40 letters in a line; in how many days, of 7 hours each, will
10 compositors compose a volume to be printed in the same
letter, containing 40 sheets, 16 pages in a sheet, 6O lines in a
page, and 50 letters in a line? Ans. 32 days.

BY CANCELLATION. ANALYSIS. The required term or an-
16 swer is to be in days; and we see that
«j all the terms appear in pairs or couplets,
r. except the 16 days, which is of the same
* kind as the answer sought.'
^0 We will proceed to compare the terms
^02 of each couplet with the 16 days. First,
rf*j if 5 compositors require 16 days, how
^ many days will 10 compositors require?
ft" less days; hence the multiplier is the
32 days, Ans. proper fraction ^, and we have 16 X &•
Next, if 14 hours a day require 16 days,
how many days will 7 hours a day require? more days; hence the
multiplier is the improper fraction ty, and we have 16 X fy X ty-
Next, if 20 sheets require 16 days, how many days will 40 sheets
require? more days; hence the multiplier is the improper fraction
$%, and we have 16 X (5j X V X f J- Pursuing the same method
with the other couplets, we obtain the result as shown in the opera-
tion. Hence we have the following
RULE. I. Of the terms composing each couplet form a
ratio greater or less than 1, in the same manner as if the
answer depended on those two and the third or odd term.
II. Multiply the third or odd term by these ratios successively,
and the product will be the answer'sought.
NOTE. By the odd term is meant the one that is of the same kind
as the answer.
The following examples may be solved by either of the
given methods.

PARTNERSHIP.
402. Partnership is a relation established between two
or more persons in trade, by which they agree to share the
profits and losses of business.
403. The Partners are the individuals thus associated.
404. Capital, or Stock, is the money or property invested
i:i trade.
4 05. A Dividend is the profit to be divided.
400. An Assessment is a tax to meet losses sustained.
CASE I.
407. To find each partner's share of the profit or
loss, when their capital is employed for equal periods of
time.
1. A and B engage in trade; A furnishes $300, and B
$400 of the capital; they gain $182; what is each one's
share of the profit?

$182 X f = $104, B'. each man's share of
the profit or loss will have the same ratio to the whole profit or
loss that his share of the stock has to the whole stock, A will have
i of the entire profit, and B ^, as shown in the operation.
We may also regard the whole capital as the first cause,
find each man's share of the capital as the second cause, the
whole profit or loss as theirs* effect, and each man's share of the
profit or loss as the second effect, and solve by proportion thus:

CASE II.
408. To find each partner's share of the profit or
loss when their capital is employed for unequal periods
of time.
It is evident that the respective shares of profit and loss will
depend upon two conditions, viz.: the amount of capital in-
vested by each, and the time it is employed.
1. Two persons -form a partnership; A puts in $450 for
7 months, and B $300 for 9 months; they lose $156; how.
much is each man's share of the loss?

If the loss, $156, be divided between the two partners, according to
Case I, the results will be the loss of each as shown in the operation.
PARTNERSHIP. '297
Examples of this kind may also be solved by proportion as in
Case I, the causes being compounded of capital and time; thus,

Hence the following
RULE. Multiply each man's capital by the time it is em-
ployed in trade, and add the products. Then multiply the
entire profit or loss by the ratio of the sum of the products to
each product, and the results will be the respective shares of
profit or loss of each partner. Or,
Multiply each man.s capital by tfte time it is employed in
trade, and regard each product as his capital, and the sum of
the products as the entire capital, and solve by proportion, as in
Case I.

ANALYSIS.
409. Analysis, in arithmetic, is the process of solving
problems independently of set rules, by tracing the relations
of the given numbers and the reasons of the separate steps of
the operation according to the special conditions of each question.
41 Ot In solving questions by analysis, we- generally reason
from the given number to unity, or 1, and then from unity, or
1, to the required number.
411. United States money is reckoned in dollars, dimes,
cents,andmills(180),one dollar being uniformly valued in all
the States at 100 cents; but in most of the States money is
sometimes still reckoned in pounds, shillings, and pence.
Note. At the time of the adoption of our decimal currency by
Congress, in 1786, the colonial currency, or bills of credit, issued by the
colonies, had depreciated in value, and this depreciation, being unequal
in the different colonies, gave rise to the different values of the State
currencies; and this variation continues wherever the denominations of
shillings and pence are in use.

31. A man bought 10 bushels of wheat and 25 bushels of
corn for $30, and 12 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn
for $20; how mudh a bushel did he grve for each?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. We may divide or

latlot, 10 25 $30 by such a number as will render
2d" 12 5 $20 one of the commodities purchased,
. - Z ;aK alike in both expressions. In this

1 bn. C. = $ .64 would be produced by multiply-
ing the second by 5,) and we have
the cost of 2 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn, equal to $6.
Subtracting this from 12 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn, which
cost $20, we find the cost of 10 bushels of wheat to be $14; there-
fore the cost of 1 bushel is ^ of $14, or $1.40. From any one of
the expressions containing both wheat and corn, we readily find the
cost of 1 bushel of corn to be 64 cents.

ALLIGATION.
413.. Alligation treats of mixing or compounding two or
more ingredients of different values. It is of two kinds — Alli-
gation Medial and Alligation Alternate.
414. Alligation Medial is the process of finding the aver-
age price or quality of a compound of several simple ingredi-
ents whose prices or qualities are known.
1. A miller mixes 40 bushels of rye worth 80 cents a
bushel, and 25 bushels of corn worth 70 cents a bushel, with
15 bushels of wheat worth $1.50 a bushel; what is the value
of a bushel of the mixture?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since 40 bushels
80 X 40 = $32.00 of rye at 80 cents a bushel is
70X25=' 17.50 worth $32, and 25 bushels of corn
1 50 X 15 = 22 50 a* "^ cents a bushel is worth
— — $17.50, and 15 bushels of wheat
80 ) 72.00 at $1.50 a bushel is worth $22.50,'
therefore the entire mixture, con-
.
sisting 01 80 bushels, is worth
$72, and one bushel is worth -fa of $72, or 72 -=- 80 = $.90.
Hence the following
RULE. Divide the entire cost or value of the ingredients
by the sum of the simples.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
2. A wine merchant mixes 12 gallons of wine, at $1 per
gallon, with 5 gallons of brandy worth $1.50 per gallon, and
3 gallons of water of no value; what is the worth of one gal-
lon of the mixture? Ans. $.975.
3. An innkeeper mixed 13 gallons of water with 52 gallons
of brandy, which cost him $1.25 per gallon; what is the value
of 1 gallon of the mixture, and what his profit on the sale of
the whole at 6£ cents per gill? Ans. $1 a gallon ; $65 profit.
4. A grocer mixed 10 pounds of sugar at 8 cts. with 12
pounds at 9 cts. and 16 pounds at 11 cts., and sold the mixture
at 10 cents per pound; did he gain or lose by the sale, and
how much? Ans. He gained 16 cts.
5. A grocer bought 71 dozen of eggs at 12 cents a dozen,
8 dozen at 10^- cents a dozen, 9 dozen at 11 cents a dozen,
and 10£ dozen at 10 cents a dozen. lie sells them so as to
make 50 per cent. on the cost; how much did he receive per
dozen? Ans. 16£ cents.
6. Bought 4 cheeses, each weighing 50 pounds, at 13 cents
a pound; 10, weighing 40 pounds each, at 10 cents a pound;
j,nd. 24, weighing 25 pounds each, at 7 cents a pound; I sold
the whole at an average price of 9£ cents a pound; how much
v.'as my whole gain? Ans. $6.
41.5. Alligation Alternate is the process of finding the
proportional quantities to be taken of several ingredients,
whose prices or qualities are known, to form a mixture of a
required price or quality.
CASE I.
416. To find the proportional quantity to be used
of each ingredient, when the mean price or quality of
the mixture is given.
1. What relative quantities of timothy seed worth $2 a
bushel, and clover seed worth $7 a bushel, must be used to
form a mixture worth $5 a bushel?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since on every in-
2 -J 2 ") gradient used whose price or qual-
7 JL 3 ) ity is less than the mean rate there
will be a gain, and on every in-
gredient whose price or quality is greater than the mean rate
there will be a loss, and since the gains and losses must be exactly
equal, the relative quantities Used of each should be such as repre-
sent the unit of value. By selling one bushel of timothy seed worth
$2, for $5, there is a gain of $3; and to gain $1 would require £ of
a bushel, which we place opposite the 2. By selling one bushel of
clover seed worth $7, for $5, there is a loss of $2; and to lose $1
would require \ of a bushel, which we place opposite the 7.
In every case, to find the unit of value we must divide $1 by the
gain or loss per bushel or pound, &c. Hence, if, every time we take
\ of a bushel of timothy seed, we take \ of a bushel of clover seed,
the gain and loss will be exactly equal, and we shall have £ and \
for the proportional quantities.

If we wish to express the proportional numbers in integers, we
may reduce these fractions to a common denominator, and use their
numerators, since fractions having a common denominator are to
each other as their numerators. ( 37§ ) thus, J and \ are equal to
| and |, and the proportional quantities are 2 bushels of timothy
seed to 3 bushels of clover seed.
2. What proportions of teas worth respectively 3, 4, 7 and
10 shillings a pound, must be taken to form a mixture worth
6 shillings a pound?
ANALYSIS. To preserve the
equality of gains and losses, we
must always compare two prices
or simples, one greater and one
less than the mean rate, and
treat each pair or couplet as a
separate example. In the given
example we form two couplets,
and may compare either 3 and 10, 4 and 7, or 3 and 7, 4 and 10.
We find that J of a Ib. at 3 s. must be taken to gain 1 shilling,
and ^ of a Ib. at 10 s. to lose 1 shilling ; also £ of a Ib. at 4 s. to gain
1 shilling, and 1 Ib. at 7 s. to lose 1 shilling. These proportional
numbers, obtained by comparing the two couplets, are placed in
columns 1 and 2. If, now, we reduce the numbers in columns 1 and
2 to a common denominator, and use their numerators, we obtain
the integral numbers in columns 3 and 4, which, being arranged in
column 5, give the proportional quantities to be taken of each.*
It will be seen that in comparing tha simples of any couplet, one
of which is greater, and the other less than the mean rate, the pro-
portional number finally obtained for either term is the difference
between the mean rate and the other term. Thus, in comparing 3
and 10, the proportional number of the former is 4, which is the
difference between 10 and the mean rate 6; and the proportional
number of the latter is 3, which is the difference between 3 and the
mean rate. The same is true of every other couplet. Hence, when
the simples and the mean rate are integers, the intermediate steps
taken to obtain the final proportional numbers as in columns 1, 2, 3,
and 4, may be omitted, and the same results readily found by taking
the difference between each simple and the mean rate, and placing
it opposite the one with which it is compared.
* Prof. A. B. Canfleld, of Oneida Conference Seminary, N. Y., used this method ol
Alligation, essentially, In the instruction of his classes as early as 1846, and he was
doubtless the author of it.
From the foregoing examples and analyses we derive the following
Rri.i;. I. Write the several prices or qualities in a column,
and the mean price or quality of the mixture at the left.
II. Form couplets by comparing any price or quality less,
with one that is greater than the mean rale, placing the part
which must be used to gain 1 of the mean rate opposite the less
simple, and the part that must be used to lose 1 opposite the
greater simple, and do the same for each simple in every couplet.
HI. If the proportional numbers are fractional, they may be
reduced to integers, and if two or more stand in the same hori-
zontal line, they must be added; the final results will be the pro-
portional quantities required.
NOTES. 1. If the numbers in any couplet or column have a com-
mon factor, it may be rejected.
2. We may also multiply the numbers in any couplet or column by
any multiplier we choose, without affecting the equality of the gains
and losses, and thus obtain an indefinite number of results, any one of
which being taken will give a correct final result.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.

CASE II.
417. When the quantity of one of the simples is
limited.
1. A miller has oats worth 30 cents, corn worth 45 cents,
and barley worth 84 cents per bushel; he desires to form a

•he take?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. By

5J5
Ans.
the same process
as in Case I we
find the propor-
tional quantities
cf each to be 4 bushels of oats, 8 of corn, and 10 of barley. But
•we wish to use 40 bushels of corn, which is 5 times the propor-
tional number 8, and to preserve the equality of gain and loss we
must take 5 times the proportional quantity of each of the other
simples, or 5 X 4 r= 20 bushels of oats, and 5 X 10 = 50 bushels
of barley. Hence the following
RULE. Find the proportional quantities as in Case I.
Divide the given quantity by the proportional quantity of the
same ingredient, and multiply each of the other proportional
quantities by the quotient thus obtained.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
2. A merchant has teas worth 40, 60, 75, and 90 cents per

6. A merchant mixed 80 pounds of sugar worth 6£ cents
per pound' with some worth 8^ cents and 10 cents per pound,
so that the mixture was worth 7£ cents per pound; how much
of each kind did he uso?
CASE III.
418. When the quantity of the whole compound is
limited.
1. A grocer has sugars worth 6 cents, 7 cents, 12 cents,
and 13 cents per pound. He wishes to make a mixture of
120 pounds worth 10 cents a pound; how many pounds of
each kind must he use?
ANALYSIS. By Case
I we find the propor-
tional quantities of each
to be 31bs. at 6 cts., 2
Ibs. at 7 cts., 3 Ibs at 12
cts., and 4 Ibs. at 13 cts.
By adding the propor-
tional quantities, we find
that the mixture would be but 12 Ibs. while the required mixture is
120, or 10 times 12. If the whole mixture is to be 10 times as much
as the sum of the proportional quantities, then the quantity-of each
simple used must be 10 times as much as its respective proportion-
al, which would require 30 Ibs. at 6 cts., 20 Ibs. at 7 cts., 30 Ibs. at
12 cts., and 40 Ibs. at 13 «ts. Hence we deduce the following

INVOLUTION.
419. A Power is the product arising from multiplying a
number by itself, or repeating it several times as a factor;
thus, in 2 X 2 X 2 = 8, the product, 8, is a power of 2.
420. The Exponent of a power is the number denoting
how many times the factor is repeated to produce the power,
and is written above and a little to the right of the factor; thus,
2 X 2 X 2 is written 23, in which 3 is the exponent. Exponents
likewise give names to the powers, as will be seen in the
following illustrations:
3 = 3l r= 3, the first power of 3;
3X3 = 32 = 9, the second power of 3
3X3X3 = 33 = 27, the third power of 3.
421. The Square of a number is its second power.
432. The Cube of a number is its third power.
423. Involution is the process of raising a number to a
given power.

434. A Perfect Power is a number that can be exactly
produced by the involution of some number as a root; thus, 25
and 32 are perfect powers, since 25 = 5 X 5, and 32 = 2 X
2X2X2X2.

times as a factor. Hence, we have the following
Rule. Multiply the number by itself as many times, less 1,
as there are units in the exponent of the required power.

425. A Root is a factor repeated to produce a power;
thus, in the expression 5 X 5 X 5 = 125, 5 is the root from
-which the power, 125, is produced.
426. Evolution is the process of extracting the root of a
number considered as a power, and is the reverse of Involution.
437. The Eadical Sign is the character, •>/, which, placed
before a number, denotes that its root is to be extracted.
428. The Index of the root is the figure placed above the
radical sign, to denote what root is to be taken. When no
index is written, the index 2 is always understood.
429. A Surd is the indicated root of an imperfect power.
430. Roots are named from the corresponding powers, as
will be seen in the following illustrations:
The square root of 9 is 3, written ^/9 = 3.
The cube root of 27 is 3, written ^27 = 3.
The fourth root of 81 is 3, written ^81 = 3.
431« Any number whatever may be considered a power
whose root is to be extracted; but only the perfect powers can
have exact roots.
SQUARE ROOT.
432. The Square Eoot of a number is one of the two
equal factors that produce the number; thus the square root
of 49 is 7, for 7 X 7 = 49.
433. In extracting the square root, the first thing to be
determined is the relative number of places in a given number
and its square root. The law governing this relation is exhib-
ited in the following examples : —
Root?. Squares. Roots. Squares.
Ill 1
9 81 10 1,00
99 98,01 100 1,00,00
999 99,80,01 1000 1,00,00,00
From these examples we perceive
1st. That a root consisting of 1 place may have 1 or 2
places in the square.
2d. That in all cases the addition of 1 place to the root
adds 2 places to the square. Hence,
If we point off a number into two-figure periods, commen-
cing at the right hand, the number of full periods and the left
hand full or partial period will indicate the number of places
in the square root; the highest period answering to the highest
figure of the root.
434. 1. What is the length of one side of a square plat
containing an area of 5417 sq. ft.?
OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since the given figure is
54,17 | 73 6 a square, its side will be the square root
49 of its area, which we will proceed to com-
pute. Pointing off the given number, the
"2 periods show that. there will be two in-
143 429 tegral figures, tens and units, in the root.
146.0 8800 Tne tens of tne root inust be extracted
1466 87 96 from the first or left hand period, 54 hun-
• dreds. The greatest square in 54 hun-
4 dreds is 49 hundreds, the square of 7 tens;
we therefore write 7 tens in the root, at
the right of the given number.
Since the entire root is to be the side of a square, let us form a
Fig. I. square (Fig. I), the side of which is 70 feet long.
The area of this square is 70 X 70 = 4900 sq. ft.,
which we subtract from the given number. Tin's
is done in the operation by subtracting the
square number, 49, from the first period, 54,
and to the remainder bringing down the sec-
ond period, making the entire remainder 517.
If we now enlarge our square (Fig. I) by the addition of 517
square feet, in such a manner as to preserve the square form, ita
size will be that of the required square. To preserve the square
form, the addition must be so made as to extend the square equally
in two directions ; it will therefore be composed of 2 oblong figures
at the sides, and a little square at the corner (Fig. II). Now, the
width of this addition will be the additional length to the side of the
square, and consequently the next figure in the root. To find width
we divide square contents, or area, by length. But the length of
one side of the little square cannot be found till the width of the
addition be determined, because it is equal to this width. We will
therefore add the lengths of the 2 oblong figures, and the sum will
be sufficiently near the whole length to be used as a trial divisor.

317
Fig. II.
Each of the oblong figures is equal in length to the side of the
square first formed; and their united length
is 70 + 70 = 140 ft. (Fig. III). This num-
ber is obtained in the operation by doubling
the 7 and annexing 1 cipher, the result being
written at the left of the dividend. Dividing
517, the area, by 140, the approximate length,
we obtain 3, the probable width of the addi-
tion, and second figure of the root. Since 3 is
also the side of the little square, we can now
Fig. III.
7.I
70
a
Trial Divisor — 140
Complete Divisor= 143
find the entire length of the addition, or the complete divisor, which
is 70 + 70 + 3 = 143 (Fig. III).
This number is found in the oper-
ation by adding 3 to the trial di-
visor, and writing the result un-
derneath. Multiplying the com-
plete divisor, 143, by the trial
quotient figure, 3, and subtracting
the product from the dividend, we
obtain another remainder of 88 square feet. With this remainder,
for the same reason as before, we must proceed to make a new
enlargement; and we bring down two decimal ciphers, because the
next figure of the root, being tenths, its square will be hundredths.
The trial divisor to obtain the width of this new enlargement,
or the next figure in the root, will be, for the same reason as
before, twice 73, the root already found, with one cipher annexed.
But since the 7 has already been doubled in the operation, we have
only to double the last figure of the complete divisor, 143, and
annex a cipher, to obtain the new trial divisor, 146.0. Dividing, we
obtain .6 for the trial figure of the root; then proceeding as before,
we obtain 146.6 for a complete divisor, 87.96 for a product; and
there is still a remainder of .04. Hence, the side of the given
square plat is 73.6 feet, nearly. From this example and analysis
we deduce the following
RULE. I. Point off the given number into periods of two
figures each, counting from unit's place toward the left and
right.
II. Find the greatest square number in the left hand period,
and write its root for the first figure in the root; subtract the
square number from the left hand period, and to the remainder
dawn the next period for a dividend.
III. At the left of the dividend write twice the first figure of
the root, and annex one cipher, for a trial divisor; divide the
dividend by the trial divisor, and write the quotient for a trial
figure in the root.
IV. Add the trial figure of the root to the trial divisor for a
complete divisor; multiply the complete divisor by the trial
figure in the root, and subtract the product from the dividend,
and to the remainder bring down the next period for a new
dividend.
V. To the last complete divisor add the last figure of the
root, and to the sum annex one cipltcr, for a new trial divisor,
with which proceed as before.
NOTES. 1. If at any time the product be greater than the dividend,
diminish the trial figure of the root, and correct the erroneous work.
2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex another cipher to the trial
divisor, and another period to the dividend, and proceed as before.

CUBE BOOT.
442. The Cube Boot of a number is one of the three
equal factors that produce the number. Thus,"the cube root
of 27 is 3, since 3 X 3 X 3 = 27.
443. In extracting the cube root, the first thing to be
determined is the relative number of places in a cube and its
root. The law governing this relation is exhibited in the fol-
lowing examples : —
Hoots. Cubes. Roots. Cubes.
Ill 1
9 729 10 1,000
99 907,299 100 1,000,000
999 997,002,999 1000 1,000,000,000
From these examples, we perceive,
1st . That a root consisting of 1 place may have from 1 to
3 places in the cube.
2d. That in all cases the addition of 1 place to the root
adds three places to the cube. Hence,
If we point off a number into three-figure periods, com-
mencing at the right hand, the number of full periods and the
left hand full or partial period wibl indicate the number of
places in the cube root, the highest period answering to the
highest figure of the roof.
444. 1. What is the length of one side of a cubical block
containing 413494 solid inches?
OPERATION — COMMENCED. ANALYSIS. Since the block is a
413494 | 74 cube, its side will be the cube root of
343 its solid contents, which we will pro-
compute. Pointing off the
1470070494 •
given number, the two periods show
that there will be two figures, tens and
units, in the root. The tens of the root must be extracted from the
first period, 413 thousands. The greatest cube in 413 thousands is
343 thousands, the cube of 7 tens; we therefore write 7 tens in the
root at the right of the given number.
323

Since the entire root is to be the side of a cube, let us form a
cubical block (Fig. I), the side
of which is 70 inches in length.
The contents of this cube are
70 X 70 X 70 = 343,000 solid
inches, which we subtract from
the given number. This is done
in the operation by subtracting
the cube number, 343, from the
first period, 413, and to the re-
mainder bringing down the sec-
JS oud period, making the entire
'remainder 70494.
If we now enlarge our cubical
block, (Fig. I), by the addition of 70494 solid inches, in such a
manner as to preserve the cubical form, its size will be that of
the required block. To preserve the cubical form, the addition
must be made upon three adjacent sides or faces. The addition
will therefore be composed of 3 flat blocks to cover the 3 faces,
(Fig. II); 3 oblong blocks to fill the vacancies at the edges,
(Fig. Ill); and 1 small cubical block to fill the vacancy at the cor-
ner, (Fig. IV). Now, the thickness of this enlargement will be the
additional length of the side of the cube, and, consequently, the
second figure in the root. To find thickness, we may divide solid
- 'I- contents by surface, or area.
But the area of the 3 oblong
blocks and little cube cannot
be found till the thickness of
the addition be determined, be-
cause their common breadth is
equal to this thickness. We will
therefore find the area of the
three flat blocks, which is suffi-
ciently near the whole area to bo
used as a trial divisor. As these
are each equal in length and
breadth to the side of the cube
whose faces they cover, the whole
area of the three is 70 X 70 X
3 = 14700 square inches. This number is obtained in the operation
by annexing 2 ciphers to three times the square of 7; the result
being written at the left hand of the dividend. Dividing, we obtain

4, the probable thickness of the addition, and second figure of the
root. With this assumed figure,
we will complete our divisor by
adding the area of the 4 blocks,
before undetermined. The 3 ob-
long blocks are each 70 inches
long; and the little cube, being
equal in each of its dimensions
to the thickness of the addition,
must be 4 inches long. Hence,
their united length is 70 + 70
+ 70 + 4 = 214. This number
is obtained in the operation by
multiplying the 7 by 3, and an-
nexing the 4 to the product, the
result being written in column
I, on the next line below the
trial divisor. Multiplying 214,
the length, by 4, the common
width, we obtain 856, the area of
the four blocks, which added to
14700, the trial divisor, makes
15556, the complete divisor; and
multiplying this by 4, the second
figure in the root, and subtract-
ing the product from the divi-
dend, we obtain a remainder of
0270 solid inches. With this re-
mainder, for the same reason as
before, we must proceed to make
a new enlargement. But since
we have already two figures in
the root, answering to the two
periods of the given number,
the next figure of the root must
be a decimal; and we therefore
annex to the remainder a period
of three decimal ciphers, mak-
ing 8270.000 for a new dividend.
The trial divisor to obtain the
thickness of this second enlarge-
ment, or the next figure of the root, will be the area of three new flat
blocks to cover the threa sides of the cube already formed; and this

face of each of the flat blocks, oblong blocks, and little cube;
and in the correction of the trial divisor, 856, 1 face of each of
the oblong blocks and of the little cube; and in the square of
the last root figure, 16, a third face of the little cube. Hence, 16

thus: 16, 6, and 6 are 28, and we write the unit figure in the new
trial divisor; then 2 to carry, and 5 and 5 are 12, &c. We annex
2 ciphers to this trial divisor, as to the former, and dividing, obtain
5, the third figure in the root. To complete the second trial di-
visor, after the manner of the first, the correction may be found by
annexing .5 to 3 times the former figures, 74, and multiplying this
number by .5. But as we have, in column I, 3 times 7, with 4
annexed, or 214, we need only multiply the last figure, 4, by 3,
and annex .5, making 222.5, which multiplied by .5 gives 111.25,
the correction required. Then we obtain the complete divisor,
16539.25, the product, 8269.625, and the remainder, .375, in the
manner shown by the former steps. From this example and analysis
we deduce the following
RULE. I. Point off the given number into periods of three
figures each, counting from units' place toward the left and right.
II. Find the greatest cube that does not exceed the left hand
period, and write its root for the first figure in the required
root; subtract the cube from the left hand period, and to the
remainder bring down the next period for a dividend.
III. At the left of the dividend write three times the square
of the first figure of the root, and annex two ciphers, for a trial
divisor; divide the dividend by the trial divisor, and write the
quotient for a trial figure in the root.
EVOLUTION.
IV. Annex the trial figure to three times the former figure,
and write the result in a column marked I, one line below the
trial divisor; multiply this term by the trial figure, and write
the product on the same line in a column marked II; add this
term as a correction to the trial divisor, and the result will be
the complete divisor.
V. Multiply the complete divisor by the trial figure, and
subtract the product from the dividend, and to the remainder
bring down the next period for a new dividend.
VI. Add the square of the last figure of the root, the last
term in column II, and the complete divisor together, and annex
two ciphers, for a new trial divisor; with which obtain an-
other trial figure in the root.
,- '. .-'. VlI . Multiply the unit figure of the last term in column I
by 3, and annex the trial figure of the root for the next term
of column I; multiply this result by the trial figure of the root
for the next term of column II; add this term to the trial
divisor for a complete divisor, with which proceed as before.
NOTES. 1. If at any time the product be greater than the dividend,
diminish the trial figure of the root, and correct the erroneous work.
2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex two more ciphers to the
trial divisor, and another period to the dividend; then proceed as be-
fore with column I, annexing both cipher and trial figure.

ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION.
44tf. An Arithmetical Progression, or Series, is a series
of numbers increasing or decreasing by a common difference.
Thus, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c., is an arithmetical progression with an
ascending series, and 13, 10, 7, 4, &c., is an arithmetical pro-
gression with a descending series.
4-1:6. The Terms of a series are the numbers of which it
is composed.
447. The Extremes are the first and last terms.
448. The Means are the intermediate terms.
44!). The Common Difference is the difference between
any two adjacent terms.
450. There are jive parts in an arithmetical series, any
three of which being given, the other two may be found.
They are as follows: the first term, last term, common differ'
ence, number of terms, and sum of all the terms.
CASE I.
451. To find the last term when the first .term,
common difference, and number of terms arc given.
Let 2 be the first term of an ascending series, and 3 the
common difference; then the series will be written, 2, 5, 8, 11,
14, or analyzed thus: 2, 2 + 3, 2 + 3 +3, 2 + 3 + 3 + 3,
2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.
Here we see that, in an ascending series, we obtain the
second term by adding the common difference once to the first
term; the third term, by adding the common difference twice
to the first term; and, in general, we obtain any term by
adding the common difference as many times to the first term
as there are terms less one.
NOTE. The analysis for a descending series would be similar.
Hence,
RULE. Multiply the common difference by the number of
terms less one, and add the product to the first term, if the
series be ascending, and subtract it iflhe series be descending.
EXAMPLES.
1. The first term of an ascending series is 4, the common
difference 3, and the number of terms 19; what is the last
term? Ans. 58.
2. What is the 13th term of a descending series whose first
term is 75, and common difference 5? • Ans. 15.
3. A boy bought 18 hens, paying 2 cents for the first, 5
cents for the second, and 8 cents for the third, in arithmetical
progression; what did he pay for the last hen?
4. What is the 40th term of the series £, £,. 1, 1J, &c.?
Ans. 10£.
5. A man travels 9 days; the first day he goes 20 miles,
the second 25 miles, increasing 5 miles each day; how far
does he travel the last day of his journey? Ans. 60 miles.
6. What is the amount of $100, at 7 per cent., for 45
years? $100 + $7 X 45 = $415, Ans.
CASE II.
452. To find the common difference when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
Referring to the series, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, analyzed in 4.38,
we readily see that, by subtracting the first term from any
term, we have left the common difference taken as many times
as there are terms less one; thus, by taking away 2 in the
fifth term, 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, we have 3 taken 4 times.
Hence,
RULE. Divide the difference of the extremes by the number
of terms less one.
EXAMPLES.
1. The first term is 2, the last term is 17, and the number
of terms is 6; what is the common difference? Ans. 3.
2. A man has seven children, whose ages are in arithmetical
progression; the youngest is 2 years old, and the eldest 14;
•what is the common difference of their ages? Ans. 2 years.
3. The extremes of an arithmetical series are 1 and 50£,
and the number of terms is 34; what is the common difference?
4. An invalid commenced to walk for exercise, increasing
the distance daily by a common difference; the first day he
walked 3 miles, and the 14th day 9£ miles; how many miles
did he walk each day?
NOTE. When we have found the common difference we may add it
once, twice, &c., to the first term, and we have the series, and conse-
quently the means.
Ans. 3, 3i, 4, 4£, 5, 5£, &c.
CASE III.
4«"»J8. To find the number of terms when the ex-
tremes and common difference are given.
Examining the series, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, analyzed in 438,
we also see that after taking away the first term from any
term, we have left the common difference taken as many
times as the number of terms, less 1. Hence,
RULE. Divide the difference of the extremes by the common
difference, and add 1 to the quotient.
EXAMPLES.
1. The extremes are 7 and 43, and the common difference
is 4; what is the number of terms? Ans. 10.
2. The first term is 2£, the last term is 40, and the common
difference is 74-; what is the number of terms? Ans. 6.
3. A laborer agreed to build a fence on the following con-
ditions: for the first rod he was to have 6 cents, with an
increase of 4 cents on each successive rod; the last rod came
to 226 cents; how many rods did he build? Ans. 56 rods.
CASE IV.
454. To find the sum of all the terms when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
To deduce a rule for finding the sum of all the terms, we
will take the series 2, 5, 8,11, 14, writing it under itself in an
inverse order, and add each term; thus,
2-f- 5+ 8+11+14=40, once the sum.
14 + 11+ 8 + 5+ 2 = 40," " «
16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 —80, twice the sum.
Here we perceive that 16, the sum of the extremes, multi-
plied by 5, the number of terms, equals 80, which is twice the
sum of the series. Dividing 80 by 2 gives 40, which is the
sum required. Hence,
RULE. Multiply the sum of the extremes by the number of
terms, and divide the product by 2.
EXAMPLES.
1. The extremes are 5 and 32, and the number of terms 12;
what is the sum of all the terms? Ans. 222.
2. How many strokes does a common clock make in 12
hours? Ans. 78 strokes.
3. What debt can be discharged in a year by weekly pay-
ments in arithmetical progression, the first being $24, and the
last $1224? Ans. $32448.
4. Suppose 100 apples were placed in a line 2 yards apart,
and a basket 2 yards from the first apple; how far would a
boy travel to gather them up singly, and return with each
separately to the basket? Ans. -20200 yards.
GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION.
455. A Geometrical Progression is a series of numbers
increasing or decreasing by a constant multiplier.
When the multiplier is greater than a unit, the series is
ascending; thus, 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, is an ascending series, in
which 3 is the multiplier.
When the multiplier is less than a unit, the series is descend-
ing; thus, 162, 54, 18, 6, 2, is a descending series, in which ^
is the multiplier.
J.10. The Ratio is the constant multiplier.
457. In every geometrical progression there are five
parts to be considered, any three of which being given, the
other two may be determined. They are as follows: The first
term, last term, ratio, number of terms, and the sum of all the
terms.
The first and last terms are the extremes, and the interme-
diate terms are the means.
CASE I.
458. To find any term, the first term, the ratio,
and number of terms being given.
The first term is supposed to exist independently of the
ratio. Using the ratio once as a factor, we have the second
term; using it twice, or its second power, we have the third
term; using it three times, or its third power, we have the
fourth term; and, in general, the power of the ratio in any
term is one less than the number of the term. The ascending
series, 2, 6, 18, 54, may be analyzed thus: 2, 2 X 3, 2 X
3X3, 2X3X3X3.
In this illustration we see that
1st term, 2, is independent of the ratio.
2d " 6 = 2X3 = the first term into the 1st power of
(he ratio.
3d term, 18 = 2 X 32 = the first term into the 2d power
of the ratio.
4th term, 54 = 2 X 3 3 = the first term into the 3d power
of the ratio. Hence
Rule. Multiply the first term by that power of the ratio
denoted by the number of terms less 1.
EXAMPLES.
1. The first term of a geometrical series is 4, the ratio is 3;
what is the 9th term? Ans. 4 X 38 = 26244.
2. The first term is 1024, the ratio ^, and the numher of
terms 8; what is the last term? Ans. ^. A
3. A boy bought 9 oranges, agreeing to pay 1 mill for the
first orange, 2 mills for the second, and so on; what did the
last orange cost him? Ans. $.256.
4. The first term is 7, the ratio ^-, and the number of terms
7; what is the last term? Ans. Ysi^j.
5. What is the amount of $1 at compound interest for 5
years, at 7 per cent. per annum? . Ans. $1.40255 -4-
Note. In the above example the first term is $1, the ratio is $1.07,
and the number of terms is 6.
6. A drover bought'7 oxen, agreeing to pay $3 for the first
ox, $9 for the second, $27 for the third, and so on; what did
the last ox cost him? Ans. $2187.
case n.
459. To find the sum of all the terms, the ex-
tremes and ratio being given.
If we take the series 2, 8, 32, 128, 512, in which the ratio
is 4, multiply each term by the ratio, and add the terms thus
multiplied, we shall have
GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION. 333
But 2 + 8 + 32 + 128 + 512 = 682 = j ^terms.8""1 °f *"
Hence, by subtracting, we get 2048 - 2 = 2046 = { ^J^Z^T
Dividing by 3, the ratio less one, 2046 -^ 3=682={ ^"^B'um of aU
The subtraction is performed by taking the lower line or
series from the upper. All the terms cancel except 2048 and
2. Taking their difference, which is 3 times the sum, and di-
viding by 3, the ratio less one, we must have the sum of all
the terms. Hence
RULE. Multiply the greater extreme by the ratio, subtract
the less extreme from the product, and divide the remainder
by the ratio less 1.
NOTE. Let every decreasing series be inverted, and the first term
called the last; then the ratio will be greater than a unit. . If the series
A infinite, the first term is a cipher.
EXAMPLES.
1. The first term is 2, the last term 512, and the ratio 3;
what is the sum of all the terms? Ans. 767.
2. The first term is 4, the last term is 262144, and the
ratio is 4; what is the sum of the series? Ans. 349524.
3. The first term of a descending series is 162, the last
term 2, and the ratio ^; "what is the sum? Ans. .242.
4. What is the value of |, ^, y^, &c., to infinity? Ans. £.
NOTE. In the following examples we first find the last term by the
Rule under Case I.
5. What yearly debt can be discharged by monthly pay-
ments, the first being $2, the second $6, and the third $18,
and so on, in geometrical progression? Ans. $531440.

OF
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.*
INTRODUCTION.
The metric system of weights and measures — so called, because
the metre is the unit from which the other units of the system are
derived—had its origin in France during the Revolution, a time when
all regard for institutions of the past was repudiated. In the year
1790, the French government resolved to introduce a new system;
and, in order that it might be received with general favor, other
countries were invited to join with it in the choice of new units.
In response to this invitation, a large number of scientific men, com-
missioned by various countries, met in Paris, in consultation with the
principal men of France. . In the year 1791, a commission, nomi-
nated by the Academy of Sciences, was appointed by the Government
to prepare the new system. The first work of the commission was to
select a standard of lengths from which the system of units adopted
might at any time be restored if from any cause the original unit
should be lost. A quadrant of the earth's meridian was chosen as
the standard, and the ten-millionth part of it taken as the unit of
lengths, which was called a metre. In 1795, this standard and a
provisional metre whose length was determined from measurements
* ST. McViCAR, A.M., Principal of the State Normal and Training School at
Brockport, N.Y., a most thorough and critical scholar as well as teacher, prepared
this article, which contains many practical improvements in Notation, Nomencla*
ture, and Applications, not before presented to the public.
Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1867, by D. W. Frsn, A. M., In the Clerk.s
Office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.
15*
of the earth's meridian, which had already been made, was adopted
by the government.
In the meantime, two eminent astronomers, Mechain and Delambre,
were engaged in determining the exact length of the arc of the meri-
dian between Dunkirk in the north of France, and Barcelona in
Spain. At a later period, Biot and Arago measured the prolonga-
tion of the same meridian as for as the island of Formentara. From
these measurements, together with one formerly made in Peru, they
deduced, as they supposed, the exact distance from the equator to
the pole, which differed slightly from the standard assumed in 1795.
In 1799, a law was passed changing the length of the metre adopted
in 1795 so as to conform with this difference. The metre thus de-
termined was marked by two very fine parallel lines drawn on a pla-
tinum bar, and deposited for preservation in the national archives.
While a part of the commission were engaged in establishing the
exact length of the metre, other members pursued a course of inves-
tigation for the purpose of determining a.unit of weights, which would
sustain an invariable relation to the unit of lengths. As the result
of their investigations, the weight of a cube of pure water whose edge
was one-hundredth part of a metre was the unit chosen. The water
was weighed in a vacuum, at a temperature of 4° C., or 39.2° F.,
which was supposed to be the temperature of greatest density. This
weight was called a gramme; and a piece of platinum weighing one
thousand grammes was deposited as the standard of weights in the
national archives.
Had the work of the commission ended in determining these
standards of lengths and weights, their labor would have been futile.
For, while the conception of basing their system upon an absolute
standard in nature was good, the execution proved a failure. Later
investigations have shown that the metre is less than the ten-millionth
part of the earth's meridian; consequently the metric system of
weights and measures is referable not to an invariable standard in
nature, but to the platinum metre deposited in the national archives
of France. The great benefits which result from the labors of the
commission arise from the adoption of the decimal scale of units, and
a simple yet general and expressive nomenclature. The amount of
time and money used in carrying on exchanges between different coun
tries, which would bo saved by the universal adoption of this system,
is incalculable. The system was declared obligatory throughout the
whole of France after Nov. 2, 1801; but, owing to the prejudices
of the people in favor of established customs, and the confusion con-
sequent upon the use of the new measures, the Government, iu 1812,
adopted a compromise, in the sysleme usuel, whose principal units
were the new ones, while the divisions and names were nearly those
formerly in use, ascending commonly in the ratios of two, three, four,
eight, or twelve. In 1837, the government abolished this system,
and enacted a law attaching a penalty to the use of any other than
the metric system after Jan. 1, 1841. Since that time, the system
has been adopted by Spain, Belgium, and Portugal, to the exclusion
of other weights and measures. In Holland, other weights are used
only in Compounding medicines. In 18G4, the system was legalized
in Great Britain; and its use, either as a whole or in some of its parts,
has been authorized in Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Mexico,
Guatemala, Venezuela, Ecuador, United States of Columbia, Brazil,
Chili, San Salvador, and Argentine Republic. In 1866, Congress
authorized the metric system in the United States by passing the fol-
lowing bills and resolution : —

NOTE. — The spelling in the above tables is not the same as in
the tablos in the schedule annexed to the report of the committee of
the House of Representatives on weights and measures. The change
is not made to indicate any preference for any standard upon this
subject; but to carry out what the author believes to be an essential
condition to the utility and success of the system.
As remarked by a distinguished senator when the tables were
adopted by Congress, "T7ie names are cosmopolitan ;" and to re-
tain this character fully, the spelling must also be cosmopolitan.
The French introduced the nomenclature and spelling; arid, ,=o
long as the names remain unchanged, the spelling should be retained.

THE METRIC SYSTEM.
NOMENCLATURE AM) TABLES. • .
There are eight kinds of quantities for which tables are usually
constructed; viz., Lengths, Surfaces, Volumes or Solids, Capacities,
Weights, Values, Times, and Angles or Arcs. The table for Times
is the same in the metric as in the ordinary system. The table for
Angles is constructed upon a centesimal scale. The tables for the
other six kinds of quantities are constructed upon a decimal scale.
In each of the tables for Lengths, Surfaces, Volumes, Capacities, and
Weights, there are eight denominations of units, — one principal and
seven derivative. The principal units are the metre, which is the
base of the system, and those derived directly from it. The two
following tabular views present the facts regarding the principal and
derivative units, which should be fixed in the memory.
1. Principal unit of Lengths. .
2. The base of the metric system, and nearly
one ten-millionth part of a quadrant of
the earth's meridian.
. 3. Equivalent, £9.3708 inches.
1. Principal unit of surfaces.
2. A square whost side is ten metres.
3. Equivalent, 119 6 square yards.
1. Principal unit of volumes or solids.
2. A cube whose edge is one metre.
3. Equivalent, 1.308 cubic yards.
1. Principal unit of capacities.
2. A vessel whose volume is equal to a cube
whose edge is one-tenth of a metre.
3. Equivalent, .908 quart dry measure, or
1.0567 quarts wine measure,
f 1. Principal unit of weights.
2. The weight of a cube of pure water whose
edge is .01 of a metre.
3. The water must be weighed in a vacuum
4° C., or 39.2° P.
4. Equivalent, 15.432 grains.

1. Three orders of smaller units, or submultiples of each
kind, are formed by dividing each of the principal units
into tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.
2. Four orders of larger units, or multiples of each kind,
are formed by considering as a unit ten times, one
hundred times, one thousand times, and ten thousand
times, each of the principal units.
The names of derivative units are formed by
attaching a prefix to the name of the princi-
pal unit from which they are derived, which
indicates their relation to the principal unit.
1. Millesimus, one thousandth, contracted
Milli. Example, Millilitro = risW of a litre;
8 millilitrcs = -nsW of a ^ltre-

Kilogramme = 1000 grammes.
4. Myria, ten thousand. Ex., Myriastere =

5. The a in deca and myra, and the o in hecto
and kilo, are dropped when prefixed to are.

THE METRIC SYSTEM.
The facts in the preceding views being mastered, the tables can be
constructed by the pupil at sight. For example: The names of the
derivative units are formed by attaching the seven prefixes, in their
order, to the principal units of the tables. The order of progression
being ten, the table of capacities will be written thus : —
10 Millilitres = 1 Centilitre. 10 Litres — 1 Decalitre.
10 Centilitres = 1 Decilitre. 10 Decalitres = 1 Hectolitre.
10 Decilitres = 1 Litre. 10 Hectolitres = 1 Kilolitre.
10 Kilolitres = 1 Myrialitre.
All the tables peculiar to the Metric System are presented together
in a convenient form in the two following tables : —

ABBREVIATED NOMENCLATURE.
To secure the fullest advantage to business men by the universal
adoption of the new system of weights and measures, it is necessary
that the names used should be short and easy to write and pronounce,
that they should express clearly the relation of the different denomi-
nations of the same table to each other, and that they should be
identical in all languages.
The last two of these requirements would be secured by the uni-
versal use of the nomenclature adopted by tho French. It is cosmo-
politan in its character : it belongs to their language no more than to
any other. The former, however, is not secured. It is evident to
all, that, for business purposes, the long names of the metric system
are inconvenient, and that to shorten them would prove a great
advantage. Efforts have been made to introduce short names;
but these efforts have invariably sacrificed their universal and expres-
sive character, which is of more importance to the business world
than their shortness.
The only true course which seems to be open, is to abbreviate the
names already introduced, in such a way as to retain their peculiar
characteristics.
To secure this, the following plan of abbreviation is suggested : —
First. Let the prefixes be abbreviated thus: Myr, kil, hect, dec,
des, cent. mil.
Second. Let the initial letter of the names of the five principal
units be used, instead of the names themselves, thus: For metre, use
a capital M; for are, use a capital A; for stere, a capital S; for
litre, a capital L; and, for gramme, a capital G.
Third. For the names of multiples and sub-multiples, attach to
these initial capital letters the abbreviated prefixes, thus: Kil M, pro-
nounced kill-em'; Kil S, pronounced kill-ess', &c.
By this method of abbreviation, the elements of the original terms
are retained in such a form that each part is clearly indicated. The
capital letter used after the prefix will always point to the base-word
of which it is the initial, although the pronunciation is changed.

NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
In the practical application of the metric system, it is not always
convenient to use the principal units as the unit of number. For
example: Should the gramme, the principal unit of weight, be used
as the unit of number, in the grocery or any similar business, small
quantities would be expressed by inconveniently large numbers.
Example: 386 Ibs. are expressed by 175,000 grammes. To avoid
this inconvenience, the higher denominations are used as the unit of
number when large quantities are measured.
No general system of notation is yet' agreed upon. The same
quantity is written in various ways by different authors. Example:
42 metres, 8 decimetres, and 5 centimetres, are written
m cm
42.85 M. 42? 85. 42.85. M 42.85. &c.
Inasmuch as the principal units of measure are not always used as
the unit of number, it is important that a system of notation be adopt-
ed, which will apply equally well to both principal and derivative
units.
It is believed that the system given below, while simple and con-
venient, expresses clearly the relation of the unit of number to the
principal unit of measure; and, hence, has an advantage over any
contractions of the names of the derivative units or arbitrary signs
which might be adopted.
GENEKAL PRINCIPLES OF NOTATION.
I. The scale in the metric system being decimal, the consecutive
denominations are expressed by the consecutive orders of units in a
number. Thus, 781)42.358 metres is an expression for 7 myria-
metres, 8 kilometres, G hectometres, 4 decametres, 2 metres, 3 deci-
metres, 5 centimetres, 8 millimetres.
II. Whichever one of the eight denominations of units of measure
is used as the unit of a number, the higher denominations are ex-
pressed as tens, hundreds, and so on; and the lower as tenths, hun-
dredths, and so o.n. Example: 784:50 decametres. Here the unit
of the number is a decametre; consequently the tens and hundreds
are, respectively, hectometres and kilometres, and the tenths and
hundredths are metres and decimetres.
From these principles and illustrations, we derive the following rule
for notation : —
KULE. Write the consecutive denominations in their order, com-
mencing with the higher, and placing a cipher wherever a denomi-
nation is omitted, and the decimal point after the denomination
which is the unit of the number.
RULES FOR INDICATING TUB DENOMINATION.
RULE I. When a principal unit of measure is the unit of num-
ber, place the initial letter of the unit used before the number, thus:
M 342.5. Read, three hundred and forty-two and five-tenths
metres; or, 3 hectometres, 4 decametres, 2 metres, 5 decimetres.
EXAMPLES. FOR PRACTICE.
Write the numbers which represeat the following quantities, con-
sidering the principal unit of measure the unit of number.
1. Seven myriametres, 4 hectometres, three decametres, and eight
centimetres. Ans. M 70430.08.
2. Thirty-four kilometres and forty-three millimetres.
Ans. M 34000.043.
3. Eighty-seven hectogrammes and fifty-nine centigrammes.
Ans. G 8700.59.
4. Thirty-two myriagrammes, forty-eight decagrammes, five milli-
grammes. Ans. G 320480.005.
5. Three hundred and two kilarcs, eight hundred and seven cen-
tiares. Ans. G 302008.07.
G. Four myrialitres, sixty-two decalitres, five millilitres.
Ans. L 40620,005.
7. Four hundred and thirty-three kilosteres, nine hundred and
eighty four hectosteres, seven thousand two hundred and three centi-
steres. Ans. S 53147203.
RULE II. When a multiple of a principal unit of measure is the
unit of number; — First, Place before the number the initial letter
of the principal unit from which the multiple is derived. Second,
Indicate the order of multiple used b'j a small figure placed to the
left and above the letter prefixed to the number. (See symbols in
table of multiples.)
Example. 42.5 kilometres, is written 3M42.5.
The M before the number indicates that the metre is the unit of
measure from which the unit of the number is derived. The small
3 indicates that the third order of multiple, or kilometre, is the unit
of number.

EEDUCTION.
Rule for Reduction Descending. Multiply the given quantity
by the number of the required denomination which makes a unit of
the given denomination.
Since the multiplier is always 10, 100, 1000, &c, the operation
is performed by removing the decimal point as many places to the
right as there are ciphers in the multiplier, annexing ciphers when
necessary.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Reduce "M 32.58 to millimetres.
2. Reduce 4M 5 to decimetres.
3. Reduce G402 to milligrammes.
4. Reduce !A42.3 to centiares.
5. Reduce 'L93.2 to decilitres.
<,. Reduce 'S 895 to decasteres.
7. Reduce 2A 903.2 to milliares.
8. Reduce 'G 539 to centigrammes.
Rule for Reduction Ascending. Divide the given quantity
by the number of its own denomination which makes a unit of the
required denomination.
Since the divisor is always 10, 100, 1000, &c, the operation is
performed by removing the decimal point as many places to the left
as there are ciphers in the divisor, prefixing ciphers when necessary.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. Reduce 2A 5 to myriares.
2. Reduce SM 403 to kilometres.

NUMERAL EXPRESSION FOR SURFACE.
The contents of a plane figure la expressed numerically by giving
the number of times it contains some given area, which is assumed as
the unit of surface.
The following illustrations will show how the various denomina-
tions of the table are used in numerical expressions of surface : —
ILLUSTRATION FIRST.
Length 6 metres.
It will be seen, by examining this figure, that the lines drawn
parallel to the sides, at the supposed distance of a metre from each
other, divide the surface into square metres, and that there are as
many rows of square metres as there are metres in the breadth, each
row containing as many square metres as there are metres in the
length. Hence the number of square metres in the area of the figure
is equal to the product of the two numbers which indicate the length
and breadth; and A 0.21 is a numerical expression for its contents.
THE METRIC SYSTEM.
ILLUSTRATION SECOND.
In this figure, the lines drawn parallel to the sides divide the
figure into 36 mllliares, or oblongs, whose length is one metre and
breadth one decimetre. It is evident that ten of these oblongs put
together will constitute a centiare, or square metre. Hence the ex-
pression, 36 milliares, may be written 3.6 centiares; and read, three
and six tenths centiares, or three centiares and six milliares.
By reducing the length to decimetres, the numerical expression of
the contents will be, by Illustration First, 60 x 6, or 360 decimilliares
or square decimetres.

nations of units in expressing the contents of a given surface.
In the following analysis, each part of the contents is presented
separately, as it would be obtained by multiplying the length by the
breadth. The learner should carefully note each part, and analyze a
sufficient number of examples to fix the principles in the mind.

From these illustrations, wo derive the following rule for finding a
numerical expression for a given surface of uniform length and
breadth : —
RULE. Reduce the length and breadth to the same denomination;
find the product of the two dimensions after reduction, and point
off as many decimal places in this product as there are decimal
places in the two dimensions.
The unit of the numerical expression thus found will be a decimil-
liare when the unit of length is a decimetre, a centiare when the
unit of length is a metre, an are when the unit of length is a deca-
metre, a hectare when the unit of length is a hectometre, and a
myriare when the unit of length is a kilometre.

NUMERICAL EXPRESSION FOB VOLUME, OR SOLIDITY.
The solidity, or contents, of a volume is expressed numerically by
giving the number of times it contains some given solid as the unit
of volume.
The following illustrations.will show how the various denominations
of the table are used in numerical expressions of volume.
llillistere, or Cubic Decimetre.
10 millisteres, placed side by side, make a volume whose length
is one metre, and breadth and thickness each one decimetre, thus, —
Ceatistere = 10 Millisteres.
10 centistere, placed side by side, make a volume whose length
and breadth is each one metre, and thickness one decimetre, thus, —

Decistre = 10 Ccntisteres = 100 Millisteres.
10 decisteres, placed face to face, make a cube whose edge is one
metro, thus,—

Sterc = 10 Dccistercs = 100 Centistcres = 1000 Millisteres.
From these illustrations, it is evident that the contents of a cubic
metre may be expressed numerically, as S 1, tS 10,2S 100, 3S 1000.
THE METRIC SYSTEM.
Centiare.
Milliare.

The following figures illustrate the use of
the same four denominations in expressing
the contents of a cubic volume whose edge
is one metre and one decimetre. The sur-
face of one face of the volume contains
one centiare, two milliares, and one deci-
milliare, thus,—
Taking a slab of the face one decimetre thick, thus, —
and we have one decistere, two
centisteres, and one millistere.
But the volume is eleven deci-
metres thick; therefore we have
eleven such slabs, or eleven times one decistere, two centisteres, and
one millistere.
f 11 millisteres = 1 centistere and 1 millistere = S 0.011
= -< 22 centisteres = 2 decisteres and 2 centisteres = S 0.22
( 11 decisteres = 1 stere and 1 decistere — S 1.1
M 1.1 X M 1.1 X M 1.1 = S1.331
From these illustrations, we derive the following rule for finding a
numerical expression for a given volume of uniform length, breadth,
and thickness: —
ROLE. Reduce the length, breadth, and thickness -to the same
denomination ; find the product of the three dimensions, after re-
duction, and point off" as many decimal places in this product as
there are decimal places in the three dimensions.
The unit of the numerical expression thus found will be a millistere
when the unit of length is a decimetre, a stere when the unit of length
is a metre, a kilostere when the unit of length is a decametre.

MEASUREMENT OF ANGLES.
In the ordinary or sexagesimal system, a right-angle, which is used
as the measure of all plane angles, is divided into 90 equal parts,
called degrees; a degree is divided into GO equal parts, called
minutes; and a minute into CO equal parts, called seconds.
In the centesimal or French system, a right-angle is divided into
100 equal parts, called grades; a grade into 100 equal parts, called
minutes; and a minute into 100 equal parts, called seconds.
The former is called the sexagesimal system, on account of the
occurrence of the number sixty in forming the subdivisions of a de-
gree; and the latter centesimal, on account of the occurrence of the
number one hundred.
Grades, minutes, and seconds are usually written thus: 35s 42X
24 v; read, thirty-five grades, forty-two minutes, twenty-four seconds.
Since the scale is centesimal, minutes may be expressed as hun-
dredths, and seconds as ten-thousandths; hence any number of grades,
minutes, and seconds may be expressed decimally thus: 73* 4569;
read, seventy-three grades, forty-five minutes, sixty-nine seconds.
In a right-angle, there are 100 grades, or 90 degrees; hence, for
every 10 grades there are 9 degrees. Dividing the 10 grades into
9 equal parts or degrees, each part will contain 1^ grades; therefore
a degree s equal to 1L grades. Hence, in any number of grades
there are as many degrees as 1^ is contained times in the given
number of grades; and, conversely, in any number of degrees there
are l1 times as many grades as thero are degrees. Hence the fol-
lowing rules: —
TO CHANGE THE CENTESIMAL MEASURE TO THE SEXAGESIMAL.
Rule. Express the minutes and seconds as a decimal of a
grade/ divide by lig: the quotient will express the number of de-
grees and decimals of a degree in the given number of grades, min-
utes, and seconds.

TO CHANGE TIIE SEXAGESIMAL MEASURE TO THE CENTESIMAL.

gree; multiply the degrees and decimal of a degree by \\: the pro-
duct is the number of grades, minutes, and seconds in the given
