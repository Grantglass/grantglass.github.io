Robinson Crusoe.

WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of '
York, of a good family,- though not of that
country, my father being a forcignerof Bra.
men, who settled firlt at Hull: he gotagood
efiate by merchandise, and leaving of? his
' - trade,livedafterwardat York; from whence
he had married my mother, whose relations were named Rabin-
.mt, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was
called Robinson Kreutznaer; but by the usual corruption of
words in England, we are now called,- nay we call ourselves, and

write our name Crusoe; and {o my companions alwaysealled
me

I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieutenant-colonel
to an English regiment of Foot in Flanders, formerly commanded
.by the famous Colonel Lathe", and was killed at the battle
neu- Dunkirk against the Spaniardr. What became of my second '
brother I never knew, any more than my father or mother did
know what was become of me.

Being the third son of'the family, and not bred to any trade,
'my head began to .be_filled very early with rambling thoughts;
my father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent
share of learning, as far as house edueation, and a country free-
school generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I Would
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination
to this led me so strongly against the will, nay the commands of
my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something
fatal in that propension of nature tending directly to the life of
misery which was to befal me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and ex-
cellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined
by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this
subject: he asked me what reasons more than a mere wandering
inclination I had for leaving my father's house and my native
country, where I might be well introduced, and had a pros-
pect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with
a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was for men of des-
perate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring superior fortunes on
the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprize,
and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of
the common road; that these things were all either too far above
me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or
what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had
found by long experience was the best state in the world, the
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and
hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic partof man-
kind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might judge
of the happiness of this state, by this one thing, viz. That this
was the state of life which all other people envied; that Kings
have frequently lamented the miserable consequences of being born
to great things, and wish they had been placed in the middleofor Rommox Canton. 7

thetwo exaemes,betweenthemean and the greet; thatthe
wisemangavehistestimonyto this, as thejuststandardoftrue
felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty or riches.

He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the cala-
mities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of
mankind; but that the middle station had the fewat disasters,
and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or
lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected toso many
distempers and uneasinesses either of body or mind, as those were,
who by vicious living, luxury, and exu-avagancies on one hand,
or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insuficient
diet on the other hand, bring distempers upon themselves by the
natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle sta-
tion of life was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind of
enjoymenes ; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle
fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society,
all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the bless
ings attending the middle station of life; that thisway men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of
it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head,

-not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with
perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the
body of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret
burning lust of ambition for great things; but in easy circum-
stances sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the
sweets of living, without the bitter, feeling that they are happy,
and learning by every day's experience to know it more sensibly.

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most afliectionate
manner, not to play the young man, not to precipitate myself
into miseries which nature and the station of life I was born in
scemedtohaveprovidedagainst; thathasundernoneeeesityof
seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and endavour
to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had been just-8 LIFE AND Aevxn'runns

recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy
in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder
it, and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus
discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he
knew would be to my hurt: in a word, thatas he would do very
kind thing's for me if I would stay and settle at home as he di-
rected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes,
as to give me any encouragement to go away: and to close all,
he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he
had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going
into the low c01mtry wars, but could not prevail, his young de-
sires prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed;
and though he said he would not cease to pray- for me, yet he
would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step,
Goo would not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be
none to assist in my recovery.

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly
prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so
himself; I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plen--
tifully, and especially when he spoke of my brother who was
killed; and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke ofl' the
discourse, and told me, his heart was so full, he could say no
more to me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who could
be otherwise; and I resolved not to think of going abroad any
more, but to settle at home according to my father's desire. But
alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of
my father's further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved
to run quite away from him. However, I did not act so hastily
neither as my first heat of resolution prompted, but I took my
mother, at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than or.' or Ronmson Cnuson; 9

dinary, and told her, that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon
seeing the world, that I should never settle to any thing with
resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had bet-
ter give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I
was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice
to atrade, or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, ifI did, I
should never serve out my time, and I should certainly run away
from my master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if
she would speak to my father to. let me go but one voyage abroad,
if I came home again and did not like it, I would go no more,
and I would promise by a double diligence to recover that time
I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion: she told me, she
knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any
\ such subject; that he knew too well what was my interest to
' give his consent to any thing so much for my hurt, and that she
ewondered how I could think of any such thing after such a dis.
3course as I had had with my father, and such kind and tender
2impressions as she knew my father had used to me , and that m
.' short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I
1 might depend I should never have their consent to it; that for
her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction;
and I should never have it to say, that my mother was willing
' when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as
I have heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him, and
that my father, after shewing a great concern at it, said to her
with a sig , " That boy might be happy if he would stay at
home, but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch
that was ever born; I can give no consent to it."

and mother about their being so positively determined against
what they knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being one
day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any purpose of
making an elopement that time; but I say, being there, and one
of my companions being going by sea to London, in his father's
ship, and prompting me to go with them, with the common
allurement of seafaring men, viz. That it should cost me nothing
for my passage, I consulted neither father or mother any more,
not so much as sent them word of it: but leaving them to hear
of it as they might, without asking Goo's blessing, or my father's,
without any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and
in an ill hour, GOD knows, on the first of September 165 x, I
went on board a ship bound for London: never any young ad-
venturer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued
longer than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out of the
Plumber, but the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a
most frightful manner; and as I had never been at sea before, I
was most inexpreesibly sick in body, and terrified in mind: I
began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how
justly I was overtaken by thejudgement of Heaven for my wicked
leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty; all the
good counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my mother's
entreaties came now fresh into my mind, and my conscience,
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has
been since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the
breach of my duty to G00 and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had
"never been upon before, went very high, though nothing like
what I have seen many times since; no, nor like what I saw a
few days after: but it was enough to affect me then, who was but
a young sailor, and had never known any thing of the mtter._ I
expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every
'time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow ofor Rosmsou Carlson." 1 I

the sea, we should never rise more; and in this agony ofmind
I made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please Goo
here to spare my life this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot
upon dry land again I would go directly home to my father, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take

his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any
more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about
the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably he had
lived all his days, and never had been exposedto tempesls at sea,
or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like a true
repenting prodigal, go home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the
storm continued, and indwd some time after; but the next day
thewindwasabated and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little
inured to it: however I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared

a; up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening fol-
SS lowed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next
9. morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the
sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the mostde--
lightful that ever I saw

I had slept well in the night, and was, now no more sea-sick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the see that was so
rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so
pleasant in so little time after. And now, lest my good resolu--
tions should continue, my companion who had indeed inticed me
away, comes to me, WEI], Bob, says he, (clapping me upon the
shoulder,) how do you do after it .P I warrant you were fiighted,

forget all that: do yau see what charming weather it i: flow?
To make short this sad part of my story, we went the old way
of all sailors; the punch was made, and I was made drunk with
it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my repen-
tance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, and all my reso-
lutions for my future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its
smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of
that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears
and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being for-
gotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I entirely
forgot the vows and promises that I made in my dishes. I
found indeed some intervals of reflection, and the serious thoughts
did, as it were, endeavoar to return again sometimes, but I shook
them 09', and reused myself from them as it were from a dis-
temper, and applying myself to drink and company, soon mas-
tered the return of those fits, for so I called them, and I had in
five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any
young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could'de-
sire. But I was to have another trial. for it still; and Provi-
dence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me
entirely without excuse. For if I would not take this for a deli-
verance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most
hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and
the mercy.

The sixth day of our being at see we eune into Tomcat]:
Roads; the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm,
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were
obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind eon-
tinuing contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight dayS, dur-
ing which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into
the same roads, as the common harbour where the ships might
wait for a wind for the river.
We had not however rid here so long, but should have tided
it up the river,but that thewindblewtoofresh; andafierwe
had lain four or five days, blew very hard. However the roads
being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and
our ground-tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and
not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest
and mirth, after the manner ofthe see; but the eighth dayin
the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work
to strike our top-masts, and make every thing snug and close,
that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the su
went very high indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped
several sets, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor; so
, that we rode with two anchors a-head, and the cables veered out
to the better end. '

Bythis time it blewa terrible storm indeed; andnowae-
gan to see terror and amazement in_the faces even ofthe seamen
emselvec. The master, though vigilant in the business of pre-
' the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me,
could hear him softly to himself say several times, Lord, be
exful to as, we shall be all last, we shall be all undone ; and
; thelike. Duringthese first hurries,Iwasstupid,lying stillin
' my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my
temper: I could ill re-assume the first penitence which I'hadso
apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself against : I thought
the bitterness ofdeath had been past, andthatthiswouldbe
nothing, like the first. But when the master himselfeame by
me,aslsaidjustnow,andsaidweshouldbeall lost,lwas
fi-ighted;1gotupoutofmymbin,andlookedout;
utsucha dismalsight I neversaw: theseawentmonntaim

diatridmrus,wefomd,hadcutthehmbythe
board, being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a ship
which rid about a mile a--head of us was foundered. Two more
ships being driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads
to sea at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The
light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea;
but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running
away with only their spritsail out before the wind.

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master
of our ship to let them cut away the fore--mast, which he was
very unwilling to do: but the boatswain protesting to him, that
if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented; and when
they had cut away the fore-mast, the main~mast stood so loose,
and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her away
also, and make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this,
who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright
before at but a little. But if I can express at this distance the
thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more
horror of mind upon account of my former convictions, and the
having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly
taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added to the
terror of the storm, put me into such a condition, that I can by
no words describe it. But the worst was not come yet: the
storm continued with such fury, that the seamen themselves
acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had a good
ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the
seamen every now and then cried out, she would founder. It
was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they
meant by founder, till I enquired. However, the storm was so
violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the master, the boat-
swain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their
prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship would go to
the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest
of our discusses, one of the men that had been down on purpose
to we, cried out, we had sprung a leak; another said there was
four foot water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the
pump. At that very word my heart, as I thought, died within
me, and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed where I sat,
- into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me,
that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to
' pump as another: at which I stirred up, and went to the pump
and worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master
1 seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm,
{ were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would not come
3 near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I who
" knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought
3; the ship had broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a
word, I was so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this
>> was a time when every body had his own life to think of, nobody
minded me, or what was become of me; but another man stepped
up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie,
ihinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came
to myself.
We Worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it was
gapparent that the ship would founder; and though the storm
began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she could swim
fill we might run into a port, so the master continued firing guns
_ for help; and a light ship who had rid it out just a-head of us,
' ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard
' the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get on
' board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side; til] at last, the
men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours,
' our men east them a rope over the stem with the buoy to it, and
' en veered it out a great length, which they after great labour and
hazard teak hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern
' d got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us
after we were in the boat to think of reaching to their own ship,
so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
share as much as we could, and our master promised them, that
if the boat was staved upon shore he would make it good to their
master: so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away
to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as
Milkmen-Mm.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our
ship before we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first
time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea; I must
acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told
me-she was sinking; for from that moment they rather put me
into the boat than that I might be said to go in: my heart was
as it were dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror
of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the
oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when our
- boat mounting the waves we were able to see the shore) a great
many people running along the shore to assist us when we should
come near, but we made but slow way towards the shore, nor
were we able to reach the shore, till being past the light--house at
W'interton, the shore falls off to the westward towards Cram,
and so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind: here
we got in, and, though not without much difficulty, got all safe
on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Tarmutlz, where, as
unfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by
the magistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as
by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as
we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hall, and have
gone home, I had been happy, and my father, an emblem of our
blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me;
for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in Tarmuth
Road, it wasagreatwhile before he had any assurance that Iwas
not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud ealls
from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home,
yet I had no power to do it. I know not what to eall this, nor
willIurgethatitisasecretoverrulingdecreethathurr-iesuson
to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it be
before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open. Cer-
tainly nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery attend-
ing, and which it was impossible for me to weape, could have
pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions
of my most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instruc-
tionsaslhadmetwithinmyfirstattempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who
was the master's son, was now less forward than I; the first time
he spoke to me after we were at Tarmuth, which was not till

; two or three days, for we were separated in the town to several
quarters; I say, the first fime he saw me, it appeared his tone
was altered; and looking very melancholy, and shaking his head,-
askcd me how I did, and telling his father who I m, and how
I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther
abroad; hisfathertumingtomewithavery graveand concerned
tone, Young M, says he, you ought never to go to .rea any more ;
you ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not
to he a seafaring man. Why, Sir, said I, will you go. to sea no
more? That 1': another care, said he, it i: In} calling, and therefore
my duty,- hut a: you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a
taste Heaven ha: givenyou of what you are to expect if you persist ;
perhap: this i: all hefallen u: on your account, like Jonah in the
31112 of Tarshish. Pray, continued he, what are you! and on
what account didjougo to no .3. Upon that I told him some ofr8 LII-'2 AND onzx'runss

my story; at the end of which he burst out With a strange kind
of passion; What had I done, says he, that such an unhappy
wretch should come into my ship! I would not set my foot in
the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds. This in-
deed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which Were yet
agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could
have authority to go. However he afterwards talked very
gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my father and not
tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a visible
hand of Heaven against me; And, young man, said he, depend
upon it ifyou do not go hack, wherever you go, you will meet with
nothing hut dinner: and disappointments, till your father's word:
are fulfilled upon you.

We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I
saw him no more; which way he went, I know not. As for me,
having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land;
and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles with my-
self, what course of life I should take, and whether I should go
home, or go to sat. \

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that
oEered to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how
I should be laughed at among the neighbours, and should be
ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even every
body else; from whence I have since often observed, how incon-
gruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is, especially
of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in such
cases, viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed
to repent; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly
to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them be esteemed- wise men. '

In this state of life hOWever I remained some time, uncertain
what measures to take, and what course of life- In. lad. An
irresistible reluctance continued to. going home; and a: I stayed
awhile, the remembrance ofthedistress I hadbeeninworeofl";
andasthatabated, the littlemotionlhad in mydeairestoa
return wore of with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts
of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That evil influence which earried me first away from my
father's house, that hurried me into the wild and indigmd
notion of raising my fortune; and that imprest those conceits so
forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to
the entreatics and even the command of my father: I say, the
same influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate
ofallenterprisestomyview;andl went onboardaveasel
bound to the coast of Africa ,- or, as our sailors vulgarly eall it,
a voyage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did
not ship myself as a. sailor; whereby though I might indwd have
worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had
learned the duty and oliice of a fore-mast man; and in time
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a
master. But as it was always my fate to choose for the worse,
so I did here; for having money in my pocket, and good clothes
upon my back, I would always go on board in the habit of a
gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the ship, or
learned to do any.

Itwasmy lotfirfi ofalltofallinto prettygoodcompanyian--
do>>, which does not always happen to such loose and unguided
young fellows as I then was ; the devil generally not omitting to lay
some snare for them very early: but it was not so with me. I
first fell acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on
thecoast of Guinea,- and who having had very good success

should be his messmate and his companion, and if I could carry
any thing with me, I should have all the advantage of it that
the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.

I embraced the offer, and entering into a strict friendship with
this captain, who was an honest and plain--dealing man, I went
the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure with me,
which by the disinterested honesty of my friend, the Captain, I
increased very considerably; for I carried about 401. in such toys
and trifles as the Captain directed me to buy. This 401. I had
mustered together by the assistance of some of my relafions
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my father,
or at least, my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first
adventure.

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in
all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty
of my friend the Captain, under whom also I got a competent
knowledge of the mathematics, and the rules of navigation,
learned how to keep an account of the ship' s course, take an ob-
servation, and, in short, to understand some things that were
needful to be understood by a sailor; for, as he took delight to
instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage
made me both a sailor and a merchant: for I brought home 5
pounds 9 ounces of gold dust for my adventure, which yielded
me in London at my return, almost 3001,. and this filled me with
those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin,

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particu~
larly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent
calenture by the excessive heat of the climate; our principal
trading being upon the coast, from the latitude of I 5 degrees
north even to the line itself.

I was now set up for in Guinea trader; and my friend, to my
great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
  
 
   
 
   
 
   
   
  

the same voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with
one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now got
the command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that
ever man made; for though I did not carry quite 1001. of my-
new gained wealth, so that I had zoo]. left, and which I lodged
with my fi'iend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into
terrible misfortuncs in this voyage; and the first was this, 'viz.
Our ship making her course towards the Cam Islands, or-
rather between those islands and the African shore, was surpriwd
in the grey of the morning, by a Turkish rover of Seller, who
gave chase to us with all the sail she could make. We crowded
also as much canvass as our yards would spread, or our masts
carry, to have got clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us;
and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we pro-
' pared to fight; our ship having 12 guns, and the rogue :8.
About three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing
' to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our
stern, as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on
that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which made him
sheer ofl' again, after returning our fire, and pouring in also his
small shot from near 200 men which he had on board. How-
_ ever, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping close. He
repared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but
flying us on board the next time upon our other quarter, he
tered 60 men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting
d hacking the decks and rigging. We plied them with small
hot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our
eck of them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy
of our story, our ship being disabled, and three of our men
'led, and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were
'ed all prisoners into Sella, a port belonging to the Moors.

Theusagelhadtherewasnotsodreadful asatfirstlappre-
norwas I carried up the country to the emperor's court,
as therestofour menwere, butwas keptbythecaptainofthe
rover, as his proper prize, and made his slave, being young and
nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising change of my
circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was per-
fectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable, and have
none to relieve me, which I thought m now so efi'eetually brought
to pass, thatI could not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven
had overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption. But
alas! thiswas butatasteofthemisery Iwas togothrough,as
will appear in the sequel of the story.

As my new patron or master had taken me home to his house,
so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went
to sea again, believing that it would some time or other be his
fate to be taken by a Spanirh or Portugal man of war: and that
then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was soon
taken away; for when he went to sea, he left me on shore to
look after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves
about his house; and when he came home again from his cruise,
he ordered me to lie m the cabin to look after the ship.

Here I mediated nothing but my escape; and what method
I might take to effect it; but found no way that had the least
probability in it: nothing presented to make the supposition of
it rational; for I had nobody to communicate it to, that would
embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or
Scotchman, there but myself; so that for two years, though I
often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had the
least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.

After about two years an odd circumstance presented itself,
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my li-
berty again in my head: my patron lying at home longer than
usual, without fitting out his ship, which, as I hard, was for
want of money, he used constantly, once or twice a week, some-
times oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnaee,
andgooutintotheroadafishing; andashealwaystook me
andayounngeuowithhimtorowthe boat,we madehim
very merry, and I proved very dexmrous in eatching fish; inso-
much that sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one of his
kinsmen, and the youth, the Alanna as they called him, to catch
a dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm
morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a
league from the shore, we lost sight of It; and rowing we knew
not whither or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next
night, and when the morning came we found we had pulled off
osea insteadofpulling m for the shore; andthatwewereat
east two leagues from the shore: however we got well in again,
ugh with a gut deal of labour, and some danger; for the
' d began to blow pretty fresh m the morning , but particularly '
' e were all very hungry.

, But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more
ofhimselffor thefuture; and having lying byhim thelong
t of our English ship he had taken, he resolved he would not

' o a fishing any more without a compass and some provision;
he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also was an Englirl:
ave, to build a little state-room or cabin in the middle of the
ng-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to
and hale home the main-sheet; and room before for a hand '
rtwotostandandworkthesails; shesailedwithwhatweeall
shoulder of mutton sail; and the boom gibed over the top of
e cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for
'm to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some
loakers to put in some bottles'of such liquor as he thought
t to drink; particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.
Wewentfrequently outwiththis boatafishing,andaslwas
ostdexmrous to catch fish for him, he never went without me.
It happened that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either
for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moor: of some distinc-
tion in that place, and for whom he had provided emu-aordinarily;
and had therefore sent on board the boat over night a larger store
of provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me to get ready
three fusees with powder and shot, which were on board his
ship; for that they designed some sport of fowling, as well as
fishing.

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next
morning with the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants
out, and every thing to accommodate his guests; when by and
by my patron came on board alone, and told me his guests had
put of? going, upon some business that fell out, and ordered me
with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and
catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house;
and commanded that as soon as I got some fish I should bring it
home to his house; all which I prepared to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my
thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship at my
command; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish
myself, not for a fishing business, but for a voyage; though I
knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I should
steer; for any where to get out of that place was my way.

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this
Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for I told
him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread; he said,
that was true ;- so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit
of their kind, and three jars with fresh water into the boat. I
knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was evi--
dent by the make were taken out of some English prize; and I
conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if
they had been there before for our master; I conveyed also a
great lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed above half

as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by sur-
prise with my arm under his twist, and tossed him clear over-
board into the see. He rose immediately, for he swam like a
cork, and calling to me, begged to be taken in, told me he would
go all over the world with me; he swam so strong after the boat
that he would have reached me very quickly, there being but
little wind; upon which I stept into the cabin, and fetching one
of the fowling pieces, I presented it at him, and told him, I had
done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him
none: but, said I, you swim well enough to reach to the shore,
and the sea is calm, make the best of your way to shore, and I
will do you no harm, but if you come near the boat I'll shoot
you through the head; for I am resolved to have my liberty:
so he turned himself about and swam for the shore, and I make
no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent
swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moar with me,
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust
him. When he was gone I turned to the boy, who they called
X10), and said to him, Xuty, if you will be faithful to me I'll
make you a great man, but if you will not stroke your face to
be true to me, that it, swear by Mahomet and hi: father's beard,
I must throw you into the sea too: the boy smiled in my face,
and spoke so innocently that I could not mistrust him; and
swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood
out directly to sea with the boat, rather su'etching to windward,
that they might think me gone towards the Strait: mouth (as
indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been sup-
posed to do), for who would have supposed we were sailed on to
the southward to the truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations
of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes, and de-
stroy us; where we could never once go on shore but we shouldor ROBINSON Cnusos. ' 27

be devoured by savage ',beasts or more merciless savages of
human kind.

Butassoon as itgrewdusk intheevening,Ichangedmy
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my course
.a little toward the east, that I- might keep in with the shore; and
having a fair fresh gale: of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I made
such sail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the
afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not be less_than
I 50 miles south of Selle: ; quite beyond the emperor of Morotto':
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we saw
no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the
dreadful apprehensions I had of fallinginto their hands, that I
would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor. V The
wind continuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five days,
and then the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would
now give over;'so I ventured to make to the coast, and came to
an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what, or
where; neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what
river: I neither saw, or desired to see any people, the principal
thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the
evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and
discover the country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard
such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was
ready to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till
day. Well, X140, said I, then I won't, but it may be we may
seemen byday, whowill beas bad to usas'thoselions. Then
we give them the shoot gun, says X107, laughing; who than not
We]. Such Englirh me spoke by conversing among usslavea
However I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gavehim
a dram (out of our patron's ease of bottles) to cheer him up:
after all me': advicewasgood, andItookit;wedropped our
little anchor and lay still all night; I say still, for we slept none;
for intwoorthreehourswe sawvast great creatures(we knew
not what to eall them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-
shore and run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves
for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they made such
hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the
like.

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but
we were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty
creatures come swimming towards our boat: we could not see
him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous
huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and it might
be so for aught I know; but poor X107 cried to me to weigh
the anchor and row away. No, says I, Xury, we ean slip our
cable with a buoy to it and go of? to sea, they eannot follow us
far. I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (what-
ever it was) within two oars length, which something surprised
me; however I immediately stept to the eabin--door, and taking
up my gun fired at him, upon which he immediately turned
about, and swam towards the shore again.

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hide-
ous cries and howlings, that were raised, as well upon the edge
of the shore, as higher within the country, upon the noise or
report of the gun; a thing I have some reason to believe those
creatures had never heard before: this convinced me that there
was no going on shore for us in the night upon that coast, and
how to venture on shore in the day was another question mo;
for to have fallen into die hands of any of the savages, had been
asbadastohavefallenintothehandsoflionsandfigers; at
last we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some--
where or other for water, for'we had not a pint left in the boat;

carrying nothing but our arms, and twojars for water.

no instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we
were in, and did not exactly know, or at least remember, what
latitude they were in, I. knew not where to look for them, or
when to stand 011' to sea towards them; otherwise I might now
easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was, that
if I stood along this coast till I came to that part where the
English traded, I should find some of their vessels Upon their
usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was,
must be that country, which lying between the emperor of
Morotto': dominions and the Negroer, lies waste, and uninhabited,
except by wild beasts, the Negroes having abandoned it, and
gone farther south for fear of the Moors; and the War: not
thinking it Worth inhabiting, by reason of its banennss; and
indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of
tigers, lions,-leopa.rds, and other furious creatures which harbour
there; so that the Moar: use it for their hunting only, where
they go like an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and
indeed for near an hundred miles together upon this coast, we
saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country by day; and heard
nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night.

Once or twice in the day-time I thought I saw the Pica of
Tenn-1ft, being the high top of the mountain Team]? in the
Canaries; and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of
reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in again by
contrary Winds, the sea also going too high for my little vessel,
so I resolved to pursue my first design and keep along the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water after we
had left this place; and once in particular, being early in the '
morning, we came to an anchor under a little point of land which :'
Was pretty high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to
go farther in. Katy, whose eyes were more about him than it
seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that we had
best go farther of the shore; for, says he, look yonder lies a
dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep. I looked
where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was
a terrible great lion that lay on the side 'of the shore, under the
shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over him.
Xury, says I, you shall go on shore and kill him: Xury looked
frighted, and said, Me kill ! he eat me at our mouth; one
mouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but
bade him lie still ; and took our biggest gun, which was almost
, musquet--bore, and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and
with two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with
two bullets; and the third, for we had three pieces, I loaded
, with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with the
first piece, to have shot him into the head, but he lay so with
, his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg
, about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up growling
at first, but finding his leg broke fell down again, and then got
up upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I
heard. Iwasalittlesurprised thatIhadnothithimonthe
head; however, I took up the second piece immediately, and
though he began to move off, fired again, and shot him into the
head, and had the pleasure to we him drop, and make but little
noise, but lay struggling for life. Then X107 took heart, and
Would have me let him go on shore. Well, go, said I. So the
boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand,
swam to shore with the other hand, and coming close to the
creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him
into the head again, which dispatched him quite.
Thiswasgarneindeedtous,butthiswasnofood: andeas

hi: head, said he. However, X107 could not cut off his head,-
but he cut ofl" a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a.
monstrous great one.

I bethought myself however, that perhaps the skin of him
might one way or other be of some value to us; and I resolved
to take ofl" his skin, if I could. So X107 and I went to work
with him; but Xary wasmuch thebetterworkman atit, furl
knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole
day; but at last we got off the hide of him, and spreading it. on
the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days time,
and it afterwards served me to lie upon.

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for
ten or twelve days, living very sparing on our provisions, which
began to abate very much, and going no oftener into the shore
than we were obliged to for freshwater: .my design in this was,
to make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any. where
about the Cape o1: Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some
European ship ;: and if I did not, I knew not what course I had
to take, but to seek for the Islands, or perish there among the
Negro". I knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea or to Bran'l, or to the East India,
made this Cape, or those Islands; and, in a word, I put the
whole of my fortune upon this single point, either that I must
meet with some ship, or must perish.

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as
Ihavesaid,Ibeganto seethatthelandwasinhabited; andin
two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon
the shore to look at us; we could also perceive they were quite
black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone on '
shore to them; but X10) was my better counsellor, and said to SS
me, No go, no go: however I hauled in nearer the shore that I '
mighttalktothem, andlfoundtheyranalongtheshorebyme
agoodway.. I observed they had nowapons intheirhands,
except one, who had along slender stick, which X107 said was
alance,andthatfiieywouldthrowthemagreatwaywithgood
aim. Solkeptatadistance,buttalkedwiththem bysigmas
well as I could; and particularly made signs for something to
eat: they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch
me some meat; upon this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay
by, and two of them ran up into the counn'y, and in less than
half an hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of
dry flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their country;
but we neither knew what the one nor the other was: however,
we were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next
dispute, for l was not for venturing on shore to them, and they
were as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us all,
for they brought it to the shore and laid it dowu, and went and
stoodagreatwayofl'tillwefetched iton board,and thencame
close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothingtomake
them amends; but an opportunity ofl'ered that very instant to
oblige them wonderfully; for while we were lying by the shore,
came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took
it) with great fury, from the mountains towards the sea: whe-
ther it was the male pursuing the female, or whether they were
in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could
tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the lat-
ter; because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom
appear but in the night; and in the second place, we found the
people terribly frighted, especially the women. The man that
had the lance or dart did not fly from them, but the rest did;
however, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, they

loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load
both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I
fired, and shot him directly into the head. Immediately he sunk
down into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and
down as if he was struggling for life; and so indeed he was: he
immediately made to the shore, but between the wound, which
was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just
before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and the fire of my gun; some of them
were even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the
very terror. But when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in
the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart and eame to the shore, and began to search for
the creature. I found him by his blood staining the water; and
by the help of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the
Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it
was a most curious leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable
degree, and the Negroes held up their hands with admiration to
think what it was I had killed him with.

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the
noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the
mountains from whence they eame, nor could I at that distance
know what it was. I found quickly the Negrae: were for eating
the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it
as a favour from me, which when I made signs to them that they
might take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately they
fell to work with him, and though they had no knife, yet with a
sharpened piece of wood they took of his skin as readily, and
much more readily, than we could have done with a knife : they
offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I
would give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they
gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their.0? Rosmso'rr .Ca-vson.' 35

provision, which though I did notunderstand, yet I accepted;
then I made signs to them for some water, and held out one of
myjars to them, turning it bottom upward, to shew timtitwas

brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in
the sun; this they set down for me, as before, and I sent Xx!)
on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The women
were as stark naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and
water: and, leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for
about eleven days more, without ofl'ering to go near the shore,
tilllsawthelandrun outagreat length into theaea,atahout
the distance of four or five leagues before me; and, the sea being
very calm, I kept a large ofling to make this point: at length,
doubling the point at about two leagues from the land, I saw
plainly land on the other side to seaward; then I concluded, as
it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and
those the blade, called from thence Capede Vet-d 131M. How-
ever, they were at a great distance, and I could not well tell what
Ihadbesttodo, foriflshouldbetakenwithafreahofwindl
might neither reach one nor the other.

_ In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stept into the eabin
and set me down, X10) having the helm, when on a sudden the
boy cried out, Meter, master, a ship with a sail ! and the
foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must nwds
be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we
were gotten far enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the
mbin, and immediatelysaw not only the ship, but what she was,
(viz) that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound
to the coast of Guinea for Negroes. But when I observed the
courseshesteered, I was soon convincedthey were bourids'ome
Qflwway,anddid not design wcomeanymmtotheshore;
upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving
to speak with them if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be gone by before I
could make any signal to them. But after I had crowded to the
utmost, and began to despair; they, it seems, saw me by the
help of their perspective-glasses, and that it was some European
boat, which, as they supposed, must belong to some ship that
was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was en-
couraged with this, and as I had my patron's ancient on board,
I made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and fired a
gun, both which they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they very
kindly brought-to, and lay-by for me, and in about three hours
time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French; but I understood none of them; but at last a
Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my
goods.

It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one Would believe,
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a misera--
ble and almost hopeless condition as I was in, and immediately
offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return for my
deliverance; but he generously told me, he would take nothing
from me, but that all I had should be delivered safe to me when
I came to the Brasils ; for, says he, I have saved your life on no
other terms than I would he glad to he saved myself ,- and it may
one time or other he my lot to he taken up in the same condition:
Besides, said he, when I any you to the Brasils, so great a too}
from your own country, if I should take from you what you have,-
you will he .rtorved there, and then I only take away that life I
have given. No, no, Seignior Ingleee, says he, M. Englishman,
I will carry you thither in charity, and those things will help you to
buy your subsistence there, and your passage home again.

As he was charitable in his propod, so he was just in the
performance to a tittle, for he ordered the seamen, that none
should offer to touch any thing Ihad; then he took every thing
into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of
them, that I might have them; even so much as my three
earthen' Jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and
told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and asked me
what I would have for it? I told him, he had been so generous
to me in every thing, that I could not offer to make any price
of the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which he told me he
would give me a note of his hand to pay me 80 pieces of eight
for it at Brasil; and when it me there, if any one offered to '
give more, he would make it up; he offered me also 60 pieces
of eight more for my boy X1177, which I was loth to take; not
that I was not willing to let the captain have him, but I wasvery
loth to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so faith-
fully in procuring my own. However, when I let him know
my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium,
that he would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten
years, if he turned Christian. Upon this, and Katy saying he
waswillingtogotohim,lletthemptainhavehim.

We had a very good voyage to the Brasilr, and arrived in the
Boy de Todo: lo: Santos, or All-- Saints-Bay, in about twenty-two
days after. And now I was once more delivered from the most
miserable of all conditions of life, and what to do next with my-
self I was now to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never
enough remember; he would take nothing of me for my pamge, '
gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the
lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused every thing I
had in the ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was
willing to sell he bought, such as the case of bottles, two of my
guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I had made can-
dles of the rest; in a word, I made about 220 pieces of eight of
all my cargo, and with this stock I went on shore in the Brasilr.

I had not been long here, but being mommended tothe house
of a good honest man like himself, who had an Ingenio as they
call it; that is, a plantation and a sugar house, I lived with him
some time, and acquainted myself by that means with the man-
ner of their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how well '
the planters lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved, .
if I could get license to settle there, I would turn planter among :
them, resolving in the mean time to find out some way to get
my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me. To '
this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I pur- '
chased as much land that was uncured as my money would reach,
and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement, and such a
one as might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to my- -
self to receive from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of Eng-
lirlz parents, whose name was Walk, and in much such circum-
stances as I was. I call him neighbour, because his plantation
lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably together. My
stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather planted for
food, than any thing else, for about two years. However, we
began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so
that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of .
us a large piece of ground ready for planting mes in the year
to come; but we both wanted help; and now I found, more
than before, I had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.

But alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no
great wonder: I had no remedybut to goon; Iwasgotteninto
an employment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary
to the life I delighted 1n, and for which I forsook my father's
house,an and broke through all his good advice; nay, I was com-
ing into the very middle station, or upper degree of low life,
which my father advised me to before; and which if I resolved
to go on with, I might as well have staid at home, and never
have fatigued myself in the world as I had done: and I used
often to say to myself, I could have done this as well in England
among my friends, as have gone five thousand miles of to do it,
among strangers and savages in a wilderness, and at such dis-
tance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the
least knowledge of me.

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbour: no work to be done, but by the labour of
myhands; andIusedtosay,Ilivedjustlikcaman east away
upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but himself.
But how just has it been, and how should all men reflect, that,
when they compare their present conditions with others that are
worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be
convinced of their former felicity, by their experience; I say
how just has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in
an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who had so often
unjustly compared it with the life which I then led, in which,
had I continued, I had in all probability been exceeding prospeh
rous and rich.

I was in some degree settled m my measures for earrying on
e plantation, before my kind friend the mptain of the ship,
thattook me up atsea, wentback; for the ship remainedtherc,
in providing his loading, and preparing for his voyage, near three
months; whentellinghimwhat littlestocklhadleftbehindmein
W0", he gave me this friendly and sincere advice: Seigmr Isglm,
so]: lie, (for so he always mlled me) if you will give me letters,
and a procuration here in form to me, with orders to the person
who has your money in London, to send your effects to Lisbon,
to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are proper I
for this country, I will bring you the produce of them, GodI
willing, at my return; but since human affairs are all subject to
changes and disasters, I would have you give orders but for one
hundred pounds sterling, which you say is half your stock, andI
let the hazard be run for the first; so that if it come safe, you
may order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry, you may I
have the other half to have recourse to for your supply. I

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I
could not but be convinced it was the best course I could mke- , I
so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I
I had left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese cap--' :
min, as he desired. '

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my
adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the
Portugal captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what
condition I was now in, with all other necessary directions for
my supply; and when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he '
found means, by some of the English merchants there, to send
over, not the order only, but a. full account of my story, to a .
merchant at London, who represented it effectually to her; where- I
upon, she not only delivered the money, but out of her own
pocket sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present for
his humanity and charity to me.

The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in ,
Englirlz goods, such as the mptain had written for, sent them I
directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to 1
the Brasilr; among which, without my direction, (for Iwas too
young in my business to think of them) he had taken care to
have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my
plantation, and which were of great use to me.
Whmthismrgoarfivedlthoughtmyformnenudeforl
wassurprisedwimjoyofit; and mygood steward the captain
had laid out the live pounds which my fi-iend had sent him for a
present for himself, to purchase, and bring me over a servant
under bond for six years service, and would not accept of any
consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would have him
accept, being of my own produce.

Neither was this all; but my goods being all English manu-
factures, such as cloth, stufi's, baize, and things particularly
valuable and desirable-inthecountry, I found means to sellthem
maverygreatadvanage,sothatlmaysayl hadmoredian
four times the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely
beyond'my poor neighbour, I mean in the advancement of my
plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave,
and an European servant also; I mean another besides that which
the captain brought me from Lisbon.

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our gram adversity, so was it with me. I went'on the next
yearwithgratsucceasinmyplantation; I raisedfifty great rolls
oftobaccoonmyownground,morethanl haddisposedoffor
necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty rolls, being
each of above an hundred weight, were well aired and laid by

inbusinessmdinwealth, myhead began to befull ofprqiects
and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are indeed often
theruinofthebestheadsinbusinees.

Hadl continued inthestation Iwas now in,Ihadroomfor

inclination in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects and those
measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred to pre~
sent me with, and to make my duty.

As I had done thus in breaking away from my parents, so I
could not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy
view I had of being a rich and thriving man in my new planta-
tion, only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself
down again into the deepest gulph of human misery that ever
man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state
of health in the world.

To come then by the just degrees to the particulars of this
part of my story; you may suppose, that having now lived
almost four years in the Brasil:, and beginning to thrive and
prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned
the language, but had contracted acquaintance and friendship
among my fellow planters, as well as among the merchants at St.
Salvadore, which was our port; and that in my discourses among
them, I had frequently given them an account of my two
voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the
Negroe: there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast,
for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives, seissars, hatchets, bits of
glass, and the like, not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants
teeth, 65:. but Negroes for the service of the Brasile, in great
numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the buy-
ing Negroes, which was a trade at that time not only not far entered
into, but as far as it was, had been earried on by the Assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain and Partugal, and engrossed

4.2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
carriages were procured by my apparent obstinate 'adhering'to
in the public, so that few Negroes were bought, and those exces-
sive dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and told
me they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed
with them of the last night, and they came to make a secret pro--
posal to me ; and after enjoining me secrecy, they told me that they
had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all
plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much
as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried on,
because they could not publicly sell the Negroes when they came
home; so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the
Negroe: on shore privately, and divide them among their own'
plantations; and in a word, the question was, whether I_would
go their supereargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon
the coast of Guinea ,- and they offered me that I should have my
equal share of the Negroes, without providing any part of the
stock.

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been
made to any one that had not had a settlement and plantation of
his own tolook afier,whichwas inafairwayofcomingtobe
very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But for me,'
that was thus entered and established, and had nothing to do but
goon as I had begun, forthree or fouryears more,andtohave
sent for the other hundred pounds from England, and who in that
time, and with that little addition, could scarce have failed of
being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in-
creasing too; for me to think ofsuch avoyaggwas the most
preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances could be

Bm 1. that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more
mist the ofi'er,thanIeould restrain myfirstramblingdssigns,
when my father's good counsel was lost upon me. In a ward, I'
told them I would go with all my heart, if they would undertake
to look after my plantation in my absence, and would dispose of
ittosuchaslshoulddirectiflmiswfied. Thistheyall'
engaged to do, and entered into writings or covenants to do so;
and I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation and effects,
in case ofmydeath, making the captain of the ship that had'
saved my life as before, my universal heir, but obliging him to!
disposeofmyefi'ects as I had directedin mywill, one halfofa
the produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped to 1
England.

In short, I took all possible nation to preserve my effects, 1
and keep up my plantation; had I used halfas much prudence !
to have looked into my own interest, and have made ajudgment !
of what I ought to have done, and not to have done, I had cer-I i
tainly never gone away so from prosperous an undertaking, l
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and 1
gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards;
to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular misfor-- -:
tunes to myself. ~

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my
fancy rather than my reason: and accordingly the ship being
fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things done as by
agreement by my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour, the rst of September, being the same day eight years
that I went fi'om my father and mother at Hall, in order to act l
the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own interest. f

Our ship was about 120 ton burthen, carried 6 guns, and 14 1
men, besides the master, his boy, and myself; we had on board 1
no large argo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our
trade with the Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd
trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissars, hatchets,
and the like.

in those days. We had very good weather, only meesive hot,
all the way upon our own coast, till we came the height of Cape
St. Augustine ,- from whence keeping farther ofi" at see, we lost
sight of land, and steered as if we were bound {or the isle Fer-

about twelve days time, and were by our last observation in 7
degrees 22 min. northern latitude, when a violent tornado or
hurrimne took us quite out of our knowledge: it began from
the south-east, me about to the north-Wm, and then settled
into the north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible man--
ner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing but
drive; and seudding away before it, let it eerry us whither ever '
fate and the fury ofthe winds directed; and during these twelve
days, I need notsay that I expected-everydayto beswallowed
up, not indeed did any in the ship-expect to save their levee

In this distress, we had, beeides the terror of the .storm, one
of our men died of the mlenture, and one man .and the boy
washed overboard. About the twelfth day,tl1e weather aban'ng
alittle,themas'termadean observationaswellashecould,and
found that he was in about 11 degrees northlatitude, 1111ch
was 2.2 degrees oflongitude-differenee weet from Cape St. Augm-
tina; so that he found he was gotten upon the coast of Carina, or
the north part-of Brail,'beyond thexiver Wmowatd-that
of the river Oronaque, commonly nailed the Great River, and
began to consult with me what coursedzediould1ake,for.the
ship was leaky and verymuch d'sa'bled,md 'he was:going dirxtly
back to the coast of Brasil.

Iwasposifively aginstthat; and'lookingover the charts of
the sea--coast of America with him, we concluded there was no
inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we came within
the circle of the Caribbwirlandr, and therefore resolved to stand
away for Bareadoer, which by keeping of at sea, to avoid the
indraught of the bay or gulph of Mexico, we might easily per-
form, as we hoped, in about fifteen days sail; whereas we could
not possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some
assistance, both to our ship and to ourselves.

With this design we changed our course, and steered away
N. W. by W. in order to reach some of our English islands,
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise deter-
mined; for being in the latitude of 12 deg. 18. min. a second
storm came upon us, which carried us away with the same im-
petuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all
human commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as to the
sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than
ever returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our
men early in the morning cried out, Land ! and we had no sooner
run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts
in the world we were, but the ship struck upcn a sand, and in a
moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in
such a manner, that we expected we should all have perished im-
mediately; and we were immediately driven into our close quar-
ters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea.

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like con-
dition, to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such 1
circumstances: we knew nothing where we were, or upon what
land it was we were driven, whether an island or the main,
whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the rage of the wind
was still great, though rather less than at first, we could not so

much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes without
breaking in pieces, unless the winds by a kind of miracle should
immediately about. In a word, we sat looking one upon
other, and expecting death every moment, and every man
accordingly as preparing for another world, for there was
ittle or nothing more for us to do in this. that which was our
nt comfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that contrary to
ur expectation the ship did not break yet, and that the master
' the wind began to abate.

Now though we found that the wind did a little abate, yet the
ip having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for
to expect her getting oil", we were in a dreadful condition in-
eed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as
vell as we could. We had a boat at our stern, just before the
term, but she was first staved by dashing against the ship's rud--
er, and in the next place she broke away, and either sunk o'r
driven ofi'to sea, so there was no hope from her; we had
other boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was
doubtful thing: however, there was no room to debate, for_
e fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and
me told us she was actually broken already.

In this dish-ass, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat,
d with the help of the rest of the men, they got her slung over
he ship's side, and getting all into her, let go, and committed
urselvec, being eleven in number, to God's mercy, and thewild
; for though the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea
ent dreadful high upon the shore, and might well be called, den
ild zee, as the Data}: all the sea in a storm.

And now our ease was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
Iainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not live,
d that we should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail,
e had none, nor, if we had, could we have done any thing with
; so we worked at the car towards the land, though with heavy
carts, like men going to execution: for we all knew, that when
e boat mine nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand
pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we committed our
souls toGod in the most earnest manner, and the wind driving
us towards the shore, we hastened our .destmction with our own
hands, pulling as well as we could towards land.

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or
shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could rationally give us
the least shadow of expectation, was, if we might happen into
some bay or gulph, or the mouth of some river, where by great
chance we might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of
the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was no-
thing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the
shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven about a league and a'
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, cum
rolling a--stem of us, and plainly bade us expect the couple--grate. *
In a word, it took us with such a fury, that it over-set the boat~
at once; and separating us, as well from the boat as from one-
another, gave us not time hardly to say, 0 God! for we were:
all swallowed up in a moment. =-

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt
when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very well, yet
I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath,
till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me a vast way
on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and.
left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with the water
I took in. I had so much presence of mind as well as bread!
left, that seeing myself nearer the main land than I expected,l
got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land
as fast as I could, before another wave should return and take
me up again. But I soon found it was impcesible to avoid it;
for I saw theses come after me asihighasa greathill,and8
furious as an enemy which I had no means or suength to con-
tend with; my business wasto hold my breath, and raise myself
upon the water, if I could: and so by swimming to preserve my
breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible: my
greatest concern now being that the sea, as it would carry me a
great way towards the shore when it me on, might not earry
me back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 20 or
30 feet deep in its own body; and I could feel myself earried
with a mighty force and swiftnecs towards the share, a very
great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myselfto swim
still forward with all my might. I was ready to burst with
holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to my
immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above
the surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of
time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave
me breath and new courage. I was covered again with water a
good while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding the
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground again with my
feet. I stood still a few moments to recover breath, and till the
water went from me, and then took to my heels, and ran with
what strength I had farther towards the shore. But neither
would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which earne
pouring in after me again, and twice more I was lifted up by the
waves and earried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well near been fatal to me;
for the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or
rather dashed me against a piece of a rock, and that with such
force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own .
deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the
breath as it were quite out of my body; and had it notreturned
again immediately, I must have been mangled in the water; but
I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and seeing I
should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold fast

c
by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till '
the wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high as at
first, being near land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and
then fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore,
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swal-
low me up as to carry me away; and the next run I took I got
to the main land, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up
the clifts of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from
danger, and quite out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up 3
and thank God that my life was saved in a case wherein there '
was some minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe it :
is impossible to express to the life what the ccstasies and trans- 3
ports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may say, out of l
the very grave; and I do not wonder now at that custom, viz.
that when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is
tied up, andjust going to be turned oil", and has a reprieve brought -
to him: I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with i
it, to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it, that
the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart,and
overwhelm him:

For sudden joys, like grief}, tonfnund at firrt. i

Iwalked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my
whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of my
deliverance, making a thousand gestures and motions which I
cannot describe, reflecting upon all my comrades that were 1
drowned, and that there should not be one son] saved but myself;
for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of '
them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that

were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach and
froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far
off, and considered, Lord! how was it possible I'could get on
shore!

AfterI had solamd my mind with the comfortable part of my
condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of place
I was in, and what was next to be done; and I soon found my
comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance:
for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any thing either to
eat or drink to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect before
me, but that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by
wild beasts: and that which was particularly afflicting to me,
was, that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature
that might desire to kill me for theirs: in a word, I had nothing
about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a
box; this was all my provision, and this threw me into terrible
agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like a mad-man;
night coming upon me, I began with a heavy heart to consider
what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasm in that
country, seeing at night they always come abroad for their
prey-

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time, was,
to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which
grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider
the next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw no pros-
pect of life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if
I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to my great
joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to
prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, en-
deavoured to place myself so, as that if I should sleep I might
not fall; and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon,
for my defence, I took up my lodging, and having been ex-
cessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as, I believe, few could have done in my condition, and. found
myself the most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on such
an occasion.

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and Well as before:
but that which surprised me most, was, that the ship was lifted
off in the night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of
the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which I first -
mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dashing me '
against it; this being within about a mile from the shore where I
was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself
on board, that, at least, I might save some necessary things for
my use.

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked '
about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which
lay as the wind and the sea had tossed her, up upon the land,
about two miles on my right hand; I walked as far as I could
upon the shore to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of
water between me and the boat, which was about half a mile
broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon
getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my '
present subsistence. '

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of
the ship; and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; forI '
saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had been all safe, '
that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so
miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and com- '
pany, as I now was: this forced tears from my eyes again, but as
there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the
ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to
extremity, and took the water; but when I me to the ship, my
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board, for as
she lay a--ground, and high out of the water, there was nothing
within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and
the second time I spied a small piece of a rope, which Iwondered
Idid not see at first, hang down by the fore-chains so lowas that
with great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope
got up into the forecastle of the ship: here I found that the ship
was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that
she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth,
that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low
almost to the water; by this means all her quarter was free, and
all that was in that partwas dry; for you may be sure my first
work was to search and to see what was spoiled and what was
free; and first I found that all the ship's provisions were dry,
and untouched by the water; and being very -well disposed to
eat, I went to the bread--room and filled my pockets with biscuit,
and eat it as I went about other things, for Iliad no time to lose.
I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a
large dram, and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me
for what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to
furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would be very
necessary to me.

It was in vain to sitstill and wish for whatwas not to behad,
and this extremity roused my application. We had several
spareyards, and twoorthreelarge sparsofwood, andaspare
hop-mast or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with
these, and flung as many of them overboard as I could manage
for their weight, tying every one with a rope that they might not
drive away; when this was done! went down theship's .side, and
pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast together at both
ends, as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or
three short pieces of plank upon them cross-ways, I found I
could wall: upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear
any great weight, the pieces being too light; so I went to work,
Ind withtheearpentel'saawlcutasparetop-mastinto three
lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour
and pains: but hope of furnishing myself with necessaries, en-
couraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to have
done upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight;
my next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what
I laid upon it from the surf of the sea; but I was not long con--
sidering this; I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I
could get, and having considered well what I most wanted, I first
got three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open and
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; the first of these
I filled with provisions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
five pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much upon, and
a little remainder of European corn which had been laid by for
some fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were
killed; there had been some barley and wheat together, but, to
my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all; as for liquors, I found several cases of
bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial
waters, and in all about five or six gallons of rack; these I
stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into the
chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing this, I found
the tide began to flow, though very calm; and I had the morti-
fication to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on
shore upon the sand, swim away; as for my breeches, which
were only linen, and open--kneed, I swam on board in them and
my stockings: however, this put me upon rummaging for clothes,
of which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for
present use, for I had other things which my eye was more upon;
as, first, tools to work with on shore; and it was after long
searching that I found out the earpenter's chest, which was indeed
a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-
loading of gold would have been at that time: I got it down to
my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look into
it, for I knew in general what it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms: there were
two very good fowling--pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols;
these I secured first, with some powder-horns, and a small bag of
shot, and two old rusty swords: I knew there were three barrels
of powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed
them; but with much search I found them, two of them dry
and good, the third had taken water: those two I got to my
raft, with the arms; and now I thought myself pretty well
fieighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with
them, having neither sail, car, or rudder, and the least cap-full
of wind would have over-set all my navigation.

I had three encouragements: I. A smooth, mlm sea: 2. The
tide rising and setting into the shore: 3. What little wind there
was, blew me towards the land: and thus, having found two or
three broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools
which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe and a ham-
mer, and with this cargo I put to see. For a mile, or there-
abouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little
distant from the place where I had landed before, by which I
perceived that there was some indraft of the water, and conse-
quently I hoped to find some creekor river there, which I might
make use ofas a port to get to land with my cargo.

As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before me a little
opening of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set
intoit,soIguidedmyraftaswellaslcouldtokeepinthe
middle of the stream: but here I had like to have sufi'ered a
second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broke my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft run
I-ground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being a-grotmd
at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had
Slipped ofi' towards-tint end that was afloat, and so fallen into
the water. I did my unnost, by setting my back against the
chests, to keep them in their places, but could not thrust of the
raft with all my strength, neither durst I stir from the posture I
was in; but holding up the chests with all my might, stood in
that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the
water brought me a little more upon a level; and a little after,

the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her of?
with the oar I had, into the channel; and then driving up higher, j

I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land
on both sides, and a strong current or tide running up: I looked
on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I was not
willing to be driven too high up the river, hoping in time to see
some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near.
the coast as I could. .

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek,
to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and
at last got so near, as that, reaching ground with my oar, I
could thrust her directly in; but here I had like to have dipped
all my cargo in the sea again ; for that shore lying pretty steep,
that is to say sloping, there was no place to land, but where one
end of the float, if it run on shore, would lie so high, and the
other sink lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo
again: all that I could do, was to wait till the tide was at the
highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor to hold the
side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I
expected the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as
I found water enough (for my raft drew about a foot of water),
I thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened
or moored her by sticking my two broken oars into the ground;
one on one side near one end; and one on the other side near
the other end; and thus I lay fill the water ebbed away, and left
my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper

.__._._..._.._...A ..
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure
them from whatever might happen; where I was I yet knew
not; whether on the continent or on an island, whether inhabited
or not inhabited, whether in danger of wild beasts or not; there
was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very steep
and high, and which seemed to over-top some other hills which
lay as in a ridge from it northward; I took out one of the fowl-
ing pieces, and one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, and
thus armed I travelled for discovery up to the top of thathill,
where, after I had with great labour and difficulty got to the top,
I saw my fate to my great affliction, viz. that I was in an island
environed every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except
some rocks which lay a great way off, and two small islands less v
than this, which lay about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw
good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of
whom however I saw none ; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but
knew not their kinds, neither when I killed them could I tell
what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back, I
shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of
agreatwaod; I believeit wasthefirst gun thathad beenfired
there since the creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, but
from all the parts of the wood there arose an innumerable num--
ber of (owls of many sorts, making a confused screaming, and
crying every one according to his usual note; but not one of
them ofany kind that I knew: as for the creature I killed, I
took it to be a kind of hawk, its colour and beak raembling it,
but had no salon: or claws more than common; its flesh was
earrion, and fit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the
restofthat day; and whatto do with myselfat night I knew
Mt; nor indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on

c 2
the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour me,
though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need for those
fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself round with
the chase: and boards that I had brought on shore, .and made a
kind of a hut for that night's lodging: as for food, I yet saw
not which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or
three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I shot the
fowl.

I now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many
things out of the ship, which Would be useful to me, and par-
ticularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things as
might come to land, and I resolved to make another voyage on
board the vessel, if possible; and as I knew that the first storm
that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to
set all other things apart, till I got every thing out of the ship
that I could get: then I called a council, that is to say, in my
thoughts, whether I should take back the raft; but this appeared
impracticable; so I resolved to go as before, when the tide was
down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my
hut, having nothing on but a chequered shirt, and a pair of linen
trowsers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared a second raft;
and having had experience of the first, I neither made this so
unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard; but yet I brought away several
things very useful to me; as first, in the earpenter's stores, I
found two or three bags fiill of nails and spikes, a great screw-
jack, 2. dozen or two of hatchets, and above all, that most usefill
thing called a grindstone: all these I secured, together with 1
several things belonging to the gunner, particularly two or three
iron crows, and two barrels of musquet--bullets, seven musquets,
and another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of powder
more; a large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet
lead; but this last was so heavy I could not hoist it up to get it
over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could
find, and a spare fore-top-sail, hammock, and some bedding;
and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe
on shore, to my very great comfort.

I was under some apprehensions during my absence from the
land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore;
but when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor, only
there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the chests, which,
when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, and then
stood still: she sat very composed, and unconcerned, and looked
full in my face, as if she had a mindto be acquaintedwith me;
I presented my gun at her, but as she did not understand it, she
was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away:
upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way I
was not very free of it, for my store was not great: however, I
spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled it, ate it, and
looked, as pleased, for more: but I thanked her, and could spare
no more; so she marched off.

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was fain to
open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, (for they
were too heavy, being large asks,) I went to work to make me
a little tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for that
purpose; and into this tent I brought every thing that I knew
would spoil, either with rain or sun, and I piled all the empty
chests and asks up in a circle round the tent, to forfify' it from
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.

When I had done this I blocked up the door of the tent with
some boards within, and an empty chest set up an-end without:
and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two
pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I who
bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night, for Lwasj
very weary and heavy; for the night before I had slept little,
and had laboured very hard all day, as Well to fetch all those
things from the ship, as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now, that ever were
laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was not satisfied still; for
while the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ought to
get every thing out of her that I could: so every day at low
water I went on board, and brought away something or other ;
but particularly the third time I went, I brought away as much
of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope
twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvass, which was to
mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gun-powder:
in a word, I brought away all the sails first and last, only that I
was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I
could; for they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere
canvass only.

But that which comforted me more still, was, that, last of all,
after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and thought
I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth my
meddling with; I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of
bread, and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and a box of
sugar and a barrel of fine flour: this was surprising to me, 5
because I had given over expecting any more provisions, except
what was spoiled by the water: I soon emptied the hogshead of
that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the
soils, which I cut out: and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore
also.

The next day I made another voyage , and now, having plun- l
dered the ship of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began ;
with the cables , and cutting the great cable into pieces, such as '
I could move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all
the iron-work I could get; and having cut down the sprimil--
yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing I could to make aOF ROBINSON Cl U502. 6 I

large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and me away:
but my good luck began now to leave me; for this raft was so
unwieldy and so overladen, that after I had entered the little
cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able
to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw
me and all my eargo into the water. As for myself it was no
great harm, for I was near the shore; but as tomy cargo, it was
great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected would
have been of great use to me: however, when the tide was out,
I got most of the pieces of eeble ashore; and some of the iron,
though with infinite labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the
water, a work which fatigued me very much. After this, I went
every day on board, and brought away what I could get.

I had been now 13 days on shore, and had been 11 times on
board the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one
pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring; though I
believe verily, had the aim weather held, I should have brought
away the whole ship, piece by piece; but preparing the 12th
time to go on board, I found the wind begin to rise; however
at low water I went on board, and though I thought I had rum-
maged the ubin so effectually, as that nothing more could be
found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of
which I found two or three razors, and one pair of large seissars,
with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks; in another
I found about thirty-six pounds value in money, some Eurnpeau
coin, some Brasil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. 0 Drug! said
I, aloud, what art than good for? thou art not worth to me, no
not the taking of of the ground: one of those knives is worth
all this heap: I have no manner of use for thee, even remain
where thou art and go to the bottom, as a creature whwe life 18
not worth saving. However, upon second thoughts, I took it
aWily,andm-a.p[.)ingallthisinapieeeofoanvasli,I beganto
think of making another raft; but while I was preparing this, I
found the sky over-cast, and the wind began to rise, and in a
quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It pre-
sently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a
raft with the wind 01? shore, and that it was my business to be
gone before the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be
able to reach the shore at all: accordingly I let myself down into
the water, and swam across the channel, which lay between the
ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly
with the weight of things I had about me, and partly the rough--
ness of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and before it
was quite high water it blew a storm.

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with all
my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that
night; and in the morning when I looked out, behold no more
ship was to be seen: I was a little surprised, but recovered my-
self with this satisfactory reflection, 'viz. That I had lost no time,
nor abated any diligence to get every thing out of her that could
be useful to me ; and that indeed there was little left in her that
I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore from her

wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her afterwards did; but those 5

things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing my-- '

self against either savages (if any should appear) or wild beasts,
if any were in the island; and I had many thoughts of the
method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make;
whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon
the earth: and, in short, I resolved upon both, of the manner and
description of which it may not be improper to give an account.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement,
particularly because it was upon a low moorish ground near the
sea, and I believed would not be wholesome, and more particu-
larly beeause therewasno freshwater near it; so I resolved to
find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation which I found would
be proper for me: 1st, Health, and fresh water, I just now
mentioned. zdly, Shelter from the heat of the sun. 3dly, Secu-
rity from ravenous creatures, whether man or beast. 4thly, A
View to the sea; that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not
lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was not wil-
ling to banish all my expectation yet.

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on
the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was
steep as a houseside, so that nothing could come down upon me
from the top; on the side of this rock there was a hollow place,
worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave: but
there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all.

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I
resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was not above an hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green before
my door, and at the end of it descended irregularly every way
down into the low grounds by the sea--side. It was on the
N. N. W'. side of the hill, so that I was sheltered from the heat
every day, till it came to a W. and by 8. sun, or thereabouts,
which in those countries is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the hollow
place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from
the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning
and ending.

In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving
them into the ground till' they stood very firm, like piles, the
biggest end being out of the ground about five foot and a half,
and Sharpened on the top , the two rows did not stand above six
"Kim from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship,
and laid them in rows one upon another, within the circle between
those two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in
the inside, leaning against them, about two foot and a half high,
like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that neither 1
rnan or beast could get into it or over it: this cost me a great 1
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods,
bring them to the place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but
by a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was
in, I lifted over after me; and so I was completely fenced in,
and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and consequently '
slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could not have done; :
though, as it appeared afterward, there was no need of all this
caution from the enemies that I apprehended danger from.

Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all
my riches, all my provisions, ammunition and stores, of which ,
you have the account above; and I made me a large tent, which,
to preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are
very violent there, I made double, 'vx'z. one smaller tent within, {
and one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with a _
large mpaulin which I had saved among the sails. _

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing
that would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my I
goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had left open,
and so passed and repaseed, as I said, by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock;
and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down, out
through my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the nature
of a terrace, that so it raised the groundwithin about a foot and

.51." .._s
a half: and thus I made me a awe just behind my tent, which
served me like a cellar to my house.

It cost me much labour, and many days, before all these
things Were brought to perfection, and therefore I must go back
to some other things which took up some of my thoughts. At
the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for the
setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain
falling from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning hap-
pened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the
effect of it: I was not so much surprised with the lightning, .1
I was with a thought which darted into my mind as swift as the
lightning itself: 0 my powder! my very heart sunk within
me, when I thought, that at one blast all my powder might be
destroyed; on which, not my defence only, but the providing
me food, as I thought, enn'rely depended: I was nothing near so
anxious about my own danger, though had the powder took fire,
I had never known who had hurt me.

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm
was over, I laid aside all my works, my building, and fortifying,
and applied myself to make bags and boxes to separate the pow-
der, and to keep it a little and a little in. a parcel, in hope, that
whatever might come, it might not all take fire at once; and to.
keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to make one part
fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight; and
I think, my powder, which in all was about 24.0 pounds weight,
was divided in not less than a hundred parcels: as to'the barrel
that had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that,
50 I placed it in my new ave, which in my fancy I called my
kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the
I'Otiks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very wefully
where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once
atlmstevery daywith mygun, as well to divert myself, as to
see if I could kill any thing fit for food, and, as near as I could,
to acquaint myself with what the island produced. The first
time I went out I presently discovered that there were goats in
the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but then it was
attended with this misfortune to me, viz. that they were so shy,
so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most difficult thing
in the World to come at them; but I was not discouraged at this,
not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon
happened; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait
in this manner for them: I observed, if they saw me in the val-
leys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away as

l
i
l

in a terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and l

I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me: from whence

I concluded, that by the position of their optics, their sight was v

so directed downward, that they did not readily see objects that
were above them: so afterward I took this method: I always
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had
frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made among these
creatures, I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her,
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily; but when
the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her till I came and
took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one

with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my ,

enclosure, upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in
my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it
up tame, but it would not eat, so I was forced to kill it and eat
it myself: these two supplied me with flesh a great while, forl
eat sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread especially) as
much as possibly I could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely neces-
sary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn; and
what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, and what

conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of in its place:
but I must first give some little account of myself, and of my
thoughts about living, which it may well be supposed were not
a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; foras I was noteest
away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a
violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage,
and a great way, uiz. some hundreds of leagues out of the ordi-
nary course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to con-
sider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this desolate place,
and in this desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears
would run plentifully down my face when I made these reflec-
'ons, and sometimes I would expostulate with myself, why Pro-
'dcnce should thus completely ruin his creatures, and render
em so absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned, so

But something always returned swift upon me to check these
houghts, and to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking
ith my gun in my hand by the sea-side, I was very pensive
pon the subject of my present condition, when reason as it were
xpostulated with me the other way, thus: Well, you are in a
esolate condition, it is true; but pray remember, where are the
of you? Did not you come eleven of you into the boat?
here are the ten? Why were they not saved and you lost?
by were you singled out? Is-it better to be here or there?
dthenlpointedtotheses. Allevilsaretobeconsidered
ith the good that is in them, and with what worse attends them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for
Y subSistencc, and what would have been my case if it had not
pened, which we: a: hundred thousand to one, that the ship

hatwould have been myesse iflhad been to havelived inthe

'U
condition in which I at first came on shore, without necessaries
of life or necessaries to supply and procure them? Particularly, i
said I aloud, (though to myself) what should I have done with 1
out a gun, without ammunition, without any tools to make any
thing, or to work with; without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any '
manner of covering: and that now I had all these to a sufficient 1
quantity, and was ina fair way to provide myself in such a man- 1
ner, as to live without my gun when my ammunition was spent;
so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without any want,
as long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning how I
should provide for the accidents that might happen and for the
time that was to come, even not only after my ammunition
should be spent, but even after my health or strength should
decay.

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition
being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being blown
up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it so surprising
to me when it lightened and thundered, as I observed just now.

And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of
a scene of silent life, such perhaps as was never heard of in the V
world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it
in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September,
when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this
horrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its autumnal equinox,
was almostjust over my head; for I reckoned myself, by obser-
vation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees and 22 minutes north
of the line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into
my thoughts, that I should lose my reckoning of time for want
of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath
days from the working days: but to prevent this, I cut it with
my knife upon a large post in capiml letters, and making it into
a great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed, viz.
I came on than here an the 30th afSept. I6 59. Upon the sides
of this square post, I cut every day a notch with my knife, and
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every first
day of the month as long again as that long one: and thus I kept
my mlendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among the many
things which I brought out of the ship in the several voyages,
which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of
less value, but not all less useful to me, which I omitted setting
down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper; several
parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping;
three or four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials,
perspectim, charts, and books of navigation; all which I hud-
dled together, whether I might want them or no: also, I found
three very good bibles which me to me in my cargo from Eng-
land, and which I had packed up among my things; some Por-
tuguese books also, and among them two or three popish prayer-
books, and several other books, all which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two
cats, of whose eminent history I may have occasion to say some-
thing in its place; for I earried both the cats with me; and as
for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on
shore to me the day after I went on shore with my first cargo,
and was a trusty servant to me many years; I wanted nothing
that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could make up
to me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could
not do. As I observed before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I
husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall shew, that while my
ink lasmd, I kept things very exact; but after that was gone, I
could not; for I could not make any ink, by any means that I
ould devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not-
"!an all that I had amamd together; and ofthese this
of ink was one, as also spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or
remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon
learned to want that without much dificulty.

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily, and
it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little
pale or surrounded habitation: the piles or stakes, which were
as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and
preparing in the woods, and more by far in bringing home; so
that I spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home
one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the ground;
for which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at
last bethought myself of one of the iron crows, which however,
though I found it, yet it made driving those posts or piles very
laborious and tedious work.

But what need I have been concerned at the tediousan of
any thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in, nor
had I any other employment if that had been over, at least, that
I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food,
which I did more or less every day.

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the cir-
cumstance I was reduced to, and I drew up the state of my affairs
in writing; not so much to leave them to any that were to come
after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afllicting my mind;
and as my reason began now to master my despondency, I began
to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the good against
the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my case
from worse; and I stated it very impartially, like debtor and
creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I sufi'ered,
thus:

it; and let this stand as a direction from the experience of the
most miserable of all conditions in this world, that we may
always find in it something to comfort ourselves from, and to
set, in the description of good and evil, on the credit side of the
account.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition,
and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship;
I say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to ac-
commodate my way of living, and to make things as easy to me
as I could.

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent under
the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and V
cables, but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind "
of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside, -
and after some time, I think it was a year and a half, I raised
rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it
with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get to keep out _'
the rain, which I found at some times of the year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this
pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me: but I
' must observe too that at first this was a confused heap of goods,
which as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place, I
had no room to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my awe
and works farther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock,
which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: and so when
I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways
to the right hand into the rock; and then turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out, on
the outside of my pale or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were a back-
way to my tent and to my store-house, but gave me room to

stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things aslfoundlmostwanted, asparticularlyachairandatable;
for without these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had
in the world; I could not write or eat, or do'several things with
so much pleasure without a table.

So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as
reason is the substance and original of the mathematies, so by
stating and squaring every thing by reason, and by making the
most rational judgment of things, every man may be in time
master of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my
life, and yet in time by labour, application, and contrivance, I
found at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made it,
especially if I had had tools, however I made abundance of.
things, even without tools, and some with no more tools than
an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way
before, and that with infinite labour; for example, if I wanted a
board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an
edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I
had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth
with my adze. It is true, by this method I could make but one
board out of a whole tree, but this I had no remedy for but
patience, any more than I had for the prodigious deal of time
and labour which it took me up to make a plank or board: but
my time or labour was little worth, and so it was as well em-
.ployed one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above,
in the first place, and this I did out of the short pieces of boards
which I brought on my raft from the ship: but when I had
wrought out some boards, as above,I made large shelves, of the
breadth of a foot and a halfone over another, all along one side
of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work, and in a
mid, to separateevery thing at large in theirplaces,that I
might come easily at them; I knocked pieces into the wall of the
l'Ocl:ltohangmygunsandallthingsthatwouldhangup.

D74. Lin AND Anvmwass

So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a general
magazine ofall necessary things; andlhadeverythingso
readyat myhand, that itwas a great pleasuretome toseeall
my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of all
necessaries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's
employment; for indeed at first I was in too much hurry; and
not only hurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure of
mind, and my journal would have been full of many dull things.
For example, I must have said thus: Sept. the 30th, afier I got
to shore, and had escaped drowning, instead of being thankful
to Gov for my deliverance, having first vomited with the great
quantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomach, and
recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wringing my
hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming at my misery,
and crying out, I was undone, undone; till, tired and faint, I
was forced to lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not
sleep for fear of being devoured.

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the ship,
and got all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear get--
ting up to the top of a little mountain, and looking out to sea
in hopes of seeing a ship; then fancy at a vast distance I spied
a sail; please myself with the hopes of it; and then, after look-
ing steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down
and weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by my
folly.

But having gotten over these things in some measure, and
having settled my householdstufi' and habitation, made me a
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I
began to keep my journal, of which I shall here give you the
copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over again) as
long as it lasted; for having no more ink, I was forced to leave
it oil".'r... --or Ronmsox CRUSOI. 75

Allthe restofthatdaylspentin aflictingmyself, atthedis-
mal circumstances I was brought to, 'm'z. I had neither food,
house, clothes, weapon, or place to fly to, and in despair of any
relief, saw nothing but death before me, either that I should be
devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to
death for want of food. At the approach of night I- slept in a
tree, for fear of wild creatures, but slept soundly though it rained
all night.

October I. In the morning I saw to my great surprise, the ship
had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again
much nearer the island, which as it was some comfort on one hand,
for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if
the wind abated, I might get on board, and get some {oodor
necessaries out of her for my relief; so, on the other hand, it
renewed my grief at'the loss of my comrades, who I imagined if

swam on board; this day also it continued raining, though with
no wind at all. .

From the wt of October to the 24th. All these days entirely
Spent in making several voyages to get all I could out of the
ship, which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts.
Much rain also in these days, though with some intervals of fair
weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy season.

Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon
it; but being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy,
I recovered many of them when the tide was out.

Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of
wind, during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind
blowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be seen,
except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent
this day in covering and securing the goods which I had saved,
that the rain might not spoil them.

Ort. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out
a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself
from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men.
Towards night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a semi-circle for my encampment, which I resolved
to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification made of double
piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the
time it rained exceeding hard.

The 3rst, in the morning, I went out into the island with
my gun, to see for some food, and discover the country; when
I killed a she--goat, and her kid followed me home; which I
afterwards killed also, because it would not feed.

November I. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for

the first night, making it as large as I could with stakes driven in
to swing my hammock upon.
'Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the'pieoes of
timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round
me, a little within the place I had marked out for my forn'fieation.

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like
ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon went to
work to make me a table.

NW. 4.. This morning I began to order my times of work,
of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion;
viz. every morning I walked out with my gun for two or three
hours, if it did not rain, then employed myself towork till about
eleven o'clock, then eat what I had to live on, and from twelve
to two I lay down to sleep, the weatherbeing excessive hot, and.
then in the evening to work again: the working part of this
day, and of the next, were wholly employed in making my table,
for I was yet but a very sorry Workman, though time and ne-
cessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I
believe it would do any one else.

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and my dog,
and killed a wild eat, her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for
nothing: everycreatureI killedItook ofi'theskinsandpre-
served them. Coming back by the sea-shore I saw many sorts
of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was surprised
and almost frighted with two or three seals, which, while I was
gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the sea,
and eseaped me for that time.

Nw. 6. After my morning walk I went to work with my
table again, and finished it, though not to my liking. nor was
it long before I learned to mend it.

Not). 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the I 1th was Sunday)
Itook wholly up to make me a chair, andwith much ado
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and
eveninthemakinngulleditinpieces severaltimes. Nate,I
soon neglected my keeping Sundays, for omitting my mark'for
them on my post, I forgot which was which.

Nov. I 3. This day it rained, which refi-eshed me exceedingly,
and cooled the earth, but it was accompanied with terrible thun-
der and lightning, which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my
powder: as soon as it was over I resolved to separate my_stock
of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that it might
not be in danger.

Nov. 14., 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little
square chests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two
pounds, at most, of powder; and so putting the powder in, I
stowed it in places as secure and remote from one another as pos-
sible. On one of these three days I killed a large bird that was
good to eat, but I know not what to call it.

Now. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent into the
rock, to make room for my farther conveniency. Nate, three
things I wanted exceedingly for this work, 'viz. a pick-axe, a
shovel, and a wheel-barrow or basket, so I desiswd from my
work, and began to consider how to supply that want, andmake
me some tools: as for a pick-axe, I made use of the iron crows,
which were proper enough, though heavy; but the next thing
was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that
indwd I could do nothing effectmlly without it; but what kind
of one to make I knew not.

Nov. 1 8. The next day in searching the woods I found atreeof
that wood, or like it, which in the Brm'ib they all the Iron Tree,
for its exceeding hardness; of this, with great labour and almost
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home too with
difliculty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other way,
made me a long while upon this machine; for I worked it
efi'ectually by little'and little into the form of a shovel or spade,
the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the
hodparthavingnoironshoduponit atbottom,itwouldnot
lastmesolong; howeveritservedwellenough forme use:
which I'had occasion to put it to; but never was a'shovel, I
believe, made after that fmhion, or so long at making. '

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheel-barrow.
a basket I could not make by any means, having no such things
as twigs that would bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet
found out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could make
all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of, neither did I know
how to go about it; besides, I had no possible way to make the
iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so-
I gave it over; and so for carrying away the earth which I dug
out of the cave, I made me a thing like a had which the la--
bourers carry mortar in, when they serve the bricldayers.

Thiswas notso diflicultto mess the makingthe shovel; and
yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain
to make a wheel-barrow, took me up no less than four days, I
mean always excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I
seldom failed; and very seldom failed also bringing home some-
thing to eat.

New. 23. My' other work having now stood still, because of
: my making these tools, when they were finished I went on, and
Workingcveryday, asmystrengthandtimeallowed,l spent
eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my ave, that
it might hold my goods commodiously.

Note, During all this time, I worked to make this room or
ave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or ma-
gazine, a kitchen, a dining-roam, and a cellar; as for my lodg-
ing,Ikepttothetent,exoept that sometimes inthewetsason

Dumber to. I began now to think my ave or vault finished,
whenonasudden (itseemslhadmadeittoolarge)a great
quantity of earth fell down fiom the top and one side, so much
that in short it frighted me, and not without reason too; for if
I had been under it I had never wanted a grave-digger: upon
this disaster I had a great deal of work to do over again; for I
had the loose earth to carry out, and, which was of more irnpor-_
tance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no
more would come down.

Dec. 1 1. This day I went to work with it accordingly, and
got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two
pieces of boards across over each post; this I finished the next
day; and setting more posts up with boards, in about a week
more I had the roof secured; and the posts, standing in rows,
served me for partitions to part of? my house.

Du. 17. From this day to the twentieth I placed shelves, and
knocked up nails on the posts to hang every thing up that could
be hung up; and now I began to be in some order within
doors.

Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave, and began
to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a
dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards began to be very
scarce with me: also I made me another table.

Dec. 24.. Much rain all night and all day; no stirring out.

Dec. 2 5. Rain all day.

Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler than before,
and pleasanter.

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so thatl
caught it, and led it home in a string; when I had it home,l
bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke. N. B. I
took such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew well and as
strong as ever; but by nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed
upon the little green at my door, and would not go away: this
wasthefirsttimethatlentertainedathoughtofbreedingup
some tame creatures, that I might have food when my powder
and shot was all spent. '

Dee. 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze; so that there"

Ispentinputtingallmythingsinordawitlfindoors. '

7am I. Very hot still, but I went abroad early and late
with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This even-
ing, going farther into the valleys, which lay towards the cenue
of the island, I found there was plenty ofgoats, though exceeding
shyand hard to come at; howeverIreeolvedtotryifI could
not bring my dog to hunt them down. s

7a. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with my dog,-
and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for they all
faced about upon the dog; and he knew his danger toowell, for
he would not come near them.

fan. 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous
of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very:
thick and strong.

N. B. Thir wall being dereribed before, I purposely omit
what was said in the foarnal ,- it i: .mficient to observe,
that I was no let: time than from the 3d of January to
the 14th of April, working, finithing, and perfecting thi:
wall, though it was no more than about 24 yard: in
length, being a half circle from one plate in the roeh to
another place about eight yard: from it, the door of the
cave being in the centre behind it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me'
many days, my, sometimes weels together; but I thought I
should neverbeperfeetlysecure until thiswallwas finished; and .
it is scarce credible what inexpreesible labour every thing was'
done with, especially the bringing pileeout ofthewoods, and

. DZ
driving them into the ground, for I made them much bigger
than I need to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced
with a turf--wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if
any people were to come on shore there, they would not perceive
any thing like a habitation; and it was very well I did so, as
may be observed hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion.

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain admitted me, and made frequent dis-
coveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage;
particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, who built not as
wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the holes
of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they
flew away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them,
for I had nothing to give them; however I frequently found
their nests, and got their young ones, which were very good
meat.

And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found my-
self wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was
impossible for me to make, as indeed, as to some of them, it
was; for instance, I could never make a cask to be hooped: I
had a small runlet or two, a: I observed before, but I could never
arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though I spent
many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or joint
the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water;
so I gave that also over.

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle; so that as
soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock,
I was obliged to go to bed: I remembered the lump of bees-wax
with which I made candles in my flfriean adventure, but I had
none of that now; the only remedy I had, was, that when I had
killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some
oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me light, though not
a clear steady light like a candle. In the middle of all my labours
it happened, that rummaging my things, I found a little bag,
which, as I hinted before, had been filled with corn for the feed-
ing of poultry--not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose,
when the ship came from Lisbon ; what little remainder of corn
had been in the bag, was all devoured with the rats, and I saw
nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to
have the bag for some other use, I think it was to put powder
in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use,
I shook the husks of com out of it on one side of my fortifica--
tion under the rock.

It was a little before the great rains, just now mentioned, that
I threw this stufi" away, taking no notice of any thing, and not
so much as remembering that I had thrown any thing there;
when about a month after, or thereabout, I saw some few stalks
of something green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied
might be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised and
perfectly astonished, when after a little longer time I saw about
ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley of
the same kind as our European, nay, as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of
my thoughts on this occasion; I had hitherto acted upon no
religious foundation at all; indeed I had very few notions of
religion in my head, or had entertained any sense of any thing
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as we
lightly say, what pleases Goo; without so much as inquiring
into the end of Providence in these things, or his order in
governing events in the world; but after I saw barley grow
there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and
especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me
Strangely; and I began to suggest, that Goo had miraculously
eaused this grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and
that it was so direemd purely for my sustenance on that wild
tuber-able place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my
eyes, and I began to bless myself, that such a prodigy of nature
should happen upon my account; and this was the more strange
to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the side of the
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of
rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa,
when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence
for my support, but not doubting but that there was more in the
place, I went all over that part of the island, where I had been
before, peeping in every corner and under every rock to see for
more of it, but I could not find any; at last it occurred to my
thought, that I had shook a bag of chickens meat out in that
place, and then the wonder began to cease; and I must confess,
my religious thankfulness to Gon's providence began to abate
too, upon discovering that all this was nothing but what was
common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange
and unforeseen a providence as if it had been miraculous; for it
was really the work of Providence as to me, that should order
or appoint ten or twelve grains of corn to remain unspoiled,
when the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped
from heaven: as also, that I should throw it out in that par-
ficular place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it
sprang up immediately; whereas if I had thrown it any where
else at that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their
season, which was about the end of 7am, and laying up every
corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have
some quantity suflicient to supply me with bread; but it was not
till the fourth year that I could allow myself the last grain of
thiscorntoeegandeven then butsparingly,asl shall sayafter-
wardsinimorder; for! lostall that I sowed thefirstsesson,by
not observing the proper time; for I sowed it just before he
dryseason,sothatitnevercameupatdl,atlesstnotasit
would have done: of which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same are, and whose
use was ofthe same kind or to the same purpose, viz. Tomake
me breed, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it up with--
out baking, though I did that also after some time. But to
return to my journal.

I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my
wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to
go into it, not by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that
there might be no sign in the outside of my habitation.

April 16. I finished the ladder, so I went up with the ladder
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down on
the inside: this was a complete enclosure to me; for within I
had room enough, and nothing could come at me from without,
unless It could first mount my wall.

Theverynext dayafter this wall wasfinished,I hadalmost
had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed; the
casewasthus: As I was busyinthe inside ofit, behindmytent,
just in the entrance into my ave, I was terribly frighted with a
most dreadful surprising thing indwd; for on a sudden I found
the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and
fromtheedgeofthehill,over myhesd,andtwoofthepostsl
hadset up inthecave cracked inafrightfizlmanner: Iwas
heartily scared, but thought nothing of what was really the cause,
onlythinkingthatthempofmyavewasfallingin,assomeof
ithaddonebefore; and for-furl should be buried init, I ran
forward to my ladder; and not thinking myself safe there neither,
lgotovermywallfor fearofthepieoesofthe hillwhichla--
pected might roll down upon me: Iwas no sooner stepped dovm
upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible earth-
quake, for the ground I stood on shook three times at about
eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as would have
overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have
stood on the earth; and agreat piece of the top ofa rock, which
stood about half a mile from me next the sea, fell down with
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life: I perceived
also the very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I
believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the
island.

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the
like, or discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one
dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth made my stomach
sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling
of the rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing me from the
stupified condition I was in, filled me with horror, and I thought
of nothing then but the hill falling upon my tent, and all my
household goods, and burying all at once; and this sunk my
very soul within me a second time.

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage, and yet I had not heart enough
to get over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat
still upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not
knowing what to do: all this while I had not the least serious
religious thought, nothing but the common, Lord, have men)
upon me; and when it was over, that went away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy,
as if it would rain; soon after'that the wind rose by little and
little, so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane: the sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam
and froth, the share was covered with the breach of the water,
the trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible storm it was;
andthisheld aboutthreehours,andthenbeganto abate,andin
twohoursmoreitwasstarkealm,andbegantominveryhard.

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified and
dejected, when on a sudden it eame into my thoughts, that these
winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the
earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into
my eave again: with this thought my spirits began to revive,
and the rain alsohelping to persuade me,I.went inand satdown
in my tent, but the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready
to be beaten down with it; and Iwas forcedto go into my cave,
though very much afi'aid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on
my head. .

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to cut a hole
through my new fortifieation like a sink to let water go out,
which would else have drowned my cave. After I had been in
my cave some time, and found still no more shocks of the earth-
quake follow, I began to be more composed; and now, to sup-
port my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to
my little store, and took a small sup of rum, which however I
did then, and always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no-
more when that was gone.

It continued raining all that night, and great part of the next
day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more
composed, I began to think of what I had best do, concluding,
that if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there would
be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building
me some little but in an open place, which I might surround
withawallaslhaddonehere, andsomakemyselfsecurefrom
wild beasts or men: but concluded if I staid where I was, I'
should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the.
place where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice
0f the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would cer-88 Lire nun onex'rum

tainly fall upon my tent: and I spent the next two days, being
the 19th and 20th of April, in conniving where and how to
remove my habitation.

The fear of being swallowed up aIIVe, made me that I never
slept in quiet: and yet the apprehension of lying abroad, without
any fence, was almost equal to it; but still, when I looked about
and saw how every thing was put in order, how pleasantly con--
cealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loth to
remove.

In the mean time it occurred to me that it would require a
vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented
to run the venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for
myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it; so with this
resolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I
would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles
and cables, 8:. in a circle as before; and set my tent up in it
when it was finished, but that I would venture to stay where l
was till it was finished and fit to remove to. This was the arst.

April 22. The next morning I began to consider of means to
put this resolve in execution, but I was at a great loss about my
tools; I had three large axes and abundance of hatchets (for we
wried the hatches for trafiick with the Indians), but with much
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of
notches and dull, and though I had a grind--stone, I could not
turn it and grind my tools too: this cost me as much thought as
a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of polities,
or a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length I eon-
trived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might
have both my hands at liberty. Note, I had never seen any such
thing in England, or at least not to take notice how it was done,
though since I have observed it is very common there; besides
that, my grind-stone was very large and heavy. This machine
cost me a full week's work to bring it to perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding
my tools, my machine for turning my grind-stone performing
very well

April 30. Having perceived my bread had been low a great
while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one bis-
cuit cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.

May I. In the morning, looking towards the sea--side, the tide
being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary ;
and it looked like a essk. When I came to it, I found a small
barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which
were driven on shore by the late hurriesne; and looking towards
the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the
water thanitusedtodo: I examined the barrelwhichwasdriven
on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it
hadsaken water, and the powder was eekedas hard as astone;
however I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went on
upon the sands as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to
look for more.

When I me down to the ship, I found it strangely removed:
the fore-esstle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up
at least six foot; and the stern, which was broke to pieces and
parted from the rest by the force ofthe see, soon aftethad left
rummaging her, was tossed, a it were, up, and cast on one side,
and the sandwasthrownsohigh on that side next her stern,that
whereas there was a. great place of water before, so that I could
not come within a quarter of a- mile of the wreck without swim-
ming, I could now walk quite up to her when the tide was out.
I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must be
done by the earthquake: and as by this violence the ship was
more broken open than forrnerly, so many things me daily on
shore, which the see had loosened, and which the winds and
Water rolled by degrees to the land.

This wholly diverud my thoughts from the design of removing
my habitation; and I busied myself mightily that day especially,
in searching whether I could make any way into the ship; but
I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for that all the
inside of the ship was choked up with sand: however, as I had
lmt not to despair of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing
to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding, that every thing I
could get from her would be of some use or other to me.

1144] 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a burn
through, which I thought held some of the upper part or quarter
deck together; and when I had cut it through, I cleared away
the sand as well as I could from the side which lay highest; but
the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time.

May 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst
eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when just going to leave
OH", I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of
some rope yarn, but I had no hooks, yet I frequently caught fish
enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun,
and eat them dry.

May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam asunder,
and brought three great fir planks off from the decks, which I
tied together, and made swim on shore when the tide of flood
came on.

May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out of
her, and other pieces of iron-work; worked very hard, and came.
home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over.

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent not to
work, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down,
the beams being cut, that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie
loose: and the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could see
into it, but almost full of water and sand.

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or
sand; I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on shore
alsowith the tide: Ilefttheironcrowintbewreckfornext
da .

PS144} 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way
into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened
themwith the crow, but could not breakthem up; I felt also
the roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy
to remove.

May IO, 11, 12, r3, r4. Went every day to the wreck, and
got a great many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and
two or three hundred weight of iron.

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try ifI could not cut a
piece of? the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and
driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half
in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the hatchet.

Ala] 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I staid so
long in the woods to get pigeons for food, that the tide prevented
me going to the wreck that day.

May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at
a great distance, near two miles 05 me, but resolved to see what
they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy
for me to bring away.

Ma} 24. Every day to this day I worked on the wreck, and
withhard labour I loosened some things somuchwiththecrow,
that the first blowing tide several asks floated out, and two of
the seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the shore,
nothing me to land that day but pieces oftimber, and a hogs-
had, which had some Brazil pork in it, but the salt water and
sand had spoiled it.

I continued this work every day to the 15th of fine, except
the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed, during
this part of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I
might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time-I had
gotten timber, and plank, and iron-work enough to have built
a good boat, ifI had known how; and also, I got at several
times, and in several pieces, near 100 weight of the sheet-lad.

71m: 16. Going down to the see side, I found a largetortoise
or turtle; this was the first I had seen, which it seems was only
my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had
I happened to be on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day ; as I found afterwards; but per-
haps had paid dear enough for them.

fine 17 I spent in cooking the turtle; I found in herthree-
score eggs; and her flesh was to me at that time the most
savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had
no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid
place.

2710:: I8. Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought at
this time the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly, which I
knew was not usual in that latitude.

fune 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been
cold.

3'14>>: 20. No test all night, violent pains in my head, and
feverish.

film: 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with the appre-
hensions of my sad condition, to be sick and no help: Prayed to
GOD for the first time since the storm of? Hull, but scarce knew
what I said, or why; my thoughts being all confused.

yum 22. A little better, but under dreadful apprehensions of
sickness.

71m: 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a
violent headvach.

7'14": 24.. Much better.

1710!: 2 5. An ague very violent; the fit held me seven hours,
cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.

7101: 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my
gun, but found myself very weak; however I killed a she-goat,
and with much dificulty got it home, and broiled some of it,
and eat; I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but
had no pot.

71m: 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay a-bed all day,
and neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish for thirst, but
soweaklhadnotsuengthtosund up,ortogetmyselfany
water to drink: prayed to Goo again, but was light-heeded;
and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to
say; only I lay and cried, Lord, look upon me; Lord, pit} me,-
Lord, have mercy upon me : I suppose I did nothing else for two
or three hours, till the fit wearing 03", I fell asleep, and did not
wake till far in the night; when I waited I found myself much
refreshed, but weak and exceeding thirsty: however, as I had
no water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning,
and went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible
dream.

I thought that I was sitting on the ground on the outside of
my wall, where Isat when the storm blew after the earthquake,
and that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a
bright flame of fire, and alight upon the ground. He was all
' over as bright as a flame, so that I could but just beat to look
towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful,
impossible for words to describe; when he stepped upon the
ground with his feet I thought the earth trembled just as it had
done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked to my appre-
hension as if it had been filled with flashes of fire.

He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved for-
Wardtowards me,withalongspearorweaponinhishandto
kill me; and when he eame to a rising ground,atsome distance,
hespoketome,orlheardavoice so eurible,that itis impos-
Slbletoelrprasstheterrorofit; all that I can sayIundersmod
Was this, ' Seeing "411' than thing: have not brought Me: to repeat-
arm, now than .rlzalt die ,-' at which words I thought he lifined up
thespearthatwasinhishandtokillme.

No one, that shall ever read this account, will expect thatI
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible
vision; I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed
of those horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind, when I awaked, and
found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had received by
the good instruction of my father was then womout by an un-
interrupted series, for eight years, of sea-faring wickedness, and
a constant conversation with nothing but such as were like my-
self, wicked and profane to the last degree: I do not remember
that I had in all that time one thought that so much as tended
either to looking upwards towards GOD, or inwards towards a
reflection upon my own ways: but a certain stupidity of soul,
without desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely over.
whelmed me, and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,
wicked creature among our common sailors can be supposed to
be, not having the least sense, either of the far of Goo in danger,
or of thankfulness to Goa in deliverances.

In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be
the more easily believed, when I shall add, that through all the
variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had
so much as one thought of it being the hand of Goo, or that it

'was a just punishment for my sin, my rebellious behaviour '
against my father, or my present sins, which were great; or so
much as a punishment for the general course of my wicked life.
When I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of
Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what would

become of me; or one wish to Gen to direct me whither I
should go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently sur-
rounded me, as well from voracious creatures as cruel savage"
but I was merely thoughtless of a Goo, or at Providence; mil
like a mere brute from the principles ofNature, and by the
dictates of common sense only, and indeed hardly that.

When I was delivered, and taken up at sea by the Portugal
aptlin, well used, "and dealt justly and honour-ably with, as well
as charitably, I had not the least thankfizlness on my thoughts:
when again I was shipwrecked, mined, and in danger of drown-
ing on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it
as ajudgment; I only said to myself often, that I was an unfor--
tunate dag, and born to be always miserable.

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my
ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a
kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the
grace of Goo assisted, might have come up to true thankfulness;
but it ended where it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or,
as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least reflection
upon the distinguishing goodness of the hand which had pre-
served me, and had singled me out to be preserved, when all
the rest were destroyed; or an inquiry why providence had been
thus merciful to me; even just the same common sort of joy
which seamen generally have, after they have got safe on shore
from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the next bowl of
punch, and'forget, alstt asfin as it is over; and all the rest
of my life was like it.

Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made sen-
sible of my condition; howI was east on this dreadful place, out
of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect
of redemption; as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and
that I should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of
ofmy afliction wore off, and I began to be very easy, applied
myself to the. works proper for my preservation and supply,.and
was far enough from being amieted at my condition, as a judg-
ment from heaven, or as the hand of Goo against me: these
were thought: which very seldom entered into my head.

The growmg up of the com, as is hinmd in myjournal, had
at first some little influence upon me, and began to affect me
with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something miraculous
in it; but as soon as ever thatepart of thought was removed, all
the impression which was raised from it wore of also, as I have
noted already.

Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more tenible
in its nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible
power, which alone directs such things; yet no sooner was the
first fright over, but the impression it had made went of? also;'
I had no more sense of Goo, or his judgments, much less of the
present affliction of my circumstances being from his hand, than
if I had been in the most prosperous condition of life.

But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the
miseries of death came to place itself before me; when my spirits
began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature
was exhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, that
had slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach my-
self with my past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon
wickedness, provoked the justice of Got) to lay me under un-
common strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.

These reflections oppressed me from the second or third day
of my distemper, and in the violence, as well of the fever as of
the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words
from me, like praying to God, though I cannot say they were
either a prayer attended with desires, or with hopes; it was
rather the voice of mere fright and distress: my thoughts were
confused, the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror
of dying in such a miserable condition, raised vapours into my
head with the mere apprehensions; and, in these hurries of my
soul, I know not what my tongue might express. But it was
rather exclamation; such as, Lord! what a miserable cream!!!
am I! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help:
and what will become of me? Then the tears burst out of my
eyes, and I could say no more for a good while.
In this interval the good advice of my father came to my mind,
and presently his prediction, which I mentioned in the beginning
of this story; 'viz. That if I did take this flolieh step, God wauld
not bless nae, and I would have leisure hertfter ta reflect upon
having neglected his counsel, when there might be nane to am'xt in
my recovery. Now, said I aloud, my dear father's words are
come to pass: Goo's justice has overtaken me, and I have none
to help or hear me; I rejected the voice of Providence, which
had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I
might have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it
myself, not learn to know the blessing of it from my parents; I
left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn
under the consequences of it; I refused their help and assistance,
who would have lifted me into the world, and would have made
every thing easy to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle
with, too great for even nature itself to support, and no assist-
ance, no help, no comfort, no advice. Then I cried out, Lord,
he my help, for I an- in great distress!

This was the first prayer, if I may all it so, that I had made
for many years. But I return to my journal.

fine 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I
I had had, and the fit being entirely oil", I got up; and though
the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I con-
sidered, that the fit of the ague would return again the next day,
and now was my time to get something to refresh and support
myself when I should be ill; and the first thing I did, I filled a
large square case bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in
reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish disposition
of the water, I put about a, quarter of a pint of rum into it, and
mixed them together: then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh,
and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. 'I walked
about, but was very weak, and, withal, very sad and heavy-
lmrted under a sense of my miserable condition, dreading the

E
return of my distemper the next day: at night I made my sup-
per of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes,
and eat, as we call it, in the shell; and this was the first bit of
meatI had ever asked Goo's blessing to, even, as I could re-
member, in my whole life.

After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found myself so weak,
that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never Went out without
that), so Iwent but a little way, and sat down upon the ground,
looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very
calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these
occurred to me: -

What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen so much?
Whence is it produced? And what am I, and all the other crea-
tures, wild and tame, human and brutal; whence are we?

Sure we are all made by some secret power, who formed the
earth and sea, the air and sky; and who is that?

Then it followed, most naturally: it is Goo that has made it
all. Well, but then it came on strangely; if Goo has made all
these things, he guides and governs them all, and all things that
concern them; for the Being that could make all things, must
certainly have power to guide and direct them.

If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his works,
either without his knowledge or appointment.

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows
that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing
happens without his appointment, he has appointed all this to
befal me.

Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any of these
conclusions: and therefore it rested upon me with the greater
force, that it must needs be, that Goo had appointed all this to
befal me; that I was brought to this miserable circumstance by

his direction, he having the sole power, not of me only, but of
everything that happened in the world. Immediately it followed.

i
WhyhatGaddgnethietarne? What have Idoneto hethu:
used?

My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I
had blasphemed; and methought it spoke to me, like a voice;
Wretch ! dost that: ash what thou hast done ? Look back upon a
dreadful mispent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done?
Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? Why wert
than not drowned in Yarmouth Roads? killed in the fight when
the ship was taken by the Sallee man of war? devoured by the
wild heart: on the coast of Africa? or, drowned HERE, when all
the crew perished hut thyself? Dost thou ask, IVhat have I
done ?

I was struck with these reflections as one astonished, and had
not a word to say, no, not to answer to myself; but rose up
pensive and sad, walked back to my reheat, and went up over
my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts were
sadlydisturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down
in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now,
as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me
very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brasilia: take
no physio but their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I
had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was
quite cured, and some also that was green, and not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt! for in this chest I
found a cure both for soul and body! I opened the chest, and
found what I looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as the few books
I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the bibles which I
mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had not found lei-
sure, or so much as inclination, to look into; I say I took it
out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the
table.

Whatusetomakeofthe tobaccoI knewnogas tomydis-
flEtmper, or whether itwas good for itor no; but I tried several
experiments with it, as if I resolved it should hit one way or
other: I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth,
which indeed at firist almost stupified my brain, the tobacco being
green and strong, and that I had not been much used to it; then
I took some, and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and
resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I
burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the
smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as the
virtue of it, and I held almost to suffocation.

In the interval of this operation, I took up the bible, and be-
gan to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only having opened
the book casually, the first words that occurred to me were
these, Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee,
and than shalt glorify me.

The words were very apt to my case, and made some impres-
sion upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not
so much as they did afterwards; for, as for being delivered, the
word had no sound, a: I may say, to me; the thing was so re-
mote, so impossible in my apprehension of things, that I began
to say as the children of Israel did when they were promised
flesh to eat, Can Godrpread a tall: in the wilderneu ? so I began
to say, Can Goo himself deliver me from this place? And as it
was not for many years that any hope appeared, this prevailed
very often upon my thoughts; but, however, the words made a
very great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very
often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dazed
my head so much, that I inclined to sleep , so I left my
lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want any thing in the
night, and went to bed: but before I lay down, I did what I
never had done 1n all my life , I kneeled down and prayed to
Goo to fulfil the promise to me, that if I dulled upon him in the
day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my broken and
imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had
steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco,
that indeed I could scarce get'it down. ' Immediately upon-this
[went to bed, and I found presently it flew up- into my head
violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more, till
by the sun it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the after-
noon the next day; nay, to this hand ampartlyofthe opinion,
that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost three the
day after; for otherwise I knew not how I should lose a day. out
of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some
yws after-I haddone; forifI had lost it bycrossing andre-
crossing the line, I should have lost more than one day: but cer-
tainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way.

Be that however one way or other, when I' waited, I found
myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful.
When I got up, I was stronger than I was the day before, and
my stomach better; for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no
lit the next day, but continued much altered for the better. This
was the 29th.

The 30th was my well day, of course; and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not we to travel too far: I killed asu-
fowl or two, something like a brand goose, and brought them
home, but was not very forward to eat them: so I at some
more of the tnrtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening
I renewed the medicine which I had supposed did me good the
day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take
so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke: however, I was not so well the next day,
which was the first of fab, as I hoped I should have been; for
I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.

fab 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways, and dead
myself with it at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.

5w, 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though Idid not
recover my full strength for some weeles after. While I was thus
gathering strength, my thoughts run exceedingly upon the scrip-
ture, I will deliver thee; and the impossibility of my deliverance
lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it: but as
I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my
mind, that I pared so much upon my deliverance from the main
affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had received; and
I was, as it were, made to ask myself such questions as these;
viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sick--
ness? from the most distressed condition that could be, and that
was so frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it? had
I done my part? God had delivered me: but I had not glorified
him: that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that
as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater deliverance?

This touched my heart very much, and immediately I kneeled
down, and gave God thanks, aloud, for my recovery from my
sickness.

in!) 4. In the morning I took the bible; and, beginning at
the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed
upon myself to read awhile every morning and every night, not
tying myself to the number of chapters, but as long as my
thoughts should engage me: it was not long after I set seriously
to this work, but I found my heart more deeply and sincerely
affected with the wickedness of my past life; the impression of
my dream revived, and the words, All there things have not
brought thee to repentance, ran seriously in my thoughts. I was
earnestly begging of Goo to give me repentance, when it hap-
pened providentially the very day, that, reading the scripture, I
came to these words, He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to
give repentance, and to give remission. I threw down the book,
and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a
kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, Yen", thou Son of David,
yum, thou exalted Prime and Saviour, give me repentance! _
Thiswasthefirst time that I'oould say, inthe truesenseof.

the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed with
a sense of my condition, and with a true scripture view of hope,
founded on the encouragement of the word of Goo; and from
this time, I may say, I began to have hope that Gov would hear
me. .
Now I began to construe the words mentidned above " Call
on me, and I will deliver thee," in a difi'erent sense from what I
had ever done before; for then I had no notion of any thing
being ealled deliverance, but my being delivered from the eapti-
vity I was in; for though Iwasindeedatlarge inthe place, yet
the island was certainly a prison to me, and that, in the worst
sense in the world; but now I learned to take it in another sense.
Now I looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my
sins appwed so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of Goo,
but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my
comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so
much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was all
of no consideration, in comparison of this: and I add this part
here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come
to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance from sin a
much greater blessing than deliverance from afliiction.

But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as
to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind; and my
thoughts being directed by a constant reading the Scripture, and
praying to Got), to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal
of comfort within, which till now I knew nothing of: also astmy
health and strength returned, I bestirred myself to furnish my--
selfwitheverythingthatlwanted, andmakemywayofliving
as regular as I could.

From the 4th of 7:47 to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in
walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a. little at a
time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of
sickness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to
what weakness I was reduced. The appliation which I made
use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an
ague before; neither can I recommend it to any one to practise
by this experiment; and though it did carry off the fit, yet it
rather contributed to weaken me; for I had frequent convulsions
in my nerves and limbs for some time.

I learnt from it also this in particular, that being abroad in
the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that
could be, especially in those rains which eame attended with
storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came'in a
dry season was always most accompanied with such storms, so
I found this rain was much more dangerous than the rain which
fell in September and Octofier.

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months; all
possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human
shape had ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured
my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire
to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to see what
other productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.

It was the 15th of 71d} that I began to take a more particular
survey of the island itself; I went up the creek first, where, as I
hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I eame
about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and
that it was no more than a little brook of running water, and
very fresh and good; but this being the dry season, there was
hardly any water in some parts of it, at least not enough to run
in any stream, so as it could be perceived.

0n the bank of this brook I found many pleasant Java": or
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the
rising parts of them next to the higher grounds, where the water,
as it might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal
of tobacco; green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk:
there were divers other plants which I had no notion of, or on:
dersmnding about; and might perhaps have virtues of their own,
which I could not find out.

I searched for the carom root, which the Indian: in all that
climate make their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large
plants of aloes, but did not then understand them: I saw several
sugar canes, but wild, and for want of cultivation, imperfect. I
contenmd myself with these discoveries for this time, and me
back musing with myself what course I might take to know the
virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should
discover, but could bring it to no conclusion: for, in short, I
had made so little observation while I was in the Brasilr, that I
knew little of the plants of the field, at least very little that might '
servemetoanypurpose nowin-mydistress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and,

after going something farther than I had done the day before, I
found the brook and the savanna: began to case, and the coun-
try beeune more woody than before. In this part I found diffe-
rent fruits, and particularly -1 found melons upon the ground in
great abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread
indeed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just now
in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was asurprising dis-
covery, and I was exceeding glad of them, but I was warned
by my experience to eat sparingly of them, remembering that,
when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several
of our Englishmen who were slaves there, by throwing them into-
fluxes and fevers: but I found an excellent use for thwe grapes,
andthatwastocureordrythem in the sun and keep them as
dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as
indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to est,'when

nograpesmightbehad.
PS2
I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habi-
tation, which by the way was the first night, as I might say. I
had lain from home. In the night I took my first contrivance,
and got up into a tree, where I slept well, and the next morning
proceeded upon my discovery, travelling near four miles, as I
might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still due north,
with a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me.

At the end of this march I eamc to an opening, where the
country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of
fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran
the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so
fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being in a constant
verdure or flourishing of spring, that it looked like a planted
garden.

I descended a little on the side of that delicious valley, survey-
ing it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed with other
afflicting thoughts) to think that this was all my own, that I was
king and lord of all this country indefensibly, and had a right of
possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it in inherit-
ance, as completely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw
here abundance of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon, and Citron-
trees, but all wild, and few bearing any fruit; at least, not then:
however, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant
to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards
with water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and
refreshing.

I found new I had business enough to gather and earry home;
and resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and
lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was
approaching.

In order to do this I gathered a great heap of grapes in one
place, and a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of
limes and lemons in another place; and taking a few of each with
me, I travelled homeward, and resolved to come again, and bring
abagorsack,orwhatleouldmake,toearrytheresthome. ,

Accordingly, having spent three days-in this journey, I came
home (so I must now call my tent, and my cave); but before I
got thither, the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit,
and the weight of the juice, having broken them, and bruised
them, they were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they
were good, but I could bring but a few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest. But I was surprised,
when coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and line
when I gathered them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to
pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance
eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there were some wild
creatures .thereabouts, which had done this; but what they were
I knew not. .

However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps,
and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they
would be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed
With their own weight, I took another course; for I gathered a
large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches
of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun; and as for
the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I could Well
stand under. ,

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with
great pleasure on the fi-uitfiilnees of that valley, and the pleasant-
ness of the situation, the security from storms on that side-of the
water, and the wood; and concluded that I had pitched upon a
placeto {ix myabodewhichwas byfarthe worst partofthe
country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my
habitation, and to'look out for a place equally safe as where I
now was situamd, if pomible, in thatpleasant fruitful partof the
island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond
of it for some time, the pleasantnem of the place tempting me;
but when Leame to a nearer view of it, and to consider that I
was now by the sea-side, where it was at least possible that some-
thing might happen to my advantage, and that the same ill fate
that brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy wretches
to the same place; and though it was source probable that any
such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the
hills and woods, in the centre of the island, was to anticipate my
bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable, but
impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to
remove.

However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent
much of my time there for the whole remaining part of the
month of Yuly; and though, upon second thoughts I resolved as
above, not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and
surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and filled between
with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or
three nights together, always going over it with a ladder, as
before; so that I fancied now I had my country house, and my
sea-coast house: and this work took me up to the beginning of
August.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my
labour, but the rains came on, and made me stick close to my
first habitation; for though I had made me a tent like the other,
with a piece ofa sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a eave behind me to
retreat into when the rains were ext-aordinary.

About the beginning of dugust, a: I said, I had finished my
bower, and began to enjoy myself. The third of Augwt I found
the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were
excellent good raisins of the sun: so I began to take them down
from the trees, anditwasveryhappythat I didso; forthe rains
which followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best
partofmywinter food; for I hadabove two hundredlarge
bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and
earried most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain;
and from thence, which was the fourteenth of August, it rained
more or less every day, till the middle of October: and some-
times so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several
days.

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my
family: I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats,
who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead; and I
heard no more tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment,
she eame home about the end of Augurt, with three kitten. '
This was the more strange to me, because though I had killed a
wild cat, as I ealled it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a quite
different kind from our European eats; yet the young cats were
the same kind of house breed like the old one; and both my eats
being females, I thought it very strange: but from these three
eats,Iafterwardseameto besopeeteredwith eats, that Iwas
forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them
from my house as much as possible.

From the fourteenth of August to the twenty-sixth, incessant
rain, sothatIcouldnotstir,andwasnowveryearefulnottobe
much wet. In this confinement I began to be straitened for
food: but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat: and the
last day, which was the twenty-sixth, found a very large tortoise,
which was a treat tome; and myfoodwasregulated thus: Iest
a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh,
or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for to my great misfor-
tuneI hadnovessel toboilorstew anything),andtwo ortluee
of the turtle's eggs for supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked
daily two or three hours at enlarging my ave; and, by degrees,
worked it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of the
hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond my fence
or wall; and so I came inand out this way: but I was not per-
fectly easy at lying so open; for as I had managed myself be-
fore, I was in a perfect enclosure, whereas now I thought I lay
exposed; and yet I could not perceive that there was any living
thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had seen upon the island
being a goat.

September the thirtieth. I was now come to the unhappy
anniversary of my landing: I cast up the notches on my post,
and foundl had been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days.
I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious
exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with the most serious
humiliation, confessing my sins to Goo, acknowledging his righ-
teous judgments upon me, and praying to him to have mercy on
me, through Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least re-
freshment for twelve hours, even to the going down of the sun,
I then eat a biscuit-mke, and a bunch of grapes, and went to
bed, finishing the day as I began it.

I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for as at firstl
had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had after some time
omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than
ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what
any of the days were; but now, having east up the days as
above, I found I had been there a year; so I divided it into
weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I
found at the end of my account I had lost a day or two in my
reckoning.

A little after this my ink began tofail me, and so I contented
myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most
remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily mo-
~madam of other things
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now to appear
regular to me, andl leamedto divide them so as to provide for
them accordingly. But I bought all my experience before I had
it; andthislam going to relate,was oneofthe mostdiseou-

raging experiments that I made at all. I have mentioned, that
I had saved the few ears of barley and rice which I had so sur-

prisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and be-
lieve there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of
barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it after the
rains, the sun being in its mum position going fi'om me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well as I could,
with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed
my grain; but as I was sowing, it easually occurred to my thought,
that I would not sow it all at first, beeause I did not know when
was the proper time for it; so I sowed about two thirds ofthe
seeds, leaving about a handful of each. It was a great comfort
to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of that I sowed
this time eame to any thing; for the dry months following, the
earthhavinghad no rainafter the seedwassown, it had nomois-
ture to assist its growth, and never me up at all, till the wet
season had come again, and then itgrewasifit hadbeen newly
sown. -
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined
was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to
make another trial in; and I dug up a pieceofground near my
new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little
before the vernal equinox,- and this, having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and
yielded avery good crop; but having part ofthe seed left only,
andnotdaringtosowallthatihadyetfl hadbutasmall quan-
tity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peek of
each kind. > . '
Butby thisexperiencel was made master ofmy bmineas, and
knew exactly when the proper season was to sow; and that I
might expect two seed times, and two harvests every year.

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which
was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over,
and the weather began to settle, which was about the month of
Nwemeer, I made a visit up the country to my bower, where
though I had not been some months, yet I found all things just
as I left them. The circle or double hedge that I had made, was
not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut ofi" of
some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown
with long branches, as much as a willow tree usually shoots the
first year after lapping its head. I could not tell what tree to all
it that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very
well pleased, to see the young trees grow; and I pruned them,
and led them up to grow as much alike as I could, and it is
scarce credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into in three
years; so that though the hedge made a circle of about twenty--
five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now' eall
them, soon covered it; and it was a complete shade, sufiicient to
lodge under all the dry season.

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make
me a hedge like this in a semicircle round my wall, I mean that
of my first dwelling, which I did; and placing the trees or stakes
in a double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence,
they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habita--
tion, and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe
in its order.

I found now, that the seasons of the year might generally be
divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the
rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally thus:

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the
winds happened to blow; but this was the general observation I
made. After I had found, by experience, the ill consequence of
being abroad in the rain, I took are to furnish myself with pro-
vision beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out; and I
sat within doors as much as possible during the wet months.

In this time I found much employment, (and very suitable
also no the time) for I found great occasion ofmany things
which I had noway to fumish myselfwith, but by hard labour
and constant appliutitm: particularly, I tried many ways to
makemyselfabasket; but all thetwigs I couldgetforthe
purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy,
I used to take great delight in standing at a baht-maker's in
the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-
w'": and being, as boys usually are, very oflieious to help, and
1 great observer of the manner how they worked those things,
and sometimes lending a hand, I had by this means so. full know-
ledge of the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the
materials; when it came into my mind, that the twigs of that
tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be
as tough as the :allow: and willows, and fliers, in England; and
I resolved to try.

Accordingly the next day I went to my country house, as I
called it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to
my purpose as much as I could desire; whereupon I tame the
next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity,
which I soon found, for there was a great plenty of them: these
I set up to dry within my circle or hedges; and when they were
fit for use, I carried them to my cave; and here during the next
season I employed myself in making (a: well a: I could) a great
many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any
thing, as I had occasion; and though I did not finish them very
handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my
purpose; and thus afterwards I took care never to be without
them; and as my wider-ware decayed, I made more; especially
I made strong deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks,
when I should come to have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, ifpossible, how to sup-
ply twa wants. I had no vessels to hold any thing that was
liquid, except two rundlecs, which were almost full of rum, and
some gins bottles, some of the common size, and others which
were case'bottles square, for the holding of waters, spirits, (it.
I had not so much as a pot togboil' any thing in, except a great
kettle which I saved out of the ship, and which was too big for
such uses as I desired for it, viz. to make broth, and stew a bit
of meat by itself. The second thing Iwould fain have had, was
a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible for me to make one; how'-
cver I found a contrivance for that too at last.

I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes of
piles, and in this wicker work, all the summer, or dry season;
when another business took me up more time than it could be
imagined I could spare.

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the whole
island, and thatI had travelled up the brook, and so on to where
I built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea,
on the other side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite
zeros to the sea-shore on that side: so taking my gun, and
hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder and shot
than usual, with two biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins
in my pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When I had
passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within
view ofthe sea, to the west,- and it being averyclear day, I
fairly descried land, whether an island or continent I could not
tell; but it lay very high, extending from the West to the
W. S. W. at a very great distance; by my guess it could not be
less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be, other-
wisethan thatI knewitmust be part ofdmerim; and,asIcon-
eluded by all my observations, must be near the Spanish domi-
nions, and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where if I should
have landed, I had been in a worse condition than Iwas now;
and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of Providence,
which I began now to own, and to believe, ordered every thing
for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with this, and left
afllicn'ng myself with fruitless wishes of being there.

Besides, after some pause upon this afiair, I considered, that if
this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or
other, see some vwels pass or repass one way or other; but if
not, then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country '
and Brasil, which are indeed the worst of savages; for they
ate eannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour
allthehumanbodiesthatfallintotheirhands.

With these considerations I walked very leisurely forward. I
found that side of the island where I now was, much plusanter
than mine, the open or savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers
and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of
parrots, and fain would I have caught one, if possible, to have
kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after
some pains taken, catch a young parrot; for I knocked it down
with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home, but it
was some years before I could make him speak. However, at
last I taught him to call me by my name, very familiarly: but
the accident that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very
diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I found in the

low grounds, hares as I thought them to be, and foxes, but they
differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met with; nor

could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed several: but
I had no need to be venturous; for I had no want of food, and
of that which was very good too: especially these three sorts,
viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise; which, added to my
grapes, Laden/ml] market, could not have furnished a better table
than I, in proportion to the company: and though my case was
deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulnws, that]
was not driven to any extremities for food; but rather plenty,
even to dainties.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a
day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and returns, to
see what discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to
the place where I resolved to sit down for all night; and then
either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row
of stakes set upright in the ground, either from one tree to ano-
ther, or so as no wild creature could come at me without waking

me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that
I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island; for here
indeed the shore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas
on the other side I had found but threein ayear and a half.
Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many kinds, some
of which I had not seen before, and many of them very good
meat; but such as I knew not the names of, except those ealled
penguin. _

I' could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing
of my powder and shot: and therefore had more mind to kill a
she--goat, if I could, which I could better feed on: and though
there were many more goats here than on the other side 'of the
island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come

near them; the country being flat and even, and they saw me
much sooner than when I was on the hills.

I confess this' side of the country was much pleasanter than
mine, but yet I had not the least inclination to remove; for as I
was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me; and I
seemed all the while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a journey,
and (ion: home. However, I travelled along the shore of the sea
towards the cast, I suppose, about twelve miles; and then setting

up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would
go home again; and the next journey I took should be on the
other side of the island, :45! from my dwelling, and so round,

till I came to my post again. ofwhich in its place.
1 I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking

I could easily keep all the island so much in my view, that I
could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country;
but I found myself mistaken; for being come about two or
three miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley;
but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with woods,
that I could'not see which was my way by any direction but that
of the sun; nor even then, unless I knew very well the position
0f the sun at that timeofthe day.

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved
hazy for three or four days, while I was in this valley; and not
being able to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably,
and at last was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for my post,
and come back the same way I went; and then by easyjournies
I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot; and my
gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy.

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized
upon it; and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved
it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home, if I
could; for I had often been musing whether it might not be
possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of name goats,
which might supply me when my powder and shot should be
spent.

I made a collar for this little creature; and with a string which
I made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me,l
led him along, though with some difficulty, till I came to my
bower, and there I inclosed him, and left him; for I was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent above
a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into
my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed: this little
wandering journey, without a settled place of abode, had been so
unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to myself,
was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it ren-
dered every thing about me so comfortable, that I resolvedl
would never go a great way from it again, while it should be my
lot to stay on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and reg-ale myself after
my long Journey , during which, most of the time was taken up
in the weighty afi'air of making a cage for my Poll, who begin
now to be a mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted
with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid, which I
had pent in within my little circle, and resolved to go and {etc}!
it home, and give it some food: accordingly I went, and found
it where I left it; for indeed it could not get out, but was almost
starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of trees and
branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over; and
having fed it, I tied it as I did before to lead it away; but it was
so same with being hungry, that I had no needto havetiedit;
for it followed me like a dog; and as I continually fed it, the
creature beeame so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became '
fi-om that time one of my domestics also, and would never leave
me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and
I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as
before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island, having
now been there two years, and no more prospect of being delivered
than the first day I came there. I spent the whole day in humble
and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies
which my solitary condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave
humble and hearty thanks, that Goo had been pleased to discover
to me, even that it was possible I might be more happy in this
solitary condition, than I should have been in at liberty of society,
and in all the pleasures of the world: that he could fully make
up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state and the want of
human society, by his presence, and the communications of his
grace to my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me
to depend upon his providence here, and hope for his eternal
presence hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy
the life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than
the wicked cursed abominable life I led all the past part of my
days; and now, having changed both my sorrows and my joys,
my very desires altered, my afi'ections changed their gust, and
my delights were perfectly new from what they were at first
coming, or indeed for two years past.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for view-
ing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would
break out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would die
within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I
was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal
bolts and bars of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without
redemption. In the midst of the greatest composures of my
mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and made me
wring my hands, and weep like a child. Sometimes it would
take me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit
down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two
together; and this was still worse to me; for if I could burst
out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go off, and the
grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I
daily read the word of GOD, and applied all the comforts of it to
my present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the
bible upon these words, " I will never, never leave thee, nor for-
sake the: .' " Immediately it occurred, that these words were to
me, why else should they be directed in such a manner, just at
the moment when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of G00 and man? Well then, said I, if Goo does not
forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it,
though the world should all forsake me; seeing on the other
hand, if I had all the world, and should lose the favour and
blessing of Goo, there would be no comparison in the loss.

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind, that it
was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary
condition, than it was probable I should ever have been in any
other particular state in the world; and with this thought I was
going to give thanks to GOD for bringing me to this place.

I know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at
that thought, and I durst not speak the words. How canst than
be such an hypocrite (said I, even audibly), to pretend to be
thankful fora condition, which, however thou mayest endeavour
to be contented with, thou wouldest rather pray heartily to be
delivered from? So I stopped there; but though I could not
say I thanked Goo for being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks
to Gov for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences,
to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for my
wickedness, and repent. I never opened the bible, or shut it,
but my very soul within me blessed Goo for directing my friend
in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my
goods; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the
wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year;
and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so par-
ticular an account of my works this year as at the first, yet in
general it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle; having
regularly divided my time, according to the several daily employ-
ments that were before me; such as, jinx, my duty to G00, and
reading the scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time
for, thrice every day. Strand] , the going abroad with my gun
for food, which generally took me up three hours every morning
when it did not rain. Thirdly, the ordering, curing, preserving,
and cooking what I had killed or caught for my supply. These
took up great part of the day. Also it is to be considered, that
in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the
violence of the heat was too great to stir out; So that about four
hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to
work in; with this exception, that sometimes I changed my
hours of hunting and working, and went to work in the morning,
and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added
the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which,
for want of tools; want of help, and want of skill, every thing
that I did took up out of my time: for example, I was Full two-

r
and-forty days making me a board for a long shell, which I
wanted in my cave; whereas two sawyers, with their tools and

saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half
a day.

Myeasewasthis: Itwastobealarge treewhich was tobe
cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. The tree
I was three days a cutting down, and two more cutting ofl" the
boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hcwing, I reduced both the sides of it
into chips, till it began to be light enough to move; then I
turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat, as a board,
from end to end: then turning that side downward, cut the other
side till I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and
smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my
hands m such a piece of work; but labour and patience carried
me through that and many other things; I only observe this in
particular, to shew the reason why so much of my time went
away with so little work, <<#2. That what might be a little to be
done with help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a pro-
digious time to do alone, and by hand.

But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I went
through many things, and indeed every thing that my circum-
stances made necessary for me to do, as will appear by what
follows.

I was now in the months of November and December, expecting
my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured or dug
up for them was not great; for, as I observed, my seed of each
was not above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost one
whole crop by sowing in the dry season; but now my crop
promised very well, when on a sudden I found I was in danger
of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was
searce possible to keep from it; at first, the goats, and wild
creatures which I called hares, which, tasting the sweetness of the
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it
sodas, thatitcouldgetnotimetoshootupineosmlks.

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an inclosure about
itwithahedge,which I did with a greatdoal oftoil; and the
more, because it required a great deal of speed; the creatures
daily spoiling my corn. However, as my arable land was but
small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about
three weeks time; and shooting some of the creatures in the day-
time,Isetmydog toguuditinthenighgtyinglfimuptoa
stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night long:
so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the corn
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.

But as the beasts mined me before, while my corn was in the
blade, so the birds were as like to ruin me now, when it was in
the ear; for going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw
my little crop surrounded with fowls of I know not how many
sorts, which stood as it were watching till I should be gone. I
immediately let fly among them, (for I always had my gun with
me.) I had no sooner shot, but there arose up a little cloud of
fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that in a few days
they would devour all my hopes: that I should be starved, and
neverbeabletoraiseacropatall; ande to doIoould not
tell; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though
I should watch it night and day. In the first place, I went among
it to see what damage was already done, and found they had
spoiledagooddeal ofit; but that, as itwasyettoogreen for
them, the loss was not so great, but the remainder was like to be
a good crop, ifit could be saved.

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easilyseethethieves sittinguponall themesaboutme,asif
they only waited till I was gone away, and the event proved it
tobeso; forastalkedofi',asifIwasgone,Iwasnosooner
out of their sight, but they dropped down one by one into the corn
again. I was so provoked, that I could not have patience to stay
till more came on, knowing that every grain that they eat now
was, a: it might be said, a peck loaf to me in the consequence;
but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of
them. This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and
served them as we serve notorious thieves in England, w'z. hanged
them in chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine
almost, that this should have such an effect as it had; for the
fowls would not only not come at the corn, but in short they
forsook all that part of the island, and I could never see a bird
near the place as long as my searecrows hung there.

This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about the
latter end of Deumhr, which was our second harvest of the year,
I reaped my com.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down,
and all I could do was to make one as well as I could, out of one
of the broad-swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms
out of the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I had no
great difficulty to cut it down: in short, I reaped it my way,
for I cut nothing of? but the ears, and earried it away in a great
basket which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands:
and at the end of all my harvesting I found, that out of my half-
peck of seed, I had near two bushels of rice, and above two
bushels and a half of barley, that i: to my, by my guess, for I
had no measure at that time.

However, this was a great encouragement to me; and I fore-
saw that in time it would please GOD to supply me with bread:
and yet here I was perplexed again; for I neither knew how to
grind or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it, and
part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it; and if
how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These things
being added to my desire of having a good quantity for store,
andtosecure aconstnnt supply, I resolved not to taste anyof
this crop, but to preserve it all for wed against the min season,
and in the mean time to employ all my study and hours of mrk--
ing to accomplish this great work of providing myself with com
and breed.

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my breed. It IS
a little wonderfirl, and what I believe few people have thought
much upon, viz. the strange multitude of little things necessary
in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and finish-
ing, this one article of bread.

I, thatwasreducedtoamere stateofnature, foundthisto be
my daily discouragement, and was made more and more sensible
of it every hour, even after I got the first handful of seed corn,
which, as I have said, wne up unexpectedly, and indeed to a
surprise.

First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade or shovel
to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade,
as I observed before, but this did my work in but a wooden
manner; andthoughitcostme agreet manydays to make it,
yet for want of iron, .it not only wore out the sooner, but made
my work the harder, and made it be performed much worse.

However, this I bore with too, and was content to work it out
with patience, and bar with the badness of the performance.

When it wasgrowing or grown, I have observed already how
many things I wanted, to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure
or wryit home, thresh, part it from the chaff, and ssve it. Then

it into breed, andanoven to bake it in; and all these things I
didwithougasshall beobserved; andyetthecornwasan
inestimable comfort and advantage to me too: but all this, as I
said, made every thing laborious and tedious to me, but that there
was no help for; neitherwas my time so much loss to me, beeause
I had divided it. A certain part of it was every day appointed
to these works; and as I resolved to use none of the corn for
bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next six
months to apply myself, wholly by labour and invention, to
furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all the
operations necessary for the making the corn, when I had it, fit
for my use.

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough
to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's
work at least to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was
a very sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required double
labour to work with it; however, I went through that, and sowed
my seeds in two large flat pieces of ground, as near my house as I
could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge,
the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which I had set
before, which I knew would grow; so that in one year's time I
knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would want but
little repair. This work was not so little as to take me up less
than three months ; beeause great part of that time was in the wet
season, when I could not go abroad.

Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I
found employment on the following occasion, always observing,
that all the while I was at work, I diverted myself with talking to
my parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly learnt him
to know his own name; at last, to speak it out pretty loud, Poll;
which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island by'any
mouth but my own. This therefore was not my work, but an
assistant to my work; for now, asI said, I had a great employ--
ment upon my hands, as follows: viz. I had long studied, by
some means or other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which
indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them :
however, considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt
but if I could find out any such clay, I might batch up some
such pot, as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough, and
strong enough, to bear handling, and to hold any thing thatwas
dry, and required to be kept so; andasthiswas necessary in
preparing corn, meal, at. which was the thing I was upon, I
resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand
like jars to hold what should he put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to
tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste, what odd
misshapen ugly things I made, how many of them fell in, and
how many fell out, the clay not being still" enough to bear its
own weight; how many cracked by the over violent heat of the
sun, being set out too hastily; and how many fell to pieces with
only removing, as well before as after they were dried; and, in
a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig
it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not make
above two large earthen ugly things, I cannot call them jars, in
about two months labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I
lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two
greater wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for them,
that they might not break; and, as between the pot and the
basket there was a little room to spare, I stufl'ed it full ofthe rice
and barley straw; and these two pots being to stand always dry,
I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal when
the corn wm bruised.

. Though I misearried so much in my design for large pots, yet
I madeseveial smaller things with better success; such as little
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my
hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked'them strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my end, Which was to get an
earthen pot to hold what was lit'piid, and beer the fire, which none
of these could do. It happened after some time, making a pretty
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after
I had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthen--
warevessels in the fire, burnt as hardas astone,andred asa
tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself, that
certainly they might be made to burn whole, if they would burn
broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it
burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the pot-
ters burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had some
lead to do it with; but I placed three large pipkins, and two or
three pots, in a pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood
all round it, with a great heap of embers under them: I plied
the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till
I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and observed
that they did not crack at all: when I saw them clear red, I let
them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the sand
which was mixed with the clay, melted by the violence of the
heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone on; so I
slacked my fire gradually, till the pots began to abate of the red
colour; and watching them all night, that I might not let the
fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good, I will
not say handsome pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard
burnt as could be desired; and one of them perfectly glazed with
the running of the sand.

After this experiment I need not say that I wanted no sort of
earthen-ware for my use; but I must nwds say, as to the shapes
of them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose,
when I had no way of making them, but as the childrenmake -
dirt-pies, or as a woman would make pies that never learnt to

raise paste.

did not see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most
difficult thing, so much as but to think on; forte be sure, I had
nothing like the necessary things to make it with; I man fine
thin canvass, or stuff, to scarce the meal through. And here I
was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know what
to do: linen I had none left but what was mere rags; I had
goat's hair, but neither knew I how to weave or spin it; and had-
I known how, here were no tools to work it with. All the
remedy that I found for this, was, that at last I did remember I
had among the seamen's clothes, which were saved out of the
ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with some pieces
of these I made three small sieves, but proper enough for the
work: and thus I made shift for some years; how I did after--
wards, I shall shew in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how.
I should make bread when I came to have corn; for, first, I had
no yeast. As to that part, as there was no supplying the want, so
I did not concern myself much about it. But for an oven, I was
indeed in great pain. At length I found out an experiment for
that also, which was this: I made some earthen vessels very
broad, but not deep; that is to say, about two feet diameter, and
not above nine inches deep; these I burnt in the fire, as I had
done the other, and laid them by: and when I wanted to bake, I
made a great fire upon the hearth, which I had paved with some
square tiles of my own making and burning also; butI should
not call them square.

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into embers or
live coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover
it all over; and there I let them lie, till the hearth was very hot :
then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves;
and whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers
all round the outside of the pot, to keep in, and add to the heat:
and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my
barley-loaves, and became in a little time a mere pastry-cook into
thebargain; forImademyselfseveralcakasoftherieenndpud--
dings; indeed I made no pics, neither had I any thing to put into
them, supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up
mostpartofthethirdyearofmyabode here; foritistobeob--
served, that in the intervals ofthese things, I had my new harvest
and husbandry to manage: for I reaped my corn in its season,
and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the w,
inmylargebaskets,till I had time to rub itout; for I hadno
floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.

And now indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted
to build my barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay it up in; for
the increase of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had of
the barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or
more; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to use it freely,
for my bread had been quite gone a great while: also I resolved
to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, and
to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and
rice were much more than I could consume in ayear; so I
resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that I sowed
the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me
with bread, (it.

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had
seen fi'om the other side of the island; and I was not without

secret wishes that I was on shore there, fancying that seeing the
main land, and in an inhabited country, I might find some way or
other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some
means of eseape. '
But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such
a condition, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and
perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the
lions and tigers of Africa : that if I once eame into their power,
I should run a hazard more than a thousand to one of being
killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the
people of the Caribean coasts were cannibals, or men-eaters; and
I knew by the latitude that I could not be far off fi-om that
shore: that, suppose they were not cannibals, yet they might kill
me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been
served, even when they had been ten or twenty together; much
more I that was but one, and could make little or no defence.
All these things, I say, which I ought to have considered well of,
and I did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took none of
my apprehensions at first; and my head ran mightily upon the
thoughts of getting over to that shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long boat with the
shoulder--of--mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand
miles on the coast of flfrica; but this was in vain. Then I
thought I would go and look on our ship's boat, which, as I have
said, was blown up upon the shore a great way in the storm,
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where she did at
first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves,
and the winds, almost bottom upwards, against the high ridge of
a beachy rough sand, but no water about her as before.

If I had hands to have refitted her, and have launched her into
the water, the boat would have done well enough, and I might
have gone back into the Brad]: with her easily enough; but I
might have easily foreseen, that I could no more turn her, and
set her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove the island.
However I went to the wood, and cut levers and rollers, and
brought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could do;
suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her down, I might
easily repair the damage she had received, and she would be a
very good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.
' 'Isparednopainsindeedinthis pieceoffmitlesstoil,andspent,
I think, three or four weeks about it: at last finding it impossible
to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the
sand to undermine it; and so to make it fall down, setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or
to get under it, much less to move it forwards towards the water;
501 was forced to give it over: and yet, though I gave over hopes
of the boat, my desire to venture over for the main increased,
rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was not possible
to make myself a canoe or periagua, such as the natives of those
climates make, even without tools, or as I might say, without
hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought
possible, but easy; and pleased myself extremely with my
thoughts of making it, and with my having much more con-
venience for it than any of the negroe: or Indian: ; but not at all -
considering the particular inconveniences which I lay under more
than the Indian: did, viz. want of hands to move it into the
water, when it was made; a difficulty much harder for me to
surmount than all the consequences of want of tools could be to
them; for what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast tree
in the woods, I might with great trouble cut it down, if, after I
might be able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into a
proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it
hollow, so to make a boat of it; if, after all this, I must leave it
just there where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the
water ?

One would have thought, I could not have had the least reflec-
tion upon my mind of my circumstances, while] was making my
boat, but I should have immediately thought how I should get
it into the see: but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage
over the sea in it, that I never once considered how I should get
it of the land; and it was really in it's own nature more easy'for
me to guide it over forty--five miles of sea, than about forty-five
fathom of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this boat: the most like a fool that ever
man did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself
with the design, without determining whether I was ever able to
undertake it; not but that the difiiculty of launching my boat
came often into my head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it by this foolish answer which I gave myself; Let mefirst
make it, I will warrant I will find some way or other to get it
along when it i: done.

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of
my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and felled a cedar nee;
I question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the
building the temple of yerusalem; it was five feet ten inches
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven
inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it
lessened for a while, and then parted into branches. It was not
without infinite labour that I felled this tree; I was twenty days
hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; Iwas fourteen more
getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading head of it
cut ofl", which I hacked and hewed through with my axe and
hatchet, with inexprsssible labour; after this it cost me a month
to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the
bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do.
It cost me near three months more to clear the inside, and work
it out so as to make an exact boat of it; this I did indeed without
fire, by mere mallet and. chisel, and by the dint of hard labour;
till I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big
enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently
big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted
with it: the boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a canoe
6r poring", that'was made ofone tree, in my life; my aweary
stroke ithadcost,youmaybesure,forthereremainednothing
but to get it intothewater; and hadI gotten it intothewater,I
make no question but I should have begun the maddest voyage,
and the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was under-
taken. ~ '

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though
they cost infinite labour too; it lay about one hundred yards
from the water, and not more; but the first inconvenience was,
it was up hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this dis-
couragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and
so make a declivity; thisI began, and it cost me a prodigious
deal of pains: but who grudge pains that have their deliverance
in view ? But when this was worked through, and this dificulty
managed, it was still much at one; for I could no more stir the
canoe than I could the other boat. , .

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut
a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I
could not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this
work, and when I began to enter into it, and ealculated how deep
it was to be dug, how broad, how the stufi' to be thrown out, I
found that by the number of hands I had, being none but my
own, it must have been ten or twelve years before I should have
gone through with it; for the shore lay high, so that at the upper
end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so at length,
though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though too late, the
folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before
we judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and
with as much "comfort, as ever before; for by a constant study,
and serious application of the word of GOD, and by the assistance
of his grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had
before; I entertained different notions of things; I looked now
upon the world as a thing remote; which I had nothing to do
with, no expectation from, and indeed no desires about: in a
word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to
have; so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it
hereafter, 'viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it;
and well I might say, as father Abraham to Dives, Between me
and thee there i: a great gulph fixed.

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of
the world here: I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust qf the
eye, or the pride of Ii e : I had nothing to covet, for I had all I
was now mpable of enjoying: I was lord of the whole manor;
or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the
whole country which I had possession of: there were no rivals:
I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command
with me; I might have raised ship--loadings of corn, but I had
no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my
occasion: I had tortoises, or turtles enough; but now and then
one was as much as I could put to any use: I had timber enough
to have built a fleet of ships; I had grapes enough to have made
wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when
they had been built.

But all I could make use of, was all that was valuable: I had
enough to eat, and to supply my wants, and what was all the
rest to me? If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must
eat it, or the vermin; if I sowed more com than I could eat, it
must be spoiled: the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on

the ground, I could make no more use of them than for fuel;
and that I had no occasion for, but to dress my food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me,
upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world are no
farther good to us than as they areforour use: andthatwhat--
ever we may heap up indeed to give to others, we enjoy as much
asweeanuse,_andno more. Themost covetousgi-ipingmiser
in the world would have been cured of the vice of covetousnes,
ifhehadbeeninmyease; forI Winfinitelymorethanl
knewwhattodowith. I had no room fordesire, areeptitwas
of things which I had not, and they were but u-ifles, though
indeed ofgreatusetome. I had, as I hinted before,apa.reel
of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty--six pounds sterling;
alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner
of business for it; and I often thought with myself, that I would
have given a handful of it-for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a
hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for
six-penny worth of nmu'p and corral seed out of England, or for
a handful ofpea: and beam, and a bottleof ink: "it was, I
had not the last advantage by it, or benefit from it; but there
it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave
inthewet season; and ifI hadhadthedrawerfilll ofdiaznonds,
ithad beenthesamease; and theyhad beenofno mannerof
value to me, because of no use.

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself
than itwasat first, and mucheasier to mymind, aswcll as to
my body. I frequently sat down to my meat with thmkfiilnaaa,
and admired the hand of 6013's providence, which had thus spread
my table in the wilderness. I learned to look more upon the
bright side of my condition, and less upon the dark side; and
to consider what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; and this
gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot express
them; and which I take notice of here, to put thmc discontented
people in mind of it, who eannot enjoy comfortably what Goo
has given them,beeause theyseeandcovetsomethingthathe
has not given them: all our discontent: about what we want ap-
pearedtome tospringfrom thewant ofthankfulneas forwhat

we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would
be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was;
and this was, to compare my present condition with what I at
first expected it should be; nay, with what it would certainly
have been, if the good providence of Goo had not wonderfully
ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore, where I not only
could come at her, but could bring what I got out of her to the
shore for my relief and comfort; without which I had wanted
tools to work, weapons for defence, or gunpowder and shot for
getting my food.

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to
myself in the most lively colours how I must have acted, if I had
got nothing out of the ship; how I could not have so much as
got any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it was long
before I found any of them, I must have perished first: that I
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage: that
if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no way
to slay or open them, or part the flesh from the skin and the
bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and
pull it with my claws, like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present condition,
with all its hardships and misfortunes: and this part also I can-
not but recommend to the reflection of those who are apt in their
misery to say, I: any afllim'on like mine? Let them consider,
how much worse the cases of some people are, and what their
case might have been, if Providence had thought fit.

I had another reflection which assisted me also to comfort my
mind with hopes; and this was, comparing my present condition
with what I had deserved, and had therefore reason to expect
from the hand of Providence; I had lived a dreadful life, per-
fectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of Goo: I had been
well instructed by my father and mother; neither had they beenwanting to me in their early endeavoms, to infuse a religious awe
of Goo into my mind, a sense of my duty, and of what the nature
and end of my being required of me. But, alu! falling early
into the sea--faring life, which of all the lives is the most destitute
of the fear of Goo, though his terrors are always before them;
I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring com-
pany, all that little sense of religion which I had entertained, was
laughed out of me by my messmates; by a hardened despising
of dangers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to me;
by my long absence from all manner of opportunities to converse
with any thing but what was like myself, or to hear any thing of
what was good, or tended towards it.

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliverances
I enjoyed, such as my eseape from Sallee, my being taken up by
the Portuguese master of the ship, my being planted sowell in
Brasil, my receiving the eargo from England, and the like, I
never once had the words Thank Gad, so much as on my mind,
or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress, had I so much
thought as to pray to him; nor so much as to say, Lord, have
mercy upon me! No, nor to mention the name of Goo, unless it
was to swear by, and blaspheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I
have already observed, on the account of my wicked and hardened
life past; and when I looked about me, and considered what
particular providencss had attended me, since my coming into
this place, and how Goo had dealt bountifully with me; had
not only punished me less than my iniquity deserved, but had so
plentifully provided for me; this gave me great hopes that my
repentancewas accepted, and that GOD had yet mercies in store
for me.

With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to
resignation to the will of GOD in the present disposition of my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my condi--
tion; and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to com-
plain, seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins; that I
enjoyed so many mercies, which I had no reason to have ex-
pected in that place; that I ought never more to repine at my
condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily
bread which nothing but a cloud of wonders could have brought:
that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a miracle, even
as great as that of feeding Elfin by ravens; nay, by a long series
of miracles; and that I could hardly have named a place in the
uninhabited part of the world, where I could have been cast
more to my advantage: a place where, as I had no society,
which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no ravenous
beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no veno--l
mous creatures, or poisonous, which I might have fed on to my
hurt; no savages to murder and devour me.

In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was
a life of mercy another: and I wanted nothing to make it a life
of comfort, but to be able to make my sense of Goo's goodness
to me, and care over me in this condition, be my daily consola-
tion; and after I did make a just improvement of these things, I
went away, and was no more sad.

I had now been here so long, that many things which I brought
'on shore for my help, were either quite gone, or very much
wasted, and near spent.

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but
a very little, which I eked out with water a little and a little, till
it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the
paper: as long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the
days of the month on which any remarkable thing happened to
me; and first, by casting up times past, I remembered that there
was a strange concurrence of days, in the various providences which
befel me, and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to
observe days as fatal or fortunate, Imight have hadreasonto
have looked upon with a great deal 'of curiosity.

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away
from my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull in order to
gotosea,thesame day afterwardsI wastaken bythe Salleeman
of war, and made a slave. '

The same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of
that ship in Tamar/z Roads, that same day of the year after-
wards I made my escape from Salk: in the boat.

The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the 20th of
Septmler, the same day I had my life so miraculously saved 26
years after, when Iwas east on shore in this island; so that my
wicked life, and solitary life, both began on a day.

The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that of my
bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship. This
I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but one sake
of bread a day, for above a year: and yet I was quite without
bread for near a year before I got any corn of my own; and great
reason Ihadtobe thankful thatlhadany atall,the getn'ngit
being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.

My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to linen, I had
had none a good while, except some chequered shirts which I found
in the chests of the other seamen, and which I earefiilly preserved,
because many times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt;
and itwas a very great help to me, that I had amongall the
men's clothes of the ship almost three dozen of shirts. There
were also several thick watch-coats of the seamen's, which were
left indeed, but they Were too hot to wear; and though it is true,
that the weather was so violent hot that there was no need of
clothes, yet I could not go quite naked; no, though'I had been
inclined to it, which I was not; nor could I abide the thoughts
of it, though I was all alone.

One reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could not
bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked, as with some
clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin;
whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and
whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it:
no more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the
sun without a cap or a hat; the heat of the sun heating with
such violence as it does in that place, would give me the head-
ach presently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap
or hat on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on my
hat, it would presently go away.

Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few
rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order; I had worn
out all the waisteoats I had, and my business was now to try if I
could not make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had
by me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set to work
a-tailoring, or rather indeed a-botching; for I made most piteous
work of it. However, I made shift to make tWO or three waist-
coats, which I hoped would serve me a great while; as for
breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed, till
afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and I had hung them
up stretched out with sticks in the sun; by which means some
of them were so dry and hard, that they were fit for little; but
others, it seems, were very useful. The first thing I made of
these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside
to shoot of the rain; and this I performed so well, that after
thisI made a suit of clothes wholly of those skins; that is to
say, a waistcoat and breeches open at the knees, and both loose;
for they were rather wanted to keep me cool, than to keep me
warm. I must not omit to acknowledge, that they were wretch--
edly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor.-
however, they were such as I made very good shift with ; and
wheanasabroad,ifithappenedtorain,thehairofthewaist~

Afterthislspentadeal oftimeandpainstomake mean
umbrella: Iwas indeed in greatwant ofone, and hadagreat
mind to make one; I had seen them made in the Brasils, where
they arevery useful in the great heamwhich are there; andI
felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being
nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad,
it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as the
heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a great while be-
fore I could make any thing likely to hold; nay, after I thought
I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to
my mind ; but at last I made one that answered indifi'erently well;
the main difficulty I found was to make it to let down. I could
make it to spread ; but if it did not let down too, and draw in,
it would not be portable for me any way, but just over my head,
which would not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one
to answer; I covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it
cast 087 the rain like a pent--house, and kept 08" the sun so efi'ec-
tually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather, with
greater advantage than I could before in the coolest; and when
I had no need of it, I could close it, and carry it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably. my mind being entirely
composed by resigning to the will of G01), and throwing'myself
wholly upon the disposal of his Providence: this made my life
better- thansociable; forwhen Ibegantoregretthewantof
conversation, I would ask myself. whether thus conversing mu-
tually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope, I may say, with
even Goo hirnselfibyejaeulations,wasnotbetterthanthe utmost
enjoyment of human society in the world?

I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any cam-aordinary
thinghappened to me; but I lived oninthe me course, inthe
samepostureandplacejmtasbefore; theehiefthinglwn
employed in, besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I always kept upjust
enough to have sufficient stock of the year's provisions before-
hand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily labour of
going out with my gun, I had one labour to make me a canoe,
which at last I finished: so that by digging a canal to it, six feet
wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half
a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly big, as I made it with-
out considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should be
able to launch it; so never being able to bring it to the water, or
bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as
a memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time. Indeed the
next time though Icould not get a tree proper for it, and was
in a place where I could not get the water to it, at any less dis--
tance than, as I have said, of near half a mile; yet as I saw it
was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and though I was
near two years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes
of having a boat to go off to sea at last.

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size
of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view,
when I made the first; I mean of venturing over to the term
firma, where it was above fortymilcs broad; accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and
now I thought no more of it. But as I had a boat, my next
design was to make a tour round the island; for as I had been
on the other side, in one place, crossing, as I have already de-
scribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in that journey,
made me very eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I
had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, and that I might do every thing- with dis--
cretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat,
and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails,
which lay in store, and of which I had a great store by me.

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found
she would sail very well. Then I made little lockers and boxes
at each end of my boat, to- put provisions, necessaries, and am-
munition, 69"". into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or the spray
of the sea; and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside of
the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down
over itito keep it dry.

I fixed myumbrella alsoin astcp at the stern, like a mast, to
stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun ofi" me, like
an awning; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage
upon the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little
creek; but at last, being eager to view the circumference of my
little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accordingly I
victualled my ship for the voyage; putting in two dozen of my
loaves (cakes I should rather eall them) of barley-bread; an
earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I eat a great deal of; a
little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder with shot for killing
more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned
before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests; these I took, one
to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.

It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign,
or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage,
and I found it much longer than I expected: for though the
island itself was not very large, yet when I eame to the east side
of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues
into the sea, some above water, some under it; and beyond this
a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more; so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that point.

When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprize, and come back again, not knowing how far it might
oblige me to go out to sea, and above all, doubting how I should
getbackagain; soIcametoan anchor, forlhadmademea
kind of an anchor, with a piece of broken grappling which I got
out of the ship.

a
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went on shore,
climbing up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where
I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea. from that hill where I stood, I per-
ceived a strong, and indeed, a most furious current, which ran to
the cart, and even came close to the point; and I took the more no-
tice of it, because I saw there might be some danger, that when
I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength of
it, and not be able to make the island again. And indeed, had
I not gotten first upon this hill,I believe it would have been so;
for there was the same current on the other side of the island,
only that it set it off at a farther distance; and I saw there was
a strong eddy under the shore; 301 had nothing to do but to
get out of the first current, and I should presently be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days; because the wind blowing
pretty fresh (E. at S. E. and that being just contrary to the said
current) made a great breach of the sea upon the point; so that
it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the
breach, nor to go too far off because of the stream.

The third day in the morning, the wind having abated over
night, the sea was calm, and I ventured; but I am a warning--
piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I
come to the point, when I was not my boat's length from the
shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water, and a current
like the sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along with it wid:
such violence, that all I could do could not keep her so much as
on the edge of it: but I found it hurried me farther and farther
out from the eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no
wind su'rring to help me, and all that I could do with my paddles
signified nothing: and now I began to give myself over for lost;
for, as the current was on both sides the island, I knew in a
few leagues distance they must join again, and then I was irree
coverably gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it: so
that I had no prospect before me but of perishing; not by the
mforthatwasmlmenough,butofstarvingforhunger_. I
had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could
lift, andhad tosseditinto the boat; and I had a greatjarof
fresh water, thatis to say, oneof my earthen pots; butwhat was
all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure,
there Was no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand leagues
at least!

And now I saw how easy it was for the Providence of Goo to
make the most miserable condition that mankind could be in
wont. Now I looked back upon my desolate solitary island, as
the most pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness my
heart could wish for, was to be there again. I stretched out my
handstoitwitheagerwishcs; Ohappydwert, saidI,I shall never
see thee more ! 0 miserable creature ! said I, whither am I going?
Then I reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and how
I had repined at my solitary condition; and now what would I
give to be on shore there again! Thus we never see the true state
of our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor
know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is
scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being
driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to
be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagus, and in the utmost
despair of ever recovering it again: however, I worked hard, till
indeed my strength was almost exhausted; and kcptlmy boat as
much to the northward, that is, towards the side of the current
which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as
the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt alittle breeze of wind
in my face, springing up from the 8. SEE. Th's cheered my
heanahtdeandspeciallywheninabouthalfanhourmore, it
blewaprettysmallgentlegale. Bythistimelwasgotwnata
frightful distance from the island; and, had the'last cloud or
hazyweathcr intervened, I had been undone anotherwaytoo;
for I had no compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards the islahd, if I had but once lost
sight of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to
get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to the
north as much as possible, to get out of the current.

Justas I had setmymastandsail,andtheboatbegan to
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water, some
alteration of the current was near; for where the current was so
strong, the water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I
found the current abate, and presently I found to the east, at
about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks; these
rocks I found caused the current to part again; and as the main
stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rock, and
made" a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west with
a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them
upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to
murder them, or who have been in such like extremities, may
guess what my present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put
my boat into the stream of this eddy; and the wind also freshen--
ing, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running cheerfully before
the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more towards
the northward than the current lay, which earried me away at
first; so that when I came nearthe island, I found myself open
to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the
island, opposite to that which I went out from.

When I had made something more than a league of way by
the help of this current or eddy, I found itwas spent, and served
me no farther. However, I found, that being between the two
great currents, viz. that on the south side which had hurried me
away, and that on the north, which lay about two leagues on the
otherside; I say, between these two, in the westoftheisland,I
found the water at last still, and running no way; and having
still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for
the island, though not making such fresh way as I did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about a
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which ocea-
sioned this distance, stretching out as is described before, to the
southward, and casting ofi' the current more southerly, had of
course made another eddy to the north; and this I found very
strong, but not directly setting the way my course lay, which was
due west, but almost full north. However, having a fresh gale,
I stretched across this eddy, slanting north--west, and in about an
hour came within about a mile of the shore: it being smooth
water, I soon got to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave Goo
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of
my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a little
cove that I had espied under some trees, and laid me down to
sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.

I was now at a great loss which waytoget homewith my
boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew too much the ease,
to think of attempting it by the way I went out; and what
might be at the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not,
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I only
resolved in the morning to make my way westward along the
shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay up my
fi-iga'teinsafety,soastohave heragainifIwanted her. In
about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to
a Very good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed fill
it came to a very little rivulet, or brook, where I found a con-
venient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been
in a little dock made on purpose for her: here I put in, and
having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to look about
me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I
had been before when I travelled on foot to that shore ; so taking
nothing out of my boat but my gun and my umbrella, for it was
exceeding hot, I began my march: the way was comfortable
enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached
my old bower in the evening, where I found every thing standing
as I left it; for I always kept it in good order, being, as I said
before, my country-house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest
my limbs, for I was very wary, and fell asleep: but judge you,
if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be in,
when I was awaked out of my sleep by a voice ealling me by
my name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin
Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are you?
Where have you been?

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or
paddling, as it is called, the first part of the day, and walking the
latter part, that I did not awake thoroughly; and dozing between
sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to
me: but as the voice continued to repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin
Crusoe, at last I began to awake more perfectly, and was at first
dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost consternation:
but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on
the top of the hedge, and immediately knew that this was he
that spoke to me; forjust in such bemoaning language I had
used totalktohim,andteachhim; andhehad learned itso
perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and lay lfis bill close
to my face, and cry, Poor Robin Crusoe, Where are you?
Where haveyou been ? How come you here ?---and such things as
I had taught him.
However, even though I knew itivas the parrot, and. that
indeed it could be nobody else, itwas a goodwhile before I could
eomposemyself. First,Iwasarnazedhowtheaeuturegot
thither, and then how he should just keep about the place, and
no where else: but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but
honest Poll, I got it over; and holding out my hand, and filling
him by his name, Pull, the sociable creature came to me, andsat
upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued bulking to me,
Poor Robin Crusoe, and how did I mu here ? and where had I
been? just as ifhe had been overjoyed to see me again; andso
I carried him home along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to seu for some time, and
had enough to do for many days to sit still, and reflect upon the
dangerI had been in. Iwouldhavebeenverygladtohave
had my boat again on my side of the island, but I knew not how
it was practicable to get it about. As to the east-side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough there was
no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and my
verybloodrunchill, but tothinkofit; andastotheothersideof
the island, I did not know how it might be there; but supposing
the current ran with the same force against the shore at the east,
as it passed byitontheother, I mightrunthe sameriskofbeing
driven dowu the stream, and carried by the island, asI had been
before ofbeing carried away from it: so with these thoughts I
contented myself to be without any boat, though it had been the
product of so many months labour to make it, and of so many
moretogetitintotheseu.

In this governmentofmy temperI remainedneurayeur,lived
averysedateretiredlife,asyoumaywellsuppose; andiny
thoughts being very much composed, as to my condition, and
fiillyeomforted himgningmyselftothedispensationsofPi-ovi-
dence, I thought I lived really very happily in all things except
that of society.
I improved myself, in this time, in all the mechanic exercises
which my necessities put me upon applying myself to; and I
believe could, upon occasion, have made a very good carpenter,
especially considering how few tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my
earthen-ware, and contrived well enough to make them with a
wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better, because I made
things round and shapmble, which before were filthy things
indeed to look on. But I think I never was more vain of my.
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I found out, than
for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a
very ugly clumsy thing when it was done, and only burnt red
like other earthen-ware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would
draw the smoke, I was excwdingly comforted with it; for I had
been always used to smoke, and there were pipes in the ship, but
I forgot them at first, not knowing there was tobacco in the
island; and afterwards when I searched the ship again, I could
not come at any pipes at all.

In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and made abun-
dance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention shewed me,
though not very handsome, yet convenient for my laying things
up in, or fetching things home in. For example, if I killed a
goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and
cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and the like by
a turtle: I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two
of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in
a basket, and leave the rest behind me: also large deep baskets
were my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed out as soon
as it was dry, and cured; and kept it in great baskets instead of
a granary. .

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; and
this was a want which it was impossible for me to supply: then
I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should have
nomore powder; thatistbsay,howlshoulddotokillany

kid grew an old goat; and I could never find inmyhearttokill

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, a I
have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study
some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not
eatch some of them alive; and particularly I wanted a she.goat
great with young.

Tothispurposelmadesnaresto hamper-them; and believe
they were more than once taken inthem; butmytacklewas not _
good, for I had no wire, and always found them broken, and my
bait devoured.

AtlengthIresolvedtotryapit--fall; so I dug several large
pitsin the earth,inplaceewhereIhadobwvedthegoats used
to feed, and over these pits I placed hurdles of my own making
too, with a great weight upon them ; and several times I put ears
of barley, and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I could
easily perceive that the goats had gone in, and eaten up the corn,
for I could see the mark of their feet: at length, I set three traps
in one night, and going the next morning, I found them all scand-
ing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very discouraging;
however, I altered my trap , and, not to trouble you with par-
ticulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found in one of
them a large old he-goat; and, in one of the others, three kids,
a male and two females.

he had been fi-ightened out of his wits; but I did not then know
what I afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a lion: if I
had let him stay there three or four days without food, and then
have carried him some water to drink, and then a little corn, he
would have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are mighty
sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at
that time; then I went to the three kids; and taking them one
by one, I tied them with strings together; and with some difli-
culty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be
tame: and now I found that if I expected to supply myself with
goat's-flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some
up tame was my only way, when perhaps I might have them
about my house like a flock of sheep.

But then it presently occurred to me, that I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when
they grew up; and the only way for this was to have some
inclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale,
to keep them in so efi'ectually, that those within might not break
out, or those without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as I
saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it, my first piece of
work was to find out a proper piece of ground; viz. where there
'was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink,
and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such enclosures, will think I had very
little conn'ivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper forall
these, being a plain open piece of meadow-land, or menu (as
our people all it in the western colonies) which had two or
three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was very
woody; I say they will smile at my foremst, when I shall tell
themIbeganmyenclosingoftbispieceofgroundinsucha
manner, that my hedge, or pale, must have been at last two miles
about; norwas the-madness ofit sogratastotheeompass;~for
ifit was ten miles about, I was like tohave timeenongh to do it
in; but I did not consider, that my goats would be as wild inso
much compass, as if they had had the whole island; and I should
have so much room to chase them in, that I should never utch
them.

My hedge was began and carried on, I believe, about fifty
yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped
short, and for the first beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of
about 150 yards in length, and 100 yards in breadth, which as
it would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable
time, so, as my dock increased, I could add more ground to my
enclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with
courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece;
and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the best part
of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible, to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and carry them some
cars of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my
hand; so that after my enclosure was finished, and I let them
loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for
a handful of com.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had
a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years
more I had three-and-forty, besides several that I took and killed
for my food; and after that I enclosed five several pieces of
ground to fwd them in, with little pens to drive them into, to
take them as I wanted them; andgasesoutofonepiece of
ground into another.

But thiswas not all; for now I not only had goat'svflesh' to
feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing which indeed in
my beginning I did not so much as think of, and which, when
it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise; for
now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of
milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies of food to
every creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it, so
I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or
cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a great many
essays and misearriages, made me both butter and cheese at last,
and never wanted it afterwards.

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his creatures, even
in those conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in
destruction ! How can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and
give us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons! What a
table was here spread for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing
at first but to perish for hunger!

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my little
family sit down to dinner: there was my majesty, the prince and
lord of the whole island; I had the lives of all my subjects at.
absolute command; I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it
away, and no rebels among all my subjects!

Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, attended
by my servants ! Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the
only person permitted to talk to me; my dog, which was now
grown old and crazy, and found no species to multiply his kind
upon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side
the table, and one on the other, expecting now- and then a bit
from my hand, as a mark of special favour.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at
first; for they were both of them dead, and had been interred
near my habitation by my own hands; but one of them having
multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these were two
which I preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild into the woods,
and beeame indeed troublesome to me at last; for they would
often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last I was
obliged to shootthem,anddid killagreat many; atlcngththey
left me with thisattendance, and in this plentifiilmannerllived;
neither could I be said towant any thing but society, andofthat,
insometimeafierthis,lwasliketohavetoomuch.

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use
of my boat, though very loth to run any more hazard: and
therefore sometimes I sat conniving ways to get her about the
island, and at other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go
down to the point of the island, where, as I have said in my last
ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the
current set, that I might see what I had to do: this inclination
increased upon me every day; and at length I resolved to travel
thither by land, and following the edge of the share, I did so:
but had any one in England been to meet such a man as I was,
it must either have frighted them, or raised a great deal of laugh-
ter; and as I frequentlystood still to look at myself, I could not
but smile at the notion of my travelling through 1" orb/tire with
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a
sketch of my figure, as follows:

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's-skin, with a
flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me, as
toshoot the minofi'from running into my neck; nothing being
so hurtful in these climates, as the rain upon the flesh under the
clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's-skin, the skirts coming down to
about the middle of my thighs: and a pair of open-kneed
breechesofthesame: the breechesweremadeoftheskinofan
old lie-gm, whose hair hung down such a length on either side,
that,likepataloon:, it reachedtothemiddlcofmylegs. Snick-
ingsandshoalhadnone;but1mademeapairofsomething,
Isesroekmwwhattoesll them,like buskins, toflap overmy
legs,andlaoeon_eithersidelikespamdashes; butofamost
barbarousshape, asindeedwereallthcrestofmyclothss.
I had on a broad belt of goat's-skin dried, which I drew,
together with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and
in a kind of frog on either side of this, instead. of a sword and
dagger, hung a little saw and hatchet; one on one side, one on
the other: I had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the
same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at the end of
it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's-
skin too; in one of which hung my powder, in the other my
shot: at my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun,
and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's-skin umbrella, but

'wllich, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me,
next to my gun: as for my face, the colour of it was really not
so Mulam like, as one might expect from a man not at all care-
ful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox.
My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter
of a yard long ; but as I had both scissars and razors sufficient,
I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip,
which I had trimmed into a large pair of Malmnetmr whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some 'I'urk: whom I saw at Sallee:
for the Moor: did not wear such, though the T urk: did. Of these
mustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to
hang my hat upon them; but they were of length and shape
monstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed
for frightful.

But all this is by the bye; foras to my figure, I had so few to
observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence; so I say
no more to that part: in this kind of figure I went my new
journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first along the
sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought my boat to
an anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and, having no boat now
to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way, to the same
height that I was upon before ; when looking forward to the point
of the rock which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with
myboat,asI saidabove,Iwassurprisedtoseetheseaallsmooth
and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there
than in other places.

Iwasatastrangeloss tounderstand this, and resolved to
spend some time in the observing of it, to see if nothing from
the sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently con-
vinced how it was; viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and Joining with the current of waters from some great
river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current; and that
according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west, or from
the north, this current came nearer, or went farther from the shore ;
for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again,
and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current
again as before, only that it ran farther 03", being near half a
league from the shore; whereas in my use, it set close upon the
shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which at
another time it would not have done.

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do but
to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might
very easily bring my boat about the island again: but when I
began to think of putting it in practice, I hadsuch a terror upon
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that
I could not think of it again with any patience; but on the con-
t1ary,I took up another resolun'on, which was more safe, though
more laborious ; and this was, that I would build, or rather make
me another periagua, or canoe ; and so have one for one side of
the island, and one for the other.

Youaretounderstand, thatnowI had,asI maycallit,two
plantations in the island; one my little fortification or tent, with
the wall about it under the rock, with the cave behind me, which
by this time I had enlarged into several apartments or eaves, one
within another. One of these, which was the driest and largst,
andhadadooryet beyondmywallorfortifimtion,thatisto
say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was all filled up'
with large earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and
with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold five or
six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of provision, espe-
cially my corn, some in the ear cut of? short from the straw, and
the other rubbed out with my hands.

As for my wall, made a: before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least appear-
ance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land,
and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn ground;
which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded
me their harvest in its season; and whenever I had occasion for
more com, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had now a tolerable
plantation there also; for first, I had my little bower, as I called
it, which I kept in repair; that i: ta say, I kept the hedge which
circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder
standing always in the inside: I kept the trees, which at first
were no more than my stakes, but were now grown very firm
and tall; I kept them always so cut, that they might spread and
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which
they did effectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had
my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread over
poles set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair
or renewing; and under this I had made me a. squab or couch,
with the skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft
things, and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-
bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me ;.
and here, whenever I had oceasion to be absent from my chief
seat, I took up my country habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to.
say, my goats: and as I had taken aninoonceivable deslofpains
to fence and enclose this ground, Iwas so uneasy to see it kept
entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never left 03',
till with infinite labour I'hsd stuck the outside of the hedge so '
full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather
a pale than a hedge, and there wasscarce roomto putahand
through between them, which afterwards, when those stakes grew,
as they all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure
strong, like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared
no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my
comfortable support; for I considered the keeping up a breed of
tame creatures thus at my hand, would be a living magazine of
flesh, milk, butter, and cheese, for me, as long as I lived in the
place, if it were to be. forty years; and that keeping them in my
reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to
such a degree that I might be sure of keeping them together;
which by this method indeed I so efi'ectually secured, that when
these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very
thick, I was forced to pull some of them up again.

In this place also I had my grapss growing, which I principally
depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never
failed to preserve very earefully, as the best, and most agreeable
dainty of my whole diet; and indeed they were not only agree-
able, but physieal, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to. the
last degree.

As this was also about half way between my other habitation
and the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid and
lay here in my way thither; for I used frequently to visit my
boat, and I kept all things about or belonging to her in very
good order: sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but
no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor searee ever above a
stone's east or two from the choral was so apprehensive of.
being hurried out of my knowledge-again by the currents, or
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene
of my life.

It happened one day about noon, going towards my boat, I
was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot
on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand. I
stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition.
I listened, I looked round me, I could hear nothing, nor see any
thing; I went up to a rising ground to look farther. I went up
the shore, and down the shore, but it was all one, I could see no
other impression but that one. Iwent to it again to see if there
were any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy, but
there was no room for that, for there was exactly the very print
of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it came thither
I knew not, nor could in the least imagine. But after innume~
rable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused, and out
of myself, I came home to my fortification, not feeling, as we
say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree, look--
ing behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking every bush
and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to be a man:
nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes an
afi'righted imagination represented things to me in; how many
wild ideas were formed every moment in my fancy, and what
strange unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughm by the
way.

When I came to my castle, for so I think I called it ever after
this, I fled into it like one pursued; whether I Went over by the
ladder, as first contrived, 'or went in at the hole in the rock,-
which I called a door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I re-
member the next morning ; for never frighted hare fled to cover,
or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat.

I had no sleep that night: the farther Iwas from the occasion
of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were; which is some-";- r:

thingsonbarytothenatureofsuchtlfingsnndespeciallytothe
usualpractioeofall creaturesin fear. Butlwassoembarrassed
with my own frightful ideas ofthe thing, that I formed nothing
butdismalimaginationsm myself, even thoughIwasnowa
great way of it. Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil;
and reason joined in with me upon this supposition. For how
should any other thing in human shape come into the place?
Where was the vessel that brought them? What marks were
there of any other footsteps? And how was it possible a man
should come there? But then to think that Satan should take
human shape upon him in such a place, where there could be no
manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot
behind him, and that even for no purpose too (for he could not
be sure I should see it), this was an amazement the other way.
I considered that the devil might have found out abundance of
other ways to have terrified me, than this of the single print of
a foot. That as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he
would never have been so simple to leave a mark in a place
where it was ten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or
not; and in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea upon
a high wind would have defaced entirely. All this seemed in.
consistent with the thing itself, and with all notions we usually
entertain of the subtlety of the devil.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of
all apprehensions of its being the devil. And I presently con-
cluded that it must be some more dangerous creature; viz. That
it must be some ofthe savages of the main land over against me,
who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either driven
by the currents, or byeontrary winds, had made the island; and
had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea, being as
loth, perhaps, to have staid in this desolate island, as I would
have been to have had them.

While thmc reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was very-
thankful in my thought, that I was so happy as not to be there-
abouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by which
they would have concluded, that some inhabitants had been in
the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me. Then ter-
rible thoughts racked my imaginations about their having found
my boat, and that there were people here; and that if so, I
should certainly have them come again in greater numbers, and
devour me; that if it should happen so that they should not find
me, yet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry
away all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for
mere want. .

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope : all that former
confidence in GOD which was founded upon such wonderful ex-
perience as I had had of his goodness, now vanished; as if he
that had fed me by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his
power the provision which he had made for me by his goodness.
I reproached myself with my easinms, that would not sow any
more com one year, than would just serve me till the next season,
as if no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop
that was upon the ground. And this I thought so just a reproof,
that I resolved for the future to have two or three years corn
before--hand, so that whatever might come, I might not perish
for want of bread.

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man!
And by what secret differing springs are the affections hurried
about, as differing circumstances present! To-day we love what
to--morrow we hate; to--day we seek what to-morrow we shun;
to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at
the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in me at this time,
in the most lively manner imaginable; for 1, whose only affliction
was, that I seemed banished from human society, that I was
alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off from man-
kind, and condemned to what I call a silent life; that I was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among
the living, or to appear among the rest of his creatures; that to
have seen one of my own species, would have seemed to me a
raising me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could
bestow; I so}, that I should now tremble at the very apprehen-
sions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground, at
but the shadow, or silent appearance of a man's having set his
foot on the island!

Such IS the uneven state of human life , and it afforded me a
great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a little
recovered my first surprise. I considered that this was the
station of life the infinitely wise and good providence of Goo
had determined for me; that as I could not foresee what the
ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dis-v
pute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted
right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he
thought fit; and who, as I was a creature who had offended him,
had likewise ajudicial right to condemn me to what punishment
he thought fit; and that it was my part to submit to bear his
indignation, because I had sinned against him.

I then reflected that Goo, who was not only righteous, but
omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me,
so he was able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do
it, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and
entirely to his will. And, on the other hand, it was my duty
also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the dic-
tates and directions of his daily providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may
say, weeks and months; and one particular efect of my cogita-
tions on this occasion I cannot omit; viz. one morning early,
lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from
the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed me very much;
upon which those words of the scripture me into my thoughts,
Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me.

Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not
only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray ear.
nestly to Goo for deliverance. When I had done praying, I took
up my bible, and opening it to read, the first words that pre-
sented to me, were, Wait on the Lord, and he afgood cheer, and
he shall strengthen thy heart: wait, I my, on the Lord. It is
impossible to express the comfort this gave me; and in return,
I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more sad; at least,
not on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflec-
tions, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this might be
a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the print
of my own foot, when I came on shore fi'om my boat. This
cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade myself it
was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my own foot;
and why might not I come that way from the boat as well as I
was going that way to the boat? Again, I considered also, that I
could by no means tell for certain where I had trod, and where
I had not; and that, if at last this was only the print of my own
foot, I had played the part of those fools, who strive to make
stories of spectra and apparitions, and then are themselves frighted
at them more than any body else.

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again; for
I had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so
that I began to starve for provision; for I had little or nothing
within doors, but some barley-mkes and water. Then I knew
that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in great pain and
inconvenience for want of it; and indeed it almost spoiled some
of them, and almost dried up their milk.
Hearteningmyselfthereforewith the belief, thatthiswas
nothing but the print of one of my own feet, (and so I might
betrulysaidto startatmyown shadow),Ibegantogoabroad
again, and went to my country-house to milk my flock; but to
see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind
me, how I was ready, every now-and-then, to lay down my
basket, and run for my life; it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had been
lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed I had.

However, as I went down thus two or'three days, and having
seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there
was really nothing in it but my own imagination; but I could
not persuade myself fully of this, till I should go dowu to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my
own, and see if there was any similitude or fimess, that I might be
assured itwas my own (but. But when I came to the place, first, it
appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could
not possibly be on shore any where thereabouts. Secondly, when
I eame to measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot
not so large by a great deal. Both these things filled my head
with new imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the
highest degree; so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague,
and I went home again, filled with the belief that some man or
men had been on shore there; or, in short, that the island was
inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware; and
what course to take for my security, I knew not.

0 what ridiculous resolutions men take, when possessed with
fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason

offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was,
totluowdownmyenclosures,andtum all my taniecattlewild
into the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and then
frequent the islandin prospectofthe same,or the like booty;
then to the simple thing of digging up my two com-helm, that
they might not find such a grain there, and <<film be'prompted
to frequent the island; then to demolish my bower and tent,
that they might not see any vestiges of my habitation, and be
prompted to look farther, in order to find out the persons in-
habiting.

These were the subjects of the first night's cogitation, after
I was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so
over-run my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was fill]
of vapours, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times
more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes;
and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much than the evil
which we are anxious about; but, which was worse than all this,
I had not that relief in this trouble from the resignation I used to
practise that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul,
who complained not only that the Philirtine: were upon him, but
that Gov had forsaken him; for I did not now take due ways
to compose my mind, by crying to Goo in my distress, and
resting upon his providence, as I had done before, for my defence '
and deliverance: which if I had done, I had at least been more
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps carried
through it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night; but
in the morning I fell asleep, and having by the amusement of my
mind been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept
very soundly, and awaked much better composed than I had ever
been before. And now I began to think sedately; and, upon
the utmost debate with myself, I concluded, that this island,
which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from
the main land than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned
as I might imagine. That although there were no stated inha-
bitants who lived on the spot; yet that there might sometimes
come boats off from the shore, who either with design, or per-
haps never but when they were driven by cross winds, might
come to this place.
Thatlhadlivedherefifceenyearsnow,andhadnotmetwith
the least shadowor figure of any people before; andthatifat
any time they should be driven here, it was probable they went
awayagainassoonasever they could,sceingtheyhadnever
thought fit to fix there upon any occasion, to this time.

That the most I could suggest any danger from, was, from
any such casual accidental landing of straggling people from the
main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were
here against their wills; so they made no stay here, but went off
again with all possible speed, seldom staying one night on shore,
lest they should not have the help of the tides and day-light back
again; and that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider
of some safe retreat, in use I should see any savages land upon
the spot.

~Nowaegan sorelytorepentthatlhaddug myeuvesolarge,
as to bring a door through again, which door, as I.said, came
, out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock. Upon

maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a
second fortification, in the manner of a semicircle, at a distance
from my wall, just where I had planted a double row of trees
about twelve years before, of which I made mention: these
trees having been planted so thick before, there wanted but a
few piles to be driven between them, that they should be thicker
and stronger, and my wall would be soon finished.

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and every thing I
could think ofto make it strong; having in it seven little holes,
about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of
this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, continually
bringingeerthoutofmyeave, and laying it at the footofthe
wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes I con-
trived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I got
seven on shoreoutofthe ship; thee, I say, Iplanted libemy

n
cannon, and fitted them into frames that held them like a carriage,
thatsoIcoddfireallthesevengunsintwominutestime: this
wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never
thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall,
for a great way every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the
drier-like wood, which I found so aptto grow, as they could well
stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near twenty thou-
sand of them, leaving a pretty large space betWeen them and my
wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they might
have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to ap-

proach my outer wall.

Thus in two years time I had a thick grove; and in five or
six years time I had a wood before my dwelling, grown so mon--
strous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable;
and no man of what kind soever would ever imagine that there
was any thing beyond it, much less a habitation: as for the way
I proposed myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue) it was
by setting two ladders; one to a part of the rock which was low,
and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon
that; so' when the two ladders Were taken down, no man living
could come down to me without mischiefing himself; and if
they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer
wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest
for my own preservation; and it will be seen at length, that they
were not altogether without just reason; though I foresaw no-
thing at that time more than my mere fear suggested.

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my
other afi'airs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little
herd of goats; they were not only a present supply to me upon
every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, without the
expense of powder and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my
huntingafterthewildones; andlwaslothtolosetheadvantage
ofthem,andtohavethemalltonurseupoveragain.

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think but
of two ways to preserve them: one was to find another conve>>
nient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them into it
every night; and the other was to enclose two or three little bits
of land, remote from one another, and'as much concealed as I
could, where I might keep about half a dozen young goats in
eachplace; sothatifanydisasterhappenedtotheflockin
general, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble
and time: and this, though it would require a greatdeal of time
and labour, I thought was the most rational design.

Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private
indeed as my hea'rt could wish; for it was a little damp piece
of ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where,
as is observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to
come back thatwayfrom theeastempartoftheisland: here I
found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with
woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least it did
not want near so much labour to make it so, as the other pieces
of ground I had worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and in
less than a month's time I had so fenced it round, that my flock
or herd, call it which you please, which were not so wild now as
atfirsttheymightbesuppowdtobe,werewellenoughsecmed
in it. So without any farther delay, I removed ten she-goats
and two he--goats to this piece; and when there, I continued to
perfect the fence, till I hadmade it as secure asthe other, which,
however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by
a great deal.

Allthislahourlwas atthe expense ofipurely fi'orn myappre--
hensions on the account of the print of a man's footwhich I had
seen; for as yet, I never saw any human creature come near the
island; and I had now lived two years under these uneasinetses,
which indeed made my life much less comfortable than it was
before; as may well be imagined, by any who know what it is
to live in the constant snare of the fear of man: and this I must
observe with grief too, that the discomposure of my mind had
too great impressions also upon the religious part of my thoughts;
for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages and
cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in
a due temper for application to my Maker; at least, not with
the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to
do. I rather prayed to Goo as under great affliction and pressure
of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every night
of being murdered and devoured before the morning; and I
must testify from my experience, that a temper of peace, thank-
fulness, love and affection, is much more the proper frame for
prayer than that of terror and discomposure; and that under the
dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a com--
forting performance of the duty of praying to GOD, than he is
for repentance on a sick-bed; for these discomposurss afi'ect the
mind as the others do the body; and the discomposure of the
mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body,
and much greater, praying to Goa being properly an act of the
mind, not of the body.

But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my little
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another
private place, to make such another deposit; when wandering
more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea at
a great distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one
of the seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship; but I had
it not about me; and this was so remote, that I could not tell
what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not
able to look any longer: whether it was a boat, or not, I do not
know; butasI descended from the hill, I couldseenomore of
it, so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more without a
perspective glass in my pocket.

When I was come down the hill, to the end of the island,
where indeed I had never been before, I was presently convinced,
that theseeingtheprintofaman'sfoot,wasnotsuchastrange
thing in the island as I imagined; and, but that it_;was a special
Providence that I was east upon the side of the island where the
savages never eame, I should easily have known, that nothing
was more frequent than for the muse: fi'om the main, when they
happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that
side of the island for harbour; likewise, as they often met and
fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners,
would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their
dreadful customs, being all tannibalr, they would kill and eat
them: of which hereafter.

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above,
being the S. W'. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded
and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of
my mind, at seeing the shore spread with skullsyhands, feet, and
other bones of human bodies; and particularly I observed a place
where there hadbeenafiremade, anda circleduginthe earth,
like a cock-pit, where it is supposed the savage wretches had sat
down to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-
creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that] enter--
tained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long
while; all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such
a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the de-
generacy of human nature; which, though I had heard of often,
yet IneVer hadso nearaviewofbefore: inshort,Iturned away
my face from the horrid spectacle, my stomach grew sick, and
I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the
disorder from my stomach, and, having vomited with an un-
common violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to
stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the hill again with
all the speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation.

When I eame a little out of that part of the island, I stood
still awhile as amazed; and then recovering myself, I looked up
with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears
in my eyes, gave Goo thanks, that had east my first lot in a part
of the world where Iwas distinguished from such dreadful crea-
tures as these; and that though I had esteemed my present con-
dition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it,
that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of 3. and
this above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of himself, and the hope of his
blessing, which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to
all the misery which I had suffered or could suffer.

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my eastle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circum-
stances, than ever I was before; for I observed, that these
wretches never Came to this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting any
thing here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered
woody part of it, without finding any thing to their purpose. I
knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw
the least footsteps of a human creature there before; and might
be here eighteen more as entirely conceded as I was now, if I did
not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of oceasion
to do, it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed
where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than can-
nibal: to make myself known to.

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches
that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman
custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I
condoned pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle
for almosttwo years after this: when I say my own circle, I
mean by it my three plantations, viz. my castle, my country-
seat, which I ealled my bower, and my enclosure in the woods;
nordidIlook afterthisforanyother use than as anenclosure
for my goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to thwe
hellish wretcheswas such, that I was as fearfirl of seeing them as
of using the devil himself; nor did I so much as go to look
aftermyboatinall thistime, butbeganrathertothinkof
making me another; for I could not think of ever making any
more attempts to bring the other host round the island to me,
lest I should meet with some of those creatures at sea, in which,
if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what
would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had, that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear of?
my uneasiness about them; and I began to livejust in the same
composed manner as before; only with this difference, that I
used morecaution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them; and
particularly, I was more eautious of firing my gun, lest any of
them being on the island should happen to hear it; and it was there-
fore as very good providence to me, that I had furnished myself
with a tame bmd of goats, thatI had no nwdto hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did eatch any more
of them after this, it was with traps and snares, as I had done
before: sothatfortwoyearsafterthis, Ibelieve I neverfi'red
my gun. once ofl', though I 'never went out without it; and,
which was more, as I had saved three pistols 'out of the'ship, I
always earried'them out with me, or at least two of them, stick;
ing them in my goat-skin belt. I likewise furbished up onevof
the great cutlasses that I hadoutofth'e ship,andmademe a
belt to put it in also; so thathasnowamostformidable
fellow to look at when I went abroad, ifyou add to the fonner
description of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a great
broad--sword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a seab-
bard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed,
excepting these eautions, to be reduced to my former ealm sedate
way of living; all these things tended to show me more and
more how far my condition was from being miserable, compared
to some others; nay, to many other particulars of life, which it
might have pleased Got) to have made my lot. It put me upon
reflecting, how little repining there would be among mankind, at
any condition of life, if people would rather compare their con-
dition with those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than
be always comparing them with those which are better, to assist
their murmurings and complainings.

As in my present condition there were not really many things
which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been
in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in
for my own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention
for my own conveniences; andI had dropt a good design, which
I had once bent my thoughts upon; and that was, to try if I
could not make some of my barley into. malt, and then try to
brew myself some beer: this was really a whimsieal thought,
and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I pre-
sently saw there would be the want of several things necessary
to the making my beer, that it would be impossible for me to
supply; as, first, easks to preserve it in, which was a thing that,
as I have observed already, I could never eompm; no, though
I spent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting
it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to make
it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make
it boil; and yet, had not all these things intervened, I mean the
flights andcerrors I wasin aboutthesavages,l hadundermken'
it, and perhaps broughtit to pass too; for I seldom gavean'y
thing over without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my
head enough to begin it.

But my invention now ran quite another way; for night and
day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of
these monsters in their cruel bloody entertainment, and ifpossi--
ble, save the victim they should bring hither to destroy. It
would take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended
tobe,tosetdownallthecontrivanceslhatched,orrad1er
brooded upon in my thoughts, for the destroying thwe creatures,
or at least fiightening them, so as to prevent their coming hither
any more; but all was abortive; nothing could be possible to
take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself," and what
could one man do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts, or their bows
and arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I
could with my gun?

Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place where
they made their fire, and put in five or six pounds of gunpowder,
which when they kindled their fire, would consequently take
fire, and blow up all that was near it; but, as in the first place
I should be very loth to waste so much powder upon them, my
store being now within the quantity of a barrel, so neither could
I be sure of its going off at any certain time, when it might sur-
prise them; and, at best, that it would do little more'than just
blow the fire about their ears, and fright them, but not suficient
to make them forsake the place; so I laid it aside,'and then
proposed, that I would place myself in ambush, in some conve-
nient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and in the
middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should
besureeokillorwoundperhapstwoorthree at mint;
and thmfalling inupon themwithmy threepiscolsandmy

sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should
kill them all: this fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks,
and I was so full of it that I often dreamt of it; and sometimes,
that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.

I went so far with it in my indignation, that I employed
myself several days to find out proper places to put myself in
ambuseade, as I said, to watch for them; and I Went frequently
to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar to me;
and especially while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of
revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the
sword, as I may call it; but the horror I had at the place, and
at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another,
abated my malice.

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill, where
I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of the boats
coming, and might then, even before they would be ready to
come on shore, convey myself unseen into thickets of trees, in
one of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me
entirely; and where I might sit, and observe all their bloody
doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so
close together, as that it would be next to impossible that I
should miss my shoot, or that I could fail wounding three or
four of them at the first shoot.

In this place then I resolved to fix my design; and accordingly
I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling--piece. The
two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five
smaller bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets, and the fowling--
piece I loaded with near a handful of swan--shot of the largest
size; I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each: and
in this posture, well provided with ammuniu'on for a second and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.

After I had thus .laid the scheme for my design, and in my
imagination put it in practice, I continually made my tour every
morninguptothetopofthehill,whichwasfrom m'ycastle,as
Ieslledit,about threemilesormore,tosee ifI couldobserve
any boats upon the see, coming near the island, or standing over
towards it; butlbegancotireofthishardduty, afterlhadfor
two or three months constantly kept my watch ; but me always
back without any discovery, there having not in all that time
been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but
not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach
every way.

As long asI kept up my daily tourtothehill tolookout,so
long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits
seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for so outrageous
an execution, as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for .
an offence which I had not at all entered into a discussion of in
my thoughts, any further than my passions were at first fired by
the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of
that country, who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence,
in his wise disposition of the world, to have no other guide than
that of their own abominable and vitiated passions; and conse-
quently were left, and perhaps had been for some ages, to act
such horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing
but nature, entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actuated by some
hellish degeneracy, could have run them into; but now, when,
as Ihavesaid,lbegantobewearyofthefruitlessexcursion
which I had made so Iong,and so far,everymorninginvain;
so my opinion of the action itselfbegan to alter, and I began,
with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what it was I was
goingtoengagein; what authorityor call I hadto pretend to
be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom
Heaven had thought fit for so many ages to sufi'er, unpunished,
to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments
upon one another; also, how farthese people were offenders
against me, and what rightlhadtoengageinthequarrelofthat
blood which they shed promiscuously one upon another. I debated
this very often with myself thus: How do I know what Goo him-
self judges in this particular case ? It is certain these people do not
commit this as a crime; it is not against their own consciences
reproving, or their light reproaching them. They do not know
it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of divine justice,
as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it no
more a crime to kill a eaptive taken in war, than we do to kill
an ox; nor to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.

When I had considered this a little, it followed necessarily,
that I was certainly in the wrong in it; that these people were
not murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them in

,my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers,
who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle, or more
frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to
the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their
arms and submitted.

In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the usage they
gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really
nothing to me: these people had done me no injury: that if
they attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate
preservation to fall upon them, something might be said for it;
but that I was yet out of their power, and they had really no
knowledge of me, and consequently no design upon me; and
therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them: that
this would justify the conduct of the Spaniard:, in all their
barbarities practised in America, where they destroyed millions
of these people, who, however they were idolaters and bar--
barians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their
customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet,
as to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the rooting
them out of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhor-
rence and detestation, even by the Spaniard: themselves, at this
time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere
butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjmtifiabh
eitherto Gonorman; andsuch,asfor whichtheveryname
of a Spaniard is reckoned to be fi-ightful and terrible to all people
of humanity, or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of
Spain were particularly eminent for the product of a race of men,
who were without principles of tendernes, or the common
bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark
of a generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind
ofa full stop; and I began by little and little to be ofi'my
design, and to conclude I had taken a wrong measure in my
resolutions to attack the savages; that it was not my business to
meddle with them, unless they first attacked me, and this it was
my business, if possible, to prevent; but that, if I were dis-
covered and attacked, then I knew my duty.

0n the other hand, I argued with myself, that this really was
the way, not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy
myself; for unless I was sure to kill every one that not only
should be on shore at that time, but that should ever come on
shore afterwards, if but one of them eseaped to tell their country-
people what had happened, they would come over again by
thousands to revenge the death of their fellows; and I should
only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which at pmcnt I
had no manner of occasion for.

Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in principles nor in
policy, I ought one way or other to concern myself in this affair :
that my busines was by all possible means to conceal myself
from them, and not to leave the leastsignal to them to guess by,
that there were any living creatures upon the island, I mean of
human shape.

Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was convinced
now many ways that I wasperfectly out ofmy duty, when I was
laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent
creatures,lmeaninnoccntastomc; astothccrimastheywere
guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with them;
they were national, and I ought to leave them to the justice of
GOD, who is the governor of nations, and knows how by national
punishments to make a just retribution for national offences;
and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in a public
manner, by such ways as best please him.

This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater
satisfaction to me, than that I had not been sufi'ered to do a thing

which I now saw so much reason to believe would have been no
less a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and
I gave most humble thanks on my knees to Goo, that had thus
delivered me from blood-guiltiness, beseeching him to grant me
the protection of his Providence, that I might not fall into the
hands of barbarians; or thatI might not lay my hands upon them,
unlessI had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of
my own life.

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this: and
so far was I from desiring an oceasion for falling upon these
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill to
see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know whether
any of them had been on shore there or not; that I might not be
tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, or be
provoked, by any advantage which might present itself, to fall
upon them; only this I did, I went and removed my boat, which
I had on the other side the island, and earried it down to the east
end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove which I
found" under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of
the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come with
their boats, upon any account whatsoever.

With my boat I carried away every thing that I had left there
belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither;
viz. a mast and sail, which I had made for her, and a thing like
an anchor, but indeed, which could not be called either anchor
or grappling: however, it was the best I could make of its kind.
All these I removed, that theremightnot betheleastshadowof
any discovery, or any appearance of any boat, or of any habitation
upon the island.

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever,
and seldom went from my cell, other than upon my constant
employment, viz. to milk my she-goats, and manage my little
flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the other partofthe
island, was quite out of danger: for certain it is, that these
savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came
with any thoughts of finding any thing here, and consequently
never wandered of from the coast; and I doubt not but they
might have been several times on shore, after my apprehensions
ofthem had made me cautious, as well as before; and indwd I
looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my
condition would have been, if I had chopped upon them, and
been discovered before that, when naked and unarmed, except
with one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot. I
walked every where peeping and peeping about the island, to see
what I could get: what a surprise should I have been in, if,
when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had instead of that
seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me,
and, by the swiftnees of their running, no possibility of my
escaping them!

The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me,
and distressed my mind so much, that I could not soon recover
it; to think what I should have done, and how I not only should
not have been able to resist them, but even should not have had
presence of mind enough to do what I might have done; much
less what now, after so much consideration and preparation, I
might be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these
things, I should be very melancholy, and sometimes it would
lastagreatwhile; butI resolveditat last all into thankfulness
to that Providence which had delivered me from so many unseen
dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs, which I could
no way have been the agent in delivering myself from; because
I had not the least notion of any such thing depending, or the
least supposition of it being possible.

This renewed a contemplation, which often had come to my
thoughts in former time, when first I began to see the merciful
dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in this
life; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing
of it: how, when we are in a quandary (as we all it), a doubt
or hesitation, whether to go this way or that way, a secret hint
shall direct us this way, when we intended to go that way; nay,
when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business, has called
to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind,
from we know not what springs, and by we know not what
power, shall over--rule us to go this way; and it shall afterwards
appear, that had we gone that way which we should have gone,
and even to our imagination ought to have gone, we should
have been ruined and lost. Upon these, and many like reflec--
tions, I afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that whenever
I found those secret hints, or pressings of my mind, to doing or
not doing any thing that presented, or to going this way or that
way, I never failed to obey the secret dicmte; though I knew
no other reason for it, than that such a pressure, or such a hint,
hung upon my mind. I could give many examples of the
success of this conduct in the course of my life; but more espe--
cially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island;
besides many occasions which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I saw
with now. But it is never too late to be wise; and I eannot
but advise all considering men, whose lives are attended with
such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so
extraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of Providence,
let them come from what invisible intelligence they will. That
I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but cer-
minly they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and the secret
communication between those embodied and those unembodied;
and such a proof as can never be withstood; of which I shall
have occasion to give some very remarkable instances, in the
remainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.

Ibelievethemderoftliiswillnottliinksn-angejflconfx
that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the
concern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and
to all the contrivances that I had laid for my future accommo-
dations and conveniences. I had the care of my safety more
now upon my hands than that of my food. I eared not to drive
a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I should
make should be heard; much less would I fire a gun, for the
same reason; and above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making
any lire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in
the day, should betray me: and for this reason I removed that
part of my business which required fire, such as burning of pots
and pipes, (it. into my new apartment in the Woods; where,
after I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable conso-
lation, a mere natural eave in the earth, which went in a vast
way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth
of it, would be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would any
man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a
safe retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see an abun-
dant reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence), I was
cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal;
and beforelgoon, Imustobservethereason ofmymaking
this charcoal, which was thus:

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said
before; and yet I could not live there without baking my bread,
cooking my meat, 63:. so I contrived to burn some wood here,
as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it became chark,
or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal
to carry home, and perform the other services which fire was
wanting for at home, without danger of smoke.

But this is by the bye. While I was cutting down some wood
here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brush-
wood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place. I was
curious to look into it, and getting with difliculty into the mouth
of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me
to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me; but I must
confess to you, I made more haste out than I did in; when
looking farther into the place, and which was perfectly dark, I
saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or
man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim light
from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the
reflection.

However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began to
call myself a thousand fools, and tell myself, that he that was
afiaid to see the devil, was not fit to live tWenty years in an island
all alone, and that I durst to believe there was nothing in this
wave that was more frightful than myself: upon this, plucking
up my courage, I took up a great firebrand, and in I rushed
again, with the stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three
steps in, but I was almost as much fiighted as I was before; for
I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain; and
it was followed by a broken noise, a: if of words half-expmed,
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was indwd
struck with such a surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat;
and if I had had a hat on my head,-I will-not answer for it that
my hair might not have lifted it off. But still, plucking up my
spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little, with
considering that the power and presence of Goo was every-
where, and was able to protect me; upon this I stepped forward
again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little
over my head, I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous
frightful old lie-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping
for life, and dying-indwd of mere old age.

Istirredhimalitdetoseeiflcouldgethimout, andhe
emyed to get up, butwasnot abletoraisehimself; andI
thought with myself, he might even lie there; for if he had
frighted me so, he would certainly fright any of the savages, if
any of them should be so hardy as to come in there, while he
had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when I found the save was but very small; that is to
say, it might be about twelve foot over, but in no manner of
shape, either round or square, no hands ever having been em-
ployed in making it but those of mere nature. I observed also,
that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in farther,
but was so low, that it required me to creep upon my hands and
knees to go into it, and whither I went, I knew not; so having
no candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to come
again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box,
which I had made of the lock of one of the musquets, with some
wild-fire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day, I esme provided with six large
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles now
of goats bellow); and going into this low place, I was obliged to
creep upon all fours, a: I have raid, almost ten yards; which, by
the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that
I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. When
I was got through the 'streight, I found the roof rose higher up,
I believe near twenty foot; but never was such a glorious sight
seenintheisland,Idaresay,asitwas,tolook round the sides
and roof ofthis vault or ewe. The walls reflected an hundred
thousand lights to me from my two candles: what it was in the
rock, whether diamonds, or any other precious stones, or gold,
which I rather suppose it to be, I knew not.

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, of
its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the floor
was dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it;
so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen;
neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof; the only
difiiculty in it was the entrance, which, however, as it was a place
of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a
convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and
resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which
I was most anxious about to this place; particularly, I resolved
to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms,
viz. two fowling--pieces (for I had three in all) and three muskets
(for of them I had eight in all); so I kept at my castle only five,
which stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost
fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took
occasion to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of
the sea, and which had been wet; and I found that the water
had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on
every side, which, caking and growing hard, had preserved the
inside like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty pound of
very good powder in the centre of the cask; and this was an
agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away
thither, never keeping above two or three pound of powder with
me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind. I also carried
thither all the lead I had left for bullets. .

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which are
said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could
come at them; for I persuaded myself while I was here, if five
hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out;
or if they did, they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, who I found expiring, died in the mouth of the
eave the next dayafter I made this discovery; and I foundit-
much easier to dig agree: hole there, and throw him in, and
coverhimwithearth, thanto draghimout; sol interredhim
there, to prevent offence to my nose.

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence m this island,
and was so naturalized to the place, and to the manner of living,
that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would
come to the place to disturb me, I could have been content to
have capitulated for spending the rest of my time there, even to
the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old
goat in the cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions and '
amusements, which made the time pass more pleasantly with me
a great deal than it did before; as, first, I had taught my Poll,
as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and
talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me;
and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years: how
long he might live afterwards I know not; though I know they
have a notion in the Brasils, that they live a hundred years;
perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still, ealling after poor
Rob's Crusoe to this day; I wish no Englishman the ill luck to
come there and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly
believe it was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and loving
companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and
then died of mere old age; as for my eats, they multiplied, as I
have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several
ofthem at first, to keep them from devouringmeandall I had;
but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me were
gone, and after some time continually driving them from me, and
letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into
the woods, except two or three Favourites, which I kept tame,
and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned, and
these were part ofmy family. Besides these, I alwayskepttwo
or three household kids about me, which I taught to feed out of
my hand; and I had also more parrots which talked pretty well,
and would all eall Robin Crusoe, but none like my first; nor,
indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had done
with him. I had also several tame sea fowls, whose names I
know not, who I caught upon the shore, and'cut their wings;
and the little stakes, which I had planted before my castle wall,
being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived
among these low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable
to me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented
with the life I led, if it might but have been secured from the
dread of the savages.

But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all
people who shall meet with my story to make thisjust observation
from it, viz. How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil
which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are
fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very
means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we an be raised
again from the aflliction we are fallen into. I could give many
examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but in
nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the circum-
stances of my last years of solitary residence in this island.

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year; and this being the southern solstice, for
winter I eannot call it, was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields; when
going out pretty early in the morning, even before it was thorough
day-light, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon
the shore, at a distance from me of about two mile, towards the
end of the island, where I had observed some savages had been,
as before; but not on the other side: but to my great afliction,
it was on my side of the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stepped short
within my grove, notdafingtogooutflestlmight besurprised;
and yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I
had, that if these savages, in rambling .over the island, should
find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works and improve-
ments, they would immediasflxonclude that there were people
in the place, and would then never give over till they had found
me out. In this extremity I went back directly to my castle,
pulled up the ladder after me, having made all things without
look as wild and natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of
defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to
say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortification,
and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last
gasp; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the divine
protection, and earnestly to pray to Goo to deliver me out of the
hands of the barbarians; and in this posture I confinued about
two hours, but began to be mighty impatient for intelligence
abroad, for I had no spies to send out.

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in
this one, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer; so
setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there was a flat
place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after
me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill; and
pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose,
I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to
look for the place. I presently found there was no less than
nine naked savages sitting round a small fire they had made; not
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather being
extreme hot; but, as I supposed, to dress some of therr barbarous
diet of human flesh which they had brought with them, whether
alive or dead I could not know.

They had two canoe: with them, which they had hauled up
upontheshore; andas itwasthentide ofebb, they mated to
me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It is
not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into,
especially seeing them come on my side the island, and so near
me too; but when I observed their coming must be always with
the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in
my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all
the time of the tide of flood, if they were not on shore before;
and having made this observation, I went abroad about my
harvest work with the more composure.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to
the westward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle as
we call it) all away. I should have observed, that for an hour
and more before they went off, they went to dancing, and I could
easily discern their postures and gestures by my glasses: I could
not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they were stark
naked, and had not the least covering upon them; but whether
they were men or women, that I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my great
sword by my side, without a smbbard; and with all the speed I
was able to make, I went away to the hill, where I had discovered
the first appearance of all. And as soon as I gat thither, which
was not less than two hours (for I could not go apace, being so
loaded with arms as I was), I perceived there had been three
canoe: more of savages on that place; and looking out farther, I
saw they were all at sea together, making over for the main.

This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when going down
to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal
work they had been about had left behind it, <<#2. the blood, the
bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured
by those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so filled with
indignation at the sight, that I began now to premedimte the
destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be who or how
many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they thus make
to this island are not very frequent; for it was above fifteen
months before any more of them came on shore there again;
that is to say, I neither saw them, or any footsteps or signals of
them, in all that time; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are
sure not to come abroad, at least not so far: yet all this while I
lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I
was in of their coming upon me by surprise; fi'om whence I
observe, that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the
suffering, especially if there is no room to shake of? that expec-
tation or those apprehensions.

During all this time, I was in the murdering humour; and
took up most of my hours, which should have been better
employed, in eontriving how to circumvent and fall upon them
the very next time I should see them; especially if they should
be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties; nor did
I consider at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a
dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and so another, even ad irgfinitum, till I should be at
length no less a. murderer than they were in being man-eaters,
and perhaps much more so.

I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind,
expecting that I should one day or other fall into the hands of
these merciless creatures. And if I did at any time venture
abroad, it was not without looking round me with the greatest
are and caution imaginable; and now I found to my great
comfort, how happy it was that I provided for a tame flock or
herd of goats; for I durst not, upon any account, fire my gun,
especially near that side of the island where they usually came,
lestIshould alarm the savages; and ifthey had fled from me
now, I was sure to have them come back again, with perhaps
two or three hundred came: with them in a few days, and then I
knew what to expect.

1
However, I wore out a year and three months more before I
ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again,
as I shall soon observe. It is true, they might have been there
once or twice, but either they made no stay, or, at least, I did
not hear them; but in the month of May, as near as I could
calculate, and in my four--and--twentieth year, I had a very strange
encounter with them, of which in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen
months interval, was very great; I slept unquiet, dreamed always
frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night:
in the day great troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the
night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and the reasons
why I might justify the doing of it. But to wave all this for a
while, it was in the middle of M}, on the sixteenth day, I
think, as well as my poor Wooden ealendar would reckon, for I
markedall upon the poststill; I say, it was the sixteenth of
May, that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after
it. I know not what was the particular oceasion of it: but as I
was reading in the bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts
about my present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a
gun, as I thought, fired at sea.

This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different nature
from any I had met with before; for the notions this put into my
thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the greatest
haste imaginable; and in a trice clapped my ladder to the middle
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the
second u'me, got to the 'top of the hill; the very moment that a
flash of fire bade me listen for a second gun, which accordingly
in about half a minute I heard, and by the sound knew that it
wasfromthatpart ofthe seawhere I was driven out with the
current in my boat.

I immediately considered that this must be some ship in
distress,andthattheyhadeomecomrade,orsomeothushipin

driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and
E. N. E. Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily sup-
pose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured
to have saved themselves on share by the help of their boat;
but their firing of their guns for help, especially when they saw,
as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts: first, I
imagined, that, upon seeing my light, they might have put
themselves into their boat, and have endeavoured to make the
shore; but that the sea going very high, they might have been
cast away: other times I imagined, that they might have lost
their boat before, as might be the case many ways; as particu-
larly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many
times obliges men to stave or take in pieces their boat; and
sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands: other
times I imagined, they had some other ship or ships in company,
who, upon the signals of distress they had made, had taken them
up, and carried them off: otherwhiles I fancied they were all
gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the
current that I had been formerly in, were earried out into the
great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perishing;
and that perhaps they might by this time think of starving, and
of being in a condition to eat one another.

As all thae were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition
I was in, I could do no more than look upon the misery of the
poor men, and pity them; which had still this good effect on
my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks
to Goo, who had so happily and comfortably provided for me
in my desolate condition; and that of two ships' companies, who
were now cast away upon this part of the world, not one life
should be spared but mine. I learned here again to observe,
that it is very rare that the providence of Goo east: us into any
condition of life so low, or any misery so great, but we may see
something or other to be thankful for, and may see others in
worse circumstances than our own.
' Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could
notso much assee room to suppose anyofthemweresaved;
nothing could make it rational, so much astowishorexpectthat'
they did not all perish there, except the possibility only of their
being taken up by another ship in company :. and this was but
mere possibility indeed; for I saw not the least signal or appear-
ance of any such thing.

I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a

strange longing, or hankering of desires, I felt' in my soul upon
this sight; breaking out sometimes thus: 0 that there had been

but one or two, nay, or but one soul saved out of the ship, to
have esesped to me, that I might but have had one companion,
one fellow-creature to have spoken to me, and to have conversed
with! In all the time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest,
so strong a desire after the society of my fellow-creamres, or so
deeparegretatthewantofit.

There are some secret moving springs in the afi'ections, which,
when they are set a going by some object in view, or be it some
object though not in view, yet rendered present'to the mind by
the power of imagination, that motion earries out the soul by its
impetuosity to such violent eager embracings of the object, that
the absence of it is insupportable.

Such were these earnest wishings, That but one man had been
saved! 0 that it had been but one! I believe I reputed the
words, 0 that it hadhmr but one! a thousand times; and my
desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press the palms
ofmyhands,thatiflhadhadany softthinginmyhand, it
would have crushed it involuntarily , and my teeth in my head
would strike together, and set against one another so strong, that
for some time I could not part them again.

Ietthenaturalisesexplainthesethings, andthereason'and
mannerofthem: all I eansaytothein is,todescribe the fact,
which was even surprising to me when I found it, though I knew
not from what it should proceed; it was doubtless the efi'ect of
ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realizing
the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow-chris-
tians would have been to me.

But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine, or both,
forbid it; for till the last year of my being on this island, I never
knew whether any were saved out of that ship, or no; and had
only the afliiction some days after to see the corpse of a drowned
boy come on shore, at the end of the island which was next the
shipwreck: he had on no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair
of open~kneed lined drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing
to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of: he had
nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-
pipe; the last was to me of ten times more value than the first.

It was now ealm, and I had agreat mind toventure out in
my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find something
on board that might be useful to me; but that did not altoge-
ther press me so much, as the possibility that there might be
yet some living creature on board, whose life I might not only
save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last
degree: and this thought clung so to my heart, that I could not
be quiet night nor day, but I must venture out in my boat on
board this wreck; and committing the rat to Goo's providence,
I thought the impression was so strong upon my mind, that it
could not be resisted, that it must come from some invisible
direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did not

- o.
g Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
eastle, prepared every thing for my voyage, took a quantity of
bread, a great pot for fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle
ofrum(for Ihadstillagreatdalofthatleft),abasketfiillof
raisins: and thus loading myself with every thing necessary, I
went down to my boat, got the water out of her, and got her
afloat, loadedall my cargoin her, andthenwent homeagain
for more: mysccmdcargowasagreathag-fiillofrice,the

a cheese; all which, with great labour and sweat,.I brought to
my boat; and praying to Goa to dircctmy voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the canoe along the share, I came at
last to the utmost point of the island, on that side, viz. N. E.'
And now I was tolaunch out into theocan, andeithertoven--
ture, or not to venture; I looked on the rapid .currmts which
ran constantly on both sides of the island, at a distance, and
which were very terrible to me, fiorn the remembrance of the

Thwe thoughtsso oppressed my mind, that I began togive
over myenterprise; and havinghalcdmyboatintoalittlecreek
on the shore,I stepped out,andsatme down uponalittlerising
bit ofground,verypensive mdanfimbetwemfaranddesire,
about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could perceivethat
the tide was turned, and the flood come on, upon which my
goingwas for so many hours impracticable: upon this it pre-
sently occurred to me, that I should go up to the highst piece
ofground Icouldfind, and observe, ifI could, howthesets of
the tideor currents lay,whenthefloodcamein,thatImight
judge whether, if I wasdriven one way out,I might not expect
to bedriven another .way home, with the same rapidnus of the
currents. This thought was no sooner in my head, but I cast
my eye upon a little hill which sufficiently "overlooked the sea
both ways, and from whence I had a clear view' of the currents,
orsetsofthetide, andwhichwaylwastoguide myselfin my
return: hereI found, that as the current of the ebb set out close
by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood set
in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing
todobuttokeeptothenorthoftheislandinmyretum,andl
should do well enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next morn-
ing to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for
the night in the once, under the great watch-coat I mentioned,
I launched out. I made first a little out to see, full north, till I
began to feel the benefit of the current, which set eastward, and
which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as
the southern-side current had done before, and so as to take from
me all government of the boat; but having a strong steerage
with my paddle, I went at a great rate, directly for the wreck,
and in less than two hours I came up to it.

It was a dismal sight to look at; the ship, which by its build-
ing was Spank/I, stuck fast, jambed in between two rocks; all
the stern and quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the sea;
and as her fore-eastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main--mast and fore-mast were brought by
the board, that is to say, broken short of, but her bowsprit was
sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I came
close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried, and as soon as I called him, jumped into the
sec to come to me; and I took him into the boat, but found
him almost dead for hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of
my bread, and he ate like a ravenous wolf that had been starving
a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor creature some
fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he would have
burst himself.

After this I went on board: but the first sight I met With
was twomen drownedinthe eook-room,or foreustlcofthe
ship,with their arms fast about one another. I ooncluded,as

water being ebbed out, I could see; but they were too big to
meddle with. I saw several chests, which I believed belonged
to some of the seamen, and I got two of them into the boat with-
out examining what was in them.

Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore-part broken
off, I am persuadedl might have made agoodvoyage; for by
what I found in these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship
hadagreatdealofwealthonboard; andiflmayguessbythe
course she smered, she must have been bound from the Bums:
Arr", or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, be;
yond the Brasib, to the Havana, in the gulph of Mexico, and
so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her,
but ofno use at that time to any body; andwhat hwame ofthe
rest of her people I then knew not.

I found, besides these chests, a little ask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much dif-
ficulty: there were several musquets in a cabin, and a great
powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it; as forthe
musquets, I had no occasion for them," Ileftthem, bntmoh
the powder-horn , I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted
exnemely; asalsotwo little bmketdqaeoppcpottomake

came away, the tide beginning to make home again; and the

I 2
same~ evening about an hour within night, I reached the island
again, weary and fadgued to the last degree.

I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I resolved
to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave, not to carry
it home to my castle. After refi-eshing myself, Igot all my
cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars :. the cask
of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at
the Brasil: ; and, in a word, not at all good; but when I came
to open the chests, I found several things of great use to me:
for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extra-
ordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine, and very good;
the bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped with
silver. I found two pots of very good succades, or sweet-meats,
so fastened also on the top, that the salt water had not hurt
them; and two more of the same, which the water had spoiled.
I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to
me, and about a dozen and half of white linen handkerchiefs,
and coloured neckcloths; the former were also very welcome,
being exceeding refreshing, to wipe my face in a hot day; be-
sides this, when I came to the till in the chests, I found there
three great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven
hundred pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapt up in a paper,
six doubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold;
I suppose they might all weigh near a pound.

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little
value; but by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the
gunner's mate, though there was no powder in it, but about two
pounds of glazed powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose, for
charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I
got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me; for as
to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me
as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given it for three

or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which were things I
greatly wanted,but hadnot hadon myfeetnowfor manyyears.
Ihad, indeed, gottentwo pairofshoes now, which I-took of
the feet ofthe two drowned menwhomI'saw in thewreck; and
I found two pair more'in one of the chests, which were very
welcome to me; but they were not like our Eaglirl: shoes, either
formeorservice,beingratherwhatwe allpumpsthanshoea.
I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals,
but no gold; I suppose this belonged to apoorerman than the
other, which seemed to belong to some ofioer.

Well, however, I lugged this money home to my edve, and
laid it up, as I had done that before which I brought from our
own ship; but it was great pity, as'I said, that the other part of
the ship had not come to my share, for I am satisfied I might
have loaded my auto: several times over with money, which, if
I had ever escaped to England, would have lain here safe enough
till I might have come again and fetched it.

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured
them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along
the shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the
best of my way to my old habitation, where I found every thing
safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live after my old
fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for a while I
lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used to
be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if
at anytime I did stirwith any freedom, itwas alwaysto the
earl part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the
savages never mine, and where I could go without so many pre-
cautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition, as I always
arried with me, if- I Went the other way.

I lived in this condition near two years more; but my .un-
lucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to make
mybodymisuablgwas allthese twoyearsfilled with projects
and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get away from
this island; for sometimes I was for making another voyage to
the wreck, though my reason told me, that there was nothing left
there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble
one way, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I had the
boat that I went from Seller in, I should have ventured to sea,
bound any where, I knew not whither.

I have been, in all my circumstances, a manta to those who
are touched with that general plague of mankind, whence, for
aught I know, one half of their miseries flow ; I mean, that of
not being satisfied with the station wherein Goo and nature has
placed them; for, not to look back upon my primitive condi-
tion, and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to
which was, as I may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mis-
takes of the same kind had been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence, which so
happily had seated me at the Brasil: as a planter, blessed me
with confined desires, and I could have been contented to have
gone on gradually, I might have been by this time, I may: in the
time of my being in this island, one of the most considerable
planters in the Brarilr; nay, I am persuaded, that by the im-
provements I had made in that little time I lived there, and the
increase I should probably have made if I had staid, I might have
been worth an hundred thousand maiden: ; and what business
had I to leave a settled fortune, well-stocked plantation, improv-
ing and increasing, to turn supermrgo to Guinea, to fetch Ne-
groes, when patience and time would so have increased our stock
at home, that we could have bought them at our own doors,
from those whose business it was to fetch them? And though it
had cost us something more, yet the difference of that price was
by no means worth saving at so great a hazard.

But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so reflection
upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the exercise of more years, or
of the dear-bought experience of time; and so it was with meor Rostrum: Causat.' so;

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the
four-and--twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of
sofimfinmlwaslying in mybed or hammock, awake, and very

all night long, otherwisethan as follows:

It is as impossible as needless to set down the innumerable
crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare
of the brain, the memory, in this night's time. I run over the
whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, a: I

quented the island even all the while, and might have been
several hundreds of them attimes on'the shore there; but I had
never known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about
it, my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the same;
and I was as happy in not knowing my danger, as ifI had never
really been exposed to it; this furnished my thoughts with many
very profitable reflections, and particularly this one: How infi--
nitely good that Providence is, which has provided in its govern-
ment of mankind such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge
of things; and though he walks in the midst of so many thou--
sand dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him, would
distract his mind, and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm,

by having the event of things bid from his eyes, and knowing
nothing the dangers which surround him.

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I
came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for
so many years in this very island; and how I had walked about
in the greatest security and with all possible tranquillity, even
when perhaps nothing but a brow of a hill, a great tree, or the
casual approach of night, had been between me and the worst
kind of destruction, 'viz. that of falling into the hands of cannibals
and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view
as I did of a goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more a
crime to kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a curlew;
I would unjustly slander myself, if I should say I was not sin-
cerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protec-
tion I acknowledged, with great humility, that all these unknown
deliverances were due, and without which I must inevitably have
fallen into their merciless hands.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time
taken up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures, I
mean, the savages; and how it came to pass in the world, that
the wise Governor of all things should give up any of his crea-
tures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so much below even
brutality'itselfiastodevour its-ownkindr but asthisendedin
some (at that time fi'uitless) speculations, it'occurred to me to
inquire what part of the world these wretches lived in; how
far ofl' the coast was from whence they came; what they ven-
tured over-so farfi'om home for; what kind ofboats they had;
and why I might not order myself, and my business so, that I
might be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me.

I never so much as troubled myself to consider, what I should
do with myself when I earne thither; what should become of me
ifl fell into thehandsofthe savages; or how I should escape
fi'om them, if they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it
was possible for me to reach the coast, and not be attempted by
some or other of them, without any possibility of delivering
myself; and if I should not fall into their hands, what I should
do for provision, or whither I should bend my course , none of
these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but my
mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my
boat to the main land. I looked back upon my present condition
as the most miserable that could possibly be; that I was not able
to throw myself into any thing but death, that could be called
worse; that if I reached the shore of the main, I might, perhaps,
meet with relief; or I might coast along, as I did on the shore
of Afi'ica, till I eame to some inhabited country, and where I
might find some relief; and after all, perhaps, I might fall in
with sand: Christian ship that might take me in; and if the
worst eame to the worst, I could but die, which would put an
end to all these miseries at once. Pray, note, all this was the
fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made, as it were,
desperate by the long continuance of my troubles, and the dis-
appointments I hadmet inthewreckI had been on boardof;
and where-I had been so near the obtaining what I so earnestly
longed for, m'z. somebody to speak to, and to learn some know-
ledge from of the place where I was,,and of the probable means
of my deliverance : I say, I was agitated wholly by thwe thoughts.
All my calm of mind in my resignation to Providence, and wait.
ing the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be sus-
pended; andI had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts
to any thing but to the project of a voyage to the main; which
came upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of de-
sire, that it was not to be resisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more,
with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and
my pulse beat as high as if I had been in a fever, merely with
the extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, nature, as if I
had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thought of it,
threw me into a sound sleep: one would have thought I should
have dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of any thing relating to
it; but I dreamed that I was going out in the morning, as usual,
from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes, and eleven
savages coming to land, and that they brought with them ano-
ther savage, who they were going to kill, in order to eat him;
when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill,
jumped away, and ran for his life; then I thought in my sleep,
that he came running into my little thick grove, before my for-
tifimtion, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone, and not
perceiving that the others sought him that way, shewed myself
to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him, that he kneeled
down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I
shewed my ladder, made him go up, and carried him into my
cave, and he became my servant; and that as soonas I had got-
ten this man, I said to myself, Now I may certainly venture to
the main land; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will
tell me what to do, and whether to go for provisions, and whe-
ther not to go for fear of being devoured; what places to venture
into, and what to escape. I waked with this thought, and was
under such inexprsssible impressions of joy at the prospect of
my escape in my dream, that the-disappointments which I felt
uponeomingtomyselfland finding itwasnomorethan adream,
were equally exuavagant the other way, and threw me into a
very great dejection of spirit.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that my only
way to go about an attempt for an eseape, was, ifpossible, to
get a savage into my possession; and, if possible, it should be
one of their prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten,
and should bring thither to kill; but these thoughts still were
attended with this difieulty, that it was impossible to effect this
without atmclting a whole earavan of them, and killing them all ;
and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and might mis-
earry; but, on the other hand, I had gmtly scrupled the lawful-
ness of it to me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of
shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. I
need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this,
they being the same mentioned before: but though I had other
reasons to ofi'er now, viz. that those men were enemies to my
life, and would devour me, if they could ; that it was self-pre-
servation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this
deathofalife,andwasactinginmyowndefence,asmuchasif
they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though
these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I
could by no means reconcile myself to a great while.

However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and
after great perplexitiss about it (for all these arguments, one way
and another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager pre-
vailingdasireofdeliveranceat length masteredalltherest,and
I risolved, ifpossible, toget one of these savages into my hands,
003th it would: the neat thingthen was to contrive how to
do it; andthis indeed was very'dificult to resolve on: but as I
could pitch uponno probable mans for it, so I resolved to put
myselfupon the watch to see them when they came on shore,
and leave the rest to the event, taking such measures as the
opportunity should present, let be what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the
scout as often as possible, and indeed so often, till I was heartily
tired of it; for it was above a year and a half that I waited, and
for great part of that time went out to the we" end, and to the
south-west corner of the island, almost every day, to see for
canoes, but none appeared: this was very discouraging, and began
to trouble me much; though I eannot say that it did in this case,
as it had done some time before that, 'uiz. wear of the edge of
my desire to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed,
the more eager Iwas for it: in a word, I was not atfirst so
careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen
by them, as I was now eager to be upon them.

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or
three savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves
to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their
being able, at any time, to do me any hurt. It was a greatwhile
that I pleased myself with this affair, but nothing still presenwd;
all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savage eame
near me for a great while.

About a year and half after I had entertained these notions,
and, by long musing, had, as it were, resolved them all into
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them in execun'on, I was
surprised one morning early, with seeing no less than five canoes
all on shore together, on my side the island, and the people who
belonged to them all landed, and out of my sight: the number
of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and know-
ing that they always eame four, or six, or sometimes more, in a
boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
measures to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so I lay
still in my eastle, perplexed and discomforted: however I put
myselfintoallthesamepostureefiyranattackthatIhadforuierly
provided,andwasjustreadyfisraction,ifany thinghadpre-
tented. Havingwaitedagoodwhile,liatmingtohearifthey
made any noise; at length being very impatient, I setmy guns
at the foot ofmy ladder, and clambered uptothetopofthehill
by my twostages, as usual; standingso,however, thatmyhead
did not appear above the hill, so that they could not perceive me
by any means: here I observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that they
hadafire kindled,that they had had meat dressed; how they
had cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was 5 but they were
all dancing in I know not how many bubarous gestures and
figures, their own way, round the fire.

When I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my per-
spective two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where,
it wens, they were laid by, and were now brought out for the
slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fell, being
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for that
was their way; and two or three others were at work immediately,
cutting him open for their cookery, while the other victim was
left standing by himselfitill they should be ready for him: in
that very moment this poor wretch, seeing himselfa little at
liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started
away from them, and ran with incredible swiftnaas along the
sands,directlytowards me, I mean, towards that partof the
coast where my habitation was.

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge) when I
perceived him to run my way 3 and especially when, as I thought,
I saw himpursued by the whole body; and nowIexpectcdthat
part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would cer-
tainly take shelter in my grove; but I could not depend, by any
means, upon my dream for the rat of it, viz. that the other
savages would not pursue him thither, and find him there.
However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover,
when I found that there were not above three men that followed
him; and still more was I encouraged, when I found he outstript
them exceedingly in running, and gained ground of them, so that
if he could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would
fairly get away from them all.

There was between them and my castle the creek, which I
mentioned often at the first part of my story, when I landed my
cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw plainly he must neces-
sarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there; but
when the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it,
though the tide was then up; but plunging in, swam through
in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with
exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came
to the creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the
third could not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked
at the other, but went no further; and soon after went softly
back again, which, as it happened, was very well for him in the
mam. .

I observed, that the two who swam were yet more than twice
as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled from
them. It came now very warmly upon my thoughts, and
indeed irresistibly, that now was my time to get a servant, and
perhaps a companion, or assistant, and that I was called plainly
by Providence to save this poor creature's life. I immediately
run down the ladders with all possible expedition, fetches my
two guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladder, as I
observed above; and getting up again with the same haste to the
top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea; and having a very short
cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in the way between the
pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who,
looking back, was at first perhaps as much frighted at me as I at
them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; andiii:

5".
in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two that
followed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked
him down with the stock of my piece; I was loth to file, because
I would not have the rest hear, though at that distance it would
not have been easily heard; and being out of sight of the smoke
too, they would not have easily known what to make of it.
Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued with
him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced apace
towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had
a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was
then necessitated to shoot at him first; which I did, and killed
him at the first shoot. The poor savage who fled, but had
stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen, and killed (as
he thought) yet was so frighted with the fire and noise of my
piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither earne forward or went
backward, though he seemed rather inclined to fly still than to
come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come
forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way, then
stopped again, and then a little further, and stopped again; and
I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been
taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies
' were. I beckoned him again to come to me, and gave him all the
signs of encouragement that I could think of; and he came nearer
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of
acknowledgment for savi g his life. I smiled at him and looked
pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length
he came close to me, and he then kneeled down again, kissed the
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by
the foot, set my foot upon his head. This, it seems, was in
token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, and
made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there
was more work to do yet; for I perceived the savage, who I
knocked down, was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and
began to come to himself: so I pointed to him,andshewed him
the savage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke some words
to me; and though I could not understand them, yet I thought
they were pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a
man's voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-
five years. But there was no time for such reflections now: the
savage, who was knocked down, recovered himself so far as to
sit up upon the ground; and I perceived that my savage began to
be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at
the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage, for so
I call Iii>>: now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword,
which hung naked in a belt by my side; so I did: he nosooner
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut of his
head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one, who, I
had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except
their own wooden swords. However it seems, as I learned
afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy,
and the wood is so hard, that they will cut oil" heads even with
them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had
done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and, with abundance of gestures,
which I did not understand, laid it down, with the head of the
savage that he had killed, just before me.

But that which astonished him most was, to know how I had
killed the other Indian so far of; so pointing to him, he made
signs to me to let him go to him: so I bade him go,aswellas
I could. When he came to him, he stood like one amazed,
looking at him; turned him first on one side, then on the other;
looked at the wound the bullet had made, which it seems wasjust
in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of
blood had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
dead: hetookuphisbowandarrows,andeameback; soIt-urned

inaninstant he had scraped a holein thesandwithhis hands,
big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it,
and covered him, and did so also by the other. I believe he had
buried them both in a quarter of an hour: then ealling him away,
I earried him not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on
the fartherpartofthe island; so I did not let my dream come
to pass in that part; viz. that he earne into my grove for
shelter.

HereIgave him bread,andabunch ofmisinstoeat,and a
draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress
for, by his running; and having refi-ashed him, I made signsfor
himtogo liedown and sleep,pointing to aplaeewhereIhad
laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I
used to sleep upon myself sometimes: so the poor creature lay
down and went to sleep. '

He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with
straight long limbs, not too large, tall, and well--shaped, and, as
I reckon, about twenty--six years of age. He had a very good
countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have
something very manly in his face, and yet he had all the sweet-
nose and softness of an European in his countenance too, especially
when he smiled: hishairwaslongandblack, notcurledlike

sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour ofhisskinwasnot

nauseous tawny, as the Bruiliu: and Virginians, and other
natimofdnerim are; butofabrightkindofadunolive

colour,thathadinitsomethixigveryagreeable,thoughnotvery
easy to describe. His face was round and plump, his nose
small, not flat like the negroes, a very good mouth, thin lips,
and his fine teeth, well--set, and white as ivory. After he had
slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he waited again,
and comes out of the cave to me, for I had been milking my
goats, which I had in the enclosure just by. When he espied
me, he came running to me, laying himself down again upon
the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble thankful
disposition, making many antic gestures to shew it. At last he
lays his head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my
other foot upon his head, as he had done before; and after this,
made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission
imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me as long as
he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him know
I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I began to
speak to him, and teach him to speak to me: and first, I made
him know his name should be Friday, which was the day I saved
his life; I called him so for the memory of the time. I likewise
taught him to say Master, and then let him know that was to be
my name; I likewise taught him to say 'Yes and No, and to
know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my
bread in it; and I gave him a sake of bread to do the like, which
he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was very good
for him

I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was
day, I beckoned him to come with me, and let him knowI
would give him some clothes; at which he seemedvery glad, for
he was stark--naked. As we went by the place where he had
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot, and shewed
me the marks that he had made to find them again, making
signs to me that we should dig them up again and eat them.
At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it,
made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned
with my hand to him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great submission. I then led him up to the top of the hill,
to see if his enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but no
appearance of them, or of their cancer; so that it was plain that
they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind them,
without any search after them.

But I was not content with this discovery; but having now
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I takes my man
Friday with me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow
and arrows at his back, which I found he could use very dexter--
ously, making him eerry one gun for me, and I two for myself,
and away we marched to the place where these creatures had
been; for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence of
them. When I enme to the place, my very blood ran chill in
my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the horror of the
spectacle: indeed it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to
me, though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered
with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, great
pieces of flesh left here and there half-eaten, mangled, and
scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast
they had been making there, after a victory over their enemies.
I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four
legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and
Frisky, by his signs, made me understand that they brought
over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten
up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth: that there
had been agreatbattlebetween them andtheirnextking,whose
subjects, it seems, he had been one of; and that they had taken
a great number of prisoners, all which were carried to several
places by thosethathadtaken them inthefighginordertofust

K
upon them, as was done here by these wretches upon those they
brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatever remained, and lay them together on a heap, and make
a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday
had still a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and was
still a cannibal in his nature; but I discovered so much abhor-
rence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of
it, that he durst not discover it; for I had, by some means, let
him know, that I would kill him if he offered it.

When we had done this, we came back to our castle, and
there I fell to work for my man Friday. And first of all, I
gave him a pair of linen drawers which I had out of the poor
gunner's chest I mentioned, and which I found in the wreck;
and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well: then I
made him a jerkin of goat'saskin as well as my skill would
allow, and I was now grown a tolerably good tailor: and I gave
him a cap, which I had made of a hare-skin, very convenient,
and fashionable enough: and thus he was dressed, for the
present, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see him-
self almost as well clothed as his master: it is true, he went
awkwardly in these things at first; wearing the drawers was very
awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his
shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little easing them,
where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to them,
at length he took to them very well.

The next day after I came home to my hutch with him, I
began to consider where I should lodge him; and that I might
do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little
tent for him in the vaunt place between my two fortifieations,
_ in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first: and as
there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal
framed door-ease, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the
passage, alittle within theentrance; andeausingthedoortoopen
ontheinside,lbarred it up in.thenight,takinginmyladders
too; so that Fn'da} could no wayoameatmeintheinsideof
my innermost wall, without making so much noise in getting
over, that itmust needswaken me; for myfirstwall hadnowa
complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and
leaning up to the side of the hill, which wasagain laid across
with small sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over a great
thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong like ruds; and
at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder,
I had placed a kind of trap-door, which if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but would have
fallen down, and made a great noise; and as to weapons, I took
them all into my side every night.

But I needed none of all this preeaution; for never man had
a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me;
without passions, sullennees or designs; perfectly obliged and
engaged; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a
child to a father; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life
for the saving mine, upon any oceasion whatsoever: the many
testimonies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt; and soon
convinced me, that I needed to use no precautions as to my safety
on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that however it had pleased Goo in his providence, and
in the government of the works of his hands, to take from so
great a part ofthe world, ofhis creatures, the best usestowhich
their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted; yet
that he has bestowed 'upon them the same powers, the same
reason, the same afi'ections, the same sentiments of kindness and-
obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the
same sense ofgratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities
ofdoinggood,andreoeivinggood,thathehasgiventous; and '
that when he pleases to offer to them occasions of exerting these,
they are as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the right
uses for which they were bestowed than we are. And this made
me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several
occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all these, even
though we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of
instruction, the Spirit of Goo, and by the knowledge of his
word, added to our understanding; and why it has pleased Goa
to hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of souls,
who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much
better use of it than we did.

From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade the sove-
reignty of Providence; and, as it were, arraign the justice of so
arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that light from
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a likeduty from
both : but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this con-
clusion. First, that we did not know by what light and law
these should be condemned; but that as GOD was necessarily,
and by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and just, so it
could not be, but that if these creatures were all sentenced to
absence from himself, it was on account of sinning against that
light, which, as the scripture says, was a law to themselves, and
by such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to bejust,
though the foundation was not discovered to us: and, secondly,
that still, as we are all clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel
could say to him, Why hast thou formed me thus?

But to return to my new companion. I was grady delighted
with him, and made it my business to teach him every thing that
was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but espe-
cially to make him speak, and understand me when I spake: and
he was the aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly was so
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he could but
' understand me, or make me understand'him, that it was very
pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my life began to'beso

easy that I began to say to myself, that could I but have been
safefrommoresavages, Icarednotiflwasnevertoremovefrom
the place while I lived.

After I had been two or three days returned to my cmtle, I
thought that, in order to bring Friday of from his horrid way of
feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to
let him taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one morning
to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my
own flock, and bring him home and dress it; but as I was going,
I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids
sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday, Hold, said I, stand
still; and made signs to him not to stir; immediately I presented
my piece, shot and killed one of the kids. The poor creature,
who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy,
but did not know or could imagine how it was done, was sensi--
bly surprised, trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that
I thought he would have sunk down; he did not see the kid I
shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistth
to feel if he was not wounded ; and, as I found, presently thought
I was-resolved to kill him; for he me and kneeled down to
me, and, embracing my knees, said a great many things I did
not understand; but I could easily see that the meaning was to
pray me not to kill him.

. I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no
harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and
pointing tothe kid which I had killed, beckonedtohim corun
and fetch it,. which he did; and while he was wondering and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again, andbyaiid by I sawa greatfowl, like ahawk, sit upona
' tree within shot: so, to. let Friday understand a little what I
would do, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which
was indeed a parrot, thoughil thought it had been a hawk; I say,
pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under
the parrot,to let him seel wouldmake him fall, I madehim
understand that I Would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I
fired, and bid him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall.
He stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had said
to him; and I found he was the more amazed, because he did
not see me put any thing into the gun; but thought there must
be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing,
able to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing near or far off: and
the astonishment this created in him was such as could not wear
all" for a long time; and I believe, if I Would have let him, he
would have worshipped me and my gun : as for the gun itself,
he would not so much as touch it for several days after; but
would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when
he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was
to desire it not to kill him.

Well : after his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed
to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but
staid some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had flut-
tered a good way 03" from the place where she fell; however he
found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and, as I had
perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took this advan-
tagetochargethegunagain,and notlet himseemedoit,that
I might be ready for any other mark that might present; but
nothing more offered at that time: so I brought home the kid;
and the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well
asl could ; and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed
some of the flesh, and made some very good broth. After I had
begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very
glad of it, and liked it very well; but that which was strangest
tohim, was, to seemeeatsaltwithit. Hemadeasigntomc
that the salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his
own mouth, he seemed to nauseatc it, and would spit and sputter
atit, washinghis mouthwithfresh water afterit; ontheother
hand, I took some meat in my'mouth without salt, and I pre-z
tended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done
at the salt; but it would not do, he would never we forsalt with
meat, or in his broth; at least, not a great while, and then but a
very little.

Having thus fed him with boiledmeat and broth, I wastesolved-
tofusthim the nextdaywith roastingapiece of the kid: this

people do in England, setting two poles up, one on each side the
fire, and one acm the top, and tying the string to the cross
stick, letting the meat turn continually: this Friday admired
very much; but when he came to taste the flesh, he took so
many ways totell me howwell he liked it, that I could not but
understand him; and atlasthetoldme hewouldncvet atman's
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.

The next day I set him toworkto beating some corn out, and
siffingitinthe mannerI usedto do,asIobeervedbefore; and
hesoonunderstoodhowto doit asweflasLespeciallyafterhe

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to fwd in-
stead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and
plantalargerquantityofcornthan I used todo; soImarked
out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same-man-i
neras before,inwhich Friday not Only workedva'ywillingly, and
veryhard,but diditverycheerfiilly; andltoldhimwhatitwas
for, that it was forcorn tomake more bmd,beeausehewasnowi
widxmenndthatImighthaveenoughforhimandmyselftoo: he
appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know, that he
thought I had much more labour upon me on his account than I
had for myself, and that he would work the harder for me, if I
would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.
Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of
almost every thing I had occasion to all for, and of every place
I had to send him to, and talked a great deal to me; so that, in
short, I began now to have some use for my tongue again, which
indeed I had very little oceasion for before; that is to say, about
:pudz. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular
satisfaction in the fellow himself; his simple unfeigned honesty
appeared to me more and more every day, and I began really to
love the creature; and on his side, I believe he loved me more
than it was possible for him ever to love any thing before.

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination
to his own country again ; and having learned him Englixh so
well that he could answor me almost any questions, I asked him,
whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle?
At which he smiled, and said, Yes, yes, we always fight the
better ; that is, he meant, always get the better in fight; and so
we began the following discourse. You always fight the better!
said I. How came you to be taken prisoner then, Friday?

Friday. My nation beat much for all that.

11445:". How beat? if your nation beat them, how came you
to be taken?

Friday. They more many than my nation in the place where
me was; they take one, two, three, and me. My nation over
beat them in the yonder place, where me no was, - there my na-
tion take one, two, great thousand.

Master. But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies then?

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in
the canoe ,- my nation have no canoe that time.

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men theytake? Do theyearrythem away, and atthem as
these did ?

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.

Master. Where do they entry them?

Friday. Go to other place where they think.

Master. Do they come hither?

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither: come other else place.

Master. Have you been here with them?

Friday. Yes, I been here [points to the N. W. side If the
bland, which it seems, was their side]

By this I understood, that my man Friday had formerly been
among the savages who used to come on shore, on the farther
part of the island, on the same man-eating oceasions that he was
now brought for; and some time after when I took the-courage
to earry him to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned,
he presently knew the place, and told me, he was there once
when they sat up twenty men, two women, and one child: he
could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying
somanystonesonarow,andpointedtometotellthemover.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows ;--
that afterlhad hadthisdiscoursewithhim,l askedhimhow
far it was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoe:
were not often lost? He told me there was no danger, no em:-
ever lost; but that after a little way out to see, there was acme
rent, ande always one way in the morning, the other in the
afternoon. .

This] understandtobenomorethanthesetsofthetide,
asgoingout, orcoming in; but I afterwards understood it was
oceasioned by the great draught and reflux of the mighty river
Orquue; in the mouth, or the. gulph, of which river, as I
thought afterwards, our island lay; and this land, which I per-
ceived tothe "CandMFlfiwasthegmtislandeiMaon'
the north point of the mouth of the river: I asked Friday a

x 2
thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea,
the coast, and what nations were near : he told me all he knew
with the greatest openness imaginable. ' I asked him the names
of the several nations of his sort of people, but could get no other
name than Carib: ; from whence I easily understood, that these
were the Caribbecy, which our maps place on the part of America
which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoguc to Guinea,
and onwards to St. .Martha: he told me, that up a great way
beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon,
which must be W. from their country, there dwelt white bearded
men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I men-
tioned before; and that they had killed mac/1 mam, that was his
Word: by all which I understood he meant the Spaniard:, whose
cruelties in America had been spread over the whole countries,
and was remembered by all the nations from father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this
island, and get among those white men: he told me, Yes, yes, I
might go in two canoe; I could not understand what he meant,
or make him describe to me what he meant by two canoe ; till at
last, with great difficulty, I found he meant, that it must be in
a large great boat as big as two canoes.

This part of Friday': discourse began to relish with me very
well ; and from this time I entertained some hopes, that one time
or other I might find an opportunity to make my eseape from
this place, and that this poor savage might be a means to help
me to do it.

During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and
that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not
wanting to lay a. foundation of religious knowledge in his mind;
particularly, I asked him one time, Who made him? The poor
creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had asked
who was his father: but I took it by another handle, and asked
him, Who made the sea, the ground he walked on, and the hills
and woods? He told me it was one old Bermuda: that lived
beyondall; he couldducribe nothing ofthisgreatperson,butthat
hewasveryold; much older, hesaid, thantheseaor the land,
than the moonorthestars. Iaskedhimthen,Ifthisoldperson
had made all things, why did notall things worship him? He
looked very grave, and with a perfect look of innocence, said,
411 tiring: do my 0! to him. I asked him if the people who die
in his country went away any-where? He said Yes, they all
went to Bermuda. Then I asked him, whether those they eat
up went thither too? he said, Yes.

From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge
of the true Goo. I told him that the great Maker of all things
lived up there, pointing up towards heaven : that he governs the
world by the same power and providence by which he made it;
that he was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give every
thing to us, take every thing from us; and thus, by degrees, I
opened his eyes. He listened with great attention, and received '
with pleasure the notion of :7:qu Christ being sent to redeem us,
and of the manner of making our prayers to Gov, and his being
able to hear us, even into heaven. He told me one day, that if
our Goo could hear us up beyond the sun, he must needs be a
greater GOD than their Bermuda, who lived but a little way
off, and yet could not hear, till they went up to the great moun-
tains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him, if ever he
went thither to speak to him? He said, No, they never went
that were young men; none went thither but the old men; who
he called their. Oawookakee, that is, as I made him explain it to
me, their religious,or clergy; andthattheywe'nttosay 0! (so
he called saying prayers), and then came back, and told them
what Emanuele: said. By this I. 0W thit- there is 2"?"-
crafl even amongst the most blinded ignorant Pagans in .the
world; and the policy of making a secret religion, in order to
preserve the 'veneration of the people to the clergy. is'not only $0
be found in the Roman, but perhaps among all religions in the
world, even among the most brutish and barbarous savages. '

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday ; and
told him, that the pretence of their old men going up to the
mountains to say 0! to their God anmckee, was a cheat; and
their bringing word from thence what he said, was much more
so; that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any one
there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then I entered into a
long discourse with him about the devil, the original of him, his
rebellion against Goo, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his
setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped
instead of GOD, and as Gov, and the many stratagems he made
use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret
access to our passions and to our affections, to adapt his snares
so to our inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own tempters,
and to run upon our destruction by our own choice.

I found it was not. so easy to imprint right notions in his mind
about the devil as it was about the being of a Goo: nature
assisted all my arguments to evidence to himeven the neceasity
of a great first cause, and over--ruling governing power, a secret
directing Providence, and of the equity and justice of paying
homage to him that made us, and the like: but there appeared
nothing of all this in the notion of an evil spirit; of his original,
his being, his nature, and above all, of his inclination to do evil,
and to draw us in to do so too: and the poor Creature puzzled
me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural and
innocent, that I searce knew what to say to him. I had been
talking a great deal to him of the power of GOD, his omnipo-
tence, hisdreadfulnature to sin, his beinga consuming fire to
the workers of iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could
destroy us, and all the world in a moment; and he listened with
great seriousness to me all the while.

After this, I had been telling him how the devil was Goo's
enemyin the heartsofmen,andmdallhismaliceandokillto
defeat thegooddesignsof Providence, andtoruinthekingrbm
of Cnars'r in the world, and the like: Well, says Friday, but
you sayGoo is so strong,>> great,is he not much strong,much~
might as thedevil? Yes, yes, said 1, Friday, Goo is stronger
thanthe devil: Goo isabove thedevil, and therefore we pray to
Goo to tread himdowu undercurfeet, andenable ustoresist
his temptations, and quench his fiery darts. But, says he again,
If God much strong, mueh might a: the devil, why God no hill the
devil, :0 make him no more do wicked ?

I was strangely surprised at his question; and after all, though
Iwas nowanoldman, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill
enough qualified for a easuist or a solver of difficulties: and, at
first, Ieouldnot tell what to say; so I pretendednotto hear
him, and asked him what he said? but he was too earnest
for an answer to forget his question: so that he repeated it in
theverysame broken wordsas above. By thistime Ihadre-
covered myself a little, andI said, God will at last punish him
severely ; he is reamed/"or the judgment, and is to he east into the
bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire. This did not satisfy
Friday ; but he returns upon me, repeating my words, Reserve
at last! are no understand: but why not kill the devil now, not kill
great ago ? You may as well ask me, said I, why Goo does not
kill you andme, when wedowickedthingshere thatofi'end him:
we are preserved to repent and be pardoned. He muses awhile
at this: Well, well, says he, mighty afi'ectionately, that well; :0.
you, I, devil, all wicked, all prereme, repent, Gad pardon all.
Here I was rundownagainbyhimto the lastdegree, anditwas-
a testimony to me, how the mere notions ofnature, though they
will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a Goo, and
of aworship or homage due nothe supreme being ofGon, as .
the oonsequeneeofour nature; yet nothing but divine revela--
tion can form the knowledge of 3e": Christ, and of a redemp-.
tion purchased for us; of a Mediator; of a new covenant; and
of an Intercessor at the footstool of Goo's throne: I say nothing
but a revelation from Heaven ean form these in the soul; and
that therefore the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour 7cm Christ,
I mean the word of G00, and the Spirit of Goo, promised for
the guide and sanctifier of his people, are the absolutely necessary
instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of GOD,
and the means of salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my
man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden oceasion of going
out; then sending him for something a good way 03', I seriously
prayed to Goo, that he would enable me to instruct savingly
this poor savage, misting by his Spirit the heart of the poor
ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge of Goo
in Chrirt, reconciling him to himself, and would guide me to
speak so to him from the word of Goo, as his conscience might
be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved: when he
came again to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon
the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the world,
and of the doctrine of the Gospel preached from heaven, viz. of
repentance towards Goo, and faith in our blessed Loan 75314:,-
I then explained to him, as well as I could, why our blessed
Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of
Abraham, and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no share
in the redemption; that he came only to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel, and the like.

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge, in all the
methods I took for this poor creature's instruction; and must
acknowledge what I believe all that act upon the same principle
will find, that in laying things open to him, I really informed
and instructed myself in many things, that either I did not know,
or had not fully considered before; but which occurred naturally

to my mind, upon my searching into them for the information
ofthis'poor savage; and I had more affection in my inquiry
afterthingsuponthis occasion,than everlfelt before: sothat
whetherthis poorwildwretchwas the better for me or no,Ihad
great reason tobethankful thateverheeametome: mygrief
sat lighter upon me, my habitation grew comfortable to me be-
yond measure; and when I reflected, that in this solitary life,
which I hadbeen confinedto, I hadnotonlybeenmoved myself
to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the hand that had brought
me there, but was now to be made an instrument, under Provi-
dence, to save the life, and, fir ugh: I knew, the soul of a poor
savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and of
the Christian doctrine, that he might know Cmus'r Jesus, to
know who>>: 1': life eternal ; I say, when I reflected upon all these
things, a secret joy run through every part of my soul, and I
frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which
I had so often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that
could possibly have befallen me.

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my
time; and the conversation which employed the hours between
Friday and I was such as made the three years which we lived
there together perfectly and completely happy, if an] at}; fixing
a: complete happineu can be firmed in a :ublunary Hate. The
savage was now a good Christian, a much better than I ; though
I have reason to hope, and bless Goo for it, that we were equally
penitent, and comforted restored penitents: we had here the
word of Goo to read, and no farther of from his Spirit to in-
structthanifwehadbeeninEnglan.

I always applied myself to reading the Scripture, and to let
him know, as well as I'oould, the meaning ofwhat I read; and
he again by his serious inquiries and questions, made me, a: I
said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge,
than I should ever have been by my own private mere reading:
anotherthingleannotrefi-ainfromobserving herealso,fi-om
experience, in this retired part of my life; viz. how infinite and.
inexpressible a blessing it is, that the knowledge of Goo, and of
the doctrine of salvation by Christ 17:51", is so plainly laid down
in the word of Goo, so easy to be received and understood, that
as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of understand-
ing enough of my duty to earry me directly on to the great work
of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour
for life and salvation, to a seated reformation in practice, and
obedience to all Gon's commands, and this without any teacher
or instructor, (I mean human) so the same plain instruction suf--
ficiently served to the enlightening this savage creature, and
bringing him to be such a Christian as I have known few equal
to him in my life.

As to all the disputes, wranglings, strife and contention, which
has happened in the world about religion, whether niceties in
doctrines, or schemes of church government, they were all per-
fectly useless to us, as, for aught I can yet see, they have been
to all the rest in the world: we had the rare guide to heaven, 'viz.
' the word of GOD ; and we had, blessed be God ! comfortable views
of the Spirit of GOD, teaching and instructing us by his word,
leading a: into all truth, and making us both willing and obedient
to the instruction of his word: and I cannot see the least use
that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points in religion,
which have made such confusions in the world, would have been
to us, if we could have obtained it. But I must go on with the
historical part of things, and take every part in its order.

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak
fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him
with my own story, or at least so much of it as related to my
coming into the place; how I had lived there, and how long. I
let him into the mystery (for such it was to him) of gunpowder
and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,a or Ronixsoir Cursor; a 3 3

which he waswonderfully delighted with; and I made him a
belt with a fioghanging to it, such as in Englandwe wear
hangers in; and inthe frog,insteadofahanger,lgave-hima
hatchet, which m not only as good a weapon in some eases, but
much more useful upon other occaions.

I described to him the countries of Europe, and particularly

England, which I me from; how we lived, how we worshipped
Goo, how we behaved to one another, and how We traded in
ships to all the parts of the world. I gave him an account of
the wreck which I had been on board of, and shewed him, as
near as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all beaten
in pieces before, and quite gone.
>> I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength then,
but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat,
Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing, I asked
him what it was he studied upon. ? At last,sa says he, M: .m such
boat like can: to place at my nation.

I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I
had examined farther into it, I understood by him, that a boat,
such as that had been, earne on shore upon the country Where he
lived, that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress cf
weather. I presently imagined that some European ship must
have been east away upon their coast, and the boat might get
loose, and drive ashore ; but was so dull, that I never once thought
of men making eseape from a wreck thither, much less whence
they might come; so I only inquired after a dacrxption of the
boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough, but brought
me better to understand him, when he added, with some warmth,
We mm the white man: from drown: then I presently asked
him, if there were any white mm, as he called them, in the
boat? 2"", he said, the but full white mu. I asked him, how
many? he told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked him then,
what became of them? he told me, They live, they dwell at my
nation.

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently ima-
gined, that these might be the men belonging to the ship that
was cast away in sight of my island, as I now all it: and who,
after the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably
lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon
that wild shore among the savages.

Upon this I inquired of him more critically, what was become
of them? He assured me they lived still there, that they had
been there about four years, that the savages let them alone, and
gave them victuals to eat. I asked him, how it came to pass
they did not kill them, and eat them? he said, No, they make
brother with them: that is, as I understood him, a truce: and
then he added, They no eat man: but when make the war fight:
that is to say, they never eat any men, but such as come to fight
with them, and are taken in battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that being on the top
of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have
said, I had in a clear day discovered the main or continent of
America; Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very
earnestly towards the main land, and in a kind of surprise falls a
jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some
distance from him. I asked him what was the matter? Ojoy,
says he, 0 glad! there 3:: my country, there my nation!

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his
face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a
strangeeagerness, asifhehad amindtobe inhisownoountry
again; and this observation of mine put a great many thoughts
into me; which made me at first not so easy about my new man
Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt, but that if Friday
could get back to his own nation again, he would not only forget
all his religion, but all his obligations to me; and would be
forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and
come back perhapswith a hundredor two ofthem,and make
a feast upon me, atwhichhe might be as merryas he used tobe
with those of his enemies, when they were taken in war.

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for which _
I was very sorry afterwards: however, as my jealousy increased,
and held me someweeks, I was a. little more circumspect, and
notsofamiliar andkindtohim as before; inwhich Iwas cer-
tainly in the wrong too, the honest grateful creature having no
thought about it, but what consisted of the best principles, both
as a religious Christian, and as a grateful friend; as appeared
afterwards, to my fiill satisfaction.

Whilst myjealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
everyday pumpinghim,to seeifhewoulddiscoveranyofthe
new thoughts which I suspected were in him; but I found every
thing he said was so honest, and so innocent, that I could find
nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my un-
easiness, he made me at last entirely his OWn again; nor did he
in the least perceive that I was uneasy; and therefore I could
not suspect him of deceit.

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called to
him, and said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own
country, your own nation? Yes, he said, be be much 0 glad to be
at 111': my nation. What would you do there? said I: would
you turnwildagain, eat men's flesh again: andbeasavageas
you were before? He looked full of concern, and shaking his
head, said, No, no, Friday tall the>>: to live good, tell them to praj
God, tell them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk, In rat was
again. Why then, said Ito him, the} will Ellyn. He looked
grave at that, and then said, No, tho no kill me, the] willing lave
learn: he meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He
added, they learned much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat. Then I asked him, if he would go back to them? He
smiled at that, and told me he could not swim so far. I told
him I would make a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if
I would go with him. I go! said I, why they will eat me if I
come there. No, no, says he, M: make the>>: no out you, me out:
they much love you: he meant he would tell them how I had
killed his enemies and saved his life, and so he would make them
love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they
were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called them,
who came on shore there in distress.

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and
see if I could possibly join with these bearded men, who, I made
no doubt, were Spaniard: or Portuguese; not doubting but if I
could, we might find some method to escape from thence, being
upon the continent, and a good company together, better than
I could from an island forty miles of the shore, and alone with-
out help. So, after some days, I took Friday to work again, by
way of discourse; and told him, I would give him a boat to go
back to his own nation; and accordingly I carried him to my
frigate, which lay on the other side of the island; and having
cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in the water), I
brought it out, shewed it him, and we both went into it.

I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it; would
make itgo almost as swift and fast again as I could; so when
he was in, I said to him, Well now, Friday, shall we go to your
nation? He looked very dull at my saying so, which it seems,
was because he thought the boat too small to go so far. I told
him then I had a bigger: so the nextday I went to the place
where the first boat lay which I had made, but which I could not
get into the water; he said that was big enough; but then, as I
had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and-twenty
years there, the sun had split and dried it, thatit was in a man-
net rotten. Friday told me, such a boat would do very well,
and would arty much enough vittle, Milk, bread; that was his
way of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design
of going over with him to the continent, thatI told him we
would go and make one as big as that, and he should go home in-
it. He answered not one word, but looked very grave and sad.
Iaskedhim, whatwasthe matterwithhim? He asked meagain
thus, Why you angry mad with Friday? what rne done? I asked
himwhathemant? I told himeas notangrywith him atall.
No angry, no angry! says he, repeating the words several times.
Why tend Friday home away to my nation .? Why, said I, Friday,
did you not say you wished you were there? Tet, yet, says he,
with he hath there; no with Friday there, no matter there. In a
word, he would not think of going there without me. I go
there, Friday! said I, what should I do there? He turned very
quick upon me at this. You do great deal nauth good, says he,
you teach wild Mil: he good, :oher, tame MJ'; you tell then: know
God, pray God, and [five new life. Alat, Friday, said I, thou
knoweet not what thou Jayeet; I an: hut an ignorant man myself.
Yes, yes, says he, you teeehee me good, you teeehee then: good. No,
no, Friday, said I, you shall go without nae,- leave one here to live
by myself, a: I did before. He looked confused again at that
word, and running to one of the hatchet: which he used to wear,
he takes it up hastily, comes and gives it me. What must I do
with this ? says I to him. You take hill Friday, sayshe. 'What
"It"! I kill you for? said I again. He returns very quick, What
you tend Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday
away. This hespokeso earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his
eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in
him to me, and a firm molution in'him, that I told him then,
and often after,that Iwouldneversend hhnawayfiommgif
he wa' willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled
affection to me, and that nothing should part him from me, so
I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country
was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of
my doing them good; a thing which as I had no notion of my-
self, so I had not the least thought, or intention, or desire of
undertaking it: but still I found a strong inclination to my
attempting an escape, as above, founded on the supposition ga--
thered from the discourse; 'viz. that there were seventeen bearded
men there: and therefore, without any more delay, I went to
work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper to fell, and
make a large periagua or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There
were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of
periaguas and canoes only, but even of good large vessels: but
the main thing I looked at, was to get one so near the water, that
we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I
committed at first.

At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he knew
much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor
can I tell to this day what wood to call the tree we cut down,
except that it was very like the tree we call fthic, or between
that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour
and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this
tree out, to make it into a boat: but I shewed him how rather
to cut it out with tools, which after I shewed him how to use,
he did very handily; and in about a month's hard labour we
finished it, and made it very handsome, especially when, with
our axes, which I shewed him how to handle, we cut and hewed
the outside into the one shape of a boat. After this, however,
it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it were inch
by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but when she was in,
she would have mtried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water, and though she was so big, it
amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swift my man
Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along; so I
asked him if he would, and if we might venture over in her?
1" :5, he said, he venture over in her <<my well, though great blow
wind : however, I had a farther design that he knew nothing of,
and thatwas to make a mast and sail, and to fit her with an
anchor and able. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get;
so I pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near
the place, and which there was a great plenty of in the island;
and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him direc-
tions how to shape and order it: but as to the sail, that was my
particular are; I knew I had old sails or rather pieces of old
sails enough; but as I had had them now twenty-six years by
me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, not ima-
gining that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did
not doubt but they were all rotten; and indeed most of them
were so: however, I found two pieces which appeared pretty
good, and with these I went to work, and with a great deal of
pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may be sure) for want
of needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like
What we all in England a shoulder-of--mutton sail, to go with a
boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually
our ships long--boats sail with, and such as I best knew how to
manage; because itwassuch a one as I hadtotheboatinwhich
I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part of
my story.

I was near two months performing this last work; viz. rig-
ging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finished them very
complete, making a small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to
assist, if we should turn to windward; and, which was more than
all, I fixed a rudder to the stem of her, tosteer with; and
though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I knew the
usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself
with so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass,
though, considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that
failed, I think it cost me almost as much labour as making the
boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as
to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for though he
knew very well how to paddle the canoe, he knew nothing what
belonged to a sail and a rudder, and was the more amazed when
he saw me work the boat to--and--again in the sea by the rudder,
and how the sail gybed, and filled this way or that way, as the
course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like
one astonished and amazed; however, with a little use, I made
all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor,
except that as to the compass I could make him understand very
little of that: on the other hand, as there was very little cloudy
weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was
the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to
be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy sea-
sons ; and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-and--twentieth year of my cap-
tivity in this place; though the three last years thatI had this
creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account, my
habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of my
time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with the same
thankfulness to Goo for his mercies as at first; and if I had such
cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so now, hav-
ing such additional testimonies of the are of Providence over
me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts,
that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be ano-
ther year in this place: however, I went on with my husbandry,
digging planting, fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my
grapes, and did every necessary thing, as before.
The rainy season was in the meantime'upon me, when I 'kept
morewithindoors than at other times: so Ihadstowedournew
vessel as acme 3' we could, bringing her up into the creek,
where, 231 said inthe beginning,llanded myraftsfromthe
ship; andhalingherupto theshore,athighwatermark,.l
made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold
her, and just deep enough to give her water to float in; and
then, when the tide was out, we made a strong darn cross the
end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as to the
tide, fromthesea; andtokeeptherain ofl',welaida great
many boughsoftreessothick, that shewasaswellthatchedas
a house; tmd thus we waited for the months of November and
December, in which I designed to make my adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of
mydesignreturnedwiththe fairweather,lwas preparing daily
forthevoyage; andthefirstthingldidwas tolay byacertain
quantity of provision, being the stores for the voyage; and
intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon something
of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the sea--
shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which
we generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well
as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he eame
running back, and llew over my outward wall, or fence, like one
that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on; and
before I had time to speak to him, he criesouttome, 0 master!
0 master! 0 sorrow! 0 had! What's the matter, Friday? said
I. O yonder there, says he, one, two, three canoe! one, two, three !
By his way ofspealaing I concluded therewere six; but on
inquiry I found there were but three. Well, Friday, said I, do
not'befiighmd;soIheartenedhim upaswellasIoould.
However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly geared; for
nothing ran in hisheadbutthattheywerecometolookfor

him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat him, and the poor
fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him: I
comforted him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much
danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him: but,
said I, Friday, we must realm to fight them: Can you light,
Friday ? M: shoot, says he, hut there come many great number.
No matter for that, said I again, our guns will fright them that
we do not kill. So I asked him, whether, if I resolved to defend
him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid
him? He said, Me die, when you hid die, master,- so I went
and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I had been
so gooda husband of my rum, that I had a great deal left:
when he had drank it, I made him take the two fowling-piecas
which we always carried, and load them with large swan-shot as
big 'as small pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded
them with two slugs, and five small bullets each; and my two
pistols I loaded with a brace 'of bullets each: I hung my great
sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective-
glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could
discover; and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were
one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three tamer; and
that their whole business seemed to be the uiumphant banquet
upon these three human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed, but
nothing else more than as I had observed was usual with them.
I observed also, that they were landed, not where they had
done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek,
where the shore was low, and where a thick wood me close
almost down to the sea: this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman
errand these wretches came about, filled me with such indignation,
that I'came down again to Friday, and told him, I was twolved
to go down to them, and kill them all; and asked him if he
would stand by me. He was now gotten over his fright, andhissp'iritsbeingalittle raised with the dram I had given him,
hewas very cheerfiil; and told me, asbefbre,fiewaulddiewheu

Inthisfitoffiiry,Itookfirstand divided thearmswhich I

tomy righthandofnwamile,aswelltogetoverthecreekas
to get into the wood; so that I might come within shoot of them
before I could be discovered, which I had seen by my glass it

WhileIwas makingthis march, my former thoughts returning,
I began to abate my resolution; I donot mean, that I enter-
tained any fear of their number; forastheywere naked, unarmed
wretchec, it is certain I was superiortothem; nay,thoughIhad
been alone: but it occurred to my' thoughts, what call, what
occasion, much less what necessity I was in, to go and dip my
hands in blood,toattackpeople whohadneither done or intended
me any wrong; who, as to me, were innocent, and whose bar-
barouscustomswere their own disaster,beinginthem atoken

actions, much less an executioner of his justice; that whenever
he thought fit, he would take the cause into his own hands, and
by national vengeance punish them, as a people, for natioml
crimes; butthatinthemeantime, itwasnoneofmybusineas:
thatitwastrue, Friday mightjustifyit, because hewaa
declared enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could
not say the same with respect to me. These things were so
warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I
resolved I would only go and place myself near them, that I
might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act then
as Goo should direct; but that unless something oEered that
was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle
with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with all possible
wariness and silence (Friday following close at my heels) I
marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which
was next to them; only that one comer of the wood lay between
me and them: here I called softly to Friday, and shewing him
a great tree, which was just at the corner of the wood, I bade
him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see there
plainly what they were doing: he did so, and me immediately
back to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed there;
that they were all about the fire, eating the flesh of one of their
prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the sand, a little
from them, which he said they would kill next, and which fired
all the very soul within me. He told me, it was not one of
their nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had told me
of, that came to their country in the boat. I was filled with
horror at the very naming the white-bearded man, and, going to
the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon
the beach ofthe sea, with his hands and his feet tied with flags,
or things like rushes; and that he was an European, and had
clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about
fiftyyardsnearerto themthanthe placewhereIwas,which, by
going a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered,
and that then I should be within half shot of them; so I with-
held my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest
degree: .and going back about twenty paces, I got behind some
bushes, which held all the way till I esme to the other tree, and
then I came to a little rising ground, which gave me a fullyiew
of them, at the distance of about eighty yards.

I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of the dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground all close huddled together, and had
just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring
him, perhaps limb by limb, to their fire; and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday ; Now,
Friday, said I, do as I bid thee. Friday said, he would. Then,
Friday, says I, do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing. So
I set down one of the muskets and the fowling--piece. upon the
ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with the other
musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him do the like.
Then asking him if he was ready, he said, Yes. Then fire at
them, said I; and the same moment I fired also.

Fridaytookhisaim so much betterthanl,that ontheside
that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more;
and on my side, I killed one, and wounded two. They were,
you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation: and all of them,
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet, but did not imme-
diately know which way to run, or which way to look; for they
knew not from whence their destruction same. Friday kept his
eyes close upon me, that as I had bid him, he might observe
whatIdid; soassoonasthefirstshotwasmade, Ithrewdown
the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the
like: he mes me cock, and present, he did the same again.
Are you ready, Fridafy? said I. Yes, says he. Let fly then,
saidI, inthenameofGoo; andwiththatl firedagainamong
the amazed wrenches, and so did Friday; and as ourpieeeswere
now loaden with what I called swan-shot, or small pistol--bullets,
we found only two drop .; but so many were wounded, that they
ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatmes, all bloody,
and miserably wounded most of them; whereof three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.

Now Friday, says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and
taking up the musket, which was yet loaden, follow me, says I;
which he did, with a great deal of courage; upon which I rushed
out of the wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my
foot: as soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as
I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running as fastas I
could, which hy the way we: not very fast, being loader: with
arm: a: I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who
was, as I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between the place
where they sat and the sea; the two butchers, who were just
going to work with him, had left him, at the surprise of our first
fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had jumped
into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way : I
turned to Friday, and bid him step forwards, and fire at them;
he understood me immediately, and running about forty yards to
be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had killed them
all; forlseethem all fallofa heap into the boat,thoughlsaw
two of them up again quickly: however he killed two of them,
and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the
boat, as if he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife,
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his
hands and feet I lifted him up, and asked him m the Portuguese
tongue, what he was? He answered in Latin, Chrim'arus; but
was so weak and faint, that he couldscarce stand, or speak; I took

my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that
he should drink, which he did; and] gave him a piece of bread,
which he eat; then I asked him, what countryman he was. i and
he said, Espagnole; and, being a little recovered, let me know,
by all the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my
debt for his deliverance. Srignior, said I, with as much Spanish
aSIeouldmalteup,wewill talkafterwards,butwe mustfight
now: ifyou have any strength left, take this pistol and sword,
and lay about you: he took them very thankfully, and nosoonef

two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole
wasasurprisetothem,sothepoorcreatureswere:iomuch
frighted with the noise of our pieces, that they fell down for
mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt
their own escape, than their fieshhadtoresistourshot; andthat
was the case ofthose five that Friday shot at in the boat; foras
three of them fell with the hurt they received, so the other two
fell with the fright.

I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being willing
to keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my
pistol and sword: so I called to Friday, and bad him'run up to
the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay
there,thathadbeendischarged, whichhe didwithgreatswift--
nets; and then giving him my musket, I sat down myself to
load all the restagain, and bade them come to me when they
wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there happened a
fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages,
who made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the
same weapon that was to have killed him before, if _I had not
prevented it. ' The Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as
could be imagined, though Weak, had fought this India>> a good
while, andhadcuthim twogrestwoundson his head; but the
savage, being a stout lusty fellow, closing in with him, had
thrown him down (being faint), and was wringing my sword
out of his hand, when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely
quitting hissword, drew the pistol fromhisgirdle,shotthe
savage through the body, and killed him upon the spot, before
I whowasrunnmgtohelphunmouldoomeneerhim

Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the flying
wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with
that he dispatched those three, who, as I said before, were
wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could come--up
with; and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him
one of the fowling pieces, with which he pursued two of the
savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to
run, they both got from him into the wood, where Friday
pursued them, and killed one of them; but the other was too
nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet had. plunged
himself into the sea, and swam with all his might of to those
two who were left in the canoe, which three in the came, with one
wounded, who we know not whether he died or no, were all
that amped our hands of one-and-twenty. The account of the
rest is as follows:

3 Killed at our shot from the tree.

2 Killed at the next shot.

2 Killed by Friday in the boat.

2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.

1 Killed by dim, in the wood.

3 Killed by the Spaniard.

4, Killed, being found dropped here and there of their wounds,

or killed by Friday in his chase of them.
4. Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded; if not dead.

Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to get out of gun.
shot; and though Friday made two or three shot at them, I did
not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had
me take one of their cancer, and pursue them; and indmd I was
very anxious about their escape, lest carrying the news home to
their people, they should come back, perhaps, with two or three
hundred oftheirtmcr, and devour us by mere multitude; so I
consented to pursue them by sea; and running to one oftheir
can", Ijumped in, and Me Friday follow me; but wheh I
was in the mm, '1 was surprisedto find another poor cream
lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for
the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what the-
matter was; for he had not been able to look up over the side of-
theboat,hewastiedsohard,neckandheels,andhadbeentied
solong,thathehadmllylittlelifeinhim.

I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, which they had
bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he could
not stand, or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it
seems, still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed.

WhenFridayesmetohim,Ibadehimspaktohim,andtell
him of his deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made him
give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being
delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when
Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, it would

him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed,
jumped about, danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head, and then sung and jumped about
again like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I
oouldmakehimspeaktome, ortellmewhatwasthe matter;
but when he came a little to himself, he told me that it was his
father. -

It was not my for me to express how it maved me, to see
what ecstasy and filial afl'ection had worked in this poor ravage,
at the sight ofhis father, and ofhis being delivered from death;
nor indeed an I describe half the extravaganciel of his afi'ection,
afterthis; forhewentintothehoatandoutoftheboatagrent
many times: when he went in to him, he would sit down by
him, open his breast, and hold his father's had close to his

and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving
whatthecasewas,gavehimsomerumoutofmybottle to rub
them with, which did them a great deal of good.

- This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other ravages, who were now gotten almost out of sight; and it
was happy for us that we did not; for it blew so hard within
two hours after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that fi'om
the north-wen, which was against them, that I could not suppose
their boat could live, or that they ever reached to their own
coast.

But to return to Friday,- he was so busy about his father,
that I could not find in my heart to take him off for some time:
but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to
me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the
highest extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given his father
any bread? He shook his head, and said, None: ugly dog eat
all up self. So I gave him a take of bread out of a little pouch
I carried on purpose; I also gavehimadram forhimselfibuthe
would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my
pocket also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave him a
handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his
father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and run
away as if he had been bewitched. He run at such a rate (for
he was the swiftest fellow of his foot that ever I saw), I say, he
run at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were, in an in-
stant; and though I eallcd and hallooed (300 after him, it was all
one; away he went, and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come
back again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came
nearer, I found his pace was slacker, because he had something
in his hand.

When he me up to me, I found he had been quite home for
an earthen jug.or pot, to bring his father some freshwater; and..4.-

carry him to our dwelling, wherelwould take care ofhim: but
Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon
hisback,and carriedhim awayto the boat, andsethimdown
softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the
inside of it, and then lifted them quite in, and set him close to
his father, and presently stepping out again, launched the boat
off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk,
though the wind blew pretty hard too; so he brought them both
safe into our creek; and leaving them in the boat, runs away to
fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and
asked him, whither he went? He told me, Ga fetch more but;
so away he went like the wind; for sure never man or horse run
like him, and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon
as I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and then went to
help our new guests out of the boat, which he did; but they
were neither of them able to walk; so that poor Friday knew
not what to do.

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling
to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to
me, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and
Friday and I carried them up both together upon it between us;
but when we got them to the outside of our wall or fortifieation,
we were at a worse loss than before; for it was impossible to get
them over; and I was resolved not to break it down: so I set
to work again ; and Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made
a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above that with
boughs of trees, being in the space without our outward fence,
and between that and the grove of young wood which I had
planted: and here we made them two beds of such things as I
had; 'viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie
on, and another to cover them on each bed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich
in subjects; and it was a merry reflection which I frequently
made, how like a king I looked: first of all the whole country
was my own mere'property; so that I had an undoubted right
of dominion; 2"], My people were perfectly subjected. I was
absolute lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to me, and
were ready to lay down their lives, if Mere had been occasion for
it, for me; it was remarkable too, I had but three subjects, and
theywere ofthree diEerent religions. My man Friday wasa
protestant, his father a pagan and a cannibal ; and the Spaniard
was a papist: however, I allowed liberty of conscience through-
out my dominions: but this is by the way.
Assoonaslhadsecuredmytwoweakrescuedprisoners, and
given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to
think of making some provision for them; and the first thing I
did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and
a goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed: when I cut of
the hinder quarter, and, chopping it into small pieces, I set Fri-
day to work to boiling and stewing, and made themavery good
dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; having put some barley
and rice also into the broth, and as I cooked it without doors
(forI made nofliewithinmyirmerwall)solearrieditallinto
the new tent; and having set a cable there for them, I sat down
and eat my dimer also with them; and, as well as I could,
cheered them and encouraged them, Friday being my interpreter,
especially to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too : for the
Spaniard spoke the language of the ravage: pretty well.
Afterwehaddined, orrathersupped,lordered Fridajto
take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our musquets and other
fire-arms, which for want of time, we had left upon the place of
battle; andthenextdaylorderedhimtogoandburythedqd
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would pre-
sently be ofi'ensive; and I also ordered him to bury the horrid
remains of their barbarous feast, which I knew were prettymuch,
andwhichloouldnot think ofdoingmyself; nay,Ieouldnot
bear to see them, ifI went thatway; all which he punctually
performed, and defaced the very appearance of the savage: being
there; so that when I went again, I could scarce know where it
was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the

place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two

new subjects; and first I set Friday to inquire of his father, what
he thought of the escape of the ravage: in that canoe ? and whether
we might expect a return of them with a power too great for us
to resist? His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat
never could live out the storm which blew that night they went
05', but must of necessity be drowned or driven south to those
other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured, as they
were to be drowned if they were cast away; but as to what they
would do if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not: but
it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully frighted with the
manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he
believed they would tell their people they were all killed by thun-
der and lightning, not by the hand of man ; and that the two which
appeared (viz. Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits or furies
come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. This,
he said, he knew, because he heard them all cry out so in their
language to one another; for it was impossible for them to con--
ceive that a man should dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at '
a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now. And
this old savage was in the right, for, as I understood since by other
hands, the savages never attempted to go over to the island after-
wards. They were so terrified with the accounts given by those
four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), that they believed
whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with
fire from the gods.

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under continual

apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard,
I and all myarmy; for aswewere nowfourofus, I wouldhave
ventured upon a hundred of them fairly in the open field at any
time. '

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear
of their coming wore of, and I began to take my former thoughts
of a voyage to the main into consideration, being likewise
assured by Friday s father, that I might depend upon good usage
from their nation on his account, if I would go.

But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a serious
discoume with the Spaniard, and when I understood, that there
were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having
been cast away, and made their escape to that side, lived there at
peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore put to it for
necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars
of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship bound from
the Rio de la Plata to the Havana, being directed to leave their
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring
back what European goods they could meet with there; that they
had five Portuguese seamen on board, who they took out of ano-
ther wreck; that five of their own men were drowned when first
the ship was lost ; and that these escaped through infinite dangers
and hazards, and arrived almost starved on the Cannibal coast,
where they expected to have been devoured every'moment.

He told me, they had some arms with them, but they were
perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder or ball, the
washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder, but a little
which they used at their first landing to provide themselves some
food.

I asked him what he thought Would become of them there;
and if they had formed no design of making any escape? He
said, they had many consultations about it; but that having
neither vessel, or tools to build one, or provisions of any kind,
theircounselaalwaysendedintearsanddespair
I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal
from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if they
were all here, it might not be done? Itold him with freedom,
I feared mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me, if I put my
life in their hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in
the nature of man? nor did men always square their dealings by
the obligations they had received, so much as they did by the
advantages they expected. I told him, it would be very hard,
that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and that
they should afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain,
where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what
necessity, or what accident soever, brought him thither; and that
I had rather be delivered up to the ravages, and be devoured
alive, than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be car-
ried into the inguisition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded,
if they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build a
bark large enough to carry us all away either to the Brasil:
southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast northward: but
that if in requital they should, when I had put weapons into their
hands, carry me by force among their own people, I might be ill
used for my kindness to them, and make my case worse than it
was before.

He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuity, that
their condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it,
that he believed they would abhor the thought of using any man
unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance; and that, if
I pleased, he would go to them with the old man, and discourse
with them about it, and return again, and bring me their answer:
that he would make conditions with them upon their solemn'
oath, that they should be absolutely under my leading, as their
commander and captain; and that they should swear upon the
holy sacraments and the gospel, to be true to me, and go to such
christian country as that I should agree to, and no other; and to
be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they were
landed safely in such country as I intended; and that he would
bringacontractfi'omthemundertheirhandsforthatpurpose.

Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself, that he
would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him
orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his
blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among his
countrymen.

He told me, they were all of them very civil honest men, and
they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having neither
weapons or clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discre-
tion of the ravages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their.
own country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their
relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them,
if possible, and to send the old ravage and this Spaniard over to
them totreat: butwhen he hadgottenall thingsin readiness to.
go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much
prudence in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other
hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it; and, by
his advice, put ofi" the deliverance of his comrades for at least
halfa year. The case was thus:

He had been with us now about a month; during which time
I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the assist-
ance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently what
stock of corn and rice I had lain up; which, as it was more
than sufficient for myself, so it was not suflicient, at least with-
out good husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to
number four: but much less would it be sufficient, if his coun-
trymen, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive, should come
over; and least ofall would it be sufiicient to victual our vessel,
if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colo-
nies of America. So he told me he thought it would be'more'
advisable, to let him and the two other dig and cultivate some
more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that
we should wait another harvest, that we might have supply of
corn for his countrymen when they should come; for want
might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think them-
selves delivered, otherwise than out of one difiiculty into another.
You know, says he, the children of Ivar], though they rejoiced
at first at their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even
against Goo himself, that delivered them, when they me to
want bread inlthe wilderness.

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I
.could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I
was satisfied with his fidelity: so we fell to digging, all four of
us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted;
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it was seed-
time, we had gotten as much land cured and trimmed up as we
sowed twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice,
which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare; nor indeed
did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the
six months that we had to expect our crop, that is to say, reckon-
ing from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not
to be supposed it is six months in the ground in the country.

Having now society enough, and our number being suficient
to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless
their number had been very great, we went freely all over the
island, wherever we found occasion; and as here we had our
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at
1:4:th m, to have the means of it out of mine; to this purpose,
I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for our work, and
I set Friday and his father to cutting them down; and then I
caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thought on that
affair, to oversee and direct their work: I shewed them with
what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single
planks, andI eausedthe'mnodothe like,tilldiey_hadmade
aboutadozenlargeplanksofgoodoak, neartwofoot broad,
thirty--five foot long, and from two inches to four inches thick:

what prodigious labour it took up, any one may imagine.

At the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of
same goats asmuch as I could; and to this purpose I madeFri--
day and the Spaniard to go out one day, and myself, with Friday,
the next day, for we took our turns: and by this means we got
above twenty young'kids to breed up with the rest: for when-
ever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to our
flock: but above all, the season for curing the grapes coming
on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the
sun, that I believe, had we been at 41km, where the raisins of
the sun are cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty barrels;

andthese, withourbread, wasagreatpartofourfood,andvery
goodlivingtooflassureyou; for itxsanexceedmg nourishing

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however,
it was enough to answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels
of barley, we brought in and threshed out above two hundred
and twenty bushels : and the like in proportion of the rice, which
was store enough for our food to the next harvest, though all
the sixteen Spaniard: had been on shore with me; or, if we had
been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifirlly have victualled
our ship, to have carried us to any part of the world, that is to
say, of America. When we had thus housed and secured our
magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-work;
viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was
very handy-and clatter-nus at this part, and often blamed me, that
I did not make some things for defence of this kind of work:
but I saw no nwd of it. And now, having a full supply of fixed

for all the guests 1 expected, I gave the Wriard leave to go
over to the main, to see what he could do with thwe he left be-
hind him there. I gave him a strict charge in writing, not to
bring any man with him, who would not first swear, in the pre-
sence of himself and the old savage, that he would no way injure,
fight with, or attack the person he should find in the island, who
was so kind to send for them in order to their deliverance; but
that they would stand by and defend him against all such attempts;
and wherever they went, would be entirely under, and subjected
to his commands; and that this should be. put in writing, and
signed with their hands: how we were to have this done, when
I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed was a question
which we never asked.

Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the old ravage
(the father of Friday) went away in one of the canoes, which
they might be said to come in, or rather were brought in, when
they came as prisoners to be devoured by the meager.

I gave each of them a musket with a firelock on it, and about
eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be very good
husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent
occasrons.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by.
me in view of my deliverance for now 27 years and some days;
I gave them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient
for themselves for many days, and sufficient for their countrymen
for about eight days' time; and wishing them a good voyage, I
see them go, agreeing with them about a signal they should hang
out at their return, by which I should know them again, when
they came back, at a distance, before they came on shore.

They went away with a fair- gale on the day that the moon
was at full; by my account in the month of October ,- but as for
an exact reckoning of days, afterI had once lost it, I could never
recover it again; nor had I kept even the number of years so
punctually, as to be sure that I was right, though as it proved
when I afterwards examined my account, I found] had kept a
true reckoning of years.

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a

strange and unforeseen accident intervened of which the like has
not, perhaps, been heard ofin history. I was fast asleep in my
hutch one morning, when my man Friday came running in to
me, and called aloud, Master, Master, they are come, they are
come. .
I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as
I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which (by
the way) was bythistime grown to be avery thick wood; I
say, regardless of danger, I went without my arms, which was
not 7my custom to do; but I was surprised, when turning my
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league and a
half": distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder of nut-
ton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring
them in: also I observed presently, that they did not come from
that side which the shore lay on, but from the southermost end
of the island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bid him lie
close, for these were not the people we looked for, and that we
might not know yet whether they were friends or enemies.

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass, to
see what I could make of them; and having taken the ladder
out,Iclimbeduptothetopofthe hill,asI usedtodowhenI
was apprehemive of any thing, and to take my view the plainer
without being discovered.

I hadsearcesetmyfooton the hill, when myeyeplainlydis--
coveredashiplyingatananchor,atabouttwo leagueaandahalf's
distance from me, S. S. E., but not above a league and a half
from the shore, By my observation it appeared plainly to be an
English ship, and the boat appeared to be an Englirl: long-boat.

Icannotexpress theconfusion I washhtboughthejoyof
seeing aship, and onewhom I had reason tobelievewasmanned
by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such 'as
I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret doubts hung about

me, I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep upon
my guard. In the first place it occurred to me to consider what

business an English ship could have in that part of the world;
since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where
the Englirh had any trafiick; and I knew there had been no
storms to drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they
were English really, it was most probable that they were here
upon no good design; and that I had better continue as I was,
than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger,
which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no
possibility of its being real. That such hints and notices are
given us, I believe few that have made any observations of things
can deny; that they are certain discoveries of an invisible world,
and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the tendency
of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why should we not
suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme,
or inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and that they
are given for our good?

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of
this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret
admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been undone
inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before, as you will
see presently.

_I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw the boat
draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at
for the convenience of landing; however, as they did not some
quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I for-
merly landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the
beach, at about half a mile from me, which was-very happy for
me; for otherwise they would have landed just, as I may say, at
my door, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and
perhaps, have plundered me of all I had.

Whentheywereonshore,lwasfully satisfiedtheywere
Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought were
Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven men,
whereof three of them I found Were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on
shore, they took those three out of the boat as prisoners. One
of the three I could perceive using the most passionate gestures
of entreaty, affliction and despair, even to a kind of extravagance;
the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes,
and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the first.

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what
the meaning of it should be. Friday ealled out to me in English,
as well as he could, 0 master! you see English man: rat prironer:
a: well a: savage mam. Why, said I, Friday, do you think the}
are going to eat the>>: then ? Yes, says Friday, the} will eat them.
No, no, said 1, Friday; I a>>: aflaia'thq will murder that indeed,-
hut you may he sure Ihq will not eat them.

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was,
but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every
moment when the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I
saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass (as the
seamen eall it) or sw0rd, to strike one of the poor men; and I
expected to see him fall every moment, at which all the blood in
my body seemed to run chill in my veins.

I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the ravage that
wasgone withhim; or that I had anyway to haveeome un-
discovered within shot .of them, that I might have rescued the
three men; for I sawnofire-arms theyhad amongthem; but it
fell out to my mind another way.

After I hadobserved theoutrageous usageofthethree men
by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows ran scattering
about the land, as if they wanted to see the country. I ob-
served, that the three other men had liberty to go also where they
pleased; but theysatdown all three upon the ground very pen-
sive, and looked like men in despair.

' This put me in mind of the first time when I eame on shore,
and began to look about me; how I gave myself over for lost,
how wildly I looked round me, what dreadful apprehensions I
had, and how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of being
devoured by wild beasts.

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive
by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land, by the
storms and tide by which I have since been so long nourished
and supported; so these three poor desolate men knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near itwas
to them, and how effectually and really they were in a condition
of safety, at the same time that they thought themselves lost,
and their case desperate.

So little do we see before us in the world, and so much reason
have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world,
that he does not leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but
that in the worst circumstances they have always something to
be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than
they imagine ; nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the
means by which they seem to be brought to their destruction.

It was just at the top of high-water when these people came
on shore, and while partly they stood parleying with the prisoners
they brought, and partly while they rambled about to see'wlzat
kind of place they were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away, leaving
their boat aground.

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found after-
wards, having drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep; how-
ever, one of them waking sooner thanothe other, and finding the
boat too fastagroundforhimto stirit, hallooedforthe restwho
were straggling about, upon which they all soon came to the
boat; but itwas pastall their strength tolaunch her, the boat
being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy
sand, almost like a quicksand.

In this condition, like true seamen, who are, perhaps, the
least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and
away they strolled about the country again; and I heard one of
them say aloud to another (calling them off from the boat),
Why let her alone, Jack, can't ye! she'll flan! next tide. By
which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry, of what coun--
trymen they were.

All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir
out of my castle, any farther than to my place of observation,
nearthetop ofthe hill; and very glad has, to think howwell
it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the
boat could be on float again, and by that time it would be dark,
and I might be more at liberty to see their motions, and to hear
their discourse, if they had any.

In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle, as before,
though with more eaution, knowing I had to do with another
kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom
I had made an excellent marksmanwith hisgun, to load himself
with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieees, and I gave him
three musquets: my figure, indwd, was very fierce; I hadmy
formidable goat-skin cost on, with the great eap I have men-
tioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a
gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the heat
ofthe day, Iibund thatin shortthey were allgonestraggling
into the woods, and, as I thought, werelaid downto sleep; the
three poor distressedmen moanxiousfortheireonditiontoget

u . . -
any sleep, were however set down under the shelter of a great
tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and as I thought, out
of sight of any of the rest.

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn
something of their condition. Immediately I marched in the
figure as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind me,
as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring
a spectre-like figure as I did.

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before
any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, What
are ye, Gentlemen .?

They started up at the noise; but were ten times more con-
founded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure thatI made :
they made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just
going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English. Gen-
tlemen, said I, do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may
have a friend near you, when you did not expect it. He must
be sent directly from Heaven, then, raid one of them very gravely
to me, and pulling of his hat at the same time to me, for our con-
dition is past the help of man. All help is from Heaven, Sir,
raid I: but can you put a stranger in the way how to help you?
for you seem to me to be in some great distress. I saw you
when you landed; and when you seemed to make application to
the brute: that came with you--I saw one of them lift up h's
sword to kill you.

The poor manwith tears running down his face, and trembling,
looking like one astonished, returned, .47>> I talking to God or
man ? I: it a real man, or an angel? Be in no fear about that,
Sir, said I: if Gov had sent an angel to relieve you, he would
have come better clothed, and armed after another manner than
you see me in; pray lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Eng-
liehmn, and disposed to assist you; you see I have one servant
only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, Can we
serve you? What 15 your case? 1%"
Our case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you, while our mur-'
deters are so near; but in short, Sir, I was commander of that
ship; my men have mutinied against me, they have been hardly
prevailed on not to murder me, and at last have set me on shore
in this desolate place, with these two men with me, one my
mate, the other a passenger; where we expected to perish, be-
lieving the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to'
think of it.

Where are those brutes, your enemies? said I: Do you.know
where they are gone? There they lie, Sir, said he, pointing to a
thicket of trees; my heart tremele: far fear tho have seen u:,
and heard you meal; if the} have, the} will certainly murder
a: all.

Have they any fire arms? said I: he answered, they had only
two pieces, and one which they left in the boat. Well then,
said I, leave the rest tome; I seetheyareall asleep; itisan
easything to kill them all; but shall we rather take them pri--
soners? He told me there were two desperate villains among
them, that it was searce safe to shew any mercy to'; but if they
were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their duty.
I asked him, Which they were? He told me, he could not at
that distance describe them; but he would obey my orders in
any thing I would direct. Well, said I, let us retreat out of
their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve fur-
ther; so they willingly went back with me, till the woods
covered us from them.

Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your deliverance,
are you willing to make two conditions with me? He anticipated
my proposals, by telling me, that both he and the ship, if re-
covered, should be wholly directed and commanded by me in
every thing; and ifthe ship was not recovered, he would live
and die with me in what part of the world soever Iwould send
him; and the two Other'rnen said the same.

Well, said I, my condition: are but two: 1. That while you
stay on this island with me, you will not pretend to any autho-
rity here; and if I put arms. into your hands, you will upon all
oceasions give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or
mine, upon this island, and in the mean time to be governed by
my orders.

2. That if the ship is, or may be recovered, you will carry me
and my man to England, passage free.

He gave me all the assurance that the invention and faith of
man could devise, that he would comply with these most reason--
able demands; and besides, would owe his life to me, and ac-
knowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived.

Well then, raid 1, here are three musket: for you, with pow-
der and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done:
he shewed all the testimony of his gratitude that he was able;
but offered to be wholly guided by me: I told him, I thought
it was hard venturing any thing; but the best method I could
think of, was to lire upon them at once, as they lay; and if any
were not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, we
might save them, and so put it wholly upon Gon's providence
to direct the shot.

He said, very modestly, that he was loth to kill them, if he
could help it; but that those two were incorrigible villains, and
had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they
escaped, we should be undone still: for they would go on board,
and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. Well
then, said I, necessity legitimates my advice; for it is the only
way to save our lives. However, seeing him still cautious of
shedding blood, I told him, they should go themselves, and
manage as they found convenient. '

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake,
and soon afier we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him,
If either of them were the men who he had said were the heads
of the mutiny? He ,said No. Well then, said I, you may letthem escape, and Providenee'se'ems'to'hav'e wakened them on
purposeoo save themselves: Now, said I' ifthe rest escape you,
it it your flank. '

Animatedwiththis, hetook themusketlhad given himin
hishand, andpistolinhisbelt,and histwoeomradeswithhim,
witheech man apiecein his hand: thetwo men, who were with
him, going first, made some noise, at which one of the semen,
who was awake, turned about, and seeing them coming, cried
out to the rest; but 'it'was toolate then; for the moment he
cried out, they fired, I mean the mm mm, the captain wisely
reserving his own piece: 'they had so well aimed their shot at
the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and
the other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started
up upon his feet, and called etgerly for help to the other: but
the captain, stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for
help; he should all upon Goo to forgive his villany; and with
that word knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so
that he never spoke more: there were three more in the com-
pany, and one of them was also slightly wounded; by this fime
I was come; and when they saw their danger, and that it was
in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The'captain'told them
he would spare their lives, if they would give him any assurance
of their abhonence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and
wouldswar to be faithful to him in recovering theship,and
afterwards in carrying her back to far-aim, from whence they
' same. They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity
that could be desired; and he waswilling to believe them, and
spare their lives, which I was not against; only I obliged him
to keep them bound'hand and foot while they were upon the
island. '

While thiswasdoing, I sent Fridajwiththe captain's mate to
theboat,withorderstosecureher,andbringawaytheoarsand
sail,whichthey did; and byand bye,three straggling men,that
were (happily for them) parted from the rest, earne back upon
hearing the guns fired; and seeing their captain, who before was
their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be bourxi
also, and so our victory was complete.

It now remained, that the captain and I should inquire into
one another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amaze-
ment, and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and indeed, as my
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply;
but when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I
seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life,
the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word
'more.

After this communication was at an end, I wried him and
his two men into my apartment, leading them in just where I
came out, viz. at the top of the house; where I refreshed them
with such provisions as I had, and shewed them all the con-
trivances I had made during my long, long inhabiting that
place.

All I shewed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing;
but above all, the captain admired my fortification; and how
perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which,
having now been planted near twenty yars, and the trees grow~
ing much faster than in England, was become a little wood, and
so thick, that it was unpassable in any part of it, but at that one
.side where I had reserved my little winding'passage into it: I
told him this was my castle, and my residence; but that I had
a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither I could
retreat upon occasion, and I would shew him that too another
time; but at present our business was to consider how to recover
the ship. He agreed with me as to that; but told me, he was
perfectly at a loss what measures to take; for that there were
still six-snd--twenty hands on board, who having entered into a
cursed conspiracy,, by which they had-all forfeited their lives to
the law, would be hardened in it nowby desperation; and would
carryit on,knowingthatiftheywere reduced,theyshouldbe
brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England, or to
any of the English colonies; and that therefore there .would be
no attackingthemwithsosmallanumberaswewere.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it
was a very rational conclusion, and that therefore something was
to beresolvedonveryspeedily,aswellmdrawthe menon
board into some snare for their surprise, ts to prevent their
landing upon us, and destroying .:us. upon this. -it pmently
occurred to me, that m a little while, the ship' s crew, wondering
what .was become of their comrades, and of the. boat, would
certainly come on shore in their other boat to see for them; and
that then perhaps they might come armed, and be too strong for
us: this he allowed was rational.

Upon this I told him, the first thingweweretodwwas to
stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they might not
carry her 03'; and taking every thing out of her, leave her so
far useless as nottobefittoswim; accordingly we wenton
board, took the arms which were left on board out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of brandy, and
another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of powder, and a
great lump of sugar in a piece of canvass; the sugar-was five
or six pounds; all which was very welcome to me, especially
the brandy and sugar, of which .I had had none left for many
years.

When wehadcsrriedallthesethingsonshore (theoars,
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat, were carried away before, as
above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had
comestmngenoughtomasterus,yetthey couldnotcarrry of
the boat.
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we could be
able to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they went
away without the boat, I did not much question to make her fit
again to carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and all upon our
friends the Spaniard: in my way; for I had them still in my
thoughts. .

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by
main strength, heaved the boat up upon the beach, so high that
the tide would 'not float her of? at high-water mark ; and,
besides, had broken a hole in her bottom, too big to be quickly
stopped, and were sat down musing what we should do, we heard
the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her ancient,
as a signal for the boat to come on board, but no boat stirred ; and
they fired several times, making other signals for the boat.

At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruitless, and
they found the boat did not stir, we saw them (by the help of
my glasses) hoist another boat out, and row towards the shore ;
and we found, as they approached, that there were no lees than
ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a
full view of them as they came, and a plain sight of the men,
even of their faces; because the tide having set them a. little to
the :55! of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come
to the same place where the other had landed, and where the
boat lay.

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the
captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the
boat; of whom he said that there were three very honest fellows,
who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being
overpowered and frighted.

But that as for the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief
oflicer among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as
any of the ship's crew; and were, no doubt, made desperate in
their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.

I smiled at him, and told him, that-men in our circumstances

were past the operation of fear: that seeing almost every con--
dition that could be was better than thatwewere supposed tobe
in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether death or
life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him, what he
thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a deliver-
ance was not worth venturing for? And where, Sir, said I, is
your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your
life, which elevated you a little while ago? For my part, said
I, there seems to be but one thing amiss in all theprospectofit.
What i: that? says he. Why, said I, it, is that, as you say,
there are three or four honest fellows among them, which should
bespared; hadtheybeenall ofthewickedpartofthe crew,I
should have thought Goo's providence had singled them out to
deliver them into your hands; for, depend upon it, every man
of them that comes ashore are our own, and shall die or live, as
they behave to us.
. As I spoke this with a raised'voice and cheerful countenance,
I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our
business: we had, upon the first appearance of the boat'scoming
from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and had
indeed secured them efi'ectually.

Twa of them, of whom the captain was less assured than
ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three (delivered
men) to my eave, where they were remote enough, and out of
danger ofbeing heard or discovered, or offinding their way out
of the woods, if they could have delivered themselves: here
they left them bound, but gave them provisions, and promised
them, if they continued there quietly, to give the- their liberty
inaday ortwo;.but thatifthey attemptedthdresapgthey
should be. put to dead: without mercy. They promised faith-

M a
fully to hear their confinement with patience, and were very
thankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions,
and a light 1th them; for Friday gave them candles (such as
We made ourselves) for their comfort; and they did not know
but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept
pinioned indeed, because the captain was not free to trust them;
but the other two were taken into my service upon their captain's
recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and'
die with us; so, with them and the three honest men, we were
seven men well armed; and I made no doubt we should be able
to deal well enough with the ten that were coming, considering
that the captain had said, there were three or four honest men
among them also.

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay,
they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore, hauling
the boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid
they would rather have left the boat at an anchor, some distance
from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her; and so
we should not be able to seize the boat.

Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to the
other boat; and it was easy to see they were under a great sur-
prise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a
great hole in her bottom.

After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or
three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they
could make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose;
then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their
small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the
woods ring; but it was all one; those in the cave,we were sure,
could not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it
well enough, yet durst give no answer to them.

They were so astonished at the surprise ofthis, that, as they
toldusafienrdgtheyresolvedtogoallonboardagainto
their ship, and let them know there, that the men were all mur-
dered, and the long-boat staved; accordingly, they immediately
launched the boat again, and got all of them on board.

The eaptain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set
sail, giving their comrades up for lost, and so he should still lose
the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered, ' but
'he was quickly as much frighted the other way.

They had not been long put of? with the boat, but we per--
ceived them all coming on shore again, but with this new
measure in their conduct, which, it seems, they consulted together
upon, viz. to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go on
shore, and go up into the country to look for their fellows.

This was a great disappointment to us; lbr now we were at a
loss what to do; for our seizing those seven men on shore would
beno advantage to us ifwe let the boat escape; because they
would then row away to the ship; and then the rest of them
would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our recovering the

ship would be lost.
HOWever, we had no remedy but to wait and see what the

issue of things might present: the seven men came on shore,
and the threewho remainedin the boatputher oftoagootl
distance from the shore, and mme to an anchor to wait for
them; so that it was impossible for nstoeomeatthern in the
hon -
- Those that me on shore kept close togidler, nnrehing
towards the top of the little hill, under which my habitation
lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not per-
ceive us: we could have been very glad they would have come
nearerto'us,sothatwe mighthavefiredatthem; orthatthey
would have gone farther off, that we might have come abroad. '

But when they werecome to die how of the hill, where they:
could see a great way in the valley and woods, which lay towards
the mirth-cart part, and where the island lay lowest, they shoumd
and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat
down together under a tree, to consider of it: had they thought
fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party of them had
done, they had done the job for us; but they were too fill] of
apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they
could not tell what the danger was they had to fear neither.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this con-
sultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley
again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we
should all sally upon them, just at the juncture when their pieces
were all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we
should have them without bloodshed. I liked the proposal,
provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to
them, before they could load their pieces again.

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time,
very irresolute what course to take; at length I told them, there
would be nothing to be done in my opinion till night; and
then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the shore, and so might use some
stratagem with them in the boat, to get them on shore.

We waited a great while, though very impatient for their
removing, and were very uneasy: when, after long consultations,
we saw them start all up, and march down toward thesea sea: it
seems, they had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with their
intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined
ittobeasitreallywas; that theyhad given over their search,
and were for going back again; and the captain, as soon as I told
him my thoughts, was readyto sink at the apprehensions of it;
but I pmently thought of a stutagem to fetch them back again,
and which answered my end to a tittle.

.I ordered Friday, and the eapeain's mate, to go over the little
creek amtward, towards the .place where the ravage: came on
shorewhenFridajwasrescued; andassoon astheyeametoa
little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them halloo
as loud as they could, andwait till they found the seamen heard
them; that as'soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them,
they should return it again, and then, keeping out of sight, take
a round, always answering when the others hallooed, to draw
them as far into the island, and among the woods, as posible,
and then wheel about again to me, by such ways as I directed
them.

They were just going into the boat, when Friday, and the
mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answering
run along the shore westward towards the voice they heard,
when they were presently stopped by the creek, where, the water
being up, they could not get over, and called for theboat to
come up, and set them over, as indeed I expected.

When they had set themselves over, I observed that the boat
beinggoneupagoodwayinto the creek,and asit werein an
harbour within the land, they took one of the three men out of
her to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, having
fastened her to the stump ofa little tree on the shore.

This was what I wished for, and immediately leaving Friday
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me,
anderossingthecreck out oftheir sight,we surprised the two
men before they were aware, one of them lying on shore, and
the other being in the boat; the fellow on shore was between
deeping and waking, and going to start up, the eapta'in, who
wasforemoa,raninupon him,andknockedhim down', and
then called out tohimintheboattoyield,orhewasadeadman.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a single man'
to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade
knocked down; besides this was, it seems, one of the three that
were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards
to join very sincere with us.

In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, by
hallooing and answering, fi-om one hill to another, and from one
wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left
them where they were very sure they could not reach back to the
boat before it was dark; and indeed they were heartily tired
themselves also by the time they came back to us.

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them.

It was several hours after Friday came back to me before
they came back to their boat; and we could hear the foremost
of them, long before they me quite up, calling to those behind
to come along; and could also hear them answer, and complain
how lame and tired they were, and not being able to come any
faster, which was very welcome news to us.

At length they came up to the boat; but it is impossible to
express their confusion, when they found the boat fast a--ground
in the creek. The tide ebbed out, and their two men gone;
we could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were gotten into an enchanwd
island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered; or else there were devils or spirits in it, and
they should be all eat-tied away and devoured.

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their
names a great many times, but no answer: after some time, we
could see them, by the little light there was, run about wringing
their hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes they would
go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then come ashore
again, and walk about, and so over the same thing again. -

My men would fain have had me given them leave to fall
upon them at once in the dark; butl waswillingtotake them
at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as
I could; and especially I was unwillingtohazard thekillingany
of our own men, knowing the other were very well armed: I
molved to wait to see if they did not separate; and therefore, to
make sure of them, I drew my ambuseadc nearer; and ordered

Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet as close'

to the ground as they could, that they might not be discovered,
and get as near them as they could powibly, before they offered
to fire.

They had not been long in that posture but that the boatswain,
who was the principal ringleader of the muu'ny, and had now
shewn himself the most dejected and dispiritcd of all the rest,
came walking towards them with two more of the crew;~the
captain was so eager, as having this principal rogue ,so much in
his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come
so near as to he sure of him; for they only heard his tongue
before: but when they came nearer, the eaptain and Friday,
starting upon their feet, let fly at them.

The boatswainwas killed upon the spot; the next manwas
shot into the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die
tillan hourortwoafter; andthethirdrunforit.

At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my
whole army, which was now eight men, viz. myself, generals
brim,- Friday, my lieutenant--general; the eaptain and his two
men, and the three prisoners of war, who we had trusted with
arms.

Weeameuponthem indeed in the dark, sothat they could

the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by namg to
try if I could bring them toa parley, and so might perhaps
reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired; for
indeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they
would be very willing to capitulate; so he ealls out, as loud as
he could, to one of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith. Tom Smith
answered immediately, Who's that! Robinson! For it seems he
knew his voice. The other answered, 4y, a}; for God": :ahe,
Tom Smith, throw down your arm, andyield, or you are all dead
men this moment.

Who must we yield to? Where are they ? says Smith again.
Here they are, says he: here is our captain and fifty men with
him, have been hunting you this two hours; the boatswain is
killed; Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and-if you
do not yield, you are all lost.

Will they give us quarter then? says Tom Smith, and we will
yield. I'll go and ash, ifyou promire to yield, says Rohimon. So
he asked the captain, and the captain himself then calls out;
You, Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down your arms
immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but iVill
Atkins. -

Upon this Will Jtltins cried out, For God's sake, captain, give
me quarter: what have I done 2 the] have been all a: had a: I:
(which by the way was not true, neither; for it seems this W'ill
Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, and
giving him injurious language :) however the captain told him
he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the go-
vernor's mercy, by which he meant me; for theyall called me
governor.

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged-their
lives; and I sent the man that had par-lied with them, and two
more, who bound them all; and then myth army of fifty
men, which, particularly with those three, were all but eight,
me up and seized uponthem all, and upon their host, only
that I kept myself and one more out of sight, for reasons of
state. . -

Our next workwas to repairthe boat, andto thinkofseizing
the ship; and as for the eaptain, now he had leisure to parley
with-them, he expostulated with them up0n the villany of their
practices with him, and at length, upon the farther wickedness of
their design; and how certainly it must bring them to misery
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their
lives. As for that he told them they were none of his prisoners,
but the commander of the island; that they thought they had
set him on 'shore in a barren uninhabited island; but it had
pleased Goo so to direct them, that the island was inhabited, and
that the governor was an Englishman ,- that he might hang them
all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with there
asjustice required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by
the governor to advise to prepare for death; for that he would
be hanged in the'morning.

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired
effect: Allin: fell upon his kneeato begthecaptain to interned:
with the governor for his life; and all the rest begged ofhim
for 600': sake, that they might not be sent to England.

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was
come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fela
lows in tobeheartyin getting possession oftheship; sol retired
inthedark from them, that theymight notseewhatkindofa
governor they had, and ealled the eaptain to me; when I ealled,
as at a good distance, oneofthe menwasorderedtospeakagain,
and say to the captain, Captain the commander call: for you : -and
presently the eaptain replied, Tel] 111': extellnuy I am just a coming.
This more perfectly amused them; and they all believed, that
the commander was just by with his fifty men.

Upon the mptain's coming to me, I told him my project for
seizing the ship, which he liked of wonderfully well, and resolved
to put it in execution the next morning.

But, in order to execute it with more art, and secure of suc-
cos, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should
go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and
send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay: this was
committed to Friday, and the two men who came on shore with
the captain.

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison; and it was
indeed a dismal place, especially to men in their condition.

The other I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I
have given a full description; and as it was fenced in, and they
pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they Were
upon their behaviour.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter
into a parley with them: in a word, to try them, and tell me,
whether he thought they might be trusted or no, to go on board,
and surprise the ship: he talked to them of the' injury done him,
of the condition they were brought to: and that though the go-
vernor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present
action, yet that if they were sent to England, they would all be
hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they would join in so
just an attempt, as to recover the ship, he would have the go-
vemor's engagement for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be
accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their knees
to the captain, and promised with the deepest imprecations, that
they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they
should owe their lives to him, and would go with him all over
the world; that they would own him for a father to them as
long as they lived.
Well, says the uptain, I must go and tell. the governor what
yousay, and seewhatI can do tobring himtoeonsenttoit:
so he brought me an account of the temper he found them in,
and that he verily believed they would be faithful.

However, that we might .be very secure, I told him he should
go back again, and choose out those five, and tell them, they
might see that he did not want men; that he would take out
those five, to be his assistants, and that the governor would keep
the other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle,
(my mm) as hostages, for the fidelity of those five; and that if
they proved unfaithfiil in the execution, the five hostages should
be hanged in chains alive upon the shore.

This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor
was in earnest; however, they had no way left them but to
accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much
as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition. I.
The captain, his mate, and passenger. 2. Then the two pri-
soners of the first gang, to whom, having their characters from
the captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted them with arms.
3. The other two who I had kept till now in my bower pinioned;
but,,upon the captain's motion, had now released. 4.. These
five released at last; so that they were twelve in all, besides five
we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.

I asked the eapmin if he was willing to venture with these
hands on board the ship : for as for me and my man Friday, I
did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven then left
behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep them
asunder, and supply them with victuals..

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast; but
Friday went twice a day to them, to supply them with necessa-
ries; and I nmdethe other two earryprovisions to a certain dis-
tance, where Friday was to take it.
When I shewed myselfto the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them, I was the person the governor had
ordered to look after them, and that it was the governor's plea-
sure that they should not stir any where but by my direction;
that if they did, they should be fetched into the castle, and be
laid in irons; so that as we never sufl'ered them to see me as
governor, so I now appeared as another person, and spoke of
the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all
oceasions.

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish
his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them; he made
his passenger captain of one, with four other men; and himself,
and his mate, and five more, went in the other; and they con--
trived their business very well; for they came up to the ship
about midnight. As soon as they came within call of the ship,
he made Robina>> hail them, and tell them they had brought of
the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they
had found them, and the like; holding them in a chat, till they
came to the ship's side; when the mptain and the mate, entering
first with their arms, immediately knOcked down the second mate
and carpenter with the butt end of their musquets, being very
faithfully seconded by their men; they secured all the rest that
were upon the main and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the
hatches to keep them down who were below, when the other
boat, and their men, entering at the fore-chains, secured the
forecastle of the ship, and the skuttle which Went down into
the cook-room, making the three men they found there pri--
soners.

When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain
ordered the mate with three men to break into the round house,
where the new rebel captain lay, and, having taken the alarm,
was gotten up, and with two men and a boy had gotten fire-arms
in their hands; and when the mate with a crow split open the
door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and
wounded the mate with a musquet ball, which broke his arm,
and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody.

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-
house, wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new mp-
tain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and
came out again behind one ofhis ears ;' so that he never spoke a
word; upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken
effectually, without any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered
seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with
me, to give me notice of his success; which you may be sure I
was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it
till near two of the clock in the morning.

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it
having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till
I was something surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of Governor,
governor: and presently I knew the captain's voice, when climb-
ing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the
ship, he embraced me in his arms. My dear friend and deliver",
says he, there 1': your ship, for :he i: all your':, and :0 are we,
and all that belong to her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there
she rode within a little more than half a mile of the shore; for
they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of
her; and the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor
just against the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up,
the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I
first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.

Iwas,at first,rendyto sink downwith the surprise: for Isaw
my deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands, all things easy,
andalargeshipjustradytoearrymewhitherl pleasedtngo.
At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him oneword;
butashehadtaken me mh:sarms,Iheldfastbyhim orI
should have fallen to the ground.

He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a bottle out
of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he brought
on purpose for me. After I drank it, I sat down upon the
ground, and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a word to him.

All thiswhile the poormanwasin as great aneostasyasl,
only not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand
kind tender things to me, to compose me and bring me to my-
self; but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all
my Spirits into confusion; at last .it broke out into tears, and in
a little'while after I recovered my speech.

Then I took my turn and embraced him as my deliverer, and
we rejoiced together. I told him, I looked upon him as a man
sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction
seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these were
the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence governing
the world, and an evidence, that the eyes of an infinite power
could search into the remotest corner of the world, and send help
to the miserable whenever he pleased.

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven;
and what heart could forbw to bless Him, who had not only in
a miraculous manner provided for one in such a wilderness, and
in such a desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance
must always be acknowledged to proceed!

When we had talked awhile, the captain told me, he had
brought me some little refreshments, such as the ship afi'orded,
and such as'the wretches, that had been so long his masters, had
not plundered him of: upon this he walled aloud to the boat,
and bid his men bring the things ashore that were for the go-
vernor; and indeed it was a present as if I had been one, not
thatwas tobe carried along with them, butasiflhadbeenm
dwell upon the island still, and they were all to go without me.
First, he had broughtmeaeueofbottlesfiill ofueeflentm
dial waters, six large bottle of Wm wine; the bottles held
two quarts a piece; two pound of excellent good tobacco, twelve
good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag
of peas, and about a hundred weight of biscuit.

He brought me also a box of sugar: a box of flour, a bag full
of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other
things: but besides these, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six clean new shirts, six very good
neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one
pair of stockings, and a very good suit of clothes of his own,
which had been worn but very little: in a word, he clothed me
from head to foot.

It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may
imagine to one in my circumstances; but never was any thing in
the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it
was to me to wear such clothes at their first putting on.

Afterthweceremoniespassed,andafterallhisgoodthings
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what
was to be done with the prisoners we had; for it was worth con~
sidering whether we might venture to take them away with us
or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible
and refractory to the last degree; and the captain said he knew
they were such rogues, that there was no obliging them; and if
he did earry them away it must be in irons, as malefactors, to' be
delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come
at; and I found that the captain himself was very anxious about
It.

Uponthis,ltoldhim, thatifhedesireditJdurstundertake
to bring the two men he spoke of, to make it their own request
that he should leave them upon 'the island. I should be very glad
of that, says the eaptain, with all my liter-t.

Well,saidl,lwill sendforthernup, andtalkwiththemfor
you: so I eaused Friday and the two hostages, for they were
now discharged, their comrades having performed their promise;
I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five
men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there
till I came.

After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit, and
now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the cap-
tain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I
told them, I had had a full account of their villanous behaviour
to the captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and
Were preparing to commit farther robberies; but that Providence
had ensnated them in their own ways, and that they were fallen
into the pit which they had digged for others.

I let them know, that by my direction the ship had been
seized, that she lay now in the road, and they might see by and '
by, that their new captain had received the reward of his villany;
for that they might see him hanging at the yard arm.

That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say,
why I should not execute them as pirates taken in the fact, as by
my commission they could not doubt I had authority to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had
nothing to say but this, That when they were taken, the mptain
promised them their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy:
but I told them I knew not what mercy to shew them; for, as
formyself, I had resolved to quit the island with all my men,
and had taken passage with the captain to go for England: and
as for the captain, he could not carry them to England, other
than as prisoners in irons to be tried for mutiny, and running
away with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs
know, would be the gallows: so that I could not tell which m
best for them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the
island: if they desired that, I did not care, as I had liberty to
leave it; I had some inclination to give them their lives, if they
thought they could shift on shore. They seemed very thankful
for it; said they would much rather venture to stay there, than
to bearriedto Euglandto be hanged: so I left itonthat issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some dificulty of it,
asifhe durst not leave them there: upon thisI scemedtobe a
little angry with the captain, and told him, that they .were my
prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had offered them so much
favour, I would be as good as my word; and that ifhe did not
think'fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty as I found
them; and if he did not like that, he might take them again, if
he could eetch them.

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set
them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods, to the place
whence they came, and I would leave them some fire-arms, some
- ammunition, and some directions how they should live very well,
if they thought fit.

Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship; but told the
mptain, that I would stay that night to prepare my things; and
desired him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all right
in the ship, and send the boat on shore the next day for me;
ordering him, in the meantime, to muse the new aptain, who
was killed, to be hanged at the yard arm, that these men might
see him.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to
my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them of
their circumstances. I told them, I thought they had made a
right choice; that if the captain earried them away, they. would
certainly be hanged. I showed them the new captain .hanging
at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had nothing less
to expect.

When theyhad all declaredtheirwillingnesscostay,l then
told them I would let them into the story of my living there,
andputtheminco thewayofmaking it easy!>> them: accord-
ingly I gave them the whole history of the place, and ofuny

n
coming to it; shewed them my fortifiestions, the way I made
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and, in a word,
all thatwas necessary to make them easy. I told them the story
also of the sixteen Spaniard: that Were to be expected; for whom
I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them in common
with themselves.

I left them my fire-arms; viz. five musquets, three fowling--
pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half of
powder left; for after the first year or two I used but little, and
wasted none. I gave them a description of the way I managed
the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, to make both
butter and cheese.

In a word, I gave them every part of my own story; and I
told them, I would prevail with the captain to leave them two
barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden-seeds, which I told
them I would have been very glad of; also I gave them the bag
of peas which the uptain had brought me to eat, and bade them
be sure to sow and increase them.

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went on
board the ship; we prepared immediately to sail, but did not
weigh that night. The next moming wly, two of the five men
came swimming to the ship's side, and making a most lamentable
complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship,
'for 6013's sake, for they should be murdered; and begged the
captain to take them on board, though he hanged them imme-
diately.

Upon .this the esptain pretended to have no power without
me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of
amendment, they were taken on board, and were some time after
soundly whipped and pickled ; after which they proved very-
honest and quiet fellows.

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board for reliques
the great goat's-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and my par-
rot; also I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned,
which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty, or
tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver, till it had been a little
rubbed and handled; as also the money I found in the wreck of
the Spank}: ship.

And thus I left the island the nineteenth of Drama", as I
found by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had been
upon it eight and twenty years, two months, and nineteen days;
being delivered from this second eaptivity the same day of the
month that I first made my escape in the Barre-huge, from
among the Moor: of Seller.

In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England, the
eleventh of 7am, in the year 1687, having been thirty and five
years absent.

When I me to England, I wasasperfecta strangertoallthe
world, as if I had never been known there: my benefactor, and
faithful steward, who I had left in trust with nay-money, was
alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world, was become a
widow the second time, and very low in the world. I made her
easy as to what she owed me, assuring her, I would give her no
trouble; but on the contrary, in gratitude to her former care and
faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock--would afford,
which at that time would indeed allow me to do but little for
her: but I assured her, I would never forget her former kindness
to me; nordid I forget her, when I had suflicienteohelp her;
as be observed in its place.

went down afterwards into Torhhire; but my father was
dead, and my mother, and all'the family extinCt; 6!!th that 1
found two sisters, and two of the children of one of my brothers:
and as I had been long ago given over for dead, there had been
no provision made for me, so that, in a word, I found nothing
to relieve or assist me; and that little money I had, would not
do much for me as to settling in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect; andthiswas, thatthe masteroftheship,wholhadso
happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship and
cargo, having given a very handsome account to the owners of
the manner how I had saved the lives of the men, and the ship,
they invited me to meet them, and some other merchants con-
cerned, and all together made me a very handsome compliment
upon the subject, and a present of almost two hundred pounds
sterling.

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances" of
my life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in
the world, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not
come by some information of the state of my plantation in the
Brasils, and of what was become of my partner, who, I had
reason to suppose, had some years now given me over for dead.

With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in
April following; my man Friday accompanying me. very honestly
in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon
all occasions.

When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my
particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship,
who first took me up at sea, of of the shore of Africa : he was
now grown old, and had left off the sea, having put his son, who
was far from a young man, into his ship; andwho still usedthe
Brasil trade. The old man did not know me, and indeed, I
hardly knew him; but I soon brought him to my remembrance,
and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told him

who I was.
After some passionate expresu'ons of the old acquaintance, I
inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation, and my partner.
The old man told me, he had not been in the Brasilr for about
nine years; but that he could assure me, that when he came
away my partner was living; but the trustees, whom I hadjoined
with him, to take cognizance of my part, were both dead; that,
however, he believed that I would have a very good account of
the improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the general
beliefof my being east away and drowned, my trustees had given
in the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the
procurator fiseal; who had appropriated it, in case I never came
to claim it, one third to the King, and two-thirds to the monas-
tery of St. Augum'ne, to be expended for the benefit of the poor,
and for the conversion of the India>>: to the Catholic faith; but
that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance,
it should be restored; only that the improvement, or annual pro-
duction, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be restored;
but he assured me that the steward of the king's revenue (ti-om
lands) and the provedore, or steward of the monastery, had taken
great care, all along, that the incumbent, that is to say, my'
partner, gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of
which they received duly my moiety.

I asked him, if he knew to what height of improvement he
had brought the plantation: and whether he thought it might
be worth looking after; or whether, on my going thither, I
should meet with no obstruction to my pmeasing my just right
in the moiety.

He told me, he could not tell metly to whatdegree the plan-
tation was improved: but this he knew, that my paraler was
grown exmding rich upon the enjoying but one half of it! and
that, to the but of his remembrance, he had heard that the king's
third ofmy pargwhichwaait seems, granted away to some
other monastery, or religious house, amounwd to above two
hundred moidores a year; that, as to my being restored to a
quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that,
my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name being
also inrolled in the register of the country. Also he told me,
that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest
people, and very wealthy, and he believed I would not only have
their assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a
very considerable sum of money in their hands for my account,
being the produce of the farm, while their fathers held the trust,
and before it was given up as above, which, as he remembered,
was for about twelve years.

I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account,
and inquired of the old eaptain, how it came to pass, that the
trustees should thus dispose my effects, when he knew that I
had made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese eaptain,
my universal heir, 63:.

He told me, that was true; but that, as there was no proof
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some cer-
tain account should come of my death; and that, besides, he
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it
was true, he had registered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead or alive, he
would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the
ingenio (so they call the sugar-house) and had given his son, who
was now at the Brasilr, order to do it.

But, (says the old man) I have one piece of news to tell you,
which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest; and
that is, that believing you were lost, and all the world believing
so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account to me in
your name, for six or eight of the first years of profits, which I
received; but there being at that time, says he, great disburse-
ments, for increasing the works, building an ingmio, and buying
slaves, it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it pro-
timed: however,saystheoldman,lahallgiveyduau-ue
aceountofwhatlhavereeeivedinall, andhowlhavedisposed
of it.

After a few days further conference with this ancient friend,

he brought me an account of the six first years' income of my
plantation, signed by my partner, and the merchant's trustees,
being always delivered in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molames, (it. which is the consequence
of a sugar-work; and I found by this account, that every year
the income considerably incrmd: but, as above, the disburse-
ment beinglarge, the sum at firstwas small: however,theold
man let me see, that he was debtor to me 470 moidones of gold,
besides 60 chests of sugar, and 15 double rolls of tobacco, which
were lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked coming home
to 1.in072, about eleven years after my leaving the place.
. The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and
howhe had been obliged tomakeuseofmy moneytoreeover
his losses, and buy him a share in a new ship ;----However, my
old friend, says he, you shall not want a supply in your ne-
cessity; andassoon as my sonretums, you shall befully
satisfied.

Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me 160 Par-
tngal moidores in gold, and giving me the writing of his title
to the ship which his son was gone to the Brail: in, of which
he was a quarter part owner, and his son another, he put them
both in my hands for security ofthe rest.

I was one much moved with. the honesty and kindness of the
poor man to be able tobearthis; andrememberingwhat hebad
doneforme, how he hadtaken me up at sea, and howgme

ingat whathesaidtome. Therefore,first I askedhim ifhis
circumstancesadmimdhimtosparesomuchmoneyatthat
time, and if it would not straiten him? He told me he could
not say but it might straiten him a little: but, however, it was
my money, and I might want it more than he.

Every thing the good man saidwas full of affection, and I
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke. In short, Imok
one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to
give him a receipt for them; then I returned him the rest, and
told him, if ever I had possession of the plantation, I would
return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards did: and
that, as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would
not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the money,I
found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but
eame to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never
have a penny more from him.

When this was passed, the old man began to ask me if he
should put me in a method to make my claim to my plantation.
I told him, I thought to go over to it myself. He said, I might
do so if I pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways enough
to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits
to my use; and as there were ships in the river of Lishn, just
ready to go away to Brasil, he made me enter my name in a
public register, with his affidavit, aflirming upon oath that I was
alive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for
the planting the said plantation at first.

This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration
affixed, he directed me to send it with a letter of his writing, to a
merchant of his acquaintance at the place; and then proposed my
staying with him till an account eame of the return.

Never any thing was more honourable than the proceedings
upon this procuration; for in less than seven months I received
a large packet from the survivors of my trustees, the merchant:
for whose account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed.
First, There was the account current of the produce'of my
farm, or plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced.
with my old Portugal captain, being for six years; the balance
appeared to be 1174. moidom in my favour.~_-

Small , There was the account of four' years more while they
kept the efi'ects in their hands, before the government claimed
the administration,asbeingtheefi'ectsofapersonnottobe
found, which they call Cim'l Brat}: ,deg and the balance of this, the
value of the plantation increasing, amounted to -- cruisadoes,
which made 3241 moidores.

fluidly, There was the prior of the Augustine: account, who
had received the profits for above fourteen years; but not being
to account for what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly
declared he had 872 moidores not distributed, which he acknow-
ledged to my account. As to the king's part, that refunded
nothing.

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very
afl'ectionately upon my being alive; giving me an account how
the estate was improved, and what it produced a year, with a
particular of the number of squares, or acres, that it contained;
how planted, how many slaved there were upon it; and, making
twoand twentycrossesfor blessings, toldme hehad midso
many Av: Aldrin: to thank the bland Virgin that I was alive,
inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession
of my own, and in the mean time to give him orders to whom
he should deliver my effects, if I did not come myself; con-
cluding withaheuty tenderofhisfi'iendshipfindthatofhis
Family; and sent mm a present, seven fine leopards'-skins,
which he had, it seems, received fiom'dfi-ica'bysome other ship
which hehadsentdrither, andwho,itseems, hadmadeabetter
voyage than I. vHe sent me alsofive chests of elmelleot sweet-
meats, and a hundredpiecee ofgold uncoined, not quitesolarge
asmoidores. '

N 2
By the same fleet my two merchant-trustees shipped me 1200
chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole
account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of :70} was
better than the beginning. It is impossible to express here the
flutterings of my very heart, when I looked over these letters,
and especially when I found all my wealth about me; for as the
Bran? ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my
letters brought my goods; and the efi'ects were safe in the river
before the letter came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale,
and grew sick; and had not the old man run and fetched me a
cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of Joy had overset nature,
and I had died upon the spot.

Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours,
till a physician being sent for, and something of the real muse of
my illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood, after
which I had relief, and grew well; but I verily believe, if it had
not been eased by a. vent given in that manner to the spirits, I
should have died.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above PS5000 sterling in
money, and had an estate, as I might well all it, in the Bruils,
of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands
in England ; and in a word, I was in a condition which I sauce
knew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the
enjoyment of it.

The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor,
my good old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my
distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the
end. I shewed him all thatwas sent me; I told him that,next
to the providence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it was
owing to him ; and that it now lay on me to reward him, which
Iwould doahundredfold. Solfirstretm-nedtohimthe
hundred moidores I had received ofhim; then I sent for a no-
wy,andeausedhim eodraw upageneral release or discharge
for the 4.70 moidores which he had acknowledged he owed me,
in the fullest and firmest manner possible; after which I mused
a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver:
of the annual profits of my plantation, and appointed my partner
toacoounttohim,and make the returns bythe usual fleetsto
him in myname; andaclauseinthe end, beingagrant ofroo
moidores a year to him during his life, out of the effects; and
fiftymoidoresayearmhissonaftethim, forhislife. And
thus I requited my old man.

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put
into my hands; arid, indeed, I had more are upon my head
now than I had in my silent state of life in the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing butwhatI
wanted; whereas I had now a great chargeupm me, andmy
business was how tosecure it. Ihad neveracavetohidemy
money in, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till
it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body would meddle
with it. On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or who to
trust with it; my old paaon, the esptain, indeed, was honest,
andthatwastheonlyrefirgelhad.

In the next place, my interest in the Brad}: seemed to sum-
mon me thither; but now I could not tell how to think of going
thithertill Ihadsettled myafl'airs, and leftmyefi'ectsinsome
safe hands behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the
widow, who, I knew, was honest, and would bejust to me; but
then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew,
might beindebt; sothat, in aword,Ihadnowaybut to go
back to England myself, and take my effects with me. .

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this;
andthereforesslhadrewardedtheoldaptain fully,sndm
satisfaction, whohadheen myformer benefactor,>> Ibeganeo
think of my poor widow, whose husband had been my first bene-
factor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful steward
and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got a merchant in
Lisbon to write to his correspondent in Dado>>, not only to pay
a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in money a hundred
pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her
poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a fiirther
supply. At the same time I sent my two sisters in the country,
each of them a hundred pounds, they being, though not in want,
yet not in very good circumstances; one having been married,
and left a widow; and the other havinga husband not so kind
to her as he should be.

But among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet
pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock,
that I might go away to the 3783175, and leave things safe behind
me; and this greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasilr, and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to the
place; but I had some little scruple in my mind about religion,
which insensibly drew me back, of which I shall say more pre-
sently. However, it was not religion that kept me from going
there for the present; and as I had made no scruple of being
openly of the religion of the country, all the while I was among
them, so neither did I yet; only that now and then, having of
late thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think of
living and dying among them, I began to regret my having pro-
fessed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best
religion to die with.

But, as I have said,thiswas not the main thing that keptme
from going to the Brasilr, but that really I did not know with
whom toleavemyefi'octs behindme; so Iresolvedatlasttogo
to England with it, where if I arrived, I concluded I should make
some acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be faithful
to me; and accordingly I prepared to go for England with all
my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the
Brail fleet being just going away) resolved to give answers
suitable to the just and faithful account of things I had from
thence; and first to the prior of St. Augustine, I wrote a letter
full of thanks for their just dealings, and the offer of the 872
moidores, which was undisposed of; which I desired might be
given, 500 to the monastery, and 372 to the poor, as the prior
should direct, desiring the good Padre': prayers for me, and the
like.

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all
the acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for;
as for sending them any present, they were far above having any
occasion for it.

Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in
the improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the
stock of the works, giving him instructions for his future go-
vernment of my part, according to the powers I had left with
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became
due to me, till he should hear from me more particularly: assur-
ing him that it~was my intention, not only to come to him, but
to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. To this I
added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife
and two daughters, for such the eaptain's son informed me he had ;
with two pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I could get
in Lirlon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a
good value.

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my argo, and turned all
my efi'ects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was,
which way to go to England. I had been accustomed enough
tothesea,and yeti hadasu-angeaversiontogotoEngladhy
sea atthattime; andthoughI could give nore'aSOnforit,yet
the difficulty increased upon me so much, that though I had
once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind,
and that not once, but two or three times.

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might
be some of the reasons. But let no man slight the strong im-
pulses of his ovm thoughts in eases of such moment. Two of
the ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean more pu-
ticularly singled out than any other, that is to say, so as in one
of them to put my things on board, and in the other to have
agreed with the captain; I say, two of these ships miscarried,
'viz. one was taken by the Algerine, and the other was cast away
on the Start, near Today, and all the people drowned, except
three; so that in either of those vessels I had been made miser-
able, and in which most, it was hard to say.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to
whom I communicated every thing, pressed me earnestly not to
go by sea; but either to go by land to the Groyne, and cros
over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an
easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and
Dover; or to go up to Mid, and so all the way by land
through France.

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at
all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel all
the way by land; which, as I was not in haste, and did not
value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way ;And--t04nake
it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the
son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me;
after which, we picked up two more English merchants also,
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris
only; so thatwe were in all six ofus,and five servants, the two
merchants, and the twa Portuguese, consenting themselves with
one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me, I
got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my
man Friday, Who was taco much a stranger to be capable of sup-
plyingtheplaceofaservanton the road. '

In this manner I set out from Lisbon: and our company
being very all well mounted and armed, we made a little troop,
whereof did they me the honour to eall me eapmin, as well
because I was the oldest man, as beeause I had tw0 servants, and
indwd was the original of the whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so shall
I trouble you with none of my land journal. But some adven-
tures that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey, I
must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain,
and to see what was worth observing; but it being the latter
part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out from Aladrid
about the middle of Omhr. But when we earne to the edge
of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns on the way, with
an account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of
the mountains, that several traVellers were obliged to come bet
to Pampelmm, after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to
pass on.

When we came to Pampeluaa itself, we found it so indeed;
and to me that had been always used to a hot climate, and in-
deed to countries where we could searce bear any clothes on, the
eold--was--insufi'erable; nor indeed was it more painful than it
was surprising, to come but ten days before out of the Old
Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but very hot,
and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrmean mountains, so
very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger
benumbing and perishing ofour fingers and toes.

Poor Friday was really fiighted when he saw the mountains
all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never
seen or felt before in his life.
To 'mend the matter, after we me to Pmpeluna, it con-.
tinued snowing with so much violence, and so long, that the
people said, winter was come before its time; and the roads,
which were dificult before, were now quite impassable: in a
word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel;
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries,
there was no going without being in danger of being buried alive
every step. We staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluua;
when (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its
being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that
had been known in the memory of man) I proposed that we
should all go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for
Bourdeaux, which was a very little voyage.

But while we were considering this, there mine in four French
gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French side of the
passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who
traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had brought
them over the mountains by such ways, that they were not much
incommoded with the snow; and where they met with snow in
any quantity, they said it Was frozen hard enough to bear them
and their horses.

We sent for this guide, who told us, he would undertake to
carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, provided
we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts;
for he said, upon these great snows, it was frequent for some
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being
made ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with
snow. We told him we were well enough prepared for such
creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two-
legged wolves, which we were told we were in most danger from,
especially on the French side of the mountains.

He satisfied us therewas nodangerofthat kindintheway
that we were togo: sowe readilyagreedtofollow him: asdid
also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some French,
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and. were
obliged to come back again.

Accordingly we all set out fi'om Pampeltma, with our guide,
on the fifteenth of November, and indwd, I was surprised, when,
instead ofgoing forward, he eame directly back with us, on the
same road that we came from Mdrid, above twenty miles;
when having passed two rivers, and come into the plain country,
we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country
waspleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden, turning
to his left, he approached the mountains another way; and
though it is true, the hills and the precipices looked dreadful,
yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such
winding ways, we insensibly passed the height of the mountains,
without being much incumbered with the snow; and all on a
sudden he shewed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc
and Gamigm, all green and flourishing; though indwd it was
at a great distance, and we had some rough way to pass yet.

We were'a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed
one whole day and a night, so fast, that we could not travel;
but he bid us be easy, we should soon be post it all. We found,
indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to come more
north than before ; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on.

It was about two hours before night, when our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous waives, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way,
adjoining to a thick Wood: two of the wolves flew upon the
guide, and hadhe been halfa mile before us, he had been de-
voured indeed, beforewe could have helped him : one of them
fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with that
violence that he had not time, or not presence of mind enough,
to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily.
My manFn'dajbeingnext tome,I bid him ride up, andsee
what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the
man, he hallooed, as loud as the other, 0 mater! 0 matter!
But, like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and
with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him into the head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ;
for he, having been used to that kind of creature in his country,
had no fear upon him, but went close up to him, and shot him
as above; whereas any of us would have fired at a farther dis-
tance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered
shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a holder man than I, and
indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of
Friday': pistol, we heard on both sides the dismallest howling of
wolves, and the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of
them; and perhaps indeed there was not such a few, as that we
had no cause of apprehensions.

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other, that had
fastened upon the horse, left him immediately, and fled, having
happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle
had stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt:
the man, indeed, was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit
him twice, once on the arm, and the other time a little above
his knee; and he was just as it were tumbling down by the
disorder of the horse, when Friday came up, and shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday': pistols we
all mended our pace, and rid up as fast as the way (which was
very difficult) would give us leave, to see what was the matter:
as soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before,
we saw plainly what had been the case, and how Friday had
disengaged the poor guide; though we did not pmently discern
what kind of creature it was he had killed.

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a sur-
prising manner, as that which followed between Friday and the
bear, which gave us all (though at first we were surprised and
afraid for him) the greatest diversion imaginable , as the bear 18
a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does,
who' IS swift and light; so he has two particular qualities, which
generally are the rule of his actions; first as to men, who are
not his proper prey, I say not his proper prey, bemuse though I
mot say what excessive hunger might do, which was now their
ease, the ground being all covered with snow; yet as to men,
he does not usually attempt them, unless they first attack him;
on the contrary, if you meet him in the woods, if you do not
meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; yet then you
must takeeare tobeverycivil tohim, andgive himtheroad;
for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step out of the
way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is
to look another way, and keep going on; for sometimes, if you
stop, and stand still, and look stedfastly at him, he takes it for
an affront; and ifyou throw or toes any thing at him, and it
hits him, though it were but a bit'of stick as big as your finger,
he takes it for an affront, and sets all other business aside to
pursue his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in point of
honour, and this is his first quality; the next is, that if he be
once afl'ronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he has
his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes
you.

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we eame
up to him, he was helping him of from his horse; for the man
was both hurt and frighted, and indeed the last more than the
first; when, on the sudden we spied the bear come out of the
wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that
ever I saw: wewere all a littlesurprisedwhenwesawhim; but

pointing to him, 0 master! you give me te leave, me shake: te
hand with him, one make you good laugh.

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased, 1" ou fool you, says
I, he will eat you up. Eatee me up! eatee m up! says Friday,
twice over again; Me eatee him up; one make you good laugh ,-
you all stay here, me shew you good laugh: so down he sits,
and gets his boots of in a moment, and put on a pair of pumps
(as we call the flat shoes they wear) and which he had in '_his
pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and, with his gun,
away he flew, swift like the wind.

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with
nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him: Hark ye, hark ye, says Friday, we
:peakee wit you. We followed at a distance; for now being
come dOWn on the Garcoigne side of the mountains, we were
entered a vast great forest, where the country was plain, and
pretty open, though many trees in it scattered here and there.

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up
with him quickly, and takes up a great stone, and throws at him,
and it hit him just on the head; but did him no more harm than '
if he had thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday': end; 1
for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did it purely to make
the bar follow him, and shew us some laugh, as he alled it.

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he turns
about, and comes after him, taking devilish long strides, and
shufliing along at a. strange rate, so as would put a horse to a
middling gallop: away runs Friday, and takes his course, as if
he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once
upon the bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him
heartily for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going
about his own business another way; and especially I was angry
that hehadturned the bear upon us, and thenrun away; and I
called out, You dog, said I, i: this your making us laugh! Cm
may, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature. He
hears me, and cries out, No shoot, no shoot, stand :till, you get
much laugh: and as the nimble creature ran two foot for the
bast's one, he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing
a great oak tree, fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow,
and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun
down upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom
of the tree.

I The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance;
the first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let
it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat,
though so monstrously heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I
thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see any thing
tolaughatyet, till seeing the beer get up the tree, weallrode
nearer to him.

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out no the
small end of a large limb ofthe tree, and the bear got about
halfwaytohim; assoonasthebwgotouttothatpartwhere
the limb of the tree was weaker, Ha, says he to us, now you see
me teachee the hear dance; so he falls a jumping, and shaking the
bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and
begantolook behindhirn,toseehowheshouldgetback; then
indeed we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with
him byagmtdeel: whenhe sees him stand still, he calls out
to him again, as if he had supposed the beer could speak English,
What, you tome no further 5' Pray you come further. So he left
jumping andshaking the trees; and the bear, just as ifhe un--
derstood what he said, did come a little further; then he fell:a
jumping again, and the'bear stopped again.

We thought nowwasagoodtimeto knockhimonthe head,
andlealledefidaymsmnd still, andwewouldshootthe
bear; but he eried out earnestly,'0pray! Opray! no :hoot, we
shoot hy audthen; he would havesaid budhye. However-no
shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so
ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still could not
imagine what the fellow would do ; for first we thought he de-
pended upon shaking the but off; and we found the but was
too cunning for that too; for he would not go out far enough
to be thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad claws and

feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it,
and where the jest would be at last.

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing the bear
cling fast to the bough, and that he could not be persuaded to
come any farther, Well, well, says Friday, you no come farther,
me go, one go; you no come to me, me go come to you; and upon
this he goes out to the smallest end of the bough, where it would
bend with his weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sliding
down the bough till he came near enough tojump down on his
feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up, and stands still.

Well, said I to him, Friday, what will you do now? Why
don't you shoot him: No shoot, says Friday, no yet ,- me shoot
now me no hill ,- me .rtay give you one more laugh ,- and indeed so
he did, as you will see presently; for when the bear see his
enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where he stood, but
did it mighty leisurely, looking behind him every step, and
coming backward till he got into the body of the tree; then with
the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping
it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely;
at this juncture, and just before he could set his hind feet upon 1
the ground, Friday stepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece into his ear, and shot him as dead as a stone.

Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did not laugh; and
when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls a laughing
himself very loud; So we kill hear in my country, says Friday.
50 you kill them, said I; why you have no guns. No, says he,
no gun, but :hoot great much long arrow.
Thiswas,indeed,egooddiversiontom,butwewerestillin
a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we
hardlyknew; thehowling ofwolvesrun much in my head; and
indeed except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of
which I have said something already, I never heard any thing
that filled me with so much horror.

These things, and the approach of night, called us 09', or else,
as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the
skin of this monstrous creature of, which was worth saving; but
we had three leagues toga, and our guide hastencdus; sowe
left him, and went forward on our journey.

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep
and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures,
as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain
country, preesed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a
great deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised the
country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses,
and some people too.

We had one dangerous place to pass, which our guide told us,
if there were any more wolves in the country, we should find
themthere; andthiswasinasmallplain, surroundedwithwoods
on every side, and along narrow defile or lane, which we were
to pass to get through the wood, and then we should come to

thevillagewhereweweretolodge.
It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the first

wood; and a little after sunsetwhen weeame into the plain.
Wemetwith nothinginthefirstwood, exceptthatinalittle

sight in a few moments.
Uponthisour guidewho, by the way,was awretched faint-312 Lira awn onsn'runzs

hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed
there were more wolves a coming.

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we saw
no more wolves till we came through that wood, which was near
half a lague, and entered the plain; as soon as we eame into
the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us. The first
object we met with was a dead horse, that is to say, a poor horse
which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at
work: we could not say eating of him, but picking of his bones
rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before.

We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither
did they take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at
them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found we
were like to have more business upon our hands than we were
aware of. We were not gone half over the plain, but we began
to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left, in a frightful
manner; and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on
directly towards us, all in a body, and most. of them in a line, as
regularly as an army drawn up by experienced ofiicers. I searce
knew in what manner to receive them; but found to draw our--
selves in a close line, was the only way; so we formed in a
moment; but, that we might not have too much interval, I
ordered, that only every other man should fire; and that the
others who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a
second volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon
us; and that then those who had fired at first, should not pretend
to load their fusils again, but stand ready, with every one a pis-
tol, for we were all armed with a fusil, and a pair ofpistols each
man; so we were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half
of us at a time; however, at present, we had no necessity; for,
upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being
terrified, as well with the noise as with the fire; four of them
being shot into the head, dropped ; several others were wounded,
and went bleeding of, as we could see by the snow: I found
they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon re-
memberingthatlhadbeentold, thatthe fiercestcreatures were
terrifiedatthevoiceofa man, I caused all ourcompanytohalloo
as loud as we could, and I found the notion not altogether mis-
taken; for upon our shout, they began to retire, and turn about;
then I ordered a second valley to be fired in their mt, which
put them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods.

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and that we
might lwe no time, we kept going; but we had but little more
than loaded our fusils, and put ourselves into a readiness, when
we heard a terrible noise in the same wood, on our left; only
that it was further onward the same way we were to go.

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky,
which made it the worse on our side; but the noise increasing,
we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of
those hellish creatures; and, on a sudden, we perceived two or
three troops of wolves on our left, one behind us, and one on
our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them; how-
ever, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as
fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being very
rough,was onlyagood large trot; and in this manner we came
in view ofthe entrance ofawoodthroughwhichweweretopass,
at the farther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised,
when, coming nearer the lane, or pass, we saw a confused num-
ber of wolves standing just at the entrance.

On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the
noise of a gun; and, looking that way, out rushed a horse, with
a saddle and bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or
seventeenwolvesafte'rhimfirll speed; indeedthehorschadthe
heels of them; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at
thatrate,wedoubtednotbut theywouldgetupwithhimat
last; and no question but they did.

0
But here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the caresse of an-
other horse, and of two men devoured by the ravenous creatures,
and one of the men was no doubt the same who we heard fired
the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the
man, his head, and the upper part of his body, was eaten up.

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to
take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about
us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were
three hundred of them. It happened very much to our advan-
tage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way from it,
there lay some large timber trees, which had been cut down the
summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage; Idrew my
little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line
behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping
that tree before us, for a breast-work, to stand in a triangle, or
three fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre.

We did so, and it was well we did: for never was a more
furious charge than the creatures made upon us in the place;
they came on us with a growling kind of noise, and mounted
the piece of timber (which, as I said, was our breast-work) as
if they were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of
theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our
horses behind us, which was the prey they aimed at: I ordered
our men to fire, as before, every other man; and they took their
aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the wolves at the
first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual
firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on
those before.

When we had fired our second volley of our fusils we thought
they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but
it was but a moment, for others came forward again: so we fired
two volleys of our pistols; and I believe in these four firings,
we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as
many; yet they came on again.

Iwaslothto spendour last slmttoohastily, solealledmy
servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed; for,
with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusil
and his own while we were engaged; but, as I said, I called my
otherman; and giving himahorn ofpowder, I badehimlaya
train all along the piece oftimber, and let it bea large train; he
did so, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves me
up to it, and some were got up upon it; when I, snapping an
uncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; thwe that
were upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of
them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force and
fright of the fire; we dispatched these in an instant, and the rest
were so frighted with the light, which the night, for now it was
very near dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a little.

Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one
volley, and after that we gave a shout; upon this the wolves
turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame
ones, who we found struggling on the ground, and fell a cutting
them with our swords, which answered our expectation; for the
crying and howling they made were better understood by their
fellows; so that they lied and left us.

We had, first and last, killed about threesome of them; and
had it been day-light, we had killed my more. The field of
battle being thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had
still near aleaguetogo; we hardtheravenouscratureshowl
andyellinthewoodsaswewent,seveialtimes; andsometimes
we fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling our
eyes,wewerenotcertain; so in about an hour more we came
to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible
frightgandallinarms; for,it seems,that,thenightbefixe,the
wolvesand some barshad broke inmthevillageinthenight,
and put them in a terrible fright; and they were obliged to keep
guard night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their
cattle, and indeed their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs so swelled
with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no further;
so we were obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Thou-
louse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant coun-
try, and no snow, no wolves, or any thing like them; but when
we told our story at Thoulouse, they told us it wn nothing but
what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the moun-
tains, especially when the snow lay on the ground; but they in--
quired much what kind of a guide we had gotten, that would
venture to bring us that way in such a severe season; and told
us, it was a great chance we were not all devoured. When we
told them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in the middle,
they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but
we had been all destroyed; for it was the sight of the horses
which made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey; and that at
other times they are really afraid of a gun; but the being exces-
sive hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come
at the homes had made them senseless of danger; and that if we
had not by the continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the
train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that
we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content to
have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would
not have taken the horses so much for their own, when men
were on their backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that
at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our horses, they would
have been so eager to have devoured them, that we might have
come ofi" safe, especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and
being so many in number.

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life; for
seeing above three hundred devils come mating and open-mouthed
todevour us, and having nothing to shelterus,or retreatto,I
gavemyselfover for lost; andas itwas,I believe,l shall never"
caretoa'o'ssthosemountainsagain; Ithinklwouldmuch
rather go a thousand leagues by sea, thoughI were sure to meet
with a storm once a week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France; nothing but what other travellers have given
an account of, with much more advantage than I can. I travelled
fi'om Winslow: to Paris, and without any considerable stay, came.
to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the fourteenth of 741mm,
afterhavmghadaseverecoldsasontotravel in

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little
time all my new discovered estate safe about me, the bills of
exchange, which I brought with me, having been very currently
paid.

My principal guide and privy counsellor, was my good an-
cient widow, who, m gratitude for the moneyl had sent her,
thought no pains too much, or are too great, to employ for me;
andItrusted hersoentirelywitheverything,thatlwasperfectly
easyastothesecurityofmyefi'ects;andindeedlwasvery
happy from my beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotmd
integrity of this good gentlewoman.

Andnowlbegantothinkofl'eaving my efi'ects with this
woman, and setting out for Lids>>, and so to the Brasils: but
now another scruple came in the way, and that was religion; for
as I had entertained some doubts about the Raina): religion, even
while I was abroad, especiallyin mystateofsolitude; sol knew
there was no going to the Brawl: for me, much less going to
settle there, unlessI resolved to embrace the Roam: Catholic
religion, without any reserve; unless on the other hand I re-
solved to be asaerifice to my principles, beamartyrforreligion,
and die in the Inquisition: so I resolved to may at home, and if
I could find means for It, to dispose of my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, who in

return gave me. notice, that he could easily dispose of it there:
but that ifI thought fit to give him have to offer it in my name
to the two merchants, the survivors of my trustees who lived in
the Brasilr, who must fully understand the value of it, who lived
just upon the spot, and who I knew were very rich, so that he
believed they would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt, but
I should make 4. or 5000 pieces of eight the more of it.
V Accordingly I agrwd, gave him order to offer it to them, and
he did so; and in about eight months more, the ship being then
returned, he sent me account, that they had accepted the offer,
and had remitted 33,000 pieces of eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.

In return I signed the insh'ument of sale in the form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me
bills of exchange for 32,800 pieces of eight for the estate; re--
serving the payment of 100 moidores a year, to him (the old
man) during his life, and 50 moidores afterwards to his son
for his life, which I had promised them; which the plantation
was to make good as a rent-charge. And thus Ihave given the
first part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of Providence's
chequer--work, and of a variety which the world will seldom be
able to shew the like of: beginning foolishly, but closing much
more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as
to hope for.

Any one would think, that in this state of complimmd good
fortune, I was past running any more hazards, and so indeed I
had been, if other circumstances had concurred: but I was
inured to a wandering life, had no family, not many relations;
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance; and
though I had sold my estate in the Brailr, yet I could not keep
the country out of my head, and had a great mind to be on the
wing again; especially I could not resist the strong inclination
Ihadto see myisland, andmknowifthepoorSpaaiardrwere
inbeingthere; andhowtherogueallefttherehadusedthem.

My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded me from it, and
so far prevailed with me, that almost for seven years she pre.
vented my running abroad; during which time I took my two
nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into my care: the
eldest having something of his own, I bred up as a gentleman,
and gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate, after
my decease; the other I put out to a captain of a ship; and after
five years, finding him a sensible, hold, enterprising young fel-
low, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea: and this
young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther
adventures myself.

Intherneantime,I in part settled myselfhere: for, firstof
all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dis-
satisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one'daughter:
but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home with good
success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and
his importunitygprevailed, and engaged me to go in his ship
as a private trader to the East Indies. This was in the year
16 4..

Inthisvoyagel visitedmy neweolonyintheisland,saw my
successors the Spaniards, had the whole story of their lives, and
ofthe villains I leftthere; howat firsttheyinsulted thepoor
Spaniards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, sepa-

with them; how they were subjected to the sfixkrdr; how

into, as full ofvariety and wonderful accidents as myown part;
particularly also as to their battles with the Caribbean, who landed

made upon the island itself; and how five of them made an
attempt upon the main land, and brought away eleven men and320 LIFE AND Anvax'ruaas or Roamsox Causoa.

five women prisoners; by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young children on the island.

Here I stayed about twenty days; left them supplies of all
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes,
tools, and two workmen, which I brought from England with me;
viz. a carpenter and a smith.

Besides this, I shared the island into partswiththern,reserved
to myself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts,
respectively, as they agreed on; and having settled all things
with them, and engaged them not to leave the place, I left them
there.

From thence I touched at the Brasilr, from whence I sent a
bark, which I bought there, with more people, to the island; and
in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being web as I
found proper for service, or for wives to such as would take
them. As to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them
some women from England, with a good cargo of necessaries, if
they would apply themselves to planting; which I afterwards
paformed: and the fellows proved very honest and diligent,
aftertheywero mastered, and had their properties setapartfor
them. I sent them also from the Brasik, five cows, three of
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which,
when I came again, were considerably increased.

But all these things, with an account how 300 Curitiba: eame
and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they
fought with that whole number twice, and were at first defeated
and threeofthem killed; butat last astorm desu'oyingtheir
enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed all the rest, and re-
newed and recovered the possession of their plantation, and still
lived upon the island.

All these things, with some very surprising incidents in some
new adventures of my own, for ten years' more, I may, perhaps,
give a farther account of hereafter.

' HAT homely proverb used on so many occa-

' sions in England, viz. That what i: bred in
' the bone will not go out of the flesh, was never
; ' more verified than in the story of my LIFE.
3'" Any one would think that after thirty-five
' years' afliiction, and a variety of unhappy cir-
cumstances, which few men, if any, ever went through before,
and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness
of all things; grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed '
me to have had experience of every state of middle life, and to
know which was most adapted to make a man completely happy;
I say, after all this, any one would have thought that the native
propensity to rambling, which I gave an account of in my first
setting out into the world to have been so predominant in my
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be fully evacu-
ated, or at least condensed, andI might at sixty-one years of age
have been a little inclined to stay at home, and have done ven--
turing life and fortune any more.

Nay farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was
taken away in me; for I had no fortune to make, I had nothing
to seek: if I had gained ten thousand pound, I had been no
richer; for I had already suflicient for me, and for those I had
to leave it to; and that I had was visibly increasing; for having
no great family, I could not spend the income of what I had,
unless I would set up for an expensive way of living, such as a
great family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were
things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so that I had no-
thing indeed to do but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got,
and see it increase daily upon my hands.

Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at least not
enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again,
which hung about me like a chronical distemper; particularly the
desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, and the colony
I left there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it all
night, and my imagination run upon it all day; it was upper-
most in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep ; in short, no-
thing could remove it out of my mind; it even broke so vio-
lently into all my discourses, that it made my conversation tire-
some; for I could talk of nothing else, all my discourse run into
it, even to impertinence, and I saw it myself.

I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that all the
stir people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is
owing to the strength of imagination, and the powerful opera-
tion of fancy in their minds; that there is no such thing as a
spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like; that people's
poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased
friends so realises it to them, that they are capable of fancying
upon some extraordinary circumstances that they see them, talk
to them, and are answered by them, when in truth, there is no-
thing but shadow and vapour in the thing; and they really know
nothing of the matter.

For my part, I know not to this hour, whether there are any
such things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people
aftertheyaredead,orwhetherthere is anything inthestoriee-
they tell us of that kind, more than the product of vapours, sick
minds, and wandering fancies. But this Iknow, that my ima-
gination worked up to such a height, and brought me into such
ecsmsiea of vapours, or what else I may all it, that I actually
supposed myself oftentims upon the spot, at my old eastle be-
hind the trees, saw my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the
reprobate sailors whom I left upon the island; nay, I fancied I
talked with them, and looked at them so steadily, though I was
broadawake,asatpersonsjnst beforeme; and thisIdidtillI
often frightened myself with the images my fancy represented to
me: one time in my sleep I hadthe villany ofthethreepirate
sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and Friday:

father, that it was surprising; they told me how they barbarously
attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they set fire to

the provisions theyhad laid up, on purpose to distress and starve
them, things that I had never heard of, and that indwd were
neverall ofthem true in fact: butit wassowarm inmyimagi~
nation, and so realised to me, that to the hour I saw them, I
could not be persuaded but that it was or would be true; also
how I resenmd it when the Spaniard complained to me, and how
I brought them to justice, tried them before me, and ordered
them all threeto be hanged: what therewasreallyinthis, shall
be seen in its place; for however I eame to form such things in
my dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet
there was very much of it true. I say, I own, that this dream
had nothing literally and specifieally true; hut the general part
was so true, the base and villanous behaviour of these three
hardened rogueswas such, and had been somuch worsethanall
I eandescribe,that the dream hadtoo muchsimilitude ofthe
fact; and as I would afterwards have punished them severely,
so ifI hadhanged them all, I had been much in the'right, and
should have beenjustifiable both by the laws of Goo and man.
Buttoreturntomystory. Inthiskind oftemperlhad
lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant
hours, no agreeable diversion but what had something or other
of this in it, so that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent
upon it, told me very seriously one night, that she believed there
was some secret powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which
had determined me to go thither again; and that she found no-
thing hindered my going but my being engaged to a wife and
children. She told me, that it was true she could not think of
parting with me; but as she was assured, that if she was dad it
would be the first thing I would do; so, as it seemed to her
that the thing was determined above, she would not be the only
obstruction: for if I thought fit, and resolved to go,---here she
found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very
earnestly at her ; so that it a little disordered her, and she
stopped. I asked her why she did not go on, and say out what
she was going to say? But I perceived her heart was too full,
and some tears stood in her eyes. Speak out, my dear, said I,
are you willing I should go ? No, say: she, wry afl'euionateb',
I am far from willing; but if you are resolved to go, says she,
and rather than I will be the only hinderance, I will go with you;
for though I think it a preposterous thing for one of your years,
and in your condition, yet if it must be, said she again, weeping,
I won't leave you ; for if it be of Heaven, you must do it; there
is no resisting it; and if Heaven makes it your duty to go, he
will also make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of
me, that I may not_obstruct it.

This affectionate behaviour of my _wife's brought me a little
out of the vapours, and I began to consider what I was doing;
I corrected my wandering fancy, and began to argue with myself
sedately, what business I had, after threascore years, and after
such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so
happy and easy a manner, I say, what business I had to rush into
new hazards, and put myself upon adventures, fit only for youth
and poverty to run into?
With those thoughts, I considered my new engagement; that
I had a wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child
of another; that I had all the world could give me, and had no
needto seekhazardsfor gain: thathas decliningin years,and
ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained than of seek-
ing to increase it; that as to what my wife had said, ofits being
an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go,
I had no notion of that; so after many of these cogitations, I
struggled with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself
out of it, a: I believe people may always do in like cares, if the]
will ; and, in a word, I conquered it; composed myself with
such arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my pre-
sent condition furnished me plentifully with: and particularly,
as the most effectual method, I resolved to divert myself with
other things, and to engage in some business that might elfectu--
ally tie me up from any more excursions of this kind; for I
found the thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, had
nothing to do, or any thing of moment immediately before me.

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the county of Bed-

fard, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little con-
venient house upon it, and the land about it I found was eapable
of great improvement, and that it was manyways suited to my
inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting,
and improving of land; and particularly, being an inland coun-
try, I was removed from conversing among ships, sailors, and
things relating to the remote part ofthe world.

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family, bought
me ploughs, barrows, a cart, waggon, horses, cows, sheep; and
setting seriously to ,work, became in one half year, a mere coun-
try gentleman; my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing
my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting, (it.
and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life that nature was
eapable of directing, or that a man always bred to misfortunes
was eapable of being retreated to.
I farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to pay, was limited
by no articles, I could pull up or cut down as I pleased: what I
planted was for myself, and what I improved, was for my family;
and having thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not the
least discomfort in any part of my life, as to this world. Now
I thought indeed, that I enjoyed the middle state of life that my
father so early recommended to me, a kind of heavenly life,
something like what is described by the poet upon the subject of
a country life.

Free from vices, flee from care,
Age 114: no pain, andyoutlz no mare.

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unfore-
seen Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made a
breach upon me, inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its
consequence, into a deep relapse into the wandering disposition;
which, as I may say, being born in my very blood, soon reco-
vered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent distem-
per, came on with an irresistible force upon me; so that nothing
could make any more impression upon me. This blow was the
loss of my wife.

It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my wife, to
give a character of her particular virtues, and make my court to
the sex by the flattery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few
words, the stay of all my affilirs, the centre of all my enterprises,
the engine that by her prudence reduced me to that happy oom-
pass I was in, from the most extravagant and ruinous project that
fluttered in my head as above; and did more to guide my ram-
bling genius, than a mother's tears, a father's instructions, a
friend's counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could do. I
was happy in listening to her tears, and in being moved by her
enueaties, and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the
world by the loss of her.

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me,
Iwasasmuch asuangerinit,inmythoughts, as Iwasinthe
Brad]: when I went first on shore there; and as much alone,
exocptastotheasfistnnceofservantsfislwasinmyisland. I
knew neither what to do, or what not to do. I saw the world
busy round me, one part labouring for bread, and the other part
squander-mg in vile exceeaea or empty pleasures, equally misera-
ble, bwause the end they proposed still fled fiom them ; for the
man of pleasure every day surfeited of his vice, and heaped up
work for sorrow and repentance; and the men of labour spent
their strength in daily strugglings for bread to maintain the vital
strength they laboured with; so living in a daily circulation of
sorrow, living but to work, and working but to live, as if daily
bread were the only end of wearisome life, and a wearisome life
the only oeeasion of daily bread.

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the
island; where I sufi'ered no more corn to grow, bemuse I did
not want it; and bred no more goats, because I had no more
use for them: where the money lay in the drawer till it grew
mouldy, and had searce the favour to be looked upon in twenty
years.

All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have
done, and as reason and religion had dictated to me, would have
taught me to search farther than human enjoyments for a full
felicity, and that there was something which certainly was the
reason and end of life, superior to all these things, and which was
either to be possessed, or at least hoped for, on this side the grave.

But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship without
a pilot, that could only run before the wind; my thoughts run
all away again into .the old afi'air, my head quite was turned with
the whimsiea of foreign adventures; and all the pleasant inno-
cent amusements of my farm and my garden, my cattle, and my
family, which before entirely possast me, were nothing to me,
had no relish,andwerelike music toone thathasnoear,or food
toonethathasnotaste. Inaword, I resolvedtoleaveofi'
house-keeping, let my farm, and return to Landau : and in a few
months after I did so.

When I eameto London, Iwas still as uneasyaslwasbefore;
I had no relish to the place, no employment in it, nothing to do
but to saunter about like an idle person, of whom it may be said,
he is perfectly useless in 600's creation, and it is not one farthing
matter to the rest of his kind, whether he be dead or alive. This
also was the life which of all circumstances of life was the most
my aversion, who had been all my days used to an active life;
and I would often say to myself A state cf idleness i: the 'ver}
drag: of life; and indeed I thought I was much more suitably
employed, when I was twenty six days 2. making me a deal
board.

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew,
who, as I have observed before, I had brought up to the sea,
and had made him commander of a ship, was come home from
a short voyage to Bilbaa, being the first he had made; he came
to me, and told me, that some merchants of his acquaintance had
been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the Ear!
Indie: and to China as private traders; and now, uncle, says he,
if you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you upon
your old habitation in the island, for we are to touch at the
Brasilr.

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and
of the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of
second causes with the ideas of things which we form in our
minds, perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any in the
world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wander-
ing was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had
in his thoughts to say, when that very morning before he came
to me I had, in'a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolv--
ing every part of my circumstances in my mind, come to this
resolution, 'viz. That I would go to Lisbon, and consult with my
old sea captain ; and so, if it was rational and practicable, I would
go and see the island again, and see what was become of my
people there. I had pleased myself with the thoughts of peo-
pling the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a
patent for the possession, and I know not what; when in the
middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have said, with his
project of earrying me thither, in his way to the Ear: Indies.

I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily at him,
What devil, said I, rent you of this 10:11:17 errand? My nephew
stared, as if he hadbeen frighmd at first; but perceiving I was
not much displeased with the proposal, he recovered himself.
I hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, Sir, says he; I dare
say you would be pleased to see your new colony there, where
you once reigned with more felicity than most of your brother
monarchs in the world.

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that
is to say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have
said so much, that I told him, in few words, if he agreed with
the merchants, I would go with him: but I told him, I would
not promise to go any further than my own island. Why, Sir,
says he, you don't want to be left there again, I hope? Why,
said I, enn you not take me up again on your return? He told
me it could not be possible that the merchants would allow him

to come that way with a loaden ship of such value, it being a
month's sail out of his way, and might be three or four. Be-
sides, Sir, if I should misearry, said he, and not return at all,
then you would be just reduwd to the condition you were in
before.

This was very rational ; but we both found out a remedy for
it, which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which,
being taken in pieces and shipped on board the ship, might, by
the help of some earpenters, whom we agreed to entry with us,
beset upagaininrheisland; andfinished,iittogotosea,ina
few days. .
I was not long resolving; for indeed the importunin'es of my
nephew joined in so elfectually with my inclination, that nothing
could oppose me: on the other hand, my wife being dead, I had
nobody concerned themsde so much for me, as to persuade
me one way or other, except my ancient good friend the widow,
who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years, my easy
circumstances, and the needless hazard of a long voyage; and,
above all, my young children : but it was all to no purpose; I
had an irresistible desire to the voyage; and I told her I thought
there was something so uncommon in the impressions I had upon
my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting
Providence, if I should attempt to stay at home; after which
she ceased her expostulations, and joined with me, not only in
making provision for my voyage, but also in settlingmy family
affairs in my absence, and providing for the education of my
children.

In order to this, I made my will, and settled the estate I had
in such a manner for my children, and placed in such hands, that
I was perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done
them, whatever might befal me; and for their education, I left
it wholly to my widow, with a sufiicient maintenance to herself
for her care: all which she richly deserved; for no mother could
have taken more care in their edueation, or understand it better;
and as she lived till I me home, I also lived to thank her for
It.

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of fianuary
1694--5, and I with my man Friday went on board in the Down:
the 8th, having besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a
very considerable eargo of all kinds of necessary things for my
colony, which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved to
leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I put-posed to
place there, as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon
my own account, while I stayed, and either to leave them there,
or carry them forward, as they should appear willing; particu-
larly I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy ingeni-
ous fellow who was a cooper by trade, but was also a general
mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels, and hand-
mills to grind corn, was a good turner, and a good pot-maker;
he also made any thing that was proper to make of earth, or of
wood; in a word, we ealled him our ffack (fall trades.

With these I carried a tailor, who had ofl'ered himself to go
passenger to the East Indie: with my nephew, but afterwards
consented to stay on our new plantation, and proved a most ne-
cessary handy fellow as could be desired, in many other busi-
nesses besides that of this trade; for, as I observed formerly,
necessity arms us for all employments.

My cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not kept an
account of the particulars, consisted of a suflicient quantity of
linen, and some thin English stuffs for clothing the Spaniards,
that I expected to find there, and enough of them as by my eal-
culation might comfortably supply them for seven years; if I
remember right, the materials which I carried for clothing them,
with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they
could want for wearing, amounted to above 200 pounds, including
some beds, bedding, and household-stufl', particularly kitchen
utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, 8c. and near a hundred
pound more in iron-work, nails, tools of every kind, staples,
hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could think of.

I earried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees, be-
sides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes,
and'two pieces of brass eannon; and beeause I knew not what
time, and what extremities I was providing for, I earried a hun-
dred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron
partofsomepikesandhalberm; so,that,inshort,wehada

336 LIFE AND onzn'runss

carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his
ship, to leave behind, if there was occasion; that when they
came there, we might build a fort, and man it against all sorts
of enemies: and indeed, I at first thought there would be need
enough of it all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain our
possession of the island, as shall be seen in the course of the
StO .

{Y had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to
meet with; and therefore shall have the less occasion to inter-
rupt the reader, who perhaps may be impatient to hear how
matters went with my colony; yet some odd accidents, cross
winds, and bad weather happened, on this first setting out, which
made the voyage longer than I expected it at first; and I, who
had never made but one voyage, (viz) my firrt voyage to Guinea,
in which I might be said to come back again, as the voyage was
at first designed, began to think the same ill fate still attended
me; and that I was born to be never contented with being on
shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at sea.

Contrary winds first put up to the northward, and we were
obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound
two-and-twenty days; but we had this satisfaction with the dis-
aster, that provisions were here exceeding chap, and in the
utmost plenty; so that while we lay here we never touched the
ship's stores, but rather added to them ; here also I took in seve--
ral live hogs, and two cows, and calves, which I resolved, if I
had a good passage, to put on shore in my island; but we found
occasion to dispose otherwise of them.

We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very
fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be
about the 20th of Feeruaty in the evening late, when the mate
having the watch, came into the round--house, and told us he saw

a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he was telling
us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain heard another.
This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where for a while
we heard nothing, but in a few minutes we saw a very great light,
and found that there was some very terrible fire at a distame;
immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all
agreed that there could be no land that way, in which the fire
shewed itself, no not for 500 leagues, for it appeared at W. N. W.
Upon this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea;
and as by our hearing the noise of guns just before, we con-
cluded it could not be far ofi', we stood directly towards it, and
were presently satisfied we should discover it, because the farther
we sailed, the greater the light appeared, though the weather
being hazy we could not perceive any thing but the light for a
while; in about half an hour's sailing, the wind being fair for
us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little,
we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the
middle of the sea.

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at
all acquainted with the persons engaged in it; I presently recol-
lected my former circumstances, in what condition I was in when
taken up by the Portugal eapmin; and how much more deplo-
rable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to this
ship must be if they had no other ship in company with them:
upon this I immediately ordered, that five guns should be fired,
one soon after another, that, if possible, we might give notice to
them that there was help for them at hand, and that they might
endeavour to save themselves in their boat; for though we oould
see the flame of the ship, yet they, it being night, could see no-
thing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning
ship drove, waiting for day-light; when on a sudden, to our
great terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up
in the air, and immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all
the firewas out, and the rest ofthe ship sunk; thiswas aterri-

ble, and indeed an afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men,
who, I concluded, must be either all destroyed in the ship, or be
in the utmost distress in their boat in the middle of the ocean,
which at present, by reason it was dark, I could not see : how-
ever, to direct them as well as I could, I caused lights to be
hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could, and which
we had lanthorns for; and kept firing guns all the night long;
letting them know by this, that there was a ship not far of.
About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered the ship's
boats, by the help of our perspective glasses; found there Were
two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in the water;
we perceived they rowed, the wind being against them; that
they saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see them.
We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we saw
them; and hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come on
board; and then made more sail, standing directly to them. In
a little more than half an hour, we came up with them, and, in
a word, took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men, wo-'
men, and children; for there were a great many passengers.
Upon the whole we found it was a French merchant-ship of
300 ton, homeward-bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada.
The master gave us a long account of the distress of his ship,
how the fire began in the steerage by the negligence of the steers-
man; but, on his crying out for help, was, as every body thought,
entirely put out: when they found that some sparks of the first
fire had gotten into some part of the ship, so difficult to come
at, that they could not effectually quench it; till getting in be-
tween the timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded
into the hold, and mastered all the skill and all the application
they were able to exert.
They had no more to do then but to get into their boats,
which, to their great comfort, were pretty large; being their
long boat, and a great shallop, besides a small skill, which was
of no great service to them, other than to get some fresh water
and provisions into her, after they had secured their lives from
the fire. They had indeed small hope of their lives by getting
into these boats at that distance from any land; only, as they
said well, that they were escaped from the fire, and had a possi-
bility, that some ship might happen to be at sea, and might take
them in. They had sails, oars, and a compass; and were pre--
paring to make the best of their way back to Newfoundland, the
wind blowing pretty fair; for it blew an easy gale at S. E. by E.
They had as much provisions and water, as, with sparing it so
as to be next door to starving, might support them about twelve
days; in which, if they had no bad weather, and no contrary
winds, the eaptain said, he hoped he might get the banks of NM
foundland, and might perhaps take some fish to sustain them till
they might go on shore. But there were so many chances
against them in all these cases; such as storms to overset and
founder them; rains and cold to benumb and perish their limbs;
contrary winds to keep them out and starve them; that it must
have been next to miraculous if they had eseaped.

In the midst of their consultations, every one being hopeless,
and ready to despair, the captain with tears in his eyes told me,
they were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun
fire, and after that four more; these were the five guns which I
eauwd to be fired at first seeing the light: this revived their
hearts, and gave them the notice, which, a: about, I desired it
should, viz. that there was a ship at hand for their help.

It was upon the hearing these guns, that they took down their
masts and sails; the sdund coming from the windward, they re--
solved to lie by till morning. Some fime after this, hearing no
more guns, they fired three musquets, one a considerable while
after another; but thwe, the wind being contrary, we never
heard.

Some time afici- that again, they were still more agreeably sur-
prised with seeing our lights, and hearing the guns, which, as I
have said, I caused to be fired all the rest of the night: this set
them to work with their oars to keep their boats a-head, at least
that we might the sooner come up with them; and at last, to
their inexpressible joy, they found we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the
strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these poor de-
livered people run into, to express the joy of their souls at so
unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described;
sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and
hands, make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of joy, a
surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances-in it; there were
some in tears, some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had
been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving and
downright lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with their
feet, others wringing their hands; some were dancing, some
singing, some laughing, more crying; many quite dumb, not
able to speak a word; others sick and vomiting, several swoon-
ing, and ready to faint; and a few were crossing themselves and
giving Goo thanks.

I would not wrong them neither; there might be many that
were thankful afterward; but the passion was too strong for
them at first; and they were not able to master it; they were
thrown into ecstasies and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a very
few that were composed and serious in their joy.

Perhaps the case may have some addition to it, from the par-
ticular circumstance of that nation they belonged to; I mean the
French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, more pas-
sionate, and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than in
other nations. I am not philosopher enough to determine the
cause, but nothing I had ever seen before came up to it: the
emtasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found
his father in the boat, came the nearest to it; and the surprise of
the master, and his two companions, whom I delivered fibm the
villains that set them on shore in the island, came a little way
towards it; but nothing was to compare to this, either that I saw
in Friday, or any where else in my life.

It is further observable, that thwe extavagances did not shew
themselves in that different manner I have mentioned, in different
persons only: but all the variety would appear in a short suc-
cession of moments, in one and the same person. A man that
we saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and con-
founded, should the next minute be dancing and hallooing like
an antic; and the next moment be tearing his hair, or pulling-
his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet like a
madman; a few moments after that, we should have him all in
tears, then sick, then swooning; and had not immediate help
been had, would in a few moments more have been dead; and
thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the
greatest part of them; and, if I remember right, our surgeon
was obliged to let above thirty of them blood.

There were two priests among them, one an old man, and the
other a young man; and that which was strangest was, that the
oldest man was the worst.

As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw himself
safe, he dropped down stone-dend, to all appearance; not the
least sign of life could be perceived in him; our surgeon imme--
diately applied proper remedies to recover him; and was the only
man in the ship that believed hewasnot dead: and atlengthhe
opened a vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the
part, so as to warm it as much as pomible: upon this the blood,
which only dropped at first, flowed something freely; in three
minutes after, the man opened his eyes; and about a quarter of
an 'hour after that, he spoke, grew better, and quite 'well; after
' the blood was stopped, he walked about, told us he was perfectly
well, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him,'and-
was what we call come to himself; about a quarter of an hour
after, they came running into the eabin to the surgeon, who was
bleeding a French woman that had filmed; and told him, the
priest was gone stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve
the change of his circumstance, and again this put him into an
ecstasy of joy; his spirits whirled about faster than the vessels
could convey them; the blood grew hot and feverish; and the
man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in it;
the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition, but
gave him something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after
some time, operated upon him, and he waited the next morning
perfectly composed and well.

The younger priest behaved with great command of his pas-
sions, and was really an example of a serious well-governed mind;
at his first coming on board the ship, he threw himself flat on
his face, prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance;
in which I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him, really
thinking he had been in a swoon ; but he spake calmly ; thanked
me; told me he was giving GOD thanks for his deliverance;
begged me to leave him a few moments, and that, next to his
Maker, he would give me thanks also.

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him; and not only left
him, but kept others from interrupting him also; he continued
in that posture about three minutes, or a little more, after I left
him; then came to me, as he had said he would, and, with a
great deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes,
thanked me, that had, under GOD, given him, and so many
miserable creatures their lives. I told him, I had no room to
move him to thank Goo for it, rather than me; but I added,
that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all
men, and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to
Gov, who had blessed us so far as to make us the instruments

of his mercy to so many of his creatures.
After this the young priest applied himself to his country
folks; laboured to compose them; persuaded, enu-eated, argued,
reasoned with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the
exercise of their reason; and with some he had success, though
others were, for a time, out of all government of themselves.

I eannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may
be useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for the guiding
themselves in all the extravagances of their passions; for if an
excess of joy ean carry men out to such a length beyond the
reach of their reason, what will not the extravagances of anger,
rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to? And indeed, here I
saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of
every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of sor-
row and anger.

We were something disordered by these extravagances among
our new guests for the first day ; but when they had been retired,
lodgings provided for them as well as our ship would allow, and
they had slept heartily, as most of them did, they were quite
another sort of people the next day.

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the
kindness shewn them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are
naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The eaptain, and one
of the priests, came to me the next day; and desiring to speak
with me and my nephew, the commander, began to consult with
us what should be done with them; and first they told us, that,
as we had saved their lives, so all we had was little enough for a
return to us for that kindness received. The eapbain said, they
had saved some money and some things of value in their boats,
catched hastily up .out of the flames; and if we would accept it,
they were ordered to make an offer ofit all to us; they only'
desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if pos-
sible, they might get passage to Frame.

. My nephew was for accepting their money at first word, and
to consider what to do with them afterwards; but I over-ruled
him inthatpart; forlknewwhatitwasto besetonshoreina
strange country; and if the Portugal captain that took me up at
sea had served me so, and took' all I had for my deliverance, I
must have starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brasib,
as I had been in Barbary, the being sold to a Mailman: ex-
cepted; and'perhaps a Portuguere is not much a better masher
than a. Turk, if not, in some cases, a much worse. '

I therefore told the French captain, that we had taken them
up in their distress, it was true; but that it was our duty to do '
so, as we were fellow-creatures, and as we would desire to be so
delivered, if we were in the like or any other extremity; that we
had done nothing for them, but what we believed they would
have done for us if we had been in their case, and they in our's ;
but that we took them up to save them, not to plunder them;
and it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little from
them which they had saved out of the fire, and then set them on
shore and leave them; that this would be first to save them fi'om
death, and then kill them ourselves; save them from drowning,
and then abandon them to starving; and therefore I would not
let the least thing be taken from them. As to setting them on
shore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding difficulty to us,
for that the ship was bound to the East Indies; and though we
were driven out of our course to the westward a very great way,
and perhaps was directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliver-
ance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage
on this particular account; nor could my nephew, the mptain,
answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under charter;
party to pursue his voyage by the way of Bran'l: ,- and all I knew
he could do for them was, to put ourselves in the way of meet~
ing with other ships homeward-- bound from the Wen Indies, and
get them passage, if possible, to England or France.

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they
could not but be very thankful for it: but they were invery
great consternation, especially the passengers, at the notion of
being eanied away to the East Indie: : and they then entreated
me,thatseeinglwasdrivensofirtothewestwardbeforelmet
with them, I would at least keep on the same course to the banks
of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might meet with some
ship or sloop that they might hire to wry them back to Canada,
from whence they earne.
I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part , and
' therefore I inclined to agree to it: for indwd I considered, that
to carry this whole company to the East Indies, would not only
be an intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be
ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen
accident made absolutely necessary to us; and in which no one
could say we were to blame; for the laws of G00 and nature
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats
full of people in such a disfiessed condition; and the nature of
the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged
us to set them on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance;
' so I consented that we would earry them to Newfoundland, if
wind and weather would permit; and if not, that I would earry
them to Adartinico in the West Indies.

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty
good; and as the winds had continued in' the points between
N. E. and S. E. a long time, we missed several opportunities of
sending them to France; for we met several ships bound to
Europe, whereof two were Frenrh, from St. Christopher':; but
theyhadbeensolongbeating upagainstthewind, that they
durst take in no passengers for fear of wanting provisions for the
voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should take in;
sowewere obliged to go on. It wasaboutaweek after this,
that we made the banks of Newfoundland, where, to shorten my

P 2
story, we put all our French people on board a bark, which they
hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to tarry
them to France, if they could get provision to victual thenwelves
with: when, I say, all the French went on shore, I should re-
member, that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were
bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and
to be set on shore on the coast of Coromndel, which I readily
agreed to: for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good
reason, as will appear afterwards ; also four of the seamen entered
themselves in our ship, and proved very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steer-
ing away 3. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, some-
times little or no wind at all, when we met with another subject
for our humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that
before.

It was in the latitude of twenty--seven degrees five minutes N.
and the 19th day of March 1694-5>> when we spied a sail, our
course S. E. and by S. We soon perceived it was a large vessel,
and that she bore up to us; but could not at first know what to
make of her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found she had
lost her main-top-mast, fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently
she fired a gun as a signal of distress; the weather was pretty
good, wind at N. N. W. a fresh gale, and we soon came to
speak with her.

We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from Barbuda",
but had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes, a few days
before she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the
captain and chief mate were both gone on shore; so that beside
the terror of the storm, they were but in an indifferent ease for
good artists to bring the ship home : they had been already nine
Weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible storm after the
hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of their
knowledge to the westward, and in which they lost their masts
asabove; they told us, they expected to have seen the Bahama
islands, but were then driven away again to the south--east by a'
strong gale of wind at N. N. W. the same that blew now, and
having no sails to work the ship with, but a main course, and a
kind of square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had set up,
they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand
away for the Canaries.

But that which was worst of all, was, that they were almost
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had
undergone: their bread and flesh was quite gone, they had not
an ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven days , the
only relief they had, was, their water was not all spent, and they
had about half a. barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough;
some suceadec or sweet-meats they had at first, but they were
devoured; and they had seven asks of rum.

There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant, on
board, who were going pmgers, and thinking the ship was
ready to sail, unhappily came on board the evening before the
hurricane began; and, having no provisions of their own left,
they were in a more deplorable condition than the rest; for the
seamen being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves,
had no compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers;
and they were indwd in a condition that their misery is very
hard to describe.

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not
led me, the weather being fair, and the wind abawd, to go'on
board the ship: the second mate, who upon this occasion com--
manded the ship, had been on board our ship; and he told me
indeed, they had three passengers in the great cabin, that they
were in a deplorable condition: nay, says he, I believe they are
dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two days; and

was afraid to inquire after them, said he, for I had nothing to
relieve them with. . . _ .
' We immediately applied ourselves to give thern'what re1ief
we could spare; and indeed I had so far over-ruled things with
my nephew, that I would have victualled them, though we had
gone away to Virginia, or any part of the coast of America, to
have supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for that.

But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of
eating too much, even of that little we gave them: the mate or
commander brought six men with him in his boat; but these
poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak, they
could hardly sit to their oars: the mate himself was very ill, and
half-starved; for he declared he had reserved nothing from the
men, and went share and share alike with them in every bit
they eat.

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him im-
mediately, and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began
to be sick, and out of order; so he stopt awhile, and our surgeon
mixed him up something with some broth, which he said would
be to him both food and physio; and after he had taken it, he
grew better; in the mean time I forgot not the men; Iordered
victuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather devoured
than eat it; they were so exceeding hungry, that they were in a
kind ravenous, and had no command of themselves; and two of
them eat with so much greediness, that they were in danger of
their lives the next morning.

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me,
and brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of, at my
first coming on shore in my island, where I had not the least
mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any; besides the
hourly apprehension I had of being made the food of other
creatures. But all the while the mate was thus relating to me
the miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not put
out of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor
creatures in the great eabin; (viz) the mother, her son, and the
maid servant, 'who he had heard nothing of for two or three days;
and who he seemed to confess they had wholly neglecwd, their
own extremities being so great; by which I understood, that
they had really given them no food at all; and that therefore
they must be perished, and be all lying dead perhaps on the floor
or deck of the cabin.

As I therefore kept the mate, who we then called captain, on
board with his men to refresh them, so I also forgot net the
starving crew that were left on board, but ordered my own boat .
to go on board the ship, and with my mate and twelve men to
carry them a sack ofbread, and four or five piecesofbeefto
boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be
boiled while they stayed, and to keep gnard' m the cook-room to
prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot
before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very
little at a time; and by this caution he preserved the men, who
would otherwise have killed themselves with that. very food that
was given them on purpose to save their lives.

At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the great
cabin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in, and,
if they were alive, to comfort them and give them what refiesh--
ment was proper; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher
with some of the prepared broth which he had given the mate
that was on board, and which he did not question would restore
them gradually.

I was not satisfied with this; but as I said above, having a
great mind to see the scene of misery which I knewtheship
itself would present me with, in a more lively manner than I
could have it by report, I took the eapt'ain of the ship, as we
now called him, with me, and went myself a little after in their
boat

Ifoundthepoormenonboardalmostinatumulttogetthe
victuals out of the boiler before it was ready. but my mate
observed his order, and kept a good guard at the cook-room-
door; and the man he placed there, after using all possible per-
suasion to have patience, kept them ofi' by force; however, be
caused some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened
with the liquor of the meat, which they all brewis, and gave
them every one one, to say their stomachs, and told them it was
for their own safety, that he was obliged to give them but a little
at a time. But it was all in vain, and had I not come on board,
and their own commander and officers with me, and with good
words, and some threats also of giving them no more, I believe
they would have broke into the cook-room by force, and tore
the meat out of the furnace; for words are indeed of very small '
force to a hungry belly: however we pacified them, and fed
them gradually and cautiously for the first time, and the next
time gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and the
men did well enough.

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of
another nature, and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the ship's
company had so little for themselves, it was but too true, that
they had at first kept them very low, and at last totally neg-
lected them; so that for six or seven days, it might be said,
they had really had no food at all, and for several days before
very little.

The poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman
of good sense, and good breeding, had spared all she could get
so afi'ectionately for her son, that at last she entirely sunk under
it: and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the
floor or deck, with her back up against the sides, between two
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk in between her

shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dad. My mate said
all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon put
some broth into her mouth: she opened her lips, and lifted up
one hand, but could not speak: yet she understood what he said,or 11031wa Causot. 351

and made signs to him, intimating, that it was too late for her,
but pointed to her child, as if she would have said, they should
take we of him.

However the mate, who was exceedingly moved with the
sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth into her mouth;
and, as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down, though I ques-
tion whether he could be sure of it or not: but it was too late,
and she died the same night.-

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most afl'ec-
n'onate mother's life, was not so far gone; yet he lay in a eabin-
bed as one stretched out, with hardly any life left in him; he
had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the
rest of it; however, being young, and having more snength than
his mother, the mate got something down his throat, and he
began sensibly to revive, though, by giving him some time after
but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and
brought it up again.

But the next care was the poor maid: she lay all along upon
the deck hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen
down with an apoplexy, and struggled for life: her limbs were
distorted, one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair,
and she griped it so hard that we could not easily make her let
go; her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both together,
set fast against the frame of the cabin-table: in short, she lay just
like one in the last agonies of death, and yet she was alive too.

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and
terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us
afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, who she saw
dying two or three days before, and who she loved most ten-
derly.

We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our
surgeon, who was a man of very great knowledge and expe-
rience, and with great application recovered her as to life, he3 52 Lu-'z AND onsN-ruazs

had her upon his hand as to her senses, for she was little less
than distracted for a considerable time after; as Shall appear
presently.

Whoever shall read these memorandum, must be desired to
consider, that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country,
where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place.
Our business was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not
to lie by for them; and though they were willing to steer the
same course with us for some days, yet we could earry no sail to
keep pace with a ship that had no masts: however, as their cap--
tain begged of us to help him to set up a main top-mast, and a
kind of a top-mast to his jury fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie
by him for three or four days; and then having given him five
barrels of beef, a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a
proportion of peas, flour, and what other things we could spare;
and taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of
eight of them for satisfaction, we left them, taking on board
with us, at their own earnest request, the priest, the youth, and
the maid, and all their goods.

The young lad was about seventeen years of age; a pretty,
well-bred, modest, and sensible youth: greatly dejected with the
loss of his mother, and, as it seems, had lost his father but a few
months before at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon to
speak to me, to take him out of the ship; for he said, the cruel
fellows had murdered his mother; and indeed so they had, that
is to say, passively; for they might have spared a small suste-
nance to the poor helpless widow, that might have preserved her
life, though it had been but just to keep her alive. But hunger
kHOWS no friend, no relation, no justice, no right; and therefore
is remorseless, and capable of no compassion.

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and how it
would any him away from all his friends, and put him perhaps
in as bad circumstances, almost as those wefound him in; that
is to say, starving in the world. He said he matt'ered not whi-
ther he went, if he was but delivered from the terrible crew he
was among: that the captain (by which he meant me, for he
could know nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he
was sure would not hurt him; and as for the maid, he was sure,
if she wne to herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us
any them where we would. The surgeon represented the ease
so affectionately to me, that I yielded, and we took them both
on board with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar,
which could not be removed, or come at; and as the youth had
a bill of lading for them, I made his commander sign a writing,
obliging him to go, as soon as he earne to Bristol, to one Mr.
Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was rec
lated, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the
goods he had belonging to the dmed widow: which Isup-
pose was not done, for I could never learn that the ship eame to
Bristnl; but was, as is most probable, lost at sea, being in so
disabled a condition, and so far from any land, that I am of
opinion, the first storm she met with afterwards, she might
founder in the sea; for she was leaky, and had damage in her
hold when we met with her.

I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and had hitherto
had a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at first the winds
had been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little inci-
dents of wind, weather, currents, 8:. on the rest of our voyage ;'
but, shortening my story for the sake of what is to follow, shall
oburve, that I came to my old habitation, the island, on the
10th of April, 1695. It was with no small difliculty that. I
found the place; for 'as I came to it, and went from it before,-
on the south and east side of the island, as coming from'the
Bruilr, so now coming in between the main and the island, and-
having no chart for the coast, nor any landmark, I did not know
it when I saw it, or know whether I saw it or no. -
We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several
islands in the mouth of the great river Oroonoque, but none for
my purpose; only this I learned by my coasting the shore, that
I was under one great mistake before, viz. that the continent
which I thought I saw from the island I lived in, was really no
continent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands reaching
from one to the other side of the extended mouth of that great
river; and that the savages who came to my island, were not
properly those which we call Caribbeex, but islanders, and other
barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited something nearer to
our side than the rest.

In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose;
some I found Were inhabited, and some were not. On one of
them I found some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there;
but speaking with them, found they had a sloop lay in a small
creek hard by, and they came hither to make salt, and catch
some pearl--muscles, if they could ; but they belonged to the Isle
de Trinidad, which lay further north, in the latitude of to and
u degrees.

But at last coasting from one island to another, sometimes
with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop (which
we had found a convenient boat, and therefore kept her with
their very good will), at length I came fair on the south-side of
my island, and I presently knew the very countenance of the
place; so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside with
the little creek where was my old habitation.

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked
him if he knew where he was? He looked about a little, and
presently clapping his hands, cried, 0 yes, 0 Mare, 0 yes, 0
there! pointing to our old habitation, and fell a dancing and
capering like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him
from jumping into the sea, to swim on shore to the place.

Well, Friday, says I, do you think we shall find any body
here, or no? and what do you think, shall we see your father?
The fellow stood mute as a stock a good while; but when I
named his father, the poor affectionate creature looked dejected;
and I could see the tears run down his face very plentifully.
What is the matter, Friday, said I? are you troubled because
you may see your father? No, no, say: he, shaking his head, no
see him more, no ever more see again. Why :a, said I, Friday .?
Izow do you brow Ilia! .? 0 no, 0 no, says Friday, he long ago
die; long ago, he much old man. Well, well, say: I, Friday,
you don't know ; but shall we see any one else then? The fel-
low, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points just to the
hill above my old house; and though we lay half a league of,
he cries out, We see! we see! yes, we see much man there, and
there, and there. I looked, but I could see nobody, no, not
with a perspective glass; which was, I suppose, because I could
not hit the place; for the fellow was right, as I found upon
inquiry the next day, and there were five or six men altogether
stood to look at the ship, not knowing what to think of us.

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I caused the
English ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them
notice we were friends; and about half a quarter of an hour
after, we perceived a smoke rise from the side of the creek; so
I immediately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me; and,
hanging out a white flag, or flag of truce, I went directly on
shore, taking with me the young friar I mentioned, to whom I
had told the whole story of my living there, and the manner of it,
and every particular, both of myself, and those I left there; and
who was on that account extremely desirous to go with me. We
had besides about sixteen men very well armed, if we had found
any new guest there which we did not know of : but we had no
need of weapons.

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water,
we rowed directly into the creek; and the first man I fixed my
eye upon, was the Spaniard, whose life I had saved, and who I
knew by his face perfectly well; as to his habit, I shall describe
it afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at first but
myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the boat: for the
affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance, a good
way off of the Spaniard:, where indeed I saw nothing of him;
and if they had not let him go on shore, he would have jumped
into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew away to
his father like an arrow out of a bow. It would have made any
man have shed tears, in spite of the firmeSt resolution, to have
seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy, when he came
to his father; how be embraced him, kissed him, stroked his
face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and
lay down by him; then stood and looked at him as any one
would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour together;
then lie down upon the ground, and stroke his legs and kiss
them, and then get up again, and stare at him; one would have
thought the fellow bewitched; but it would have made a dog
laugh to see how the next day his passion run out another way:
in the morning he walked along the shore, to-and-again, with his
father, several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if he
had been a lady; and every now-and-then he would come to
fetch something or other for him from the boat, either a lump of
sugar or a dram, a biscuit cake, or something or other that was
good. In the afternoon his frolics ran another way; for then he
would set the old man down upon the ground, and dance about
him, and make a thousand antic postures and gestures; and all
the while he did this, he would be talking to him, and telling
him one story or another of his travels, and of what had hap-
pened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if the same filial
affection was to be found in Christians to their parents, in our
parts of the world, one would be tempted to say, there would
hardly have been any need of the fifth commandment.

But this is a digression; I return to my landing. It would
be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that
the Spaniard: received me with. The first Spaniard, who, as I
said, I knew very well, was he whose. life I had saved : he came
towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce
also; and he did not only not know me at first, but he had no
thoughts, no notion, of its being me that was come, till I spoke
to him. Seignior, said I in Portuguese, do you not know me?
at which he spoke not a word; but giving his musquet to the
man that was with him, threw his arms abroad, and saying some-
thing in Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, comes forward
and embraced me, telling me, he was inexcusable not to know
that face again that he had once wen, as ofan angel from heaven
sent to save his life : he said abundance of very handsome things,
as a well bred Spaniard always knows how; and then beckoning
to the person that attended him, bade him go and all out his
comrades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old habi-
tation, where he would give me possession of my own house
again, and where I should see there had been but mean improve-
ments. So I walked along with him; but, alas!. I could no
more find the place again, than if I had never been there; for
they had planted so many trees, and placed them in such a pos-
ture, so thick and close to one another, in ten years time they
were grown so big, that, in short, the place was inaccessible, ex-
cept by such windings, and blind ways, as they themselves only
who made them could find.

I asked them, what put them upon all these fortifieations?
He told me, I would say there was need enough of it, when they
had given me an account how they had paged their time since
their arriving in the island, especially after they had the misfor-
tune, to find that I was gone: he told me he could not but have
some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he heard that I was
gone away in a. good ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he
had oftentimes a strong persuasion, that one time mother he
should see me again; but nothing that ever befel him in his life, '
he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the
disappointment he was under when he came back to the island,
and found I was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left
behind, and of whom he said he had a long story to tell me; the
Spaniard: all thought themselves much better among the savages,
only that their number was so small. And, says he, had.they
been strong enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory; and
with that he crossed himself on the breast. But, Sir, says he, I
hope you will not be displeased, when I shall tell you how, forced
by necessity, we were obliged, for our own preservation, to dis-
arm them, and make them our subjects, who would not be con-
tent with being moderately our masters, but would be our mur--
derers. I answered, I was heartily afraid of it when I left them
there; and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island,
but that they were not come back, that I might have put them
in possession of every thing first, and left the other in a state of
subjection, as they deserved: but if they had reduced them to it,
I was very glad, and should be very far from finding any fault
with it; for I knew they Were a parcel of refractory ungoverned
villains, and were fit for any manner of mischief.

While I was saying this, came the man whom he had sent
back, and with him eleven men more: in the dress they were in,
it was impossible to guess what nation they were of; but he
made all clear both to them and to me. First, he turned to me,
and pointing to them, said, These, Sir, are some of the-gentle-
men who owe their lives to you; and then turning to them, and
pointing to me, he let them know who I was; upon which they
all came up one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and ordi-
nary fellom, and I the like, but really as if they had been am-
bassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch, or a great conqueror:
their behaviour was to the last degree obliging and eourwous,
and yet mixed with a manly majestic gravity, which very well
became them ;' and in short, they had so much more manners
than I, that I scarce knew how to rweive their civilities, much
less how to return them in kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct in the island, after
my going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many inci-
denu, which the former part of my relation will help to under-
stand, and which will, in most of the particulars, refer to that
account I have already given, that I cannot but commit them
with great delight to the reading of those that come after me.

I shall no longer aouble the story with a relation in the first
person, which will put me to the expense of ten thousand raid 1'5,
and raid he'r, and he told art's, and I told Irina'r, and the like;
but I shall collect the facts historieally, as nsar as I ean gather
them out of my memory, from what they related to me, and
horn what I met with in my conversing with them, and with the
place.

I order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, I
must go back to the circumstance in which I left the island, and
which the persons were, of whom I am to speak. And first, it
is necessary to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's father and
the Spaniard, the two whose lives I had rescued from the savages;
I say, I hadsent them awayin alargeeanoetothemain,arl
the): thought it, to fetch over- the Spaniard: companions, whom
he had left behind him, in order to save them from the like
calamitythathe had beenin, and inordertosuocourthemfor
the present, and that, if possible, we might together find some
way for our deliverance afterward.

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or
the least room to hope. for, my own deliverance, any more than
I had twenty year before; much less had I any foreknowledge
of what afterward happened, I mean of an English ship coming
on shore there to fetch me off; and it could not butbe avery
greatsurprise to them, whentheyeame back, notonly'tofind
that I was gone, but to find three strangers left on the spot,
possessed of all that I had left behind me, which would otherwise
have been their own.

The first thing, however, which I enquired into (that I might
begin where I left off), was of their own part: and I desired he
would give me a particular account of his voyage back to his
countrymen with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over.
He told me there was little variety in that part; for nothing
remarkable happened to them on the way, they having very calm
weather, and a smooth sea: for his countrymen, it could not be
doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him (it seems
he was the principal man among them, the captain of the vessel
they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some time):
they were, he said, the more surprised to see him, because they
knew that he was fallen into the hands of savages, who, they
were satisfied, would devour him as they did all the rest of their
prisoners: that when he told them the story of the deliverance,
and in what manner he was furnished for ear-tying them away, it
was like a dream to them; and their astonishment, they said,
was something like that of 7aseplz': brethren, when he told them
who he was, and told them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's
court: but when he shewed them the arms, the powder, the ball,
and the provisions that he brought them for their journey, or
voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a just share of
the joy of their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come
away with him. _

Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they were
obliged not to stick so much upon the honest part of it, but to
trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow tw0 large
canoes or periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing, or for
pleasure.

In these they came away the next morning; it seems they
.wanted no time to get themselves ready, for they had no bag-
gage, neither clothes, or provisions, or any thing' in the world,
but what they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they
used to make their bread.

They were in all three weeks absent, and in that time, un-
luckily for them, I had the oceasion offered for my escape, as I
mentioned in my other part, and to get off from the island;
leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, ungovemed, dis-
agreeable villains behind me, that any man could desire to meet
with, to the poor Spaniard? great grief and disappointment, you
may be sure.

The onlyjust thing the rogues did, was, that when the Spaniard:
came on shore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them
provisions, and other relief, as I had ordered them to do; also
they gave them the long paper of directions, which I had'left
with them, containing the particular methods which I took for
managing every part of my life there; the way how I baked my
bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my corn; how I cured
my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word, every thing I did:
all this being written down, they gave to the Spaniard:, two of
whom understand English well enough; nor did they refuse to
accommodate the Spaniard: with every thing else, for they agmd
very well for some time: they gave them an equal admission
into the house, or cave, and they began to live very sociably;
and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my method,
and Friday': father together, managed all their atFairs: for, .as
for the Englishmen they'did nothing but ramble about the island,
shoot parrots, and catch tortoises,- and when they came home at

night, the Spaniard: provided their suppers for them. .
The Spaniard: would have been satisfied with this, would the

other but have let them alone; which, however, they could not
find in their hearts to do long; but, like the dog in the manger,
they would not at themselves, and would not let others eat
neither: the difi'erences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial,

Q
and such as 'are not worth relating; but atlast it broke out into
open war, and it begun with all the rudeness and insolenee that
can be imagined, without reason, without provocation, contrary
to nature, and indeed to common sense; and though it is true,
the first relation of it came from the Spaniard: themselves,
whom I may call the accusers, yet when I came to examine the
fellows, they could not deny a word of it.

But before I come to the particular of this part, I must supply
a defect in my former relation; and this was, that I forgot to set
down among the rest, that, just as we were weighing the anchor
to 'set sail, there happened a little quarrel on board our ship,
which I was afraid once would have tuned to a second mutiny;
nor was it appeased till the captain, musing up his courage, and
taking us all to his assistance, parted diem by force, and making
two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in
irons; and as they had been active in the former disorders, and
let fall some ugly dangerous words the second time, he threatened
to carry them in irons to England, and have them hanged there
for mutiny and running away with the ship.

This, it seems, though the captain did not intend todo it, fiighted
some other men in the ship; and some of them had put it into
the heads of the rest, that the captain only gave them good words
for the present, till they should come to some Englith port; and
that then they should be all put into gaol, and tried for their
lives.

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it;
upon which it was desired, that I, who still pased for a great
man among them, should go doivn with the mate, and satisfy the
men, and tell them, that they might be assured, if they behaved
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time past
should be pardoned. So I went, and after passing my bottom":
word to them, they appeared easy, and the more so, when I
caused the two men who were in irons, to be relmd and for-
given.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night,
the wind also fallingeslm; next morningwefound,thatourtwo
menwho hadbeenlaidin irons,hadstoleeaehofthemamus-
quet, and some other wapons; what powder or shot they lad,
we know not; and had taken the ship's pinnaoe, which was not
yet haled up, and ran away with her to their companions in
roguery on the shore.

As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore,
with- twelve men and the mate, and away they went to seek the
rogues; but they could neither find them, nor any of the rest;
for they all fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming
'on shore. The mate was once resolved, in justice to their
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt all their home-
hold-stun: and furniture, and left them to shift without it; but
having no order, he let it all alone, left every thing as they
found it, and bringing the pinnace away, me on board without
them.

These two men made their number five; but the other three
villainswmsomuch wickederthanthese: thataftertheyhad
been two or three days together, they turned their two new-
comers out of doors to shift for themselves, and would have no-
thingto dowith them; nor couldtheyforagoodwhilebeper-
$113M to give them any food: as forthe Spaniardr,.they were
not yet come. ' '

When the <<Spaniard: came first on shore, the business began
to go forward; due Spaniard: would have persuaded the three
English brutes to have taken in dneir two countrymen again, that,
as they said, they might be all one family; but they woulduot
hear of it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves; and
finding nothing but industry and application would make them
live comfortably, they pitched their tents on the north shore of
the-island, but a little more to the west, to be out of the danger
of the savages, who always landedon the east parts of the island.
Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the other
to lay up their magazines and stores in; and the Spaniard:
having given them some corn for seed, and especially some of
the peas which I had left them, they dug and planted, and en-
closed after the pattern I had set for them all, and began to live
pretty well. Their first crop of corn was on the ground, and
though it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at
first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve
them, and find them with bread or other enables; and one of
the fellows, being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at
making soup, puddings, and such other preparations, as the rice
and the milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished him to
do.

They were going on in this little thriving posture, when the
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere
humour, and to insult them, tame and bullied them, and told
them the island was theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had
given them possession of it, and nobody else had any right to it;
and, damn them, they should build no houses upon their ground,
unless they would pay them rent for them.

The two men thought they hadjested at first; asked them to
come and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that they
had built, and tell them what rent they demanded: and one of
them merrily told them, if they were ground--landlords, he hoped
if they built tenements upon the land, and made improvements,
they would, according to the custom of all landlords, grant them
a long lease; and bid them go fetch a scrivener to draw the
writings. One of the three damning and raging, told them,
they should see they were not in jest; and going to a little place
at a distance, where the honest men had made a fire to-dress their
victuals, he takes a fire--brand and claps it to the outside of their
hut, and very fairly set it on fire; and it would have been all
burnt down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not run to
the fellow, thrust him away, and and the fire out with his feet,
and that not without some difficulty too.

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting
him away, that he returned upon him with a pole he had in his
hand; and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and
run into the hut, he had ended his days at once. His comrade,
seeing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and imme>>
diately they came both out with their mosques; and the man
that was first struck at with the pole, knocked the fellow down,
that had begun the quarrel, with the stock of his musquet, and
that before the other two could come to help him; and then see-
ing the rest come at them, they stood together, and presenting
the other ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand of.

The other had fire-arms with them too: but one of the two
honest men bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his,
danger, told them, if they offered to move hand or foot, they
were dead men; and boldly commanded them to lay down their
arms. They did not indeed.lay down their arms; but, seeing
him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and they consenmd
to take their wounded man with them, and be gone; and in-
deed,' it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the
blow; however, they were much in the wrong, since they had
the advantage, that they did not disarm them effectually, as they
might have done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards,
and given them an account how the rogues had treated them;
for the three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every day
gave them some intimation that they did so.

But nottocrowd thispartwith an accountoftheleeserpart
of their rogueries, such as treading down their corn, shooting
three young kids, and a she-goat which the poor men had got to
breed up tame for their store; and, in a word, plaguing them
night and day in this manner, it forced the two men to such a
duperation, that they resolved to fight them all three the first
time they had a fair opportunity. In order tothis, they resolved
to go to the castle, as they called it, that was my old dwelling,
where the three rogues and the Spaniardt all lived together at that
time, intending to have a {air battle, and the Spaniards should
stand by to see fair play. So they got up in the morning before
day, and eame to the place, and called the Englishmen by their
names, telling a Spaniard that answered, that they wanted to
speak with them.

It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards, having
been in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom,
for distinction, I call the honest men,- and he had made a sad
complaint to the Spaniards, of the barbarous usage they had met
with from their three counh'ymen, and how they had ruined their.
plantation, and destroyed their corn, that they had laboured so
hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat, and their'three'
kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance; and
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist
them again, they should be starved. When the Spaniards me-
home at night, and they were all at supper, he took the freedom
to reprove the three Englishmen, though in very gentle and man--
nerly terms, and asked them, how they could be so cruel, they
being harmless inoffensive fellows, and that they were only put-
ting themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that it
had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such perfec-
tion as they had?

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What had
they to do there? That they came on shore without leave,
and that they should not plant or build upon the island; it was
none of their ground. Why, says the Spaniard, very calmly,
Seignior Inglese, they must not starve. The Englishman replied,
like a true rough--hewn tarpaulin, they might starve and be
damned, they should not plant or build. But what must they
do then, Seignior? says the Spaniard. Another of.the brutes
reamed, Do! d--n them, tiny should he servants, and work
for them. But how eon you expect that of them? says the
Spaniard, they are not bought with your money; you have no
right to make them servants. The Englishman answered. the
islandwastheirs,thegovermrhadgiven it tothem,andnoman
had anything to do there but themselves; and with that swore
byhisMaker,thattheywouldgoandhumall theirnewhuts;
they should build none upon their land.

. Why, Seignior, says the Spaniard, by the same rule, we must
be your servants too. Ay, says the bold dog, and so you shall
too, before we have done with you, mixing two or three G--d
d--n-me's in the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard
only smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this
little discourse had hated them; and starting up, one says to
the other, I think itwas he they called "'71! Atkinr, Come, fad,
let us go and have the other brush with them; we will demo--
lish their castle, I will warrantyou; they shall plant no colony
in our dominions.

Upon this they went alltrooping away, witheverymana
gun, a pistol, and. a sword, and muttered some insolent things
among theruselm, of what they would do to the Spaniard: too,
when opportunity offered; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not
so perfectly understandthem as to knowall the particulars;
only that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking the
two Englishman's part. ~

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that
evening, the Spaniard: said they did not know; but it seems
they wandered about the country part of the night; and then
lyingdowninthe plaeewhichlusedtocallmybower,they
were wary, and overslept themselves. The use was this : they
hadreeolvedeostaytill midnighgand so to take thetwopoor
men when they were asleep; and as they acknowledged after-
wards, intendedeo set fire to their hutswhile theywereinthem,
and either burn them in them, or murder them as they came
out: and, as malice seldom sleepsvery sound, it was very strange
they should not have been kept waking.

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I
have said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and

murdering, it happened, and very luckily, for them all, that they
were up and gone abroad, before the bloody--minded rogues me
to their huts.

When they came there and found the men gone, dth'm, who
it seems was the forw'ardest man, called out to his comrades,
Ha! 7ack, here's the nest; but d--n them, the birds are flown:
they mused awhile to think what should be the occasion of their
being gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently, that the
Spaniard: had given them notice of it; and with that they shook
' hands, and swore to one another, that they would be revenged
of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody bar-
gain, they fell to work with the poor men's habitation; they did
not set fire indeed to any thing, but they pulled down both their
little houses, and pulled them so limb from limb that they left not
the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where
they stood; they tore all their little collected household-stuff in
pieces, and threw every thing about in such a manner, that the
poor men afterwards found some of their things a mile of!" of
their habitation.

When they had done this, they pulled up all the young trees
the poor men had planted ; pulled up an enclosure they .had
made to secure their cattle and their corn ; and, in a word,
sacked and plundered every thing as completely as a herd of
Tartar: would have done.

The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out,
and had resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though
they were but two to three: so that, had they met, there certainly
would have been bloodshed among them; for they were all very
stout resolute fellows, to give them their due.
ButProvidence tookmore we'tokeep themasundertlm

another, when the three were gone thither, the two were here;
andafterwards,whenthetwowentbacktofindthem, thethree

ing conduct prwently. When the three me back, like furi-
ous creatures, flushed with the rage which the work they had
been about put them into, they came up to the Spaniardr, and
told them what theyhad done, by way of 9006' and bravado;
and one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniard:, as if they
had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of his hat, as it
was upon his head, and giving it a twirl about, fleeting in his
face, says he to him, Andyaa, Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have
the 3am mute, if you dc not mdyaur men. The Spaniard,
who, thoughaquietcivilman,masbraveasamaneouldde--
sire to be, and withal a strong well-made man, looked steadily at
himforagoodwhile; andthen,havingnoweaponinhishand,
set-pt gravely up to him, and with one blow of his fist, knocked
him down,as an ox is felledwith a poleaxe,atwhich one of
the rogues, insolent as the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard
immediately: he missed his body indeed, for the bulletswent
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and
he bled pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard believe he
wasmorehurt than he reallywas, and thatputhiminto some

Whmtheywmthmdimdandfoundtheyhadnndeall
the Spaniard: their enemies, as well as their own connuymen,

0'2
they began to cool; and giving the Spaniard: better words,
would have had their arms again; but the Spaniard: considering
the feud that was between them and the other two Englishmen,
and that it would be the best method they could take to keep
them from killing one another, told them they Would do them
no harm; and if they would live peaceably they would be very
willing to assist and associate with them, as they did before; but
that they could not think of giving them their arms again, while
they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to their own
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make them
their servants.

The rogues were now more capable to hear reason than to act
reason: but being refused their arms, they went raving away,
and raging like madmen, threatening what they would do,
though they had no fire-arms: but the Spaniards, despising their
threatening, told them they should take are how they offered
any injury to their plantation or cattle; for if they did, they
would shoot them, as they would do ravenous beasts, wherever
they found them; and if they fell into their hands alive, they
should certainly be hanged. However, this was far from cool-
ing them; but away they went, raging and swearing like furies
of hell. As soon as they were gone, came back the two men in
passion and rage enough also, though of another kind; for,
having been at their plantation, and finding it all demolished and
destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had provoea--
tion enough; they could scarce have room to tell their tale, the
Spaniard: were so eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange
enough to find, that three men thus bully nineteen, and receive
no punishment at all.

The Spaniard: indeed despised them, and especially having
thus disarmed them, made light of all their threatenings; but the
two Englxirlunen resolved to have their remedy against them, what
pains soever it cost to find them out.
'But the Spaniard: interposed here too, and told them, that as
they had disarmed them: they could not consent that they (the
two) should pursue them with fire-arms; and perhaps kill them :
but, said the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, we will
endeavour to make them do you justice, if you will leave it to
us, for, as there is no doubt but they will come to us again when
their passion is over, being not able to subsist without our as-
sistance, we promise you to make no peace with them, without
having a full satisfaction for you; and upon this condition we
hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than
in your defence.

The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and
with great reluctance; but the Spaniard: protested, they did it
only to keep them from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last,
for, said they, we are not so many of us; here is room enough
for us all, and it is great pity we should not be all good friends.
At length they did consent, and waited for the issue of the thing,
living for some days with the Spaniard: ; for their own habita-
tion was destroyed.

In about five days time the three vagrants, tired with wander-
ing, and almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on
turtles eggs all that while, came back to the grove; and finding
my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor, and two
more with him, walking by the side of the creek, they came up
in a very submissive humble manner, and begged to be received-
again into the family; The Spaniard: used them civilly, but
told them, they had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen,
and so very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they could
not come to any conclusion without consulting the two Englidi-
m, and the rest; but however they would go to them, and
discourse about it, and they should know in half an hour. It
may be guessed that theywereveryhardputto it; for it seems,
as they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they begged
he would send them out some bread in the mean time; which he
did, and sent them at the same time a large piece of goat's flesh,
and a boiled parrot; which they eat very heartily, for they were
hungry enough.

After half an hour's consultation they were called in, and a
long debate had among them, their two countrymen charging
them with the ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder
them ; all which they owned before, and therefore could not deny
now; upon the whole, the Spaniard acted the moderator between
them; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt
the three, while they were naked and unarmed, so they now ob-
liged the three to go and build their fellows two huts, one to be
of the same, and the other of larger dimensions than they were
before; to fence their ground again, where they had pulled up
the fences, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up
the land again for planting corn, where they had spoiled it; and,
in a word to restore every thing in the same state as they found
it, as near as they could; for entirely it could not be, the season
for corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges, not being @-
ble to be recovered.

Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had plenty of
provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and
the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together;
only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to work;
I mean, for themselves, except now and then a little, just as they
pleased; however, the Spaniard: told them plainly, that if they
would but live sociably and friendly together, and study in the
whole the good of the plantation, they would be content to work
for them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleas-
ed; and thus having lived pretty well together for a month or
two, the Spaniard: gave them their arms again, and gave them
liberty to go abroad with them as before.

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went
abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began to he as insolent and
troublesome as before: but, however, an accident happened pre-
sently upon this, which endangered the safety of them all; they
were obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look to the
preservation of their lives.

It happened one night, that the Spaniard governor, as I call
him, that is to say, the 81:471er whom life I had saved, who
was now the esptain, or leader, or governor of the rest, tbund
himself very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any
sleep: he was perfectly well in body, as he told me the scary,
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon men
fighting and killing of one another, but was broad awake, and
could not by any means get any sleep; in short, he lay a great.
while; but growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise:
as they lay, being so many of them, upon goat-skins, laid thick
upon such couches and pads as they made for themselves, not in
hammocks and ship beds, as I did, who was but one, so they had
little to do, when they were willing to rise, but to get up upon
their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their
pumps, and they were ready for going any way that their
deg thoughts guided them.

Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being dark, he
could see little or nothing; and besides, the trees which I had
planted, as in my former account is described, and which were
now grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could only look
up, and see that it was a clear star--light night; and, hearing no
noise,heremmedandlaidhimdownagain; butitwas allone,
he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to any thing
likerest,but his thoughtswere tothelastdegreeunessy, and
yet he knew not for what.

Having made some noise with rising and walking about,
goingoutand coming in, another ofthemwaked,and,calling,
asked who itwas that was up? Thegovernortold him,how it
had been with him. Say you so, says the other Spaniard; such
things are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is certainly
some mischief Working, says he, near us; and presently he asked
him, Where are the Englishmen? They are all in their huts,
says he, safe enough. It seems the Spaniard: had kept possession
of the main apartment, and had made a place, where the three
Englishmen, since their last mutiny, always quartered by them-
selves, and could not come at the rest. Well, says the Spaniard,
there is something in it, I am persuaded from my own experi-
rience; I am satisfied our spirits embodied have a converse with,
and receive intelligence from, the spirits unembodied, and inha-
biting the invisible world; and this friendly notice is given for
our advantage, if we know how to make use of it. Come, says
he, let us go out and look abroad; and if we find nothing at
all in it to justify our trouble, I will tell you a story to the
purpose, that shall convince you of the justice of my pro-
posing it.

In a word, they went out to go up to the top of the hill,
where I used to go; but they, being strong, and in good com-
pany, not alone, as I was, used none of my cautions to go up by
the ladder, and then pulling it up after them, to go up a second
stage to the top, but were going round through the grove uncon--
cerned and unwary, when they were surprised with seeing alight
as of fire, a very little way of? from them, and hearing the voices
of men, not of one or two, but of a great number.

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on
the island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the
least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the place;
and when by any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually, that they that got away were scarce able to give any
account of it, for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor did ever
any that had seen me escape to tell any one else, except it was
the three savages in our last encounter, who jumped into the boat,
of whom I mentioned that I was afraid they should go home, and
bring more help.

Whether it was the consequence of the eseape of those men,
that so great a number me now together; or whether they
came ignorantly, and by accident, on their usual bloody errand,
they could not it seems understand; but whatever it was, it had ,
been their business, either to have concealed themselves, and not
have seen them at all; much less to have let the savages have
seen that there were any inhabitants in the place; or to have
fallen upon them so effectually, as that not a man of them should
have escaped, which could only have been by getting in between
them and their boats; but this presence of mind was wanting to
them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great while.

We need not doubt but that the governor, and the man with
him, surprised with this sight, run back immediately, and raised
their fellows, giving them an account of the imminent danger
they were all in; and they again as readily took the alarm, but
it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within where

they were, but that they must run all out to see how things
stood.

While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, and they
had opportunity enough, for some hours, to view them by the
light of three fires they had made at some distance from one
another; what they were doing they knew not, and what to do
themselves they knew not; for, first, the enemy were too many;
and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were divided'into
several parties, and were on shore in several places.

The Spaniard: were in no small consternation at this sight;
and as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the
shore, they made no doubt, but, first or last, some of them would
chop in upon their habitation, or upon some other place, where
they would see the token of inhabitants; and they were in great
perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which would have376 Lm: aub Auvsuruaes

been little less than starving them, if they should have been
destroyed; so the first thing they resolved upon was to dispatch
three men away before it was light, viz. two Spaniard: and one
Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the great valley
where the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into the
very cave itself.

Could they have seen the savages altogether in one body, and
at any distance from their canoes, they resolved, if they had been
a hundred of them, to have attacked them; but that could not
be obtained, for they were some of them two miles of from the
other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two different nations.

After having mused a great while on the course they should
take, and beaten their brains in considering their present circum--
stances, they resolved at last, while it was still dark, to send the
old savage (Friday's father) out as a spy, to learn, if possible,
something concerning them, what they came for, and what they
intended to do; the old man readily undertook it, and, stripping
himself quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he went:
after he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word, that he
had been among them undiscovered, that he found they were two
parties, and of two several nations, who had war with one another,
and had had a great battle in their own country, and that both
sides, having had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were
by mere chance landed all in the same island for the devouring
their prisoners, and making merry; but their coming so by
chance to the same place, had spoiled all their mirth; that they
were in a great rage at one another; and that they were so near,
that.he believed they would fight again as soon as day-light
began to appear; but he did not perceive that they had any
notion of any body's being on the island but themselves. He
had hardly made an end of telling his story, when they could
perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the two little
armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
Friday': father used all the arguments he could to persuade
our people to lie close, and not be seen; he told them, their
safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie
still, and the savages would kill one another to their hands, and
then the rest would go away; and it was so to a tittle. But it
was impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englirlzm; their
curiosity was so importunate upon their prudentials, that they
must run out and see the battle; however, they used some
caution too, 'viz. they did not go openly just by their own
dwelling, but went farther into the woods, and placed themselves
to advantage, where they might securely see them manage the
fight, and, as they thought, not to be seen by them; but it seems
the savages did see them, as we shall find hereafter.

The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the Englixh--
men, one of them said he could perceive, that some of them were
men of great bravery, of invincible spirits, and of great policy in
guiding the fight. The battle, they said, held two hours, before.
they could guess which party would be beaten; but then that
party which was nearest our people's habitation began to appear.
weakest, and after some time more, some of them began to fly;
and this put our men again into a great consternation, lost any of
those that fled should run into the grove, before their dwelling,
for shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the place; and
i that by consequence the pursuers should do the like in search for
them. Upon this they resolved, that they would stand armed
' within the wall, and whoever eame into the grove, they should
, sally out over the wall, and kill them; so that, if possible, not
one should return to give an account of it; they ordered also,
that it should be done with their swords, or by knocking them
down with the stock of the musquet, but not by shooting them,
for fear of raising an alarm by the noise.

As they expected, it'fell out; three of the routed army tied
for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in.
the least knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick
wood for shelter; the scout they kept to look abroad gave notice
of this within, with this addition to our men's great satisfaction,
'viz. That the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which
way they were gone. Upon this the Spaniard governor, a man
of humanity, would not suffer them to kill the three fugitives;
but sending three men out by the top of the hill, ordered them
to go round, and come in behind them, surprise and take them
prisoners, which was done; the residue of the conquered people
fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the victors retired, made
no pursuit, or very little; but drawing themselves into a body
together, gave two great screaming shouts, which they supposed
were by way of triumph, and so the fight ended: and the same.
day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also marched to
their canoes. And thus the Spaniard: had their island again free.
to themselves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages in
several years after.

After they were all gone, the Spaniard: came out of their den;
and, viewing the field of battle, they found about two--and-thirty
dead men upon the spot; some were killed with great long
arrows, some of which were found sticking in their bodies; but
most of them were killed with their great wooden swords, sixteen
or seventeen of which they found in the field of battle, and as
many bows, with a great many arrows: thee swords were
strange great unwieldy things, and they must be very strong
men that used them: most of those men that were killed with
them had their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as we
call it in English, their brains knocked out, and several of their
arms and legs broken; so that it is evident they fight with
inexpressible rage and fury; we found not one wounded man
that was not stone dead; for either they stay by their enemy till
they have quite killed them, or they carry all the wounded men,
that are not quite dead, away with them.
This deliverance tamed our'Englr'slrm for a great while: the
sight had filled them with horror, and the consequences appeared
terrible to the last degree, even to them, if ever they should fall
into the hands of those creature, who would not only kill them
asenemies,butkillthemfor food,as we kill our eattle. And
they professed to me, that the thoughts of being eaten up like
beef or mutton, though it was supposed it was not to be till they
were dead, had something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their
very stomachs, made them sick when. they thought of it, and filled
their minds with such unusual terror, that they were not them-
selves for some weeks after.

This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes I have
been speaking of; and, for a great while after, they were very
tractable, and went about the common business of their whole
society well enough; planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all
naturalized to the country; but some time after this, theyfell all
into such measures which brought them into a great deal of
trouble.

They had taken three prisoners, as I had obmrved; and these
three being lusty stout young fellows, they made them servants,
and taught them to work for them; and, asslaves, they didwell
enough; but they did not take their measures with them, as I did
by my man Friday, 'vr'z. to begin with them upon the principle
ofhaving saved their lives, and then instruct them in the rational
principles of life, much less of religion, civilizing and reducing
them by kind usage, and afi'ectionate arguings; but, as they gave
them their food every day, so they gave them their work too,
and kept them fully employed in drudgery enough; but they
failedinthisbyit,thattheynever had themtoassistthemand
fight for them, as I had my man Friday, who was as true to me
as the very flesh upon my bones.

Buttocometothefamilypart. Beingall nowgoodfriends .
(for common danger, as I said above, had efl'ectually reconciled
them), they began to consider their general circumstances; and
the first thing that came under their consideration was, whether,
seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of the island,
and that there were more remote and retired parts of it equally
adapted to their way of living, and manifestly to their advantage,
they should not rather remove their habitation, and plant in some
more proper place for their security, and especially for the security
of their cattle and corn.

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded, that they
would not remove their habitation; because that some time or
other they thought they might hear from their governor again,
meaning me: and if I should send any one to seek them, I
should be sure to direct them on that side, where, if they should
find the place demolished, they would conclude the savages had
killed us all, and we were gone, and so our supply would
go too.

But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them
into the valley where my cave was, where the land was as proper
for both, and where indeed there was land enough: however,
upon second thought, they altered one part of that resolution too,
and resolved only to remove part of their cattle thither, and plant
part of their corn there; and so, if one part was destroyed, the
other might be saved: and one piece of prudence they used,
which it was very well they did; viz. That they never trusted
those three savages, which they had prisoners, with knowing any
thing of the plantation they had made in that valley, or of any
cattle they had there; much lees of the cave there, which they
kept in case of necessity, as a safe retreat; and whither they
carried also the two barrels of powder which I had sent them at
my coming away.

But, however, they resolved .not to change their habitation;
yet they agreed, that as I had carefully covered it first with a

wall or fortification, and then with a grove of trees; so, seeingtheir safety consisted entirely in their being conceded, of which
they were now fully convinced, they set to work to cover and
conceal the place yet more effectually than before: to this pur-
pose, as I had planted trees (or rather thrust in sakes, which in
time all grew up to be trees) for some good distance before the
entrance into my apartment, they went on in the same manner,
and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground, from the
trees I had set, quite down to the side of the creek, where, as I
said, I landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where the
tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or any sign
that there had been any landing thereabout: these sakes also,
being of a wood very forward to grow, as I had noted formerly,
they took care to have generally very much larger and aller
than those which I had planted, and as they grew apace so they
planted them so very thick and close together, that when they
had been three or four years grown, there was no piercing with
the eye any considerable way into the plantation: as for that
part which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a
man's thigh; and among them they placed so many other short
ones, and so thick, that in a word it stood like a palisado a
quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate
it, but with a little army, to cut it all down; for a little dog could
hardly get between the trees, they stood so close.

But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground
to the right hand, and to the left, and round even to the top of
the hill; leaving no way, not so much as for themselves to come
out, but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then
lifted up, and placed again from the first sage up to the top:
which ladder, when it,was taken down, nothing but what had
wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at them.

This was excellently well contrived: nor was it less than what
they afterwards found occasion for; which served to convince
me, that as human prudence has the authority of Providence to
justify it, so it has, doubtless, the direction of Providence to set
it to work; and, would we listen wefully to the voice of it, 1
am fully persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters
which our lives are now, by our own negligence, subjected to.
But this by the way.

I return to the story. they lived two years after this' m per-
fect retirement, and had no more visits from the savages: they
had indeed an alarm given them one morning, which put them
into a great consternation; for some of the Spaniard: being out
early one morning on the west side, or rather the end of the
island, which, by the way, was that end where I never went,
for fear of being discovered, they were surprised with seeing
above twenty canoes of Indian: just coming on shore.

They made the best of their way home, in hurry enough ;
and giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that
day and the next, going out only at night, to make observation:
but they had the good luck to be mistaken; for wherever
the savages went, they did not land that time on the island, but
pursued some other design.

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen;
one of which, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage with one
of the three slaves, which I mentioned they had taken, because
the fellow had not done something right which he bid him do,
and seemed a little untractable in his shewing him, drew a
hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore it by his side, and
fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him.

One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the fellow a .

barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but
struck into his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut the poor
creature's arm ofi", ran to him, and entreating him not to murder

the poor man, clapped in between him and the savage, to prevent
the mischief.

The fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck at the

Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as ''or Rotunda Cnusotl 383

he intended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard perceiving,
avoidedtheblow,andwithsshovel,which he had inhis hand
(for they all were working in the field about their corn had),
knocked the brute down: another of the Englishmen, running
at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard
down; and then two Spaniard: more came to help their man,
and a third Englislman fell in upon them. They had none of
them any fire-arms, or any other weapons but hatchets and
other tools, except this third Englirhlnan; he had one of my old
rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the two last Spaniards,
and wounded them both: this fray set the whole family in an
uproar, and more help coming in, they took the three Eng-lithium
prisoners. The next question was, What should be dme with
them? They had been so often mutinous, and were so furious,
so desperate, and so idle withal, that they knew not what cause
to take with them, for they were mischievous to the highest

degree, and valued not what hurt they did to any man; so that,
in short, it was not safe to live with them.

The Spaniard, who was governor, told them in so many
words, that if they had been his own countrymen, he would
have hanged them; for all laws, and all governors, was to pre-
serve society; and those'who were dangerous to the society
ought to be expelled out of it; but as they were Englixhnun,
and that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman
that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would
use them with all possible lenity, and would leave them to the
judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were their country-
men.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said, they
desiredit might notheleftto them: for, says he, I amsurewe
ought to sentence them to the gallows; and with that he gives
an account how Il'ill 'Atb'nr, one of the three, had proposed to
have all the five Englirhm join together, and murder all tin
Spaniards, when they were in their sleep.
When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to William '11:-
kinr. How, Seignior Atkins, says he, would you murder us all?
What have you to say to that? That hardened villain was so far
from denying it, that he said it was true, and G--d d--mn him
they would do it still before they had done with them. Well,
but Seignior Atkinx, said the Spaniard, what have we done to you
that you will kill us? And what would you get by killing us?
And what must we do to prevent you killing us? Must we kill
you, or you will kill us? Why will you put us to the necessity
of this, Seignior Atkins? says the Spaniard very calmly, and ,
smiling.

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard': making a i
jest of it, that, had he not been held by three men, and withal "
had no weapons near him, it was thought he would have at--
tempted to have killed the Spaniard in the middle of all the com- 5
pany. .

This hair-brained carriage obliged them to consider seriously '
what was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard,
who saved the poor savage, was of opinion, they should hang
one of the three for an example to the rest; and that particularly
it should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder
with his hatchet; and indeed there was some reason to believe he I
had done it, for the poor ravage was in such a miserable condi-
dition with the wound he had received, that it was thought he
could not live.

But the governor Spaniard still said, No, it was an Englishman
that had saved all their lives, and he would never consent to put
an Englishman to death, though he had murdered half of them:
nay, he said, if he had been killed himself by an Englishman,
and had time left to speak, it should be that they should pardon
him. '

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard,
that there was no gainsaying it: and as merciful counsels are l

1

most apt to prevail, where they are so earnestly pressed, so they
all came into it; but then it was to be considered, what should
be done to keep them from doing the mischief they designed;
for all agmd, governor and all, that means were to be used for
preserving the society from danger. After a. long debate it was
agmd, first, that they should be disarmed, and not permitted to
have either gun, or powder, or shot, or sword, or any weapon,
and should be turned out of the society, and left to live where
they would, and how they would, by themselves; but that none
of the rest, either Spaniard: or English, should converse with
them, speak with them, or have any thing to do with them; that
they should be forbid to come within a certain distance of the
place where the rest dwelt; and that if they offered to commit
any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the
corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the
society, that they should die without mercy, and they would
shoot them wherever they could find them.

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the
sentence, considered a little upon it; and turning to the two
honest Englishmen, said, Hold; you must reflect, that it will be
long ere they can raise corn and settle of their own, and they
must not starve; we must therefore allow them provisions. So
he caused to be added, that they should have a proportion of
corn given them to last them eight months, and for seed to sow,
by which time they might be supposed to raise some of their
own; that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and
six kids, given them, as well for present subsistence, as for a
store; and that they should have tools given them for their work
in the field; such as, six hatches, an axe, a saw, and the like.
But they should have none of these tools or provisions, unless
they would swear solemnly, that they would not hurt or injure
any of the Spaniard: with them, or their fellow Englishmen.

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to

a
shift for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as
neither contented to go away or to stay; but as there was no
remedy, they went, pretending to go and choose a place where
they should settle themselves, to plant and live by themselves;
and some provisions were given them, but no weapons.

About four or five days after, they came again for some
victuals, and gave the governor an account where they had
pitched their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and

plantation; and it was a very convenient place indeed, on the
remotest part of the island, N. E. much about the place where I
landed in my first voyage, when I was driven out to sea, the
Lord knows whither, in my attempt to surround the island.

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived
them in a manner like my first habitation, being close under the
side of a hill, having some trees growing already to the three
sides of it; so that by planting others, it would be very easily
covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched for: they
desired some dried goat-skins for beds and covering, which Were
given them; and upon giving their words that they would not
disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave them
hatchets, and what other tools they could spare; some peas,
barley, and rice, for sowing, and, in a word, any thing they
wanted but arms and ammunition.

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and
had gotten in their first harvest, though the quantity was but
small, the quantity of land they had planted being but little; for
indeed, having all their plantation to form, they had a great deal
of work upon their hands; and when they came to make boards,
and pots, and such things, they were quite out of their element,
and could make nothing of it; and when the rainy season came
on, for want of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling: and this
humbled them much; so they came and begged the Spaniardr to
help them, which they very readily did; and in four days worked
a great hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure
their corn and other things from the rain; but itwas but a poor
place at best, compared to mine; and especially as mine was
then; for the Spaniard: had greatly enlarged it, and made several
new apartments in it.

About three quarters of a yearafcer this separation, a new
frolic took these rogues, which together with the former villany
they had committed, brought mischief enough upon them, and
had very near been the ruin of the whole colony: the three new
associates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they .
led, and that without hope of bettering their circumstances; and
a whim took them, that they would make a voyage to the con-
tinent from whence the savages came, and would try if they could
not seize upon some prisoners among the natives there, and
bring them home, so to make them do the laborious part of the
work for them.

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no
further; but they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but had
either mischief in the design, or mischief in the event; and, if I
may give my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from
Heaven; for if we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible
crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of things with the
" divine justice? It was certainly an apparent vengeance on their
crime of mutiny and piracy, that brought them to the state they
were in; and, as they shewed not the least remorse for the
crime, but added new villanies to it, such as, particularly, the
piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave, beeause he
did not, or perhaps ,could not, understand to do what he was
directed; and to wound him in such a manner, as no question
made him a cripple all his life, and in a place where no surgeon
or medicine could be hadforhiscure: and,whatwasstillwoise,
the murderous intent; or, to do justice to the crime, the inten-
tional murder, for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards the
formed design they all laid, to murder the Spaniard: in cold
blood, and in their sleep.

But I leave observing, and return to the story: The three
fellows comes down to the Spaniard: one morning, and, in very
humble terms, desired to be admitted to speak with them: the
Spaniard: very readily heard what they had to say, which was
this: that they were tired of living in the manner they did; that
they were not handy enough to make the necessaries they
wanted; and that having no help, they found they should be
starved; but if the Spaniard: Would give them leave to take one
of the entices which they came over in, and give them arms and
ammunition, proportioned. for their defence, they would go over
to the main, and seek their fortune, and so deliver them from the
trouble of supplying them with any other provisions.

The Spaniard: were glad enough to be rid of them; but yet
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction they
were running into; told them, they had sufiiared such hardships
upon that very spot, that they could, without any spirit of pro-
phecy, tell them, that they would be starved or be murdered;
and bade them consider of it.

The men replied audaciously, they should~be starved if they
stayed here, for they could not work, and would not work; and
they could but be starved abroad; and if they were murdered, '
there was an end of them, they had no wives or children to cry
after them; and, in short, insisted importunately upon their
demand, declaring that they would go, whether they would give
them any arms or no.

The Spaniard: told them, with great kindness, that if they
were resolved to go, they should not go like naked men, and be
in no condition to defend themselves; and that though they
could ill spare their firearms, having not enough for themselves,
yet they would let them have two musquets, a. pistol, and a cut-
lass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought sufficient for
them.

In a word, they accepted the ofi'er; and having baked them
bread enough to serve them a month, and given them as much
goat's flesh as they could eat while it was sweet, and a great
basket full ofdriedgrapes, a potfiilloffreshwater, andayoung
kid alive to kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a voyage over
;_ the see, where it was at least forty miles broad.

, The boat was indeed a large one, and would have very well
carried fifteen or twenty men; and therefore was rather too big
for them to manage: butastheyhad a fairbreaeandtheflood--
ride with them, they did well enough: they had made a mast of
a long pole, and a sail of four large goat--skins dried, which they
had sewed or laced together ; and away they went merrily enough:
the Spaniard: called after them Ban Veg/'0,- and no man ever
thought of seeing them any more.
, The Spaniard: would often say to one another, and the two
honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and com--
fombly they lived, now those three turbulent fellows were gone :
as for their ever coming again, that was the remotest thing from
their thoughts could be imagined; when, behold, after twenty--
two days absence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his
planting-work, sees three strange men coming towards him at a
distance, tWo of them with guns upon their shoulders.

Away run the Englishman, as if he was bewitched, comes
frighted and amazed, to the governor Spaniard, and tells him
they were all undone, for there were strangers landed upon the
island, they could not tell who: the Spaniard pausing awhile,
says to him, How do you mean, you cannot tell who? They are
the savages to be sure. No, no, says the Englishman, they are
men in clothes, with arms. Nay then, says the Spaniard, why
are you concerned? If they are not savages, they must be
friends; for there is no Christian nation upon earth, but will do
us good rather than harm.

While they were debating thus, comes the three Englishmen,
and standing without the wood which was new planted, hallooed
to them; they presently knew their voices, and so all the wonder
of that kind ceased. But now the admiration was turned upon
another question, viz. What could be the matter, and what made
them come back again.

It was not long before they brought the men in; and inquiring
where they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave
them a full account of their voyage, in a few .words, viz. That
they reached the land in two days, or something less ; but finding
the people alarmed at their coming, and preparing with bows
and arrows to fight them, they durst not go on shore, but sailed
on to the northward six or seven hours, till they came to a great
opening, by which they perceived that the land they saw from
our island was not the main, but an island: that entering that
opening of the sea, they saw another island on the right hand
north, and several more west; and being resolved to land some-
where, they put over to one of the islands which lay west, and

went boldly on shore; that they' found the people very courteous
and friendly to them, and they gave them several roots, and
some dried fish, and appeared very sociable; and the women, as
well as the men, were very forward to supply them with any

thing they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a 1

great way upon their heads.

They continued here four days, and inquired, as well as they
could of them by signs, what nations were this way, and that
way; and were told of several fierce and terrible people that
lived almost every way; who, as they made signs to them, used
to eat men; but as for themselves, they said, that they never at
men or women, except only such as they took in the wars,
andthentheyownedthattheynudeagreatfeast, andeattheir
prisoners. .

The Engliflsm inquired when they had a feast of that kind;
and they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon,
and then to two fingers; andthat theirgreatking hadtwo hun-
dred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war; and they
were fading them to make them fatforthenextfeest. The
Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those prisoners; but
the other mistaking them, thought they were desirous to have
some of them to carry away for their own eating. So they
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then
to the rising; which was to signify, that the next morning, at
sun-rising, they would bring some for them; and accordingly,
the next morning, they brought down five women, and eleven
men; and gave them to the Englishmen to carry with them on
their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen
down to a see-port town, to victual a ship.

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their
stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know what to
do: to refuse the prisoners would have been the highest affront
tothe savagegentrythatofi'eredthem; and what to dowith
them they knew not: however, upon some debate, they resolved
to accept ofthem; and, in return, theygave the savages that
brought them one of their hatchet, an old key, a knife, and six
or seven of their bullets, which, though they did not understand,
they seemed extremely pleased with: and then, tying the poor
creatures' hands behind them, they (the people) dragged the poor
prisoners into the boat for our men.

The Englirlzm were obliged to come away as soon as they
had them, or else they that gave them this noble present, would
certainly have expected that they should have gone to work with
them, have killed two or three of them the neat--morning, and
perhaps have invimd the donors to dinner.
But, having taken their leave with all the respects and thanks
that could well pass between people, where, on either side, they
understood not one word they could say, they put of!" with their
boat, and came back towards the first island, where, when they
arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being
too many of them for their occasion.

In their voyage they endeavoured to have some communication
with their prisoners, but it was impossible to make them under-
stand any thing; nothing they could say to them, or give them,
or do for them, but was looked upon as going about to murder
them; they first of all unbound them; but the poor creatures
screamed at that, especially the women, as if they had just felt
the knife at their throats; for they immediately concluded they
were unbound on purpose to be killed.

If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the same thing;
then they concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh, and
so not be fat enough to kill: if they looked at one of them more
particularly, the party presently concluded, it was to see whether
he or she was fattest and fittest to kill; nay, after they had
brought them quite over, and began to use them kindly, and
treat them well, still they expected every day to make a dinner
or a supper for their new masters.

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history
or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them, where their
new family was? And being told that they had brought them
on shore, and put them into one of their huts, and were come up
to beg some victuals for them; they (the Spaniardt) and the
other two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved
to go all down to the place, and see them, and did so, and
Friday : father with them.

When they came into the hut, there they sat all bound: for
when they had brought them on shore, they bound their hands,
that they might not take the boat and make their escape; there,
I say, they sat, all of them stark-naked; first, there were three
men, lusty, comely fellows, well-shaped, straight and fair limbs,
about thirty to thirty-five years of age, and five women, whereof
two might be from thirty to forty, two more not above four or
five and twenty, and the fifth, a tall, comely maiden, about six-
teen or seventeen: the women were well-favoured agreeable
persons, both in shape and features, only tawny,- and two of
them, had they been perfect white, would have passed for very
handsome women, even in London itself, having very pleasant
agreeable countenances, and of a very modest behaviour, especially
when they came afterwards to be clothed and dressed, as they
called it, though the dress was very indifliarent, it must be con-
fessed; of which hereafter.

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our
Spaniards, who were (to give them a just character) men of the
best behaviour, of the most calm sedate tempers, and perfect
good-humour that ever I met with; and, in particular, of the
most modesty, as will prwently appear. 1st the sight was very
uncouth, to see three naked men, and five naked women, all
together bound, and in the most miserable circumstances that
human nature could be supposed to be, viz. to be expecting
every moment to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked
out, andthentobeeatenuplikeamlfthatiskilledfora
dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday:
father, to go in, andseefirst ifhe knewany ofthem; and then, if
heunderstood any oftheir speech: as soon astheoldmaneame
in, he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them; neither
could any of them understand a word he said, or a sign he could
make, except one of the women.

However, this was enough to answer the end, which was to
satisfy them, that the men intowhose hands theywere fallen,
were Chrisfians; that they abhorred eating of men or woman,

R2
and that they might be sure they would not be killed: as soon
as they were assured of this, they discovered such ajoy, and by
such awkward and several ways, as is hard to describe; for it
seems they were of several nations.

The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid, in the next
place, to ask them if they were willing to be servants, and to
work for the men who had brought them away, to save their
lives? At which they all fell a dancing; and presently one fell
to taking up this, and another that, any thing that lay next, to
entry on their shoulders, to intimate that they were willing to
work.

The governor who found that the having the women among
them would presently be attended with some inconveniency, and
might occasion some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three
men, what they intended to do with these women, and how
they intended to use them, whether as servants, or as women?
One of the Englishmen answered very boldly and readily, that
they would use them as both. To which the governor said,- I
am not going to restrain you from it; you are your own masters
as to that: but this I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and
quarrels among you, and I desire it of you for that reason only,
viz. that you will all engage, that if any of you take any of these
women, as a woman, or wife, that he shall take but one; and
that, having taken one, none else should touch her; for though
we cannot marry any of you, yet it is but reasonable, that while
you stay here, the woman any of you bakes, should be maintain-
ed by the man that takes her, and should be his wife; I mean,
says he, while he continues here; and that none else shall have
any thing to do with her. All this appeared so just, that every
one agreed to it without any difliculty.

Then the Englirfim asked the Spaniardr, if they designed to
take any of them? But every one of them answered, No: some
of them said they had wives in Spain; and the others did not
like women that were not iChristians; and all together declared,
that they would not touch one of them; which was an instance
of such virtue as I have not met with in all my travels; on the
other hand, to be short, the five Englirlzm took them every one
awife; that is to say, a temporary wife; andsotheysetup a
new form of living; for the Spaniard: and Friday's father lived
in my old habitation, which they had enlarged exceedingly with-
in; the three servants, which they had taken in the late battle
of the savages lived with them; and these carried on the main
part of the colony, supplying all the rest with food, and assist-
ing them in any thing as they could, or as they found necessity
required.

- But the Wonder of this story was, how five such refractory,
ill-matched fellows should agree about these women, and that
two of them should not pitch upon the same woman, especially
seeing two or three of them were, without comparison, more
agreeable than the other: but they took a good way enough to
prevent quarrelling among themselves: for they set the five wo-
men by themselves in one of their hum, and they went all into
the other hut, and drew lots among them who should choose
first.

He that drew to choose first, went away by himself to the
hut, where the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her
he chose; and it was worth observing, that he that chose first,
took her that was reckoned the homeliest, and the oldest of the
five, which made mirth enough among the rest: and even the
Spaniard: laughed at it: but the fellow considered better than
any of them, that it was applieation and business, that they were
tourpectassismncein,asmuchasanythingelse; andshe
proved the best wife of all the pared.

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and
fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned
upon them again, and they firmly believed that they were. now
going to be devoured: accordingly, when the Englirh sailor
came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most
lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took their leave of her
with such agonies and such affection, as would have grieved the
hardest heart in the world; nor was it possible for the English-
men to satisfy them that they were not to be immediately mur-
dered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's father, who
instantly let them know, that the five men who had fetched them
out one by one, had chosen them for their wives.

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was
a little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniard: came and
helped them; and, in a few hours, they had built them every one
a new hut or tent for their lodging apart; for those they had
already were crowded with their tools, household stuff, and
provisions. The three wicked ones had pitched farthest off;
and the two honest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of
the island, so that they continued separated as before: and thus
my island was peopled in three places, and, as I might say, three
towus were begun to be planted.

And here it is very well worth observing, that as it often happens
in the world (what the wise ends of GOD'S providence are in such
a disposition of things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had
the two worst wives; and the three reprobates, that were scarce
worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed
born to do themselves good or any one else, had three clever,
diligent, careful, and ingenious wives; not that the two first
were ill wives as to their temper or humour; for all the five were
most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected creatures, rather like
slaves than wives; but my meaning is, they were not alike capa-
ble, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat.

Another observation I must make, to the honour of a diligent
application on one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful, negli--
gent, idle temper on the other, that when I me to the place, and
viewed the several improvements, planting, and management of
the several little colonies, the two men had so far outgone the
three, that there was noeomparison: they had indeed both of
themasmuch ground laidout for corn as they wanted; andthe
reason was, because, according to my rule, nature dictated, that
it wasto no purposeto sow morecornthantheywanted; but the
difference of the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and
indeed ofevery thing else,waseasytobe wen at firstview.

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about
their huts, that when you came to the place nothing was to be
seen but a wood; and though they had twice had their plantation
demolished, once by their own countrymen, and once by the
enemy, as shall be shewn in its place, yet they had restored all
again, and every thing was thriving and flourishing about them:
they had grapes planmd in order, and managed like a vineyard,
though they had themselves never seen any thing of that kind:
and by their good ordering their vines, their grapes were as good
again as any of the others. They had also found themselves
out a reflect in the thickest part of the woods, where, though
there was not a natural cave, as I had found, yet they made one
with incessant labour of their hands, and where, when the mis-
chief which followed happened, they secured their wives and
children, so as they could never be found; they having, by
sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood, which, as I
said, grew so easily, made the wood unpasable, except in'one
place, where they climbed up to get over file outside part, and
then went in by ways of their own leaving.

As to the three reprobates, as I justly all them, though they
were much civilized by their new settlement compared to what
they were before, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the
same opportunity, yet one of the certain companions of a profli-
gatemindnever leftthem,andthatwastheir idleness. It istrue
they planted corn; and made fences; but Salom': words were
never better verifiedthan in them. '" I went by the 'vinqard of
the slathful, and it was all aver-grown with tharn: ,- " for when the
Spaniard: me to view their crop, they could not see it in some
places for weeds; the hedge had several gaps in it, where the
wild goats had got in and eaten up the corn; perhaps here and
there a dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for the pre~
sent, but it was only shutting the stable door after the steed was
stolen; whereas, when they looked on the colony of the other
two, there was the very face of industry and success upon all
they did; there was not a weed to be seen in all their corn, or a
gap in any of their hedges; and they, on the other hand, veri-
fied Salomon": words in another place, " That the diligent hand
make: rich ;" for every thing grew and thrived, and they had
plenty within and without; they had more tame cattle than the
other, more utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet more
pleasure and diversion too.

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly
within doors; and having learned the English ways of dressing
and cooking from one of the Englishmen, who, as I said, was
cook's mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands' vic-
tuals very nicely and well ; whereas the other could not be brought
to understand it; but then the husband, who, as I say, had been
cook's mate, did it himself; but, as for the husbands of the three
wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught fish
and birds: in a word, any thing but labour, and they fared ac--
cordingly. The diligent lived well and comfortable; and the
slothful lived hard and beggarly; and so I believe, generally
speaking, it is all over the world.

But I now come to a scene different from all that had hap-
pened before, either to them or me; and the original of the story
was this.

Early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes of
Indians, or savages, call them which you please; and there is no
room tofidoubt they came upon the old errand of feeding upon
their slaves; but that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards,
and to our men too, that they did not concern themselves about
it, as I did; but, having been made sensible by their experience,
that their only business was to lie concealed, and that, if they
were not seen by any of the savages, they would go off again
quietly, when their business was done, having as yet not the
least-notion of there being any inhabitants in the island; I say,
having been made sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to -
give notice to all the three plantations to keep within doors, and
not to shew themselves; only placing a scout in a proper place,
to give notice when the boats went to sea again.

This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled
all these measures, and made it known among the savages, that
they were inhabitants there; which was, in the end, the desola-
tion of almost the whole colony. After the eanoes with the
savages were gone off, the Spaniard: peeped abroad again, and
some of them had the curiosity to go to the place where they
had been, to see what they had been doing. Here, to their
great surprise, they found three savages left behind, and lying
fast asleep upon the ground; it was supposed they had either
been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they
were asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or they
were wandered into the woods, and did not come back in time
to be taken in.

The Spaniard: were greatly surprised at this sight, and per-

fectly at a loss what to do: the Spaniard governor, as it hap-
' pened, was with them, and his advice was asked; but he pro-
fessed he knew not what to do: as for slaves, they had enough
already; and as to killing them, they were none of them in--
' dined to that; the Spaniard governor told me they could not
think of shedding innocent blood; for as to them the-poor crea--
tures had done them no wrong, invaded none of their property;
and they thought they had no just quarrel against them to take
away their lives.

And here I must, in justice to thwe Spaniards, observe, that
let the accounts of Spanirlz cruelty in Maxim and Peru be what
they will, I never met with seventeen men, of any nation what-
soever, in any foreign country, who were so universally modest,
temperate, virtuous, so very good--humoured, and so courteous,
as these Spaniards; and, as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in
their very nature; no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous
passions, and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit.

Their temper and almneas had appeared in their bearing the
unsufferable usage of the three Englishmen; and their justice and
humanity appeared now in the ease of the savages, as above:
after some consultation, they resolved upon this, that they would
lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these three men might be
gone; but then the governor Spaniard recollecwd that the three
savages had no boat; and that if they were left to rave about
the island, they would certainly discover that there were inhabi-
tants in it, and so they should be undone that way.

Upon this they went back again, and there lay the fellows fast
asleep still; so they resolved to waken them, and take them
prisoners; and they did so: the poor fellows were strangely
frighted when they were seized upon and bound, and afraid, like
the women, that they should be murdered and eaten; for, it
seems those people think all the world does as they do, eating
men's flesh; but they were soon made easy as to that; and
away they carried them.

It was very happy to them, that they did not carry them home
to their castle; I mean to my palace under the hill; but they
carried them first to the bower, where was the chief of their
country work; such as the keeping the goats, the planting the
com, &c. and afterwards they carried them to the habitation of
the two Englishmen.

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had
for them to do: and whether it was by negligence in guarding
them, or that they thought the fellows could not mend them-
selves, I know not, but one of them run away; and, taking into
the woods, they could never hear of him more.

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon
after in some other boats or canoes of savages, who came on
shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their
revels as usual, went of again in two days time: this thought
terrified them exceedingly; for they concluded, and that not
without good cause indeed, that if this fellow got safe home
among his comrades, he would certainly give them an account
that there were people in the island, as also how weak and few
they were; for this savage, as I observed before, had never been
told, and it was very happy he had not, how many they were, or
where they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any
of their guns, much less had they shewn him any of their other
retired places, such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat
which the two Englishmen had made, and the like.

The first testimony they had, that this fellow had given intel--
ligence of them was, that about two months after this, six canoes
of savages, with about seven or eight, or ten men in a canoe,
C3111: rowing along the north side of the island, where they never
used to come before, and landed about an hour after sun-rise, at
a convenient place, about a mile fiom the habitation of the two
Englishmen, where this escaped man had been kept: as the Spa--
. niard governor said, had they been all there, the damage would -
not have been so much, for not a man of them would have

eseaped: but the case differed now very much; for two men to
fiftywas too much odds: the two men had the happiness to dis-

' cover them about a league off, so that it was above an hour he-
' fore they landed, and as they landed a mile from their huts, it
was some time before they could come at them. Now having
great reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first thing they
did was to bind the two slaves which were left, and cause two of ,
the three men, who they brought with the women, who, it seems,
proved very faithful to them, to lead them with their two wives,
and whatever they could any away with them, to their retired
place in the woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to
bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard farther.

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore,
and that they bent their course directly that way, they opened
the fences where their milch~goats were kept, and drove them all
out, leaving their goats to Straggle into the woods, whither they
pleased, that the savages might think they were all bred wild;
but the rogue who came with them was too cunning for that, and
gave them an account of it all; for they Went directly to the
place. When the two poor frighted men had secured their
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three,
who came with the women, and who was at their place by acci-
dent, away to the Spaniard: with all speed, to give them the
alarm, and desire speedy help; and in the mean time they took
their arms, and what ammunition they had, and retreated towards
the place in the wood where their wives were sent, keeping at a
distance; yet so that they might see, if possible, which way the
savages took.

They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground, they
could see the little army of their enemies come on directly to
their habitation, and' m a moment more could see all their huts
and household-stuff flaming up together, to their great grief and
mortification; for they had a very great loss, to them irretriev-
able, at least for some time. They kept their station for awhile,
till they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves
all over the place, rummaging every way, and every place they
could think of, in search for prey; and, in particular, for the
people, of whom it now plainly appeared they had had intelli-
gence.

The two Englirhm mag this, drinking themselves not
secure where they stood, as it was likely some of the wild people
might come that way, so they might come too many together,
thought it proper to make another retreat about half a mile far-
ther, believing, as it afterwardshappened, thatthe fartherthey
strolled, the fewer would be together.

The next halt was at the enhance into a very thick grown
part ofthewoods, andwhereanold trunkofa tree stood,which
was hollow, and vastly large; and in this tree they both took
their standing, resolving to see what might offer.

They had not stood there long, but two of the savages ap-
peared running directly thatway, as ifthey hadalreadyhad
notice where they stood, and were coming up to attach them;
and a little way farther they spied three more coming after them,
and five more beyond them, all coming the same way; besides
which, they saw seven or eight more at a distance running another
way; for, in a word, they ran every way, like sportsmen beating
for their game.

The poor men were now in great perplexity, whether they
should stand, and keep their posture, or fly; but after avery
short debate with themselves, they considered, that if the savages
ranged the country thus, before help esme, they might, perhaps,
find out their retreat in the woods, and then all would be lost;
so they resolved to standthem there; andifthere were too
many to deal with, then they would get to the top of the tree,
I from whence they doubted not to defend themselves, fir: excepted,
as long as their ammunition lasted, though all the savages that
were landed, which was near fifty, were to attack them.

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they
should fireat the first two, orwait for the three, and so take the
middle party; by which the two and the five that followed would
be separated; and they resolved to let the two first pass by,
unless they should spy them in the tree, and cometo attack
them. Thetwofirstsavagesalsoconfimredtheminthisre--
gulation, by turning a little than them towards another part
of the wood; but the three, and the five after them, came for-wards directly to the tree, as if they had known the Englirhmen

were there.

Seeing them come so straight towards them, they resolved to
take them in a line as they me; and as they resolved to fire
but one at a time, perhaps the first shot might hit them all
three; to which purpose, the man who was to fire, put three or
four small bullets into his piece, and having a fair loophole, as
it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, with-
out being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty yards
of the tree, so that he could not miss.

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they
plainly saw that one of the three was the run-away savage that
had escaped from them, and they both knew him distinctly, and
resolved that, if possible, he should not escape, though they
should both fire; so the other stood ready with his piece, that
if he did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to have a.
' second.

But the first was too good a marksman to miss his aim; for,
as the savages kept near one another, a little behind in a line, in
a word, he fired, and hit two of them directly: the foremost was
killed outright, being shot in the head; the second, which was
the run away Indian, was shot through the body, and fell, but
was not quite dead: and the third had a little scratch in the
shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that went through the body
of the second; and being dreadfully frighted, though not much
hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a
hideous manner.

The five that were behind, more frighted with the noise than
sensible of the danger, stood still at first; for the woods made
the saund a thousand times bigger than it really was; the echoes
rattling from one side to another, and the {owls rising from all
parts, screaming and making, every sort, a several kind of noise,
according to their kind, just as it was when I fired the first gun
that,perhaps,wasevershoto&'inthatplacesinoeitwasan
island. -

Howaer, all being silent again,and they not knowing what
the matter was, came on unconcerned till they came to the place
where their companions lay, in a condition miserable enough;
and here the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were
within reach of the same mischief, stood all of a huddle over the
wounded man, talking, and, as may be supposed, inquiring of
him how he earne to be hurt: and who, 'tis- very rational to be--
lieve, told them that a flash of fire first, and immediately after
that, thunder from their gods, had killed those two, and wounded
him. This, I say, is rational; for nothing is more certain than
that, as they saw no man near them, so they had never heard a
gun in all their lives, or so much as heard of a gun; neither
knew they any thing of killing or wounding at a distance, with
fire and bullets; if they had, one might reasonably believe, that
they would not have stood so unconcerned, in viewing the fate
of their fellows, without some apprehension of their own.

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved
them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who at the
same time had no notion of their danger; yet, having them all
thus in their power, and the first having loaded his piece again,
resolved to let fly both together among them; and singling out
by agreement which to aim at, they shot together, and killed, or
very much wounded, four of them; the fifth, frighted even "to
death, though not hurt, fell with the rest; so that our men, see.
ing them all fall together, thought they had killed them all.

The belief that the savages wereall killed, madeour two men
come boldly out fi'om the tree before they had charged their
guns again,whichwas a wrong step; and theywere under some
surprise, when they came to the place, and found nodess than
four of the men alive, and of them, two very little hurt, and one
' not at all :' this obliged them to fall upon-them with the stocks
of their musquets; and first, they made sure of the run-away
savage, that had been the cause of all the mischief; and of am-
ther that was hurt in his knee, and put them out of their pain;
thenthemanthatwasnothurtatallwneandkneeleddownto
them, with his two hands held up, and made piteous moans to
them by gestures and signs, for his life; but could not say one
Word to them that they could understand.

However, they signed to him to sit down at the foot of a
tree thereby; and one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope-
twine, which he had by great chance in his pocket, tied his two
feet fast together, and his two hands behind him, and there they
left him; and, with what speed they could, made after the other
two which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of them,
should find the way to their covered place in the woods, where
their wives and the few goods they had left lay : they came once
in sight of the two men, but it was at a great distance; ever,
they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley, towards
the sea, the quite contrary way from that which led to their re-
treat, which they were afraid of; and, being satisfied with that,
they went back to the tree where they left their prisoner, who,
as they supposed, was delivered by his comrades; for he was
gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had
bound him, lay just at the foot of the tree.

They Were now in as great a concern as before, not knowing
what course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in
what numbers; so they resolved to go away to the place where
theirwiveswere,tosee ifallwaswellthere,andtomakethem
easy, who were in fright enough to be sure; for though the
savages were their own country folk, yet they were most terribly
afraid of them, and perhaps the pore, for the knowledge they
had of them.

When they me there, they found the savages had been in the

for they had attempted to carry their dead men away, and had
dragged two of them a good way, but had given it over; from
thence they advanced to the first rising ground, where they .had
stood and saw their camp destroyed, and where they had the
mortification still to see some of the smoke; but neither could
they here see any of the savages: they then resolved, though
with all possible caution, to go forward towards their ruined
plantation; but a little before they came thither, coming in sight
of the sea--shore, they saw plainly the savages all embarking
again in their canoes, in order to be gone.

They seemed sorry at first; and there was no way to come at
them, to give them a parting blow; but, upon the whole, were
very well satisfied to be rid of them.

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their
improvement destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help
them rebuild, and to assist them with needful supplies. Their
three countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least
inclination to do any good, yet, as soon as they heard of it. (for
they, living remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till all
was over), came and offered their help and assistance, and did very
friendly work for several days, to restore their habitation, and
make necessaries for them; and thus, in a little time, they were
set upon their legs again.

About two days after this, they had the farther satisfaction of
seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore, and at
some distance from them, two drowned men; by which they had
reason to believe, that they had met with a storm at sea, and
had overset some of them; for it had blown very hard the very
night after they went off.

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand,
enough'of them escaped to inforhl the rest, as well of what they
had done as of what had happened to them; and to whet them
on to another enterprise of the same nature, which they, it seems,
resolved to attempt, with sufieient force to carry all before them;
for, exth whatthefirstman had told themofinhabitann, they
could say little to it of their own knowledge, for they never saw
one man, and the fellow being killed that had afirmed it, they
had no other witness to confirm it to them.

It was five or six months after this, before they heard any
more of the savages, in which time our men were in hopes they
had either forgot their former bad luck, or given over the hopes
of better, when, on a sudden, they were invaded with a most
formidable fleet, of no less than eight and twenty unoes full of
savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden
swords, and such like engines of war; and they brought such
numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into the
utmost consternation.

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost
side of the island, our men had that night to consult and consider
what to do; and in the first place, knowing that their being en-
tirely concealed was their only safety before, and would much
more be so now, while the number of their enemies was so great,
they therefore resolved first of all, to take down the huts which
were built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to
the old eave; beeause they suppomd the savages would go
directly thither, as soon as itwas day, to play the old game over
again, though they did not now land within two leagues of it.

In the next place, they drove awayall the flock of goats they
had atthe old bower, asI called it, which belongedto the Spain'-
ards; and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants any
where as was possible: and the next morning early they posted
themselves with all their force, at the plantation of the two men,
andwaitfor their coming. As they gamed, so it happened;

could judge. Our army was but small indeed; but, that which
was worse, they had not arms for all their number neither. The
whole account, it seems, stood thus. First as to men.
17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.
1 Old I'i'iday, or Friday': father.
3 The three slaves, taken with the women, who proved
very faithful.
3 Other slaves who lived with the Spaniard:.

To arm these they had
11 Musquets.
5 Pistols.
3 F owling pieces.
5 Muskets, or fowling pieces, which were taken by me
from the mutinous seamen who 1 reduced.

9. Swords.
3 Old halberts.

To their slaves they did not give either musquet or fusil, but
they had every one a halbert, or a long staff, like a quarter staff,
with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his
side a hatchet : also every one of our men had hatchets. Two
of the women could not be prevailed upon, but they would come
into the fight; and they had bows and arrows, which the Spani-
ard: had taken from the savages, when the first action happened,
which I have spoken of, where the Indian: fought with one
another; and the women hatchets too. .

The Spaniard governor, who I have described so often, com-
manded the whole; and Wm. dtkim', who, though a dread-
ful fellow for wickedness, was a most daring bold fellow, com-
manded under him. The savages came forward like lions, and
our men, which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in
their situation; only that Will Atkins, who now proved a most
useful fellow, with six men, was planted just behind a small
thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let the
first of them pass by, and then fire into the middle of them; and,
as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat as nimbly as he could,
round a part of the wood, and so come in behind the Spaniard:
where they stood, having a thicket of trees also before them.

When the savages came on, they run straggling about every
way in heaps, out of all manner of order; and IV. Atkins let
about fifty of them pass by him; then, seeing the rest come in a
very thick throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having
loaded their musquets with six or seven bullets a-piece, about as
big as large pistol bullets. How many they killed or wounded,
they knew not; but the consternation and surprise was inexprev
sible among the savages, they were frighted to the last degree,
to hear such a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others
hurt, but see nobody that did it; when in the middle of their
fright, W'. Atkins, and his other three, let fly again among the
thickest of them; and in less than a minute, the other three
being loaded again, gave them a third volley.

Had W'. Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as
they had fired, as they were ordered to do; or had the rest of
the body been at hand to have poured in their shot continually, the
savages had been efi'ectually routed; for the terror that was
among them came principally from this; viz. That they were
killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, and could see
nobody that hurt them; but IV. Atkins, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat; some of the savages, who were at a
distance, spying them, came upon them behind; and though
Atkins and his men fired at them also, two or three times, and
killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they could, yet they
wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow Englishmen
with their arrows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of
the Indian slaves who me with the women ; this slavewas a most
gallant fellow, and fought most desperately, killing five of them
with his own hand, having no weapon but one of the armed
staves, and a hatchet.

. Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two
other men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood; and
the Spaniards, after firing three vollies upon them, retreated also;
for their number was so great, and they were so desperate, that
though above fifty of them were killed, and more than so many
wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of
danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it w observed,
that their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, were made
outrageous by their wounds, and fought like madmen.

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the
Englishman, that was killed, behind them; and the savages, when
they came up to them, killed them over again in a wretched
manner, breaking their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs,
and wooden swards, like true savages. But, finding our men
were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but drew them-
selves up in a kind of a ring, which is, it seems, their custom;
and shouted twice, in token of their victory; after which, they had
the mortification to see several of their wounded men fall, dying
with the mere loss of blood.

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up
together, upon a rising ground, Atkiur, though he was wounded,
would have had him marched, and charged them again all to-
gether at once ; .but the Spaniard replied, Seignior Atkins, you
see how their wounded men fight; let them alone till morning;
all these wounded men will be stifi" and sore with their wounds,
and faint with the loss of blood; and so we shall have the fewer
to engage.

The advice was good; but Will AIR>>: replied merrily, That
is true, Seignior, and so shall I too; and that is the reason I
would go on, while I am warm. Well Seignior Atkins, says the
Spaniard, you have behaved gallantly, and done your part; we
will fight for you, if you cannot come on; but I think it best to
seaytill morning; sothey waited.

But as it was a clear moon-light night, and they found the
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men, and
a great hurry and noise among them where they lay, they after-
wards resolved to fall upon them in the night, especially if they
could come to give them but one volley before they were dis-
covered, which they had a fair opportunity to do; for one of the"
two Englishmen, in whose quarter it was where the fight began,
led them round between the woods and the seaside, westward,-
and then turning short south, they came so near where the
thickest of them lay, that before they were seen or heard, eight
of them fired in among them; and did dreadful execution upon
them; in half a minute more eight others fired after them,-
pouring in their small shot in such a quantity, that abundance
were killed and wounded; and all this while they were not able
to see who hurt them, or which way to fly.

The Spaniard: charged again, with the utmost expedition, and
then divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved to fall in
among them all together: they had in each body eight persons;
that is to say, twenty--four, whereof were twenty-two men, and
two women, who, by the way, fought desperately.

They divided the fire arms equally in ach party, and so of
the halberts and saves. They would have had the women keep
back; but they said, they were resolved to die with their hus-
bands. Having thus formed their little army, they marched out
from among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy,
shouting and hallooing as loud as they could; the savages stood
all together, but were in the utmost oonfimion, hearing the noise
of our men shouting from three quarters together; they would
have fought if they had seen us; and, as soon as we came near
enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Frida}
was wounded, though not dangerously. But our men gave them
no time; but, running up to them. fired among them three
ways, and then fell in with the but--ends of their musquets, their
swords, armed staves and hatchets; and laid about them so well,
that, in a word, they set up a dismal screaming and howling,
flying to save their lives which way soever they could.

Our men were tired with the execution ; and killed, or mor--
tally wounded, in the two fights, about 180 of them; the rest
being frighted out of their wits, scoured through the woods, and
over the hills, with all the speed fear and nimble feet could help
them to do; and as we did not trouble ourselves much to pur-
sue them, they got all together to the sea-side, where they landed,
and where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an
end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from
the sea-ward; so that it was impossible for them to go off; nay,
the storm continuing all night, when the tide came up, their
canoes were most of them driven by the surge of the sea so high
upon the shore, that it required infinite toil to get them off; and
some of them were even dashed to pieces against the beach, or
against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest that
night: but having refreshed themselves as well as they could,
they resolved to march to that part of the island where the
savages were fled, and see what posture they were in. This
necessarily led them over the place where the fight had been,
and where they found several of the poor creatures not quite
deed, and yet past recovering life; a sight disagreeable enough
to generous minds ; for a truly great man, though obliged by the
law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his misery.

However, there was no need to give any orders in this use;
for their own savages, who were their servants, dispatched those
poor creatures with their hatchets. .

At length they came in view of the place where the more
miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where there appeared
about 100 still; their posture was generally sitting upon the
ground, with their knee up towards their mouth, and the head
put between the two hands, leaning down upon the knees. '

. When our men came within two musquet shot of them, the
Spaniard governor ordered two musquets to be fired without hall,
to alarm them; this he did, that by their countenance he might
know what to expect, viz. Whether they were sun in heart-to
fight, or were so heartily beaten, as to be dispirited and discou-
raged, and so he might manage accordingly.

This stratagem took; for, as soon as the savages heard the
first gun, and saw the flash of the mud, they started up upon
their feet in the greatest consternation imaginable; and, as our
men advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and
yawling away, with a kind of a howling noise, which our men
did not understand, and had never heard before; and thus they
run up the hills into. the country.

At first, our men had much rather the weather had been calm,
and they had all gone away to sea; but they did not then' eonsi'
der, that this might probably have been the oceasibn of their
coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least,
to come so many and so often, as would quite desolate the island,
and starve them. Will Atkins therefore, who, notwithstanding.
his wound, kept always with them, proved the best counsellor in
this case; hisadvice was, to take the advantage that-offered, and
clap in between them and their boats, and so deprive them of the

capacity of ever returning any more to plague the island.
They consulted long about this, and some were against it, for

fear of' making the wretches fly into the woods, and live there
desperate"; and so' they should have them to hunt like wild
beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business, and have their
plantations continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and,
in short, be reduced to a life of continual distress. ,-
Will Atkim told them, they had better have to do with 100
men, than with 100 nations; that as they must destroy their
boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed
themselves. In a word, he shewed them the necessity of it so
plainly, that they all came into it; so they went to work imme-
diately with the boats, and, getting some dry wood together
from a dead tree, they tried to set some of them on fire; but
they were so wet, that they would not burn. However, the fire
so burned the upper part, that it soon made them unfit for
swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw what they
were about, some of them came running out of the woods, and
coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled down and
cried, 04, 0a, Waramoleoa, and some other words of their lan--
guage, which none of the others understood any thing of; but
as they made pitiful gestures, and strange noises, it was easy to
understand they begged to have their boats spared, and that they
would be gone, and never come there again.

But our men were now satisfied that they had no way to pre-
serve themselves, or to save their colony, but effectually to pre-
vent any of these people from ever going home again; depend-
ing upon this, that if ever so much as one of them got back into
their country to tell the story, the colony was undone; so that
letting them know that they should not have any mercy, they fell
to work with their canoes, and destroyed them every one that the
storm had not destroyed before ; at the sight of which, the
savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our people
heard plain enough; after which they ran about the island like
distracted men ; so that, in a word, our men did not really know
at first what to do with them.

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider that
while they made those people thus desperate, they ought to have
kept good guard at the same time upon their plantations; for
though it is true they had driven away their cattle, and the In--. mn'xi
diam did not find out their main retreat, I mean my old castle
at the hill, nor the eave in the valley; yet they found out my
plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the'
fences and planting about it; trod all the corn under foot; tore
up the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe; and did to
our men an inestimable damage, though, to themselves, not one
farthing worth of service.

Though our men Were able to fight them upon all occasions,
yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up
and down; for as they were too nimble of foot for our men when
they found them single, so our men durst not go about single,
for fear of being surrounded with their numbers; the best was,
they had no weapons; for though they had bows, they had no
arrows left, nor any materials to make any, nor had they any
edged tool or weapon among them.

The extremity and distress they were reduced to was great,
and indeed deplorable; but at the same time our men were also
brought to very bad circumstances by them; for though their
retreats were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and
their harvest spoiled; and what to do, or which way to turn
themselves, they knew not ; the only refuge they had now was,
the stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some
little corn which grew there, and the plantation of the three
Englishmen, W'ill Atkins and his comrades, who were now reduced
to two, one of them being killed by an arrow, which struck him
on the side of his head, just under the temples, so that he never
spoke more; and it was very remarkable that this was the same
barbarous fellow who cut the poor savage slave with his hatchet,
and who afterwards intended to have murdered all the Spaniards.

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than
mine was at any time after I first discovered the grains of barley
and rice, and got into the manner of planting and raising my
corn, and my tame cattle; for now they had, as I may say, a

s 2
hundred wolves upon the island, which would devour every
thing they could come at, yet could very hardly be come at
themselves.

The first thing they concluded, when they saw what their cir-
cumstances were, was, that they would, if possible, drive them
up to the farther part of the island, south-west, that if any more
savages came on shore, they might not find one another; then,
that they would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as many of
them as they could come at, till they had reduced their number;
and if they could at last tame them, and bring them to any
thing, they would give them com, and teach them how to plant,
and live upon their daily labour.

In order to this, they so followed them, and so terrified them
with their guns, that in a few days, if any of them fired a gun at
an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down for fear;
and so dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of
sight, farther and farther, till at last our men, following them,
and every day almost killing or wounding some of them, they
kept up in the woods and hollow places so much, that it reduced
them to the utmost misery for want of food; and many were
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any hurt, but
merely starved to death.

When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and
pity moved them: especially the Spaniard governor, who was a
most gentlemanly generous minded man as ever I met with in
my life; and he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive,
and bring him to understand what they meant, so far as to be
able to act as interpreter, and to go among them, and see if they
might be brought to some conditions, that might be depended
upon, to save their lives, and do us no spoil.

It was some while before any of them could be taken; but
being weak, and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised,
and made a prisoner; he was sullen at first, and would neither
eat not drink; but finding himself kindly used, and victuals
given him, and no violence ofi'ered him, he at last grew tract-
able, and came to himself.

They brought old Frida)V to him, who talked often with him,
and told him how kind the other would be to them all; that
they would not only save their lives, but would give them a part
of the island to live in, provided they would give satisfaction,
that they would keep in their own bounds, and not come beyond
it, to injure or prejudice others; and that they should have corn
given them, to plant and make it grow for their bread, and some
bread given them for their present subsistence; and old Friday
bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of his countrymen, and
see what they said to it; assuring them, that if they did not
agree immediately they should be all destroyed.

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in num-
ber to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the first
offer, and begged to have some food given them; upon which
twelve Spaniard: and two Englishmen, well armed, with three
Indian slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place where they
were; the three Indian slaves carried them a large quantity of
bread, some rice boiled up to takes, and dried in the sun, and
three live goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of a
hill, where they sat down, eat the provisions very thankfully, and
were the most faithful fellows to their words that could be
thought of; for, except when they came to beg victuals and
directions, they never came out of their bounds; and there they
lived when I came to the island, and I went to see them.

They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread, breed
tame goats, and milk- them; they wanted nothing but wives, and
they soon would have been a nation: they were confined to a
neck of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them, and lying
plain towards the see. before them, on the south-east corner of
the island; they had land enough, and it was very good and-
fruitful; they had a piece of land about a mile and half broad,
three or four mile in length.

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I made
for myself; and gave them among them twelve hatchets, and
three or four knives; and there they lived the most subjected
innocent creatures that ever were heard of.

After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with respect
to the savages, till I came to re--visit them, which was above two
years; not but that now and then some canoes of savages came
on shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts; but as they were
of several nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of those that
came before, or the reason of it, they did not make any search
or inquiry after their countrymen; and if they had, it would
have been very hard to have found them out.

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that hap-
pened to them, to my return, at least, that was worth notice.
The Indian:, or savages, were wonderfully civilized by them, and
they frequently went among them; but forbid, on pain of death,
any one of the Indian: coming to them, because they would not
have their settlement betrayed again.

One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they taught the
savages to make wicker work, or baskets; but they soon out-
did their masters; for they made abundance of most ingenious
things in wicker-work; particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves,
bird-cages, cupboards, 8:. as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds,
couches, and abundance of other things, being very ingenious at
such work, when they were once put in the way of it.

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we
furnished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick-axes,
and all things of that kind which they could want.

With the help of these tools they were so very handy, that
they came, at last, to build up their hubs, or houses, very hand-
somely; raddling, or working it up like basket-work all the Wayround,which was a very eitraordinary piece of ingenuity, and
looked very odd; but was an exceeding good fence, as well
againsthestasagainstallsortsofvermin; and ourmen wereso
taken with it, that they got the wild savages to come and do the
like for them; so that when I mine to see the two Englirlmex':
colonies, they looked, at a distance, as if they lived all like bees
in a hive; and as for IV. Atkins, who was now become a very
industrious, necessary, and sober fellow, he had made himself
such a tent of basket-work, as I believe was never seen. It was
no paces round in the outside, as I measured by my steps; the
walls were as close worked as a basket, in pannels or squares, of
thirty-two in number, and very strong, standing about seven foot
high: in the middle was another not above twenty-two paces
round, but built stronger, being eight square in its form, and in
the eight corners stood eight very strong posts, round the top of
which he laid strong pieces, pinned together with wooden pins,
from which he raised a pyramid for a roof of eight rafters, very
handsome, I assure you, and joined together very well, though
he had no nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he made him--
self too, out of the old iron that I had left there; and indeed,
this fellow shewed abundance of ingenuity in several things which
he had no knowledge of; he made him a forge, with a pair of
wooden bellows to blow the fire; he made himself charcoal for
his work, and he formed out of one of the iron crows a middling
good anvil to hammer upon; in this manner he made many
things, but especially hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hinges.
But to return to the house; after he had pitched the roofofhis
innermost tent, he worked it up between the rafters with basket-
work, so firm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously with
rice straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the
tOprthathishousewnsasdryas ifit hadbeentiledorslated.
Indwd he owned that the savages made the basket--work for him.

The outer circuitwas covered, as a, lean-to, all round this
inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the two and thirty
angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about twenty
foot distant; so that there was a space like a walk within the
outer wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty foot wide.

The inner place he partitioned of? with the same wicker-work,
but much fairer, and divided it into six apartments, so that he
had six rooms on a floor, and out of every one of these there was
a door; first, into the entry, or coming into the main tent; and
another door into the space or walk that was round it; so that
walk was also divided into six equal parts,which served not only for
reueat, but to store up any necessaries which the family had occa-
sion for. These six spaces not taking up the whole circumference,
what other apartments the outer circle had, were thus ordered:
as soon as you were in at the door of the outer circle, you had
a short passage straight before you to the door of the inner
house; but on either side was a wicker partition, and a door in
it, by which you went, first, into a large room or store-house,
twenty foot wide, and about thirty foot long, and through that
into another not quite so long: so that in the outer circle was
ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come at through
the apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets or retiring
rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle: and four
large warehouses or barns, or what you please to call them,
which went in through one another, two on either hand of the
passage that led through the outer door to the inner tent.

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the
world; nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so i
built: in this great bee-hive lived the three families; that is to
say, IV. Atkim, and his companion; the third was killed, but
his wife remained with three children; for she was, it seems, big
with child when he died ; and the other twa were not at all back-
ward to give the widow her full share of every thing, I mean, as.
to their corn, milk, grapes, 69's. and when they killed a kid, or
foundaturtleonthediore; sothatthey all livedwell encugh,
though it was true, they were not so industrious as the other two,
as has been observed already.

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that, a for reli-
gion, I don't know that there was any thing of that kind among
them; they pretty often, indeed put one another in mind, that there
was a Goo, by the very common method of seamen, viz. swearing
by his name; nor were their poor, ignorant savage wives much'
the better for having been married to Christians, as we must call
them; for as they knew very little of Goo themselves, so they
were utterly incapable of entering into any discourse with their
wives about a Gob, or to talk any thing to them concerning
religion.

The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the wives
hadmadefromthem,was,that theyhad taughtthem to speak
English pretty well; and all the children they had, which 'was
near twenty in all, were taught to speak English too, from their
first learning to speak, though they at first spoke itinavery
broken manner, like their mothers. There Were none of these
children above six year old when I came thither; for it was not
much above seven year that they had fetched these five savage
ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitful, for they had
all children, more or less. I think the cook's mate's wife was
big of her sixth child; 'and the mothers were all a good sort of
well governed, quiet, laborious women, modest and decent,
helpful to one another, mighty observant and Subject to their
masters, I cannot call them husbands; and wanmd nothing but to
be well instructed in the Christian religion, and to be legally mar-
tied; both which were happily brought about afterwards by my
means, or, at least, in consequence of my coming among them.

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and
pretty much of my five runagate Englishmen, I must say some-
thing of the Spaniardr, who were the main body of the family;
and in whose story there are some incidents also remarkable
enough.

I had a great many discourses with them about their circum-
stances, when they were among the savages : they told me
readily, that they had no instances to give of their application or
ingenuity in that country; that they were a poor, miserable,
dejected handful of people; that ifmeans had been put into their
hands, they had yet so abandoned themselves to despair, and so
sunk under the weight of their misfortunes, that they thought of
nothing but starving. One of them, a grave and very sensible
man, told me, he was convinced they were in the wrong; that it
was not the part of wise men to give up themselves to their
misery, but always to take hold of the helps which reason offered,
as well for present support, as for future deliverance; he told
me, that grief was the most senseless, insignifieant passion in the
world; for that it regarded only things past, which were gene-
rally impossible to be recalled or to be remedied, but had no
view to things to come, and had no share in any thing that
looked like deliverance, but rather added to the amiction than
proposed a remedy; and upon this he repeated a Spanish pro-
verb; which, though I cannot rcpeat in just the same words
that he spoke it in, yet I remember I made it into an English
proverb of my own, thus:

In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouele <<hailed.

He run on then in remarks upon all the little improvements I
had made in my solitude, my unwearied applieation, as he called
it, and how I had made a condition, which, in is circumstances,
was at first much worse than their's, a thousand times more
happy than their's was, even now, when they were altogether : he
told me, it was remarkable that Englishmen had a greater presence
of mind in their distress, than any people that ever he met with;
that their unhappy nation, and the Portuguese, were the worst men
in the world to struggle with misfortunes; for that their first step
in dangers, after the common efforts were over, was always to
despair, lie down under it and die, without rousing their thoughts
up to proper remedies for escape.

I told him, their case and mine differed exceedingly; that
they were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without sup-
ply of food, or of prment sustenance, till they could provide:
that it is true, I had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I was
alone: but then the supplies I had providentially thrown into my
hands, by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore, was such
a help as would have encouraged any creature in the world to
have applied himself as I had done. Seignior, says the Spaniard,
had we poor Spaniard: been in your ease, we should never have
gotten half those things out of the ship as you did: nay, says he,
we should never have found means to have gotten a raft to carry
them, or to have gotten the raft on shore without boat or sail;
and how much less should we have done, said he, if any of us
had been alone; Well, I desired him to abate his compliment,
and go on with the history of their coming on shore where they
landed. He told me, they unhappily landed at a place where
there were people without provisions; wheres, had they had the
common sense to have put of to sea again, and gone to another
island a little farther, they had found provisions, though without
people; there being an island that way, as they had been told,
where there was provisions, though no people; that is to say,
that the Spaniard: of Trinidad had frequently been there, and
had filled the island with goats and hogs at several times;
where they have bred in such multitudes, and where turtle and
sea fowls were in such plenty, that they could ha' been in no
want of flesh, though they had found no bread; whereas here
they were only sustained with a few roots and herbs, which they
understood not, and which had no substance in them, and which
the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough, and who could
treat them no better, unless they would turn mnnibals, and eat
men's flesh, which was the great dainty of their country.

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to
civilize the savages they were with, and to teach them rational
customs in the ordinary way of living; but in vain; and how
they retorted it upon them, as unjust, that they who came there
for assistance and support, should attempt to set up for instruct-
ors of those that gave them bread: intimating, it seems, that
none should set up for the instructors of others, but those who
could live without them.

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were
driven to; how sometimes they were many days without any
food at all; the island they were upon being inhabited by a sort
of savages that lived more indolent, and, for that reason, were
less supplied with the necessaries of life, than they had reason to
believe others were in the same part of the world; and yet they
found that these savages were less ravenous and voracious, than
those who had better supplies of food.

Also they added, that they could not but see with what
demonstrations of wisdom and goodness, the governing Provi-
dence of Goo directs the events of things in the world; which,
they said, appeared in' their circumstances; for if, pressed by the
hardships they were under, and the barrennees of the country
where they were, they had searched after a better place to live in,
they had then been out of the way of the relief that happened to
them by my means.

They then gave me an account, how the savages, who they
lived among, expected them to go out with them into their wars;
and it was true, that, as they had fire-arms with them, had they
not had the disaster to lose their ammunition, they should not
have been serviceable only to their friends, but have made
themselves terrible both to friends and enemies; but being
without powder and shot, and yet in a condition, that they could
not in reason deny toga out with their landloids'totheir wars;
so when they earns into the field of battle, they were in a worse
condition than the savages themselvs; for they neither had
bows or arrows, nor could they use those the savages gave them;
so that they could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded
with arrows, till they me up to the teeth of their enemy; and
then, indwd, the three balberts they had were of use to them;
and they would often drive a whole little army before them,
with those halberts and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of
their musquets: but that for all this, they were sometimes sur--
rounded with multitudes, and in great danger from their arrows;
til] at last, they found the way to make themselves large targets
of wood, which they covered with skins of wild beasts, whose
names they knew not; and these covered them from the arrows
of the savages; that, notwithstanding these, they were some.
times in great danger, and were once five of them knocked
down together, with the clubs of the savages, which was the
time when one of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spam;
ard who I had relieved : that at first they thought had been killed,
but when afterwards they heard he was taken prisoner, they
were under the greatest grief imaginable, and would willingly
have all ventured their lives to have rescued him.

They told me, that when they were so knocked down, the
rest of their company rescued them, and stood over them fight-
ing, till they were come to themselves, all but him who they
thought had been dead; and then they made their way with their
halbert and pieces, standing close together in a line, through a
body of above a thousand savages, beating down all that eame
in their way, got the victory over their enemies, but to their
great sorrow, because it was with the loss of their friend; who
'the other party finding him alive, earried of? with some others,
as I gave an account in my former.

They dacribed most afl'ectio'nately, how they were surprised
with joy at the return of their friend and compflon in misay,
who they thought had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst
kind, viz. by wild men; and, yet how more and more they were
surprised with the account he gave them of this errand, and that
there was a Christian in any place near, much more one that was
able, and had humanity enough to contribute to their deliverance.

They described how they were astonished at the sight of the
relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of bread, things
they had not seen since their coming to that miserable place;
how often they crossed it and blessed it as bread sent from
heaven; and what a reviving cordial it was to-their spirits to
taste it; as also, of the other things I had sent for their supply.

And, after all, they would have told me something of the joy
they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them
away to the person and place from whence all these new com-
forts came; but they told me, it was impossible to express it-by
words; for their excessive joy, naturally driving them to unbe-
coming extravagances, they had no way to describe them, but by
telling me, that they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to
give vent to their passion, suitable to the sense that was upon
them; that in some it worked one way, and in some another;
and that some of them, through a surprise of joy, would burst
out into tears; others be stark mad, and others immediately
faint. This discourse extremely affected me, and called to my
mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his father, and the poor peo-
ple's ecstasy, when I took them up at sea, after their ship was on
fire; the mate of the ship's joy, when he found himself delivered
in a place where he expected to perish; and my own joy, when
after twenty-eight years' captivity, I found a good ship ready to
carry me to my own country.

All these things made me more sensible of the relation of those
poor men, and more afi'ected with it.

Having thus given a'view of the state of things, as I foundor 11031me Causes. 429

them, I must relate the heads of what I did for these people, and
the condition in which I left them. It was their opinion,
and mine too, that they would be troubled no more with the
E savages; or that, if they were, they would be able to cut them of,
iftheywere twice as many as before; so they had no concern
about that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with the
Spaniard, who I called governor, about their stay in the island;
for as Iwas not come to earry any of them off, so it would not
bejust to wry off some, and leave others, who perhaps would
be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished.

On the other hand, I told them, I came to establish them
there, not to remove them; and then I let them know, that I had
brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them. That I had
been at a great charge to supply them with all things necessary,
as well for their convenience as their defence; and that I had
such and such particular persons with me, as well to increase and
recruit their number, as by the particular necessary employments
:- which they were bred to, being artificers, to assist them in those
things, in which, at present, they were to seek.
, Theywere all together when I talked thus to them; and

before I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked
them, one by one, if they had enfircly forgot and buried the
first animosities that had been among them, and would shake
hands with one another, and engage in a strict friendship, and
union of interest, that so there might be no more misunderstand-
ings or jealousies.

Will Atkinr, with abundance of frankness and good-humour,
said, They had met with afflictions enough to make them all
f sober, and enemies enough to make them all fi-iends. That, for
' his part,he would live and diewith them; andwasso' far fiom
designing any thing against the Spaniards, that, he owned, they
had done nothing to him but what his own mad humour made
necessary, and what he would have done, and, perhaps much
worse, in their case: and that he would ask them pardon, if I
desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he had done to
them; and was very willing and desirous of living on terms of
entire friendship and union with them; and would do any thing
that lay in his power to convince them of it: and as for going
to England, he cared not if he did not go thither this twenty
years. '
The Spaniard: said, they had, indeed, at first, disarmed and
excluded Will Atkins, and his two countrymen, for their ill
conduct, as they had let me know. And they appealed to me,
for the necessity they were under to do so; but that Will Atkins
had behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they had with
the savages, and on several occasions since, and had showed him--
self so faithful to, and concerned for the general interest of them
all, that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought he
merited as much to be trusted with arms, and supplied with neces-
saries, as any of them; and that they had testified their satisfaction
in him, by committing the command to him, next to the governor
himself; and as they had an entire confidence in him, and all
his countrymen, so they acknowledged, they had merited that
confidence, by all the methods that honest men could merit to'
be valued and trusted: and they most heartily embraced the occa-

sion of giving me this assurance, that they would never have any
interest separate from one another.

Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we
appoian the next day to dine all together; and indeed we
made a splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate
to come on shore, and dress our dinner; and the old cook's
mate we had on shore aSSisted. We brought on shore six
pieces of good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's
provision, with our punch bowl, and materials to fill it; and in
particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten
bottles of English beer; things that neither the Spaniards, or
the Englishmen, had tasmd for many years; and which, it may
be suppowd, they were exceeding glad of.

The Spanmrd: added to our feast five whole kids, which the'
cooks roasted; and three of them were sent covered up close, on
board the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat
from on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on board.

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I
brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, that there might be
no dispute about dividing, I shewed them that there was suffi--
cient for them all; desired, that they might. all take an equal
quantity of the goods that were for wearing; that is to say,
equal when made up. As, first, I distributed linen sufficient to
make every one of them four shirts; and, at the Spaniard':
request, afterwards made them up six; these were exceeding
comfortable to them, having been what, as I may say, they had
long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them.

I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before,
to make every one a light coat, like a frock, which I judged
fittest for the heat of the season, cool and loose; and ordered,
that whenever they decayed, they should make more, as they
thought fit. The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, and hats, fit.

I eannot express what pleasure, what satisfacu'on, sat upon
the countenances of all these poor men, when they saw the are
I had taken of them, and how well I had fumishcd them: they
told me, I was a father to them; and that, having such a cor-
respondent as I was, in so remote a part of the world, it would
make them forget that they were left in a desolate place; and
they all voluntarily engaged to me, not to leave the place with-

out my consent. .
V - Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me;
, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of
them most necessary people; but above all, my general artificer,
than whom they could not nanne any thing that was more useful
to them; and the sailor, to shew his concern for them, went to
work immediately, and with my leave, made them every one a
shirt the first thing he did; and, which was still more, he taught
the women not only how to sew and stitch, and use the needle,
but made them assist to make the shirts for their husbands, and
for all the rest.

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they
were, for they took in pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things,
and made them clever, convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cup-
boards, lockers, shelves, and every thing they wanted of that
kind.

But, to let them see how nature made artificers at first, I ar-
ried the carpenters to see W'ill Atkim': basket-house, as I called
it; and they both owned, they never saw an instance of such
natural ingenuity before ; nor any thing so regular, and so handily
built, at least of its kind: and one of them, when he saw it,
after musing a good while, turning about to me, I am sure, says
he, that man has no need of us; you need do nothing but give
him tools.

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave
every man a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no
harrows or ploughs; and, to every separate place, a pick--axe, a
crow, a broad-axe, and a saw; always appointing, that as often
as any was broken, or worn-out, they should be supplied, with-
out grudging, out of the general stores that I left behind.

Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, Chisels, knives, scissars, and
all sorts of tools and iron-work, they had without tale, as they
required; for no man would care to take more than they wanted;
and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them, on any
account whatever. And for the use of the smith, I left two
ton of unwrought iron for a supply.

My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought them,
was such even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at
them; for now they could march as I 'used to do, with' amuse.
huet upon each shoulder, if there was occasion; and were able
to fight 1,000 savages, if they had but some little advantages
of situation; which also they could not miss of, if they had
oceasion. ' '
' Icarricd on shore with me the young man whose mother was
starved to death, and the maid also; she was a sober, well-edu-
eated, religious young woman, and behaved so inoEensively,
that every one gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an
unhappy life with us, there being no woman in the ship but
herself; but she bore it with patience. After a while, seeing
things so well ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon
my island, and considering that they had neither business or ac-l
quaintance in the East Indies, or reason for taking so long a
voyage; 'I say, considering. all this, both of them mine to me,
and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island,
and be entered among my family, as they ealled it. '
Iagreedtoitreadily; and theyhadalittle platofground
allotted to them, where they had three tents or houses set up,
surrounded with a basket-work, palisado'd like Atkins's, adjoin-
ing to his plantation ;' their tents were contrived so, that they
had each ofthem a room, a part to lodge in, and a middle tent,
like a great store--house, to lay all their goods in, and to eat and
drink in. And now the other two Englishmen removed their
habitation to the same place; and so the island was divided into
three colonies, and no more; viz. The Spaniards, with old
Friday, and the first servants, at my old habitation under the
hill, which was, in a word, the capital city, and where they had
soenlargedand extendedtheirworks,aswellunderasonthe
outside of the hill, that they lived, though perfectly concealed;
yetfullatlarge. . Neverwasthere suchalittleeityinawood,
andsohid,lbelieve, inanypartoftheworld. Forlverilyt
believe, 1,000 men might have ranged theisland a Mod,
1'
if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked on
purpose for it, they would not have found it; for the treesstood
so thick, and so close, andgrew so fast matted into one another,
that nothing but cutting them down first could discover the
place, except the only two narrow entrances where they went in
and out, could be found; which was not very easy. One of
them wasjust down at the water edge of the creek; and it was
afterwards above zoo yards to the place; and the other was up
the ladder at twice, as I have already formerly described it; and
they had a large wood, thick planted, also on the top of the hill,
which contained above an acre, which grew apace, and covered
the place from all discovery there, with only one narrow place
between two trees, not easy to be discovered, to enter on that
side.

The other colony was that of W'. Atkins's, where there were
four families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with
their wives and children; three savages, that were slaves, the
widow and children of the Englishman that was killed; the
young man and the maid; and, by the way, we made a wife
of her also, before we went away. There was also the two car-
penters and the sailor, who I brought with me for them; also
the smith, who was a very necessary man to them, especially as

.a gunsmith, to take care of their arms; and my other man, who
I called 7m qf all trader; who was in himself as good almost
as twenty men, for he was not only a very ingenious fellow, but
a very merry fellow; and, before I went away, we married him
to the honest maid that came with the youth in the ship, I men-
tioned before.

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say
something of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with me
out of the ship's crew, who I took up at sea. It is true, this >
man was a Roman, and perhaps, it may give oflhnce to some
hereafter,-if I leave any thing elmaordinary upon record, of a
man, who, before I begin, I must (to set him out in just colours)
represent in terms very much to his disadvantage, in the account
I of Protestants; as first, that he was a Papist; secondly, a Popish
priest; and, thirdly, a French Popish priest.

But justice demands of me to give him a due character; and
I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious
person; exact in his life, extensive in his charity, and exemplar
in almost every thing he did. What, then, can any one say
against my being very sensible of the value of such a man, not-
withstanding his profession? Though it may be my opinion,
perhaps, as well as the opinion of others, who shall read this,
that he was mistaken.

The first hour that I began to converse with him, after he
had agreed to go with me to the East India, I found reason to
delight exceedingly in his conversation. And he first began with
me about religion, in the most obliging manner imaginable.

.- , Sir, says he, you have not only, under Goo (and at that he
-, crossed his breast) saved my life, but you have admitted me to
i go this voyage in your ship, and by your obliging civility, have

,4 taken me into your family, giving me an opportunity of free

 

conversation. Now, Sir, says he, you see by my habit what
my profession is; and I guess by your nation, what your's is:
I may think it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my ut-
most endeavours, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I an to
the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic doc-
trine; but, as I am here under your permission, and in your
family, I am bound in justice to your kindness, as well as in
decency and good manners, to be under your government; and
therefore I shall not, without your leave, enter into any debates
on the point of religion, in which we may not agree, farther
than you shall give me leave.
Itoldhim,hiscarriagewa5somodest, thatlcouldnotbut
acknowledge it; that it was true, we were such people as they-
call benefits; but that he was not the first Catholic that I had
conversed with, without falling into any inconveniences, or care
tying the questions to any height in debate; that he should nOt
find himself the worse used for being of a different opinion from
us; and if we did not converse without any dislike on either
side, upon that score, it should be his fault, not ours.

He replied, That he thought all our conversation might be
easily separated from disputes; that it was not his business to'.
cap principles with every man he discoursed with; and that he
rather desired me to converse with him as a gentleman, than as
a religieux: that if I would give him leave, at any time, to dis
course upon religious subjects, he would readily comply with it;
and that then he did not doubt but I would allow him also to
defend his own opinions, as well as he could: but that, without
my leave, he would not break in upon me with any such thing.

He told me farther, that he would not cease to do all that
became him in his office, as a priest, as well as a private Christian,
to procure the good of the ship, and the safety of all that was
in her; and though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and
he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray for us,
which he would do upon all occasions. In this manner we con-
versed; and as he was of a most obliging gentlemahlike beha-
viour, so he was, if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good
sense, and, as I believe, of great learning.

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the
many extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which had
befallen him in the few years that he had been abroad in the
world, and particularly this was very remarkable, viz. That in
the voyage he was now engaged in, he had had the misfortune
to be five times shipped and unshipped, and never to go to the
place whither any of the ships he was in were at first designed.
That his'first intent was, to have gone to Martinito'; and that
he Went on board a ship bound thither at St. .Maloe; but being
forced into Lisbon by bad Weather, the ship received some da-
mage, by running aground in the mouth of the river Tagtu, and
was obliged to unload her cargo there. That finding a Portu-
guese ship there, bound to the Madeira: and ready to sail, and
supposing he should easily meet with a vessel there bound to
Mrtinieo, he went on board, in order to sail to the Madeira,-
but the master 'of the Partugrme ship, being but an indifferent
'mariner, had been out in his reckoning, and they drove to Fial;
where, however, he happened to find a very good market for
his cargo, which was com; and therefore resolved not to go to
the Mdeirar, but to load salt at the Isle 9/" M], to go away to
Newfoundland. He had no remedy in the exigence, but to go
with the 'ship; and had a pretty good voyage as far as the Bank:
(so they all the place where they catch the fish), where meet;
ing with a French ship bound from France to Queeec, in the
river of Canada, and from thence to Mrlinico, to carry previ--
sions, he thought he should have an opportunity to complete
his first design. But when he me to Quebec, the master of
._; the ship died, and the ship proceeded no farther. So the next
' '1 voyage he shipped himself for France, in the ship that was burnt,
when we took them up at sea, and then shipped with us for the
'East Indies, as I have already said. Thus he had been disap-
pointed in five voyages, all, a: I may call it, in one voyage, besides
what I shall have oceasion to mention farther of the same person.
. But I shall not make digressions into other men's stories,
which have no relan'on to my own. I return to what concerns
our affair in the island. He mine to me one moming,.for he
lodged among us all the while we were upon the island; and it
happened to bejust'when I was going to visit the Englishmen':
colony, at the farthest part of the island; I Jay, he came to me,
and told me, with a very grave countenance, that he had, for
two or three days, desired an opportunity of some discourse with
me, which, he hoped, should not be displeasing to me, beans:
he thought it might, in some measure, correspond with my ge-
neral design, which was the prosperity of my new colony; and,
perhaps, might put it, at least more than he yet thought it was,
in the way of Gon's blessing.

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse;
and turning a little short, How, Sir, said I, can it be said, that
we are not in the way of Goo's blessing, after such visible as-
sistances, and wonderful deliverances, as we have seen here, and
of which I have given you a large account ?

If you had pleased, Sir, said he, (with a world of modesty,
and yet with great readiness) to have heard me, you would have
found no room to have been displeased, much less to think so
hard of me that I should suggest, that you have nOt had won-
derful assistances and deliverances. And, I hope, on your
behalf, that you are in the way of GOD'S blessing, and your
design 18 exceeding good, and will prosper. But, Sir, said he,
though it were more so, than is even possible to you, yet there
may be some among you that are not equally right in their
actions. And you know, that in the story of the children'of
Israel, one Achan, in the camp, removed Goo's blessing from
them, and turned his hand so against them, that six and thirty
of them, though not concerned in the crime, were the object of
divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that punishment.

I was sensibly touched with his discourse; and told him his
inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere,
and was really so religious in its own nature, that I was very
sorry I had interrupted him; and begged him to go on. And,
in the mean time, because it seemed, that what we had both to
say, might take up some time, I told him I was going to the
Englishmen' s plantations, and asked him to go with me, and we
might discourse of It by the way. He told me, he would more
willingly wait on me thither, because there, partly, the thing
was acted, which he desired to speak to me about. So we
walkedon,anderessedhinitobefreeandplainwithme,in
what he had to say.

Why then, Sir, says he, be pleased to give me leave to lay
down a few propositions, as the foundation of what I have to
say, that we may not difi'er in the general principles, though we
may be of some differing opinions in the practice of particulars.
First, Sir, though we difi'er in some of the doctrinal articles of
religion, and it is very unhappy that it is so, especially in the
case before us, as I shall shew afterwards; yet there are some
general principles in which we both agree; viz. First, that there
is a Goo, and that this Goo, having given us some stated ge-
neral rules for our service and obedience, we ought not willingly
and knowingly to offend him, either by neglecting to do what
he has commanded, or by doing what he has expressly forbidden;
and let our difi'erent religions be what they will, this general
principle is readily owned by us all. That the blessing of Goa
I; does not ordinarily follow a presumptuous sinning against his
command; and every good Christian will be afi'ectionately con-
;ccmedtopreventanythatareunder his carelivinginatotal
neglect of Goo and his commands. It is not your men being
' Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of such, that discharges
me from being concerned for their souls, and from endeavour-
ing, if it lies before me, that they should live in as little distance
from, and enmity with their Maker as possible; especially if you
give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit.

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I
granted all he had said; and thanked him, that he would so far
concern himself for us; and begged he would explain the par-
ticulars of what he had observed, that, like full", (to take his
own parable) I might put away the accursed thing from us.

Why then, Sir, says he, I will take the liberty you give me;
and there are three things, which, ifI am right, must stand in
the way of Gods blessing upon your endeavours here, and
which I should rejoice, for your sake, and their own, to see re-
moved. And, Sir, says he, I promise myself that you will fully
agree with me in them all, as soon as I name them; especially,
because I shall convince you, that every one of them may, with
great ease, and very much to your satisfaction, be remedied.

He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities, but went
on. First, Sir, says he, you have here four Englishmen, who
have fetched women from among the savages, and have taken
them as their wives, and have had many children by them all,
and yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner,
as the laws of Goo and man require; and therefore are yet, in
the sense of both, no less than adultererr, and living in adultery.
To this, Sir, my: 11:, I know you will object, that there was no
clergyman, or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to per-
form the ceremony: nor any pen and ink, or paper, to write
down a contract of marriage, and have it signed between them.
And I know also, Sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you;
I mean of the agreement that he obliged them to make when
they took these women, viz. That they should chuse them out
by consent, and keep separately to them; which, by the way,
is nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the women as
wives, but only an agreement among themselves, to keep them
from quarrelling.

But, Sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so he
called it, being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual consent
of the parties to take one another a: man and wife, but in the
formal and legal obligation that there is in the contract, to com-
pel the man and woman, at all times, to own and acknowledge
each other; obliging the men to abstain from all the other wo-
men, to engage in no other contract while these subsist; and on
all occasions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for them, and
their children; and to oblige the women to the same, or like con-
ditions, mutati: mutandir, on their side.
Now, Sir, {my} 11:, these men may, when they plase, or when
" occasion presents, abandon these women, disown their children,
leave them to'p'erish,'and take other women, and marry them
while these are living. And here he added, with some warmth,

: How, Sir, is Goo honoured in this unlawful liberty? And how
'7 shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place, however
" good in themelver, and however sincere in your design, while these
men, who at pment are your subjects, under your absolute 'go-
vernment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in open
adultery ?
, I confess, I was struck at the thing itself, but much more with
;.- the convincing arguments he supported it with: for it was oer-
tainly true, that though they had no clergyman on the spot, yet
a formal contract on both sides, made before wimmes, and con-
firmed by any token, which they had all agreed to be bound by,
though it had been but breaking a stick between them, engaging
3' the men to own these women for their wives upon all occasions,

= and never to abandon them or their children, and the women to

i the same with their husbands, had been an effectual lawful mar-
riage inthe sight ofGoo; and it was a great neglect that it was
not done.

But I thought to have gotten off with my young priest, by
telling him, that all that part was done when I was not here;
and they had lived so many years with them now, that if it was
an adultery, it was past remedy; they could do nothing'in it
now.

Sir, :4]: lie, askingjaur pardon for me}: freedom, you are right
in this; that it being done in your absence, you could not be
charged with that part of the crime. But I beseech you, flatter
not youmelf that you are not therefore under an obligation to do
your uttermost now to put an end to it. How can you think,
but that, let the time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt, for
the future, will lie entirely upon you? Bemuse it is certainly'in
T 2
your power now to put an end to it; and in nobody's'power but
your's.

v I was so dull still, that I did not take him right; but I ima-
gined, that, by putting an end to it, he mean'd, that I should
part them, and not suffer them to live together any longer; and
I said to him, I could not do that by any means, for that it would
put the whole island into confusion. He seemed surprised that
I should so far mistake him. No, Sir, my: Ize, I do not mean
that you should now separate them, but legally and efi'ectually
marry them now. And as, Sir, my way of marrying. may not
be so easy to reconcile them to, though it will be as effectual,
even by your own laws; so your way may be as well before
-GOD, and as valid among men; I mean, by a written contract,
signed by both man and woman, and by all the witnesses pre-
sent; which all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid.

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity
of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse, as to
his own party or church, and such true warmth for the preserv-
ing people that he had no knowledge of, or relation to ; I say,
for preserving them from transgressing the laws of GOD; the
like of which I had indeed not met with any where.. But re-
collecting what he had said of marrying them by a written con-
tract, which I knew would stand too, I returned it back upon
him, and told him, I granted all that he had said to bejust, and,
on his part, very kind; that I would discourse with the men upon
the point now, when I came to them. And I knew no reason
why they should scruple to let him marry them all; which I
knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid
in England, as if they weremarried by one of our own clergy.
men. What was afterwards done in this matter, I shall speak
of by itself.

I then pressed him to tell me, what was the second canplaim
which he hadto make; acknowledging, that I was very much
his debtor for tlte first; and thanked him heartily for it. He

told me he would use the same freedom and plainness in the
' second; andhoped Iwouldtake it aswell: and thiswas, that
notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, a: he. called them,
L had lived with those women for almost seven years, had taught
them to speak English, and even to read it; and that they were,
as he perceived, women of tolerable understanding, and eapable
of insnucfion; yet they had not to this- hour taught them any
thing of the Christian religion; no, not so much to know that
there was a Goo, or a worship, or in what manner GOD was to
be served; or that their own idolatry, and worshipping they

knew not who, was false and absurd.
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and what GOD

' would certainly call them to account for; and, perhaps, at last
take the work out of their hands. He spoke this very aEec-
tionately and warmly. I am persuaded, my: be, had those men
lived in the savage country, whence their wives came, the savages
=2 would have taken more pains to have brought them to be idola-
ters, and to worship the devil, than any of these men, :0 far a:
f" he could see, had taken with them, to teach them the knOwledge
of the true-Goo. Now, Sir, said 11:, though I do not acknow-
ledge your religion, or you mine, yet we should be glad to see
the devil's servants, and the subjects of his kingdom, taught to
know the general principles of the Christian religion; that they
might at least hear of GOD, and of a Redeemer, and of the resur~
rection, and of a future state, things which we all believe; they
had at least been so muchnearer coming into the bosom of the
true church, than they are now, in the public profession of idolatry,
and devil-worship. '

I couldhold nolonger; I tookhim inmyarms,andembraced
himwithanexcess ofpassion: Howfar,saidltohim,havel
been from understanding the most essential part of a Christian,
viz. to love the interest of the Christian church, and the good of
other men's souls! I scarce have known what belongs to being a
Christian. 0, Sir, do not say so, replied be: this thing is not
your fault. No, said I, but why did I never lay it to heart as
Well as you? 'Tis not too late yet, said he; be not too forward
to condemn yourself. But what can be done now? said I; you
see I am going away. Will you give me leave, said he, to talk
with those poor men about it? Yes, with all my heart, said I;
and will oblige them to give heed to what you say too. As to
that, said lie, we must leave them to the mercy of Christ; but 'tis
our business to assist them, encourage them, and insn'uct them;
and, if you will give me leave, and GOD his blessing, I do not
doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought home into
the great circle of Christianity, if not into the particular faith that
we all embrace ; and that even while you stay here. Upon this,
I said, I shall not only give you leave, but give you a thousand
thanks for it. What followed on this account I shall mention
also again in its place.

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to
blame : Why really, says he, 'tis of the same nature, and I will
proceed (asking your leave) with the same plainness as before: It
is about your poor savages, who are (as I may say) your con~
quered subjects. It is a maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be
received among all Christians, of what church, or pretended
church soever, viz. the Christian knowledge ought to be propaga-
ted by all possible means, and on all possible occasions. It is on
this principle that our church sends missionaries into Persia, In-
dia, and China,- and that our clergy, even of the superior sort,
willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and the most
dangerous residence, among murderers and barbarians, to teach
them the knowledge of the true Goo, and to bring them over to
embrace the Christian faith. Now, Sir, you have such an oppor-
tunity here, to have six or seven-and-thirty poor savages brought
over from idolatry to the knowledge of Goo, their Maker and
Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an occasion of do-
' ing good; which is really worth the expense of a man's whole life;
"- Iwas now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say:
.131 had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for GOD and religion
3 before me, let his particular principles be of what kind soever.
. As for me, I had not so much as entertained a thought of this 1n
I my heart before; and, I believe, should not have thought of it;
for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and people, who, had
. we any work for them to do, we would have used as such, or
- would have been glad to have transported them to any other part
of the world; for our business was to get rid of them; and we
'_ would all have been satisfied, if they had been sent to any coun-
' try, so they had never seen their own. But, to the rare : I say,
. I was counfounded at his discourse, and knew not what ansWer
5, to make him. He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some
-. disorder: Sir, say: he, 1 shall be very sorry, if what I have said
gives you any offence. No, no, my: I, I am offended with no--
:body but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to
think that I should-never take any notice of this before, but with
reflecting what notice I am able to mke of it now. You know,
.1 Sir, said I, what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East
'3 Indies in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it would
be an unsufi'erable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the
men lying all this while at victuals and wages upon the owner's
account; it is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here; and
if I stay more, I must pay 31. :terling per diem demurrage; nor
can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more; and I have
i been here thirteen days already; so that I am perfectly unable
to engage in this work, unless I would sufi'er myself to be left
, behind here again ; in which case, if this single ship should mis-
earry in any part of her voyage, I should be just in the same
condition that I was left in here at first; and from which I have
been so wonderfully delivered.446 ers Anvovsn-runrs

He owned the ease was very hard upon me as to 'my voyage;
but laid it home upon my conscience, whether the blessing of
saving seven-and-thirty souls was not worth my venturing all I
had in the world for? I was not so sensible of that a: he was:
I returned upon him thus: Why, Sir, it is a valuable thing in--
deed, to be an instrument in Goo's hand, to convert seven--and--
thirty hathens to the knowledge of Christ; but as you are an
ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work, so that it seems
naturally to fall into the way of your profession, how is it that
you do not rather ofl'er yourself to undertake it, than press me
to it?

Upon this he faced about, just before me, as we walked along,
and, putting me to a full stop, made me a very low how. I
most heartily thank GOD, and you, Sir, say: 11:, for giving me so
evident a call to so blessed a work; and if you think yourself
discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will most
readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and
difficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met
with, that I may be dropped at last into so glorious a work.

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face, while he spoke this
to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his colour
came and went, as if he had been falling into fits: in a word, he
wasfired with the joy of being embarked in such a work. I
paused a considerable while before I could tell what to say to
him; for I was really surprised to find a man of such sincerity
and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of
men, not of his profession only, but even of any profession what-
soever: but, after I had considered it a while, I asked him seri-
ously, if he was in earnest, and that he would venture, on the
single consideration of an attempt on those poor people, to be
locked up in an unplanted island for, perhaps, his life, and at
last, might not know whether he should be able to do them any.
good or not? .
'- Heturned short upon me, and asked me, what I ealled a yen?
ture? Pray, Sir, mid 11:, what do you think I consented to go
in your ship to the East Indie: for? Nay, said I, that I know
not, unless it was to preach to the'Indidm'. Doubtless'it was,
said he. And do you think, if I an convert these seven-and;
thirty men to the faith of Christ, it is not worth my time, though
I should never be fetched ofl' the island again? Nay, is it not
infinitely of more worth to save so many souls, than my life is,
or the life of twenty more of the same profession? Yes, Sir,
say: he, I would give Christ and the Blessed Virgin thanks all
my days, if I could be made the least happy instrument of saving
the souls of these poor men, though I was never to set my foot
of of this island, or see my' native country any more: but since
you will honour me, says he, with putting me into this work
(for which I will pray fir you all the day: if my life), I have one
humble petition to you, said he, besides. What is that? said I.
Why, says he, it is, that you will leave your man Friday with
me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me; for, without
some help, I cannot speak to them, or they to me.

a I was sensibly u'oubled at his requesting Friday, beenuse I
could not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons:
he had been the companion of my travels; he was not only faith-
ful to me, but sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had
resolved to do something considerable for him, if he out-lived
me, as it was probable he would: then I knew, that as I had bred
Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite confound him, to
bring him to embrace another profession; and he would never,
while his eyes were open believe, his old master was a heretic,
and would be damned; and this might in the end ruin the poor
fellow's principles, and so turn him to his first idolatry.

. However, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it
wasthis: Itoldhim,I oouldnotsaythat Iwaswillingmpart
with Friday, on any account whatever; though a work, that to
him was of more value than his life, ought to be to me of much
more value than the keeping or parting with a servant. But,
on the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no
means consent to part with me; and I could not force him to it,
without his consent, without manifest injustice; bemuse I had
promised I would never put him away ; and he had promised
and engaged to me that he would never leave me, unless I put
him away.

He seemed very much concerned at it; for he had no rational
access to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one
word of their language, nor they one word of his. To remove
this difficulty, I told him, Friday's father had learned Spanish,
which I found he also understood; and he should serve him
for an interpreter: so he was much better satisfied, and nothing
could persuade him but he would stay to endeavour to convert
them; but Providence gave another and very happy turn to all
this.

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When
we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together; and
after some account given them of what I had done for them, 'viz.
what necessary things I had provided for them, and how they
were distributed, which they were very sensible of, and very
thankful for; I began to talk to them of the scandalous life they
led, and gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman
had already taken of it; and, arguing how unchristian and irre-
ligious a life it was, I first asked them if they were married men
or bachelors? They soon explained their condition to me, and
shewed me that two of them were widowers, and the other three
were single men or bachelors. I asked them, with what consci-
ences they could take these women, and lie with them, as they
had done, all them their wives, and have so many children by
them, and not be married lawfully to them?

They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz. that there
was nobody to marry them; that they agreed before the gover-
nor to keep them as their wives, and to keep them, and own
them, as their wives; and they thought, as things stood with them,
theywere as legally married as ifthey had been married bya
parson, and with all the formalities in the world.

. l I told them, that no doubt they were married in the sight of
Goo, and were bound 'in conscience to keep them as their wives;
but that the laws of men being otherwise, they might pretend
they were not married, and so desert the poor women and chil-
dren hereafter; and that their wives, being poor desolate wo-
men, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to help them-
selves. I therefore told them, that unless I was assured of their
honest intent, I could do nothing for them; but would take care,
that what I did should be for the women and their children,
without them; and that unless they would give some assurances
that they would marry the women, I could not think it was con-

, venient they should continue together as man and wife; for that

. it was both scandalous to men, and offensive to GOD, who they

could not think would bless them, if they went on thus.
All this went on as I expected; and they told me, especially
W'ill Atkins, who seemed now to speak for the rest, that they

"loved their wives as well as if they had been born in their own

native country, and would not leave them upon any account
whatever; and they did verily believe their wives were as virtu-
ous and as modest, and did, to the utmost of their skill, as much
for them, and for their children, as any women could possibly
.do; and they would not part with them on any account. And
JViIl Atkim, for his own particular, added, if any man would
take him away, and offer to carry him home to England, and

'make him captain of the best man of war in the navy, he would
.not go with him, if he might not carry his wife and children with

him; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would be

~married_to her now with all his heart.
This was just as I would have it; the priest was not with me
at that moment, but was not far of. So, to fly him farther, I
told him I had a clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere,I
would have him married the next morning ; and bid him consi-
der of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he
need not consider of it at all; for he was very ready to do it,
and was glad I had a minister with me; and he believed they
would be all willing also. I then told him, that my friend, the
minister, was a Frenchman, and could not speak English; but
that I would act the clerk between them. He never so much as
asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant; which was in-
deed what I was afraid of. But, I say, they never inquired about

1
a

it. So we parted. I went back to my clergyman; and W?" ;

Alkin: went in to talk with his companions. I desired the

French gentleman not to say any thing to them till the business =

was thorough ripe; and I told him what answer the men had
given me.

Before I went from their quarter, they all mine to me, and
told me, they had been considering what I had said; that they

were very glad to hear I had a clergyman in my company; and -

they were very willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, and
to be formally married as soon as I pleased; for they were far
from desiring to part with their wives; and that they meant no--
thing but what was very honest, when they chose them : so I
appointed them to meet me the next morning ; and that, in the
mean time, they should let their wives know the meaning of the
marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent any scandal,
but also to oblige them, that they should not forsake them,
whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the meaningof the
thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had
reason to be; so they failed not to attend all together, at my
apartment, the next morning, where I brought out my clergy-
' man: and though he had not on a minister's gown, after the
a, manner of England, or the habit of a priest, after the manner of
v France,- yet having a black vest, something like a mssock, with
a sash round it, he did not look very unlike a minister; and as
for his language, I was his interpreter.

But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the scruples
he made of marrying the women, because they were not baptized,
and professed Chrim'am, gave them an exceeding reverence for
his person; and there was no need after that to inquire whether
he was a clergyman or no.

Indeed Iwas afraid his scruple would have been carried so far,
as that he would not have married them at all: nay, notwith-
., standing all I was able to say to him, he resisted me, though
'f modestly, yet very steadily; and at last, refused absolutely to
: marry'them, unless he had first talked with the men, and the
women too; and though at first I was a little backward to it, yet

at last I agreed to it with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of

his design.
When he came to them, he let them know that I had ac-
quainted him with their circumstances, and with the present de--
>> sign; that he was very willing to perform that part of his func--
;;', tion, and marry them, as I had desired; but that before he could
do it, he must take the liberty to talk with them; he told them,
' that in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the sense of the
i laws of society, they had lived all this while in open adultery ;
c and that it was true that nothing but the consenting to marry,
or effectually separating them from one another now, could put
' an end to it; but there was a difficulty in it too, with respect to
the laws of Christian'man'imony, which he was not fully satisfied
' about, We. That of marrying one that is a professed Christian to

a savage, an idolatcr, and a heathen, one that is not baptized;
and yet that he did not see that there was time left for it, to
endeavour to persuade the women to be baptized, or to profess452 Lm: ms onen'runes

the name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing i
of, and without which they could not be baptized. I
He told them, he doubted they were but indifferent Chris-
tians themselves; that they had but little knowledge of GOD, or
of his ways; and therefore he could not expect, that they had
said much to their wives on that head yet; but that unless they
would promise him to use their endeavour with their wives, to
persuade them to become Christians, and would as well as they
could instruct them in the knowledge and belief of GOD that
made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he
could not marry them; for he would have no hand in joining
Christians with savages ; nor was it consistent with the principles
of the Christian religion; and was, indeed, expressly forbidden

in Goo's law.

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very
faithfully to them, from his mouth, as near his own words as I
could, only sometimes adding something of my own, to convince 1
them how just it was, and how I was of his mind. And I always
very faithfully distinguished between what I said from myself, and
what were the clergyman's words. They told me, it was very .-
true what the gentleman had said, that they 'were but very indif-
ferent Christians themselves, and that they had never talked to
their wives about religion. Lord, Sir, says PVilI Atkins, how
should we teach them religion? Why, we know nothing our-
selves; and besides, Sir, said he, should we go to talk to them
of God, and 3?qu Christ, and heaven and hell, it would be to
make them laugh at us, and ask us, what we believe ourselves?
And if we should tell them, we believe all the things that we
speak of to them, such as of good people going to brawn, and
wicked people to the devil, they would ask us, where we intend
to go ourselves, that believe all this, and are such wicked fel--
lows, as we indeed are. Why, Sir, it is enough to give them a
surfeit of religion, at first hearing; folks must have some religion
themselves, before they pretend to teach other people--Will-
Atkins, said I to him, though I am afraid what you say has too
much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife that she is in'
the wrong? that there is a GOD. and a religion better than her
own; that her gods are idols; that they an neither hear or
speak; that there is a great Being that made all things, and that
can destroy all that he had made; that he rewards the good, and
punishes the bad; and that we are to be judged by him, at last,
for all we do here: you are not so ignorant, but even nature
itself will teach you, that all this is true; and I am satisfied you
know it all to be true, and believe it yourself.

That is true, Sir, said Atkins, but with what face can I say
any thing to my wife of all this, when she will tell me immedi-
ately, it cannot be true ?

Not true. ' said I, ----what do you mean by that? Why, Sir,
said he, she will tell me it cannot be true, that this God (I shall
p"Ltell her of) can be Just, or can punish or reward, since I am not

__ punished, and sent to the devil, that have been such a wicked
i creature as she knowsI have been, even to her, and to every body
; ,else; and thatI should be suffered to live, that have been always
L acting so contrary to what I must tell her 15 good, and to what:
I ought to have done.

Why truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speakest too
much truth: and with that I let the clergyman know what
Atkins had said: for he was impatient to know. 0! said the
priest, tell him there is one thing will make him the best minis-
ter in the world to his wife, and that is repentance; for none
Hench repentance like true penitents. He wants nothing but
to repent, and then he will be so much the better qualified to
- instruct his wife, he will be then able to tell her, that there is
f not only a Goo, and that he 18 the just rewarder of good and

evil; but that he 13 a merciful Being, and, with infinite goodness
and long suffering, forbears to punish those that offend; ,_ waiting
to be gracious, and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather
that he should return and live; that oftentimes sufi'ers wicked
men to go on for a long time, and even reserves damnation to
the general day of retribution: that it is a clear evidence of GOD,
and of a future state, that righteous men receive not their re-
ward, or wicked men their punishment, till they come into
another world; and this will lead him to teach his wife the
doctrine of the resurrection, and of the last judgment; let him
but repent for himself, he will be an excellent preacher of
repentance to his wife.

I repeated all this to, Atkins, who looked very serious all the
while, and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordi-
narily affected with it : when being eager and hardly sufi'ering me
to make an end--I know all this, master, says he, and a great
deal more; but I have not the impudence to talk thus to my
wife: when GoD, and my own conscience knows, and my wife
will be an undeniable evidence against me, that I have lived as if .
I had never heard of a Gon, or future state, or any thing about
it; and to talk of my repenting, alas! (and with that he fetched a
deep sigh; and I could see that tears stood in his eyes) it is past
all that with me. Past it! Atkins, said I, What dost thou
mean by that? I know well enough what I mean, says he:
I mean 'tis too late; and that is too true.

I told my clergyman word for word what he said: the poor
zealous priest (I must call him so; for be his opinion what it
will, he had certainly a most singular affection for the good of
other men's souls; and it would be hard to think he had not the
like for his own; I say, this zealous, affectionate man) could not
refrain tears also. But recovering himself, he said to me, Ask
him but one question. Is he easy that it is too late, or is he
troubled, and wishes it were not so? I put the question fairly to
Atkins; and he answered with a great deal of passion, How
could any man be easy in a condition that certain must end in I
eternal destruction? That hewas farfrom being easy; butthat,
on the contrary, he believed it would one time or the other ruin
him.

What do you mean by that? said I. Why, he said, he
believed he should one day or other cut his throat, to put an
end to the terror of it.

The clergyman shook his head, with a great concern in his
, face, when I told him all this; but, turning quick to me upon it,
'raflhe,lfthatbehis casgyoumayassurehimitisnottoo
late: Christ will give him repentance. But pray, my be, ex-
plain this to him, That as no man is saved but by Christ, and
the merit of his passion, procuring divine mercy for him, how
emit betoolateforany manto receivemercy? Does he think
he is able to sin beyond the power or reach ofdivine mercy?
" Pray tell him, There may be a time when provoked mercy will
no longer strive, and when GOD may refuse to hear; but that it
-, is never too late for men to ask mercy; and we that are
3' Christ's servants are commanded to preach mercy at all times, in
lath: name of 7m" Christ, to all time that sincerely "prunso
fag. that' tis never too late to repent.

y I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness;
'- but it seemed as if he turned of the discourse to the rest; for
he said to me, he would go and have some talk with his wife; so
i he went out awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived
they were all stupidly ignorant, as to matters of religion; much
as I was when I went rambling away from my father: and yet
: that there were none of them backward to hear what had been
said; and all of them seriously promised, that they would talk
.3 with their wives about it, and do their endeavour to persuade
_ them to turn Christians.
j' The clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported what answer
they gave, but said nothing a good while; but at last, shaking
his head, We-thatareChrist'sservants,mjrlie,cango norm-thee
than to exhort and instruct; and when men' comply, submit to
the reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are
bound to accept their good words; but, believe me, Sir, said he,
whatever you may know of the life of that man you (111 Will
Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere convert among them; I
take that man to be a true penitent; I will not despair of the
rest; but that man is apparently struck with the sense of his
past life; and I doubt not, but when he comes to talk religion to
his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it; for attempting
to teach others is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves.
I knew a man, who having nothing but a summary notion of
religion himself, and being wicked and profligate, to the last de-
gree, in his life, made a thorough reformation in himself, by
labouring to convert a 7m : if that poor Atkins begins but once
to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, my life for it, he
talks himself into a thorough convert, makes himself a penitent:
and who knows what may follow?

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising as above,
to endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he
married the other three couple; but Will Atkins and his wife
were not yet come in. After this, my clergyman, waiting
a while, was curious to know where Atkins was gone; and, turn--
ing to me, say: he, I entreat you, Sir, let us walk out of your
labyrinth here, and look; I dare say we shall find this poor man
somewhere or other, talking seriously to his wife, and teaching
her already something of religion. I began to be of the same
mind; so we went out together; and I carried him a way which
none knew but myself, and where the trees were so thick set, as
that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and'far
harder to see in, than to .m out; when coming to the edge of
the wood,I saw Atkins, and his tawny savage wife, sitting under
the shade of a bush, very eager in discourse. I stopped short,
till my clergyman came up to me; and then, having showed him
where they were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a
good while.

We observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to the
sun and to every quarter of the heavens; then down to the earth,
then out to the sea, then to himself, then to her, to the

.woods, to the trees. Now, says my clergyman, you see my
ywords are made good; the man preaches to her; mark him;
.1 now he is telling her that our God has made him, and her, and
fthe heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, 55:. I
1 believe he is, said I. Immediately we perceived Will Atkin:
start up upon his feet, fall down on his knees, and lift up both
his hands; we suppose he said something, but we could not
hear him: it was too far for that: he did not continue kneeling
half a minute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and
.talks to her again. We perceived then the woman very atten-
'tive; but whether she said any thing or no, we could not tell.
' While the poor fellow was upon his knees, I could see the tears
run plentifully down my clergyman's cheeks; and I could
hardly forbear myself; but it was a great amiction to us both,
that we were not near enough to hear any thing that passed
between them.

Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear of disturbing

them: so we resolved to see an end of this piece of still conversa-
5tion; and it spoke loud enough to us, without the help of voice.
3" He sat down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked again
earnestly to her; and two or three times we could see him em-
ibrace her most passionately; another time we saw him take out
ihis handkerchief, and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again,
-with a kind of transport very unusual; and after several of these
things, we see him on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his
hand to help her up; when immediately leading her by the hand

a step or two, they both kneeled down together, and continued
_. so about two minutes.

i U
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, St.
Paul, St. Paul! behold It: prayer}: !--I was afi-aid Adi>>: would
hear him; therefore I entrested him to withhold himself awhile,
that we might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must eon-
fess, was the most affecting, and yet the most agreeable, that ever
I saw in my life. Well, he strove with himself, and contained
himself for a while, but was in such raptures of joy to think-
that the poor heathen woman was become a Christian, that he
was not able to contain himself; he wept several times: then
throwing up his hands, and crossing his breast, said over several
things ejaculatory, and by way of giving G01) thanks for so
miraculous a testimony of the success of our endeavours: some
he Spoke softly, and I could not well hear; others audibly; some
in Latin, some in French ; then two or three times the tears of
joy would interrupt him, that he could not speak at all. But I
begged that he would compose himself, and let us more narrowly
and fully observe what was before us, which he did for a time,
and the scene was not ended there yet; for after the poor man
and his wife was risen again from their knees, we observed he
stood talking still eagerly to her; and we observed by her mo-
tion that she was greatly affected with what he said, by her.
frequent lifting up her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and
such other postures, as usually express the greatest seriousness-
and attention. This continued about half a quarter of an hour,
and then they walked away too; so that we could see no more
of them in that situation.

I took this interval to talk to my clergyman: and first I told
him,Iwas glad tosee the particularswe had both beenwitnesses
to; that though I was hard enough of belief in- such cases, yet
that I began to think it was all very sincere here, both in the
man and his wife, however ignorant they might both be; and I
hoped such a beginning would have a yet more happy end : and
who knows, said I, but these two may in time, by instruction
example, work upon some of the other? Some of them!
he, turning quirk upon nu, ay, upon all of then; : depend upon
' ,ifthose two savages (for he hasbecn but littlebettcr, asyou
. it), should embrace Jesus Christ, they will never leave till
'1 ' - work upon all the rest; for true religion is naturally commu--
'cative; and he that is once made a Christian will never leave a
, aganbehindhim, ifheean help it. I owned it wasa most

' hristian principle to think so, and a testimonyofatrue zeal, as
4 -ell as a generous heart, in him. But, my fi1end, said I, will
on give me leave to start one difliculty here; I cannot tell how
.. object the last thing against that afi'ectionate concern which
j; on shew for the turning the poor people from their paganism to
if e Christian religion: but how does this comfort you, while
1' ese people are, in your account, out of the pale of the Catholic
hurch, without which you believe there is no salvation; so
5 at you esteem these but heretics; and, for other reasons, as

'J- -ylostasthepagansthemselves?

f. To this he answered with abundance ofcandour and Christian
- : 'ty, thus. Sir, I am a Catholic of the Roman church, and a
fiest of the order of St. Benedict, and I embrace all the princi--
fies of the Roman faith. But yet, if you will believe me, and
' I do not speak on compliment to you, or in respect to my circum-
: enter, and your civilitier; I say, nevertheless, I do not look

pon you, who call yourselves reformed, without some charity.
dare not say, though I know it is our opinion in general,- I say,
dare not say, thatyou cannot be saved; I will by no means
't the mercy ofChrist, sofaras tothinkthathecannotre-
ive you into the bosom of his church, in a manner, to us, un-
, eivable, and which it is impossible for us to know; and I
. ope you have the same charity for us. I pray daily for your
' all restored to Christ's church, by whatsoever methods he,
hoisallm':e,isplessedtodirect. Inthemeantime,sure,
ouwillallowittoconsistwithme, asa Roman, todistinguish
far between a Protestant and a Pagan: between one that all:
on Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not think is ac-
cording to the true faith, and a savage, a barbarian, that knows
no GOD, no Christ, no Redeemer. And if you are not within
the pale of the Catholic church, we hope you are nearer being
restored to it, than those that know nothing of Goo, or his
church. And I rejoice, therefore, when I see-this poor man,
who, you say, has been a profligate, and almost a murderer,
kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did,
though not fully enlightened; believing that Goo, from whom
every such work proceeds, will sensibly touch his heart, and
bring him to the farther knowledge of the truth in his own
time: and if Goo shall influence this poor man to convert and
instruct the ignorant savage his wife, I can never believe that he
shall be cast away himself: and have I not reason then to re-
joice, the nearer any are brought to the knowledge of Christ,
though they may not be brought quite home into the bosom
of the Catholic church, just at the time when I may desire it;
leaving it to the goodness of Christ to perfect his.work in his
own time, and in his own way? Certainly I would rejoice, if all
the savages in America were brought, like this poor woman, to
pray to Goa, though they were to be all Protestants at first, ra-
ther than they should continue pagans and heathens; firmly
believing, that he that had bestowed the first light to them,
would farther illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly grace,
and bring them into the pale of his church, when he should
see good. i

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this truly
pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the power of his
reasoning; and it presently occurred to my thoughts, that if
such a temper was universal, we might be all Catholic Christians,
whatever church or particular profession we joined to, or joined
in; that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right
principles; and, in a word, as he thought that the like charity
would make us all Catholics, so I told him, I believed, had all
the members of his church the like moderation, they would soon
be all Protestants. And there we left that part, for we never
disputed at all.

However, I talked to him another way; and, taking him 6]
the hand, My friend, says I, I wish all the clergy of the Roman
church were blessed with such moderation, and had an equal
share of your charity. I am entirely of your opinion; but I
must tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine in Spain
or Ital}, they would put you into the inquisitian.

It may be so, said he; I know not what they might do in
Spain or Italy; but I will not say they would be the better
Christians for that severity; for I am sure there is no heresy in
too much charity.

Well, as W711 Atkins and his wife was gone, our business
there was over; so we went back our own way; and when we
came back, we found them waiting to be called in. Observing
this, I asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that
we had seen him under the bush, or no; and it was his opinion
we should not; but that we should talk to him first, and hear
what he would say to us: so we called him in alone, nobody
being in the place but ourselves; and I began with him thus.

Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had you? What
was your father ?

W'. A. A better man than ever I shall be. Sir, my father
we: a tlergymn.

R. C. What education did he give you?

W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I despised
all education, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was. '

R. C. It's true, Solomon says, " he that demise: "proof it
hrutirh."

IV. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish indeed; I murdered my father:
for Goo's sake, Sir, talk no more about that, Sir; I murdered
my poor father.

Priest. Ha! a murderer?

[Here the priert started (for I interpreted every word as he
spoke it) and looked pale. It seems he believed that Will had
really killed his own father. ]

R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so. Will Atkins,
explain yourself; you did not kill your father, did you, with
your own hands?

W. 11. No, Sir; I did not cut his throat; but I cut the
thread of all his comforts, and shortened his days; I broke his
heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural return, fol-the most tender,
affectionate treatment that ever father gave, or child could
receive.

R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father, to extort
this confession; I pray Goo give you repentance for it, and
forgive you that, and all your other sins: but I asked you,
because I see that though you have not much learning, yet you
are not so ignorant as some are, in things that are good; that
you have known more of religion a great deal than you have
practised.

W .4. Though you, Sir, did not extort the confusion that I
make about my father, conscience does; and whenever we come
to look back upon our lives, the sins against our indulgent pa-
rents are certainly the first that touch us; the wounds they make
lie deepest; and the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the
mind, of all the sins we can commit.

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins,- I
eannot bear It.

W A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know nothing
of it.

R. C. Yes, Atkins; every shore, every hill, nay, I may say,
every tree in this island, is witness to the anguish of my soul,
formyinfgrstitude, andbaseusageofagoodtenderfather; a
' father much like yours, by your description; and I murdered
my father as well as you, Will Atkins ; but I think, for all'that,
myrepentaneeisshortofyourstoo,byagreatdeal.

[I would have said score, if I could have restrained pg pas-
sions; but I thought this poor man's repentance was so much sin-
cerer than mine, that I was going to leave of the discourse, and
retire, for I was surprised with what he said ; and thought that
instead of in} going abut to teach and instruct him, the m was
made a teacher and instructor to me, it: a most surprising and
unemcted When]

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly
affected with it, and said to me, Did I not say, Sir, that when
this man was convemd, he would preach to us all? I tell you,
Sir, if this one man be made a true penitenr, here will be no
nud ofme; he will make Christians ofall in the island. But
having a little composed myself, I renewed my discourse with
Will Atkins.

But FVill, saidI, how comes the senseofthis matter totouch
you just now ?

F". .4. Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a
dart through myverysoul; I have been talking aboutGon and
religion to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a
Christian ofher; and she has preached such a sermon to me as
I shall never forget while I live.

R. C. No, no ; it is not your wife has preached to you: but
when you were moving religious arguments to her, conscience
has flung them back upon you.

W111. Ay, Sir,withsuchaforceasisnottoberesisted.

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you and
your wife; for-I know something ofit already.

I"; .4. Sir, itis impossible to giveyouafull account ofit: I
amtoofiilltoholdit, andyet have no tonguetoexpress: but
let her have said what she will, and though I cannot give you
an account of it, this I ean tell you of it, that I resolve to amend '
and reform my life.

R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you begin, .
Will? For this has been an extraordinary case, that is oer-
tain; she has preached a sermon, indeed, if she has wrought
this upon you.

IV. 1. Why, I first told her the nature of our law about
marriage, and what the reasons were that men and women were
obliged to enter into such compacts, as it was neither in the
power of one or other to break; that otherwise, order and jus-
tice could not be maintained, and men would run from their
wives, and abandon their children, mix confusedly with one
another, and neither families be kept entire, or inheritances be
settled by legal descent.

R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make her
understand what you meant by inherimnce and families? They
know no such thing among the savages, but marry any how,
without regard to relation, censanguinity, or family; brother
and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the father and daughter,
and son and the mother.

W. A. Ibelieve, Sir, youare misinformed ;--and mywife assures
me of the contrary, and that they abhor it. Perhaps, for any
farther relations, they may not be so exact as we are; but she
tells me they never touch one another in the near relations you
speak of. '

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?

W'. A. She said she liked it very well; and it was much
better than in her country.

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was?

PV. 1. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I asked her,
if she would be married to me our way? She asked me, What
way that was? I told her marriage was appointed by Goo; andor ROIBIBON Cnmt. 46g

W'. A. It is too me; though, for all that, we live as if there
was no God in heaven, or that he had no power on earth.

Wife. But why God let you do so? Why he no makee you
good live ?

"7. A. It is all our own fault.

Wifi. But you say me, he is great, much great, have much
great power; can makee kill when he will: why he no make

kill when you no serve him? No say 0 to him? No be good
mans ?

W'. 1!. That is true; he might strike me dead, and I ought
to expect it; for I have been a wicked wretch, that is true; but
God is merciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve.

Wife. But then, do not you tell God tankee for that too?

W'. A. No, indeed; I have not thanked God for his mercy,
any more than I have feared God for his power.

Wife. Than you God no God; me no think, believe he be

such one, great much power, strong; no makes kill you, though
you makee him much angry?

W'. A. What! will my wicked life hinder you from believ-
ing in God! What a dreadful creature am I! And what a
sad truth is it, that the hon-id lives of Christians hinders the
conversion of heathens!

Wxfi. How me tink you have great much God up there,

(six: point: up to heaven) and yet no do well, no do good thing;
Can he tell? Sure he no tell what you do.

W'. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he hears us
speak; sees what we do, knows what we think, though we do

not speak.
H'ife. What! he no hear you swear, curse, speak the great
damn?

wicked; then he no good himself, or no great able. -

'1'. A. 22:, yes, my dear ,- he is infinitely good, and infinitely
great, and able to punish too; and sometimes to shew his justice
and vengeance, he lets fiy his anger to destroy sinners, and make
examples: many are cut of? m their sins.

Wife. But no make kill you yet; then he tell you, may he,
that he no make you kill, so you make de bargain with him,
you do bad thing, he no be angry at you, when he be angry at
other mans?

IV. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon his
goodness; and he would be infinitely just, if he destroyed me,
as he has done other men.

[Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within hint, to hear a
poor, untaught creature, desire to be taught to know God ; and he
such a wicked wretch, that he could not say one word to her about
God, but what the reproach cf his own carriage would rnake mst
irrational to her to believe; nay, that already she had told hinl
that she could not believe in God, because he that was so wicked
was not destroyed]

W'. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could teach you to
know God, not God to know you; for he knows you already,
and every thought in your heart.

Wife. Why then he know what I say to you now; he know
me wish to know him; how shall me know who makee me?

W'. of. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I cannot teach
thee; I'll pray to him to teach thee to know him; and no for-
give me, that I am unworthy to teach thee.

[T he poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring hi>> to
make her know God, and her wishing to know hint, that, he said,
he fell down on his knees before her, and prayed to God to enlighten
her mind with the saving knowledge of 7esus Christ, and to pardon
his sins, and accept if his being the unworthy instrument of in-
structing her in the principles of religion ,- after which he sat down
by her again, and their dialogue went on.]

N.B. This was the time when we saw him kneel down and
hold up his hands.

makee kill me, when I no be good; all this you say he do; yet
he be great God; me take, think, believe him be great God;
me say 0 to him too, with you, my dear.

Here the poor man could forbear no longer; but raising her
up, made her kneel by him; and he prayed to God aloud, to
instruct her in the knowledge of himself, by his Spirit; and that
by some good providence, if possible, she might some time or
other come to have a bible, that she might read the word of
God, and be taught by it to know him.

This was the time that we saw him lift her up by the hand,
and saw him kneel down by her as above.

They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too
long to set down here; and particularly she made him promise,
that since he confessed his own life had been a wicked abomina-
ble course of provocations against God, that he would reform it,
and not make God angry any more, lest he should make him dead,
as she called it, and then she should be left alone, and never be
taught to know this God better; and lest he should be miserable,
as he told her wicked men should be after death.

This Was a strange account, and very afi'ecting to us both, but
particularly to the young clergyman: he was indeed wonderfully
surprised with it; but under the greatest afliction imaginable,
that he could not talk to her; that he could not speak English
to make her understand him; and as she spoke but very broken
English, he could not understand her. However, he turned
himself to me, and told me, that he believed there must be more
to do with this woman than to marry her; I did not understand
him at first; but at length he explained himself; 'viz. That she
ought to be baptized.
Iagmdwith him in that part readily, and was forgoing
about it presently. No, no :' hold, Sir, said be, though I would
have her be baptized by all means, yet I must observe, that Will
dtkim, her husband, has indeed brought her, in a wonderful
manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life; ' and has given
her just ideas of the being of a God, of his power, justice,
mercy, yet I desire to know ofhim, ifhe has said any thing to
her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of the
nature of faith in him; and redemption by him; of the Holy
Spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and a future state.

I called "'17! Atkins again, and asked him: but the poor
fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us, he had said some-
thing to her of all those things, but that he was himselfso wicked a
creature, and his own conscience so reproached him with his
horrid ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions, that
her knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should give
to those things, and make her rather contemn religion than receive
it: but he was assured, he said, that her mind was so disposed
to receive due impressions of all those things, that if I would but
discourse with her, she would make it appear to my satisfaction,
that my labour would not be lost upon her.

Accordinglyl ealled her in, and placing myself as interpreter,
between my religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to
begin with her: but sure such a sermon was never preached by a
popish priest in these latter ages of the world; and, a: I told him, I
thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity
of a Christian, without the errors of a Rm>> Catholic; and that
I took him to be such a clergyman as the Roma bishops were,
before the church of. Ram assumed spiritual sovereignty over
the consciences of men.

In a word, he brought the poor woman to- embrace the
knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by him, not with won-
der and astonishment only, as she did the first notions of a God,
but with joy and faith, with an affection, and a surprising degree
of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much less to be express-
ed; and at her own request she was baptized.

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreeted him, that
he would perform that office with some caution, that the man
might not perceive he was of the Roman church, if possible;
because of other ill consequences which might attends. difference
among us in that very religion which we were instructing the other
in. He told me that as he had no consecrated chapel, no pro-
per things for the oflice, I should see he would do it in a manner
that I should not know by it that he was a Roman Catholic my-
self, if I had not known it before: and so he did; for saying
only some words over to himself in Latin, which I could not
understand, he poured a whole dish full of water upon the
woman's head, pronouncing in French very loud, Mary; which
was the name her husband desired me to give her, far I was her
godfather, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost; so that none could know any
thing by it, what religion he was of: he gave the benediction
afterwards in Latin; but either W'ill Atkins did not know but
it was in French, or else did not take notice of it at that time.

As soon as this was over, we married them; and after the
marriage was over, he turned himself to Will Atkins, and in a
very affectionate manner exhorted him not only to persevere in
that good disposition he was in, but to support the convictions
that were upon him, by a resolution to reform his life: told him,
it was in vain to say he repented, if he did not forsake his
crimes; represented to him, how God had honoured him with
being the instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge of
the Christian religion; and that he should be careful he did not
dishonour the grace of God; and that if he did, he would see
the heathen a better Christian than himself; the savage con-
verted, and the instrument cast away.
He said agmtmanygoodthingstothem both, a'ndthen
recommending them, in a few words, to God's goodness; gave
them the benediction again, I repeating every thing to them in
English. And thus ended the ceremony. I think it was the
= most pleasant, agreeable day to me, that ever I passed in my
" whole life.

But my clergyman had not done yet, his thoughts hung
continually upon the conversion of the seven and thirty savages;
and fain he would have staid upon the island to have undertaken
it: but I convinced him, First, that his undertaking was imprac-
ticable in itself; and secondly, that perhaps I would put it into
a way of being done, in his absence, to his satisfaction; of which
by and by.

Having thus brought the affair of the island to a narrow
compass. I was preparing to go on board the ship, when
the young man, who I had taken out of the famished ship's
" company, came to me, and told me, he understood I had a
clergyman with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to be
, married to the savages, whom they walled wives; that he had a
i" match too, which he desired might be finished before I went,
between two Christians; which he hoped would not be disagree-
able to me.

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island;
so I began to persuade him not to do any thing of that kind
rashly, or because he found himself in this solitary circumstance.
1 represented to him, that he had some considerable substance in
the world and good friends, as I understood by himself, and by
his maid also; that the maid was not only poor, and a servant,
but was unequal to him, she being six or seven and twenty years
old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen; that he might very
probably, with my assistance, make a remove from this wilder-e
nose, and come into his own country again: and that then it
would be a thousand to one but he would repent his choice;
and the dislike of that circumstance might be disadvantageous
to both. I was going to say more, but he interrrupted me,
smiling; and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that I
mistook in my guesses; that he had nothing of that kind in his
thoughts, his present circumstance being melancholy and dis-
consolate enough; and he was very glad to hear, that I had
thoughts of putting them in a way to see their country again;
and nothing should have put him upon staying there, but that
the voyage I was going was so exceeding long and hazardous,
and would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends;
that he had nothing to desire of me, but that I would settle
him in some little property in the island where he was; give
him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and he would
settle himself like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever
I returned to England, I would redeem him, and hoped I would
not be unmindful of him when I came into England; that he
would give me some letters to his friends in London, to let them
know how good I had been to him, and in what part of the
world, and what circumstance I had left him in; that he promised
me, that whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all the
improvements he had made upon it, let the value be what it
would, should be wholly mine.

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his
youth; and was the more agreeable to me, beeause he told me
positively the match was not for himself. I gave him all possi-
ble assurances, that if I lived to come safe to England, I would
deliver his letters, and do his business effectually; and that he
might depend I would never forget the circumstance I left him
in; but still I was impatient to know who was the person to be
married. Upon which he told me it was my 74d qfall Trades,
and his maid Saran.

- I was most agreeably surprised when he named the match; for
indeed I thought it very suitable. The character ofthat man I
have given already; and as for the maid, she was a very honest,
modest, sober, and religious young woman; had a. very good
share of sense; was agreeable enough in her person; spoke very
handsomely, and to the purpose; always with decency and good
manners, and not backwards to speak when any thing required
it, or impertinently forward to speak when it was not her busi-
ness; very handy and housewifely in any thing that was before
her; an excellent manager, and fit indeed to have been gover-
ness to the whole island; she knew very well how to behave to
all kind of folks she had about her, and to better, if she had found
any there.

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them
the same day; and, as I was father at the altar, as I may say,
and gave her away, so I gave her a portion; for I appointed her
and her husband a handsome large space (if ground for their
plantation; and, indeed this match, and the proposal the young
gentleman made, to give him a small property in the island, put
me upon parcelling it out amongst them, that they might not
quarrel afterwards about their situation.

This sharing out the land to them I left to M1! Atkinr, who,
indwd, was now grown a most sober, grave, managing fellow;
perfectly reformed, exceeding pious and religious; and, as far as
I may be allowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily be-
lieve, was a true sincere penitent.

He divided things sojustly, and so much to every one's satis-
faction, that they only desired one general writing under my
hand for the whole , which I caused to be drawn up, and signed
and sealed to them, setting out the bounds and situation of every
man's plantation, and testifying, that I gave them thereby, seve-
rally, at right to the whole pomion and the inheritance of the
respective plantations or farms, with their improvements, to them
and their heirs; reserving all the rest ofthe island as myown
property, and a certain rent for every particular plantation, after
eleven years, if I, or any one fi-om me, or in my name, came to
demand it, producing an attested copy of the same writing.

As to the government and laws among them, I told them, I
was not capable of giving them better rules than they were able
to give themselves; only made them promise me, to live in love
and good neighbourhood with one another: and so I prepared
to leave them. ,

One thing I must not omit; and this is, that being now set--
tled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and having
much business in hand, it was but odd to have seven-and-thirty
Indian: live in a nook of the island, independent, and, indeed,
unemployed; for, excepting the providing themselves food,
which they had difficulty enough in too, sometimes, they had no
manner of business or property to manage: I proposed therefore
to the governor Spaniard, that he should go to them with Fri--
day's father, and propose to them to remove, and either plant
for themselves, or take them into their several families as ser-
vants, to be maintained for their labour, but without being abso-
lute slaves ; for I would not admit them to make them slaves by
force, by any means, because they had their liberty given them
by capitulation, and, as it were, articles of surrender, which they
ought not to break.

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all very
cheerfully along with him; so we allotted them land and planta-
tions, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest chose to
be employed as servants in the several families we had settled;
and thus my colony was in a manner settled, as follows; the
Spaniard: possessed my original habitation, which was the capi-
tal city, and extended their plantations all along the side of the
brook, which made the creek that I have so often described, as
far as my bower; and as they increased their culture, it went
always eastward; the English lived in the north-east part, where
W. Atkins and his comrades began, and came on southward and
south--west, towards the back part of the Spaniard:; and every
plantation had a great addition of land to take in, if they found
occasion; so that they need not jostle one another for want of

room.
All the east end of the island was left uninhabited, that if any

i of the savages should come on shore there, only for their usual

customary barbarities, they might come and go; if they disturbed
nobody, nobody would disturb them; and no doubt but they

a were often ashore, and went away again ; for I never heard that
' the planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more.

It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted to my friend

i the clergyman, that the work of converting the savages might,

perhaps, be set on foot in his absence, to his satisfaction; and I
told him, that now I thought it was put in a fair way ; for the
savages being thus divided among the Christians, if they would
but every one of them do their part with those which came under
their hands, I hoped it might have a very good efl'ect.

He agreed presently in that: If, said he, they will do their
part; but how, my: he, shall we obtain that of them? I told
him, we would call them all together, and leave it in charge with
them, or go to them one by one, which he thought best; so we
divided it ; he to. speak to the Spaniards, who were all Papists;
and I to the English, who were all Protestants; and we recom-
mended it earnestly to them, and made them promise, that they
would never make any distinction of Papist or Protestant, in
their exhorting the savages to turn Christians; but teach them
the general knowledge of the true God, and of their Saviour
Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us, that they would
never have any difi'erences or disputes, one with another, about
religion.

When I came to W. Atkinr': house, I may call it so; for such

V a house, or such a piece of basket-work, I believe was not stand-478 Lire m onzx'ruruzs

ing in the world again; I say, when I me there, I found the
young woman I have mentioned above, and IV. Atkim': wife, were-
beeome intimates; and this prudent, religious young woman had
perfected the work Will Adi>>: had begun; and though it was
not above four days after what I have related, yet the new-bap--
tized savage woman was made such a. Christian, as I have sel-
dom heard of any like her, in all my observation or conversation

in the world.

It came next into my mind, in the morning, before I went to
them, that amongst all the needful things I had to leave with
them, I had not left them a bible; in which I shewed myself
less considering for them, than my good friend the widow was
for me, when she sent me the cargo of an hundred pounds from
Lishm, where she packed up three bibles and a prayer-book.
However the good woman's charity had a greater extent than
ever she imagined; for they were reserved for the comfort and
instruction of those that made much better use of them than I
had done.

I took one of the bibles in my pocket, and when I me to
Will. Atkim': tent, or house, I found the young woman, and
Atkim': baptized wife, had been discoursing of religion together;
for W11. Atkins told it m, with a great deal qucy. I asked if
they were together now? And he said yes; so I went into the
house, and he with me, and we found them together, very ear-
nest in discourse. 0, Sir, says Will. Allin, when God has sin--
ners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to bring home, he never
wantsa messenger. My wife has got a new instructor; I knew
I was unworthy, as I was incapable of that work; that young
woman has been sent hither from Heaven; she is enough to con-
vert a whole island of savages. The young Woman blushed,
and rose up to go away, but I desired her to sit still; I told her

she had a good work- upon her hands, and I hoped God would
bless her in- it;
Wetalked a little, andIdidnotperceivetheyhadany book
among them, though I did not ask; but I put my hand in my
pocket, and pulled out my bible. Here,.:ay: I, to Atkins, I have
brought you an assistant, that, perhaps, you hadnot before. The

5 man was so confounded, that he was not able to speak for some
, time; but recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands,
' and turning to his wife, Here, my dear, says he, did not I tell
<< you, our God, though he lives above, could hear what we said?
,' Here's the book I prayed for, when you and I kneeled down
under the bush ; now God has heard us and sent it. When he
had said thus, the man fell into such transports of a passionate
joy, that between the joy of having it, and giving God thanks
for it, the tears ran down his face like a child that was crying.
' The woman was surprized, and was like to have run into a
' mistake, that none of us were aware of ; for she firmly believed
, God had sent the book upon her husband's petition. It is true,
' that providentially it was so, and might be taken so in a conse-
quent sense; but I believe it would have been no difficult matter
at that time, to have persuaded the poor woman to have believed,
=1 that an express messenger came fiom heaven, on purpose to bring
that individual book; but it was too serious a matter to suffer
1 any delusion to mke place. So I turned to the young woman,
' and told her we did not desire to impm upon the new convert,
" in her first and more ignorant understanding of things; and
begged her to explain to her, that God may be very properly
said to answer our petitions, when, in the course of his Provi-
dence, such things are, in a particular manner, brought to pass,
as we petitioned for; but we do not expect returns from Hea-
ven, in a miraculous and particular manner; and that it is our
_mercythatitisnotso.
' This the young woman did afterwards effectually; so that
' there was, I assure you, nopriestcraft used here; and I should
; have thought it one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world,43deg Lu-'s AND Anvm'ruus

to have had it so: but the surprise of joy upon "/71! Atkins, is
really not to be expressed; and there, we may be sure there was no
delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful in the world for
any thing of its kind, than he was for this bible; nor I believe,
never any man was,glad of a bible from a better principle;
and though he had been a most profligate creature, desperate,
headstrong, outrageous, furious, and wicked to a great degree,
yet this man is a standing rule to us all, for the well instructing
children, viz. that parents should never give over to teach and
instruct, or ever despair of the success of their endeavours, let
the children be ever so obstinate, refractory, or, to appearance,
insensible of instruction; for if ever God in his Providence
touches the consciences of such, the force of their education
returns upon them, and the early instruction of parents is not
lost, though it may have been many years laid asleep; but,
some time or other they may find the benefit of it.

Thus it was with this poor man. However ignorant he was,
or divested of religion and Christian knowledge, he found he had
some to do with now, more ignorant than himself; and that the
least part of the instruction of his good father, that could now
come to his mind, was of use to him.

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how his father
used to insist much upon the inexpressible value of the bible;
the privilege and blessing of it to nations, families, and persons;
but he never entertained the least notion of the worth of it till
now; when being to talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians,
he wanted the help of the written oracle for his assistance.

The young woman was very glad of it also, for the present
occasion, though she had one; and so had the youth on board
our ship, among their goods which were not yet brought on
shore. And now, having said so many things of this young
woman, I cannot omit telling one story more of her and myself,
which has something in it very informing and remarkable.
I have related to what extremity the poor young woman was
reduced; how her mistress Was starved to death, and did die, on
board that unhappy ship we met at sea; and how the whole
ship's company being reduced to the last extremity, the gentle-
woman, and her son, and this maid, were first hardly used, as to
provisions, and at last, totally neglected and starved; that is to
say, brought to the last extremity of hunger.

One day, being discoursing with her upon the extremities
they suffered, I asked her if she could describe, by what she had
felt, what it was to starve, and how it appeared? She told me,
she believed she could; and she told her tale very distinctly thus.

" First, Sir, said she, we had for some days fared exceeding
hard, and suffered very great hunger; but now, at last, we were
wholly without food of any kind, except sugar, and a'little wine,
and a little water. The first day after I had received no food at
all, I found myself towards evening, first empty and sickish at
my stomach; and nearer night, mightily inclined to yawning,
and sleepy; I laid down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep;
and slept about three hours, and awaked a little refreshed, having
taken a glass of wine when I lay down: after being about three
hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the morning, I found
myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and laid down again;
but could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill; and thus I
continued all the second day, with a strange variety; first hun-
gry, then sick again, with reachings to vomit: the second night,
being obliged to go to bed again, without any food more than a
draught of fair water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was at
Barbadm', and that the market was mightily stocked with pro-
visions; that I bought some for my mistress, and went and
dined very heartily.

"I thought my stomach was as full after this, as any would
have beenafter,orata gooddinner; butwheanaked,Iwas
exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find myself in the actremity of

x
famine: the last glass of wine we had, I drank, and'put sugar in
it, because of its having some spirit to supply nourishment; but
there being no substance in the stomach for the digesting oflice
to work upon, I found the only effect of the wine was, to raise
disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay,
as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some
time.

" The third day in the morning, after a night of strange and
confused inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I
waked, ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question, had
not my understanding returned, and conquered it; I say, I
question whether, if I had been a mother, and had had a little
child with me, its life would have been safe or not.

" This lasted about three hours; during which time I was
twice raging mad, as any creature in Bedlam, as my young
master told me, and as he can now inform you.

"In one of these fits of lunacy, or distraction, whether by the
motion of the ship, or some slip of my foot, I know not, I fell
down, and struck my face against the comer of a pallet--bed, in
which my mistress lay; and with the blow the blood gushed
out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin,
I sat down and bled into it a great deal; and as the blood run
from me, I came to myself; and the violence of the flame, or
the fever I was in, abated, and so did the ravenous part of the
hunger.

" Then I grew sick and reached to vomit, but could not;
for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up: after I had bled
some time, I swooned, and they all believed I was dead; but I
came to myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful pain
in my stomach, not to be described; not like the colic, but a
gnawing eager pain for food; and, towards night, it went off
with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for food; something
like, as I suppose, the longing of a woman with child. I took
another draught of water, with sugar in it, but'my stomach
loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again. Then I tool: a
draught of water, without sugar, and that. stayed with me; and
I laid me down upon the bed, praying most heartily, that it
would please Got) to take me away; and Composing my mind
in hopes of it, I slumbered awhile; and then waking, thought
myself dying, being light with vapours from an empty stomach.
I recommended my soul then to GOD, and earnestly wished that
somebody would throw me into the sea.

" All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought,
expiring; but bore it with much more patience than I, and gave
the last bit of bread she had left to her child, my young master,
who would not have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it;
and, I believe, it saved his life.

" Towards the morning, I slept again; and first, when I
awaked, I fell into a violent passion of crying; and after that,
had a second fit of violent hunger; I got up ravenous, and in a
most dreadful condition. Had my mistress been dead, as much
as I loved her,.I am certain I should have eaten a piece of her
flesh with as much'relish, and as unconcerned, as ever I did the
flesh of any creature appointed for food; and once or twice I
was going to bite my own arm. At last, I saw the basin, in
which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day before; I
ran to it, and swallowed it with such haste, and such a greedy
appetite, as if I had wondered nobody had taken it before, and
afraid it should be taken from me now.

" Though after it was down the thoughts of it filled me with
horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger; and I drank a draught
of fair water, and was composed and refreshed for some hours
after it. This was the fourth day; and thus I held it till
'towards night, when, within the compass of three hours, I had
alltheeeseveral circumstances over agaimone aftermo'ther';

:m'z. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, .pain in the stomach, than
ravenous again, then sick again, then lunatic, then crying, then
ravenous again, and so every quarter of an hour; and my strength
wasted exceedingly. At night I laid me down, having no com--
fort, but in the hope that I should die before morning.

" All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger was now
turned into a disease; and I had a terrible colic and griping;
by wind, instead of food, having found its way into the bowels;
and in this condition I lay till morning, when I was surprised
a little with the cries and lamenmtions of my young master,
who called out to me, that his mother was dead. I lifted
myself up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but found
she was not dead, though she was able to give very little signs

of life.
" I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of

some sustenance, that] cannot describe; with such frequent
throes and pangs of appetite, that nothing but the tortures of
death can imitate; and in this condition I was when I heard the
seamen above cry out, A rail! 4 mil! and halloo and jump
about as if they were distracted.

" I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mistress
much less; and my young master was so sick, thatI thought he
had been expiring; so we could not open the cabin-door, or get
any account what it was that occasioned such a combustion;
nor had we any conversation with the ship's company for two
days, they having told us they had not a mouthful of any thing
to eat in the ship; and they told us afterwards, they thought we
had been dead.

" It was this dreadful condition we were in when you were
sent to save our lives; and how you found us, Sir, you know as
well as I, and better too."

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of
starving to death, as, I confess, I never met with, and was ex--
ceeding entertaining to me. I am the rather apt to believe it
to be a true account, beeause the youth gave me'an actount' of
a good part of it; though I must own, not so distinct, and so

i feelingly as his maid; and the rather, because, it mm, his

mother fed him at the price of .her own life: but the poor maid,
though her constitution being Stronger than that of her mistress,

' who was in years, and a weakly woman too, she might struggle
" harder with it; I say, the poor maid might be supposed to feel

the extremity something sooner than her mistress, who might
be allowed to keep the last bits something longer than she parted
with any to relieve the maid. No question, as the case is here
related, if our ship, or some other, had not so providentially met

them, a few days more would have ended all their lives, unless
5; they had prevented it by eating one another; and even that, as
their case stood, would have served them but a little while, they

being 500 leagues from any land, or any possibility of relief,
' other than in the miraculous manner it happened.--But this is

by the way; I return to my disposition of things among the
people. . .

And first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons,
I did not think fit to let them know anything of the sloop I had
framed, and which I thought of setting up among them; for I
found, at least at my first coming, such seeds of divisions among

Q them, that I saw it plainly, had I set up the sloop, and left it
9 among them, they would, upon very light disgust, have sepa-

rated, and game away from one another; or perhaps have turned
pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves, instead of a
plantation of sober and religious people, so as I intended it; nor
did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I had on board,
or the two quarter-deck guns that my nephew took extraordina-
rily, for the same reason. I thought it was enough to qualify
them for a defensive war, against any that should invade them;
but not to set them up for an offensive war, or to encourage
them to go abroad to attack others, which, in the end, would
only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves and all their
undertaking. I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for
their service another way, as I shall observe in its place.

I have now done with the island. I left them all in' good circum-
stances, and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my ship
again the of , having been fiveaand-twenty days among
them; and as they were all resolved to stay upon the island till
I came to remove them, I promised to send some further relief
from the Brasils, if I could possibly find an opportunity; and
particularly I promised to send them some cattle; such as sheep,
hogs, and cows; for as to the two cows and calves which I
brought from England, We had been obliged, by the length of
our voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of bay to feed them.

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting,
we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints, in the Brailr,
in about twenty--two days: meeting nothing remarkable in our
passage but this. That about three days after we sailed, being
becalmed, and the current setting strong to the E. N. E. running
as it were, into a bay or gulph, on the land-side, we were driven
something out of our course; and once or twice our men cried
Land, to the eastward; but whether it was the continent, or
islands, we could not tell by any means.

But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth and the
weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, covered, towards the
land, with something very black, not being able to discover what
it was; till, after some time, our chief mate going up the main
shrouds a little way, and looking at them with a perspective,
cried out, it was an army. I could not imagine what he meant by
an army, and spoke a little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or
some such word. Nay, Sir, say: he, do not be angry, for it is
an army, and a fleet too; for I believe there are a thousand
canoes, and you may see them paddle along, and they are coming
towards us too, apace.
I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew
-' the captain; for he hadheard such terrible stories ofthem in the
island, and having never been in those seas before, that he
l could not tell what to think of it, but said two or three times,
we shall all be devoured. I must confess, considering." were

becalmed, and the current set strong towards. the shore, I liked
' it the worse ; however, I bade him not be afraid, but bring the
' shiptoananchor, assoonaswe eame so near to knowthatwe
must engage them.
' The weather continued calm, and they earne on apace towards
us; so I gave order to come to an anchor, and furl all our sails.
As for the savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but
" fire; and therefore they should get their boats out, and fasten
them, one close by the head, and the other by the stern, and
1 man them both well, and wait the issue inthat posture: this I
'7' did, that the men in the boats might be ready, with skeet: and
buckets, to put out any fire these savages might endeavour to fix
to the outside of the ship.
' In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they
earne up with us, but never was such a horrid sight seen by
Christians. My mate was much mistaken in his calculation of
., their number, I mean of a thousand eanoes; the most we could
make of them when they eame up, being about a hundred and six
and twenty, and a great many of them too ; for some of them had
sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the least
six or seven.

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with
wonder and astonishment, as-- at a sight which they had, doubt-
: less never seen before; nor could they, at first, as we afterwards

understood, know what to make of us. They eame boldly up
however, very near to us, and seemed to go about to row round
us: but we ealled to our menin the boats, not to let them come
too near them. ' I
This very order brought us to an engagement with them,
without our designing it; for five or six of their large woes
came so near our long-boat, that our men beckoned with their
hands to them to keep back; which they understood very well,
and went back; but at their retreat about 50 arrows came on
board us from those boats; and one of our men in the long-boat
was very much wounded.

However, I called to them not to fire by any means; but we
handed down some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenter
presently set up a kind of a fence, like waste boards, to cover
them from the arrows of the savages, if they should shoot again.

About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a body
astern of us, and pretty near us, so near that we could easily
discern what they were, though we could not tell their design.
And I easily found they were some of my old friends, the same
sort of savages that I had been used to engage with: and in a
little time more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they
came directly broadside with us, and then rowed down straight
upon us, till they came so near that they could hear us speak.
Upon this, I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they should
shoot any more arrows, and make all our guns ready; but being
so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon the
deck, and call out loud to them in his language, to know what
they meant; which accordingly he did : whether they understood
him or not, I knew not; but, as soon as he had called to them,
six of them, who were in the foremost, or nighestboats to us,
"turns their canoes from us; and, stooping down, shewed us
their naked backsides; just as if in English, (saving your pre-
sence) they had 5111 u: kiss Whether this was a defiance
or challenge, we know not; or whether it was done in mere con-
tempt, or as a signal to the rest; but immediately Friday cried
out, They were going to shoot; and unhappily for him (poor
fellow) they let fly about 300 of their arrows; and, to my inex-
I preesible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in their
sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows,
'.and about three more fell very near him; such unlucky marksman
'ithey were.

"Z- I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, the com-
' 'on of all my sorrows and solitudes, that I immediately
rdered five guns to be loaded with small shot, and four with
t; and gave them such a broadside as they had never heard in
' their lives before, to be sure.

They were not above half a cable length of? when we fired;

:rland our gunners took their aim so well, that three or four of
E'their canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one

Eishot only.

The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides to us, gave
ins no great offence; neither did I know for certain whether
S'hat, which would pass for the greatest contempt among us,

gnight be understood so by them or not; therefore in return I

had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at them with

powder only, which I knew would fright them sufiiciently: but

when they shot at us directly with all the fury they were capable

of, and especially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom I so

entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, so well deserved it;
"I not only had been justified before God and man, but would
' have been very glad, if I could, to have overset every canoe
' there, and drowned every one of them.

I can neither tell how many we killed, or how many we
. ounded, at this broadside; but sure such a fright and hurry
; ever was seen among such a multitude: there were thirteen or
- ourteen of their canoes split, and overset, in all; and the men
' all set a swimming: the rest, frighmd out of their wits, scoured
1 away as fast as they could, taking but little are to save those
. whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose
J that they were many of them lost;.and our men took up one
x 2
poor fellow swimming for his life, above an hour after they were
all gone.

Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a
great many; but, in short, we never knew any thing how it
went with them; for they fled so fast, that, in three hours, or
thereabouts, we could not see above three or four straggling
canoes; nor did we ever see the rest any more; for a breeze of
wind springing up the same evening, we weighed and set sail for
the Brasils.

We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so sullen, that
he would neither eat or speak; and we all fancied he would
starve himself to death; but I took a way to cure him; for I
made them take him and turn him into the long--boat, and make
him believe they would toss him into the sea again, and so leave
him where they found him, if he would not speak: not would
that do, but they really did throw him into the sea, and come
away from him; and then he followed them, for he swam like
a cork, and called to them in his tongue, though they knew not
one word of what he said. However, at last, they took him in
again, and then he began to be more tractable; nor did I ever
design they should drown him.

" We were now under sail again; but I was the most disoonso-
late creature alive, for want of my man Friday, and would have
been very glad to have gone back to the island, to have taken one
of the rest from thence for my occasion, but it could not be; so
we went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said; and it was a
long while before we could make him understand any thing;
but, in time, our men taught him some English, and he began to
be a little tractable: afterwards we inquired what country he
came from, but could make nothing of what he said; for his
speech was so odd, all gutterals, and spoke in the throat in such
a hollow odd manner, that we could never form a word after
him; and we were all of opinion that they might speak that
llmguageaswell, iftheywere gagged, as otherwise; noroould
we perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue,
lips or palate: but formed their words just as a hunting-ham
forms a tune, with an open throat; he told us, however, some
time after, when we had taught him to speak a little English,
i that they were going, with their kings, to fight a great battle.
' When he said kings, we asked him, how many kings? He said
I there were five nation, (we could not make him understand the
i plural s.) and that they all joined to go against two nation. We
asked him, What made them come up to us? He said, To maker
te great wonder look--Where it is to be observed, that all those
natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn Eaglitb, they
always add two e's at the end of the words where we use one,
and place the accent upon them; as via/:22 takee, and the like;
and we could not break them of it; nay, I could hardly make
Friday leave it 08", though at last he did.
5 And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my
last leave of him; poor honest Friday! We buried him with all
- the decency and solemnity possible, by putting him into a coffin,
and throwing him into the see; and I caused them to fire eleven
guns for him: and so ended the life of the most. grateful, faith--
ful, honest, and most affectionate servant that ever man had. -
We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil, and, in about
twelve days' time, we made land in the latitude of five degrees
south of the line, being the north-eastermost land of all that part
of America. We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore four
days, when we made the Cap: St. Augustine, and in three days
me to an anchor off of the bay of All Saints, the old place of
my deliverance, from whence came both my good and evil fate.
Never did a ship come to this part that had less business than
I had; and yet it waswith greatdifl'iculty thatwewereadmitted
to hold the least correspondence on shore. Not my partner
himself, who was alive, and made a great. figure among them,
not my two merchants trustees, not the farne of my-wonderful
preservation in the island, could obtain me that favour: but my
partner, remembering that I had given five hundred moidores
to the prior of the monastery of the Augustine:, and two hundred
and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery, and obliged
the prior that then was, to go to the governor, and get leave
for me presently, with the captain, and one more, besides eight
seamen, to come on shore, and no more ; and this upon condition
absolutely capitulated for, that we should not ofi'er to land any
goods out of the ship, or to carry any person away without
licence.

They were so strict with us, as to landing any goods, that it
was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore three bales of
English goods, such as fine broad cloths, stufi's, and some linen,
which I had brought for a present to my partner.

He was a very generous, broad-hearted man, though (like me)
he carne from little at first; and though he knew not that I had
the least design of giving him any thing, he sent me on board a
present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth above
thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and three or four fine
medals in gold. But I was even with him in my present, which,
as I have said, consisted of fine broad cloth, English stufl's, lace,
and fine Hollands. Also, I delivered him about the value of
100]. sterling, in the same goods, for other uses ; and I obliged
him to set up the sloop which I had brought with me from
England, as I have said, for the use of my colony, in order
to send the refreshments I intended to my plantation.

Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very
few days, for she was already framed; and I gave the master of
her such instructions as he could not miss the place; nar did he
mix: them, a: I had an account from my partner aflerward:. I
got him soon loaded with the small cargo I sent them; and one
of our seamen, that had been on shore with me there, _ofl"ered
to go with the sloop, and settle there, upon my letter to the

governor Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity of land
:for a plantation; and giving him some clothes, and tools

gfor his planting work, which he said he understood, having
'ibeen an old planter in Malawi, and a buccaneer into the
lbargain.
I I encouraged the fellow by granting all he desired; and,
f as an addition, I gave him the savage which we had taken
- prisoner of war, to be his slave, and ordered the governor
_ Spaniard to give him his share of every thing he wanted, with
' the rest.

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told
me, there was a certain very honest fellow, a Brasil planter
of his acquaintance, who had fallen into the displeasure of
he church: I know not what the matter is with him, my:
'12:, but, on my conscience, I think he is a heretic in his hurt;
.nnd he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the

inquisition; that he would be very glad of such an opportunity

to make his mpe, with his wife and two daughters; and if I
would let them go to my island, and allot them a plantation,
he would give them a small stock to begin with; for the officers
of the inquisition had seized all his efi'ecs and estate, and he
-' had nothing left but a little household stufi', and two slaves;
: and, add: 12:, though I hate his principles, yet I would not
.- have him fall into their hands, for he will assuredly be burnt
ive if he does.
I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with
em: and we concealed the man, and his wife and daughters,
T n board our ship, till-the sloop put out to go to see; and then
Khaving put all their goods on board the sloop some time
SSbefore) we put them on board the sloop, after he was got out
_' of the bay.

Our sum was mightily plmd with this new partner; and

   
 

1- not-v-
their stock, indeed, was much alike rich in tools, in prepara-
tions, and a farm; but nothing to begin with, but as above.
However, they carried over with them (which was worth all
the rest) some materials for planting sugar mes, with some
plants of canes; which he (I mean the Portugal man) under-
stood very well.

Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in the island,
I sent them, by their sloop, three milch cows and five calves,
about twenty-two hogs among them, three sows big with pig,
two mares, and a stone~horse.

For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged three
Portugal women to go; and recommended it to them to marry
them, and use them kindly. I could have procured more
women, but I remembered that the poor persecuted man had
two daughters, and there was but five of the Spaniard: that
wanted; the rest had wives of their own, though in another
country.

All this cargo arrived safe, and as you may easily suppose,
very Welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now (with
this addition) between sixty and seventy people, besides little
children; of which there was a great many: I found letters
at London from them all, by the way of Lisbon, when I came
back to England; of which I shall also take some notice im-
mediately.

I have now done with my island, and all manner of discourse
about it; and whoever reads the rest of my memorandum.
would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect
to read of the follies of an old man, not warned by his own
harms, much less by those of other men, to beware of the like;
not cooled by almost forty years' misery and disappointments;
not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation; not made enu--
tious by affliction and distress beyond imitation.

I had no more business to go to the East Indies, than a man
at full liberty, and having committed no crime, has to go to the
, turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to lock him up among the
i; prisoners there, and starve him. Had I taken a small vessel
from England, and went directly to the island; had I loaded
3 her, as I did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for the
plantation, and for my people; took a patent from the govem-
7 ment here, to have secured my property, in subjection only to
i that of England ,- had I carried over cannon and ammunition,
servants, and people to plant, and, taking possession of the place,
'i fortified and strengthened it in the name of England, and in-
- creased it with people, as I might easily have done; had I then
settled myself there, and sent the ship back, loaden with good
.2 rice, as I might also have done in six months' time, and ordered
my friends to have fitted her out again for our supply; had I
done this, and stayed there myself, I had at least acted like a
man of common sense; but I was possessed with a wandering
.spirit, scorned all advantages, I pleased myself with being the
patron of those people I had placed there, and doing for them
in a kind of haughty majestic way, like an old patriarchal mo--
- narch; providing for them, as if I had been father of the whole
family, as well as of the plantation : but I never so much as pre.
tended to plant in the name of any government or nation, or to
g; acknowledge any prince, or to all my people subjects to any
' one nation more than another; nay, I never so much as gave
the place a name; but left it as I found it, belonging to nobody ;
and the people under no discipline or government but my own;
who, though I had an influence over them as a father and bene-
. factor, had no authority or power to act or command one way
or other, farther than' voluntary consent moved them to comply:
f3, yet even this, had I staid there, would have done well enough;
:'f but as I rambled from them, and me there no more, the last
letters I had from any of them, was by my partner's means, who,
afterwards sent another sloop to the place; and who sent me
word, though I had not the letter till five years after it was
written, that they went on but poorly, were malcontent with their
long stay there; that [VIII Atkins was dead; that five of the
Spaniard: were come away; and that though they had not been
much molested by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes
with them; and that they begged of him to write to me, to
think of the promise I had made to fetch them away, that they
might see their own country again before they died.

But I was gone a wild-goose char: indeed; and they that will
have any more of me, must be content to follow me through a
new variety of follies, hardships, and wild adventures; wherein
the justice of Providence may be duly observed, and we may
see how easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires, make
the strongest of our wishes be our affliction, and punish us most
severely with those very things which we think it would be our
utmost happiness to be allowed in.

Let no wise man flatter himself with the strength of his own
judgment, as if he was able to chuse any particular station of
life for himself. Man is a short--sighted creature, sees but a very
little way before him; and as his passions are none of his best

friends, so his particular affections are generally his worst coun-
sellors.

I say this with respect to the impetuous desire I had from a
youth, to wander into the world; and how evident it now was,
that this principle was preserved in me for my punishment.
How it came on, the manner, the circumstance, and the conclu-
sion of it, it is easy to give you historieslly, and with its utmost
variety of particulars. But the secret ends of Divine Power, in
thus permitting us to be hurried down the stream of our own
desires, is only to be understood by those who can listen to the
voice of Providence, and draw religious consequences from 600':
justice, and their own mistakes.

Be it, I had business, or no business, away I went; it is no
' e now to enlarge any farther upon the reason or absurdity of
y own conduct; but to come to the history , I was embarked
or the voyage, and the voyage I went.
I should only add here, that my honest and truly pious clergy-
, left me here; a ship being ready to go to Lisbon, he asked
' e leave to go thither; being still, as he observed, bound never
finish any voyage he began. How happy had it been for me,
I had gone with him.
But it was too late now; all things Heaven appoints are
;_ t; had I gone with him, I had never had so many things
o be thankfiil for, and you had never heard of the second
art of the Travels and Adventures of Robin Crurae; so I
" ust leave here the fruitless exclaiming at myself, and go on
ith my voyage.
From the Bran'l: we made directly away over the Atlantic
flea, to the Cape J: Bone Erperante, or, as we eall it, the Cape
V Good Hope ; and had a tolerable good voyage, our course geo
nerally south-east; now and then a storm, and some contrary
winds. But my disasters at see were at an end; my future rubs
and cross events were to befal me on shore; that it might ap-
pear, the land was as well prepared to be our scourge as the sea,
when Heaven, who directs the circumstances of things, pleases '
' appoint it to be so.
_. Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on
~ board, Who was to direct all her motions, after she arrived at the
ape; only being limited to certain numbers of days for stay,
' y charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to: this was
A one of my business, neither did I meddle with it at all; my
' ephew, the captain,-and the supercargo, adjusting all those
'ngs between them as they thought fit.
We made no stay at the Cape, longer than was needful to
7 take in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the coast
7 of Caromqndel; we. were indeed informed that a French man of
'war of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone for
the Indie: ; and, as I knew we were at war with France, I had
some apprehensions of them; but they went their own way, and
we heard no more of them.

I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with descriptions
of places, journals of our voyages, variations of the compass,
latitudes, meridian distances, trade wind, situation of ports, and
the like; such as almost all the histories of long navigation are
full of, and makes the reading tiresome enough; and are per--
fectly unprofitable to all that read, except only to those who are
to go to those places themselves.

It is enough to name the ports and places which we touched
at; and what occurred to us upon our passing from one to am
other. We touched first at the island of Madagascar, where,
though the people are fierce and treacherous, and, in particular,
very well armed with lances and bows, which they use with in-
conceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with them awhile;
they treated us very civilly; and for some trifles which we gave
them, such as knives, scissars, (9'4 they brought us eleven good
fat bullocks, middling in size, but very good in flesh; which
we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present spending,
and the rest to salt for the ship's use.

We were obliged to stay here some time, after we had fur-
nished ourselves with provisions; and I, that was always too
curious to look into every nook of the world wherever I me,
was for going on shore as often as I could. It was on the east
side of the island that we went on shore one evening; and the
people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came thronging
about us, and stood, gazing at us, at a distance; but as we had
traded freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought
ourselves in no danger: but when we aw the people, we cut
three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them at a distance from
us, which, it seems, is a mark in the county, not only of truceand friendship, but when it is accepted, the other side set up
three poles, or boughs; which is a signal that they accept the
truce too; but then this is a known condition of the truce, that
you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards them, nor
they come past your three poles or boughs towards you; so that
you are perfectlysecurewithin the three poles; andallthespace

' between your poles and their's, is allowed like a market, for free
converse, mflick, and commerce. When you go there you must
not carry your weapons with you; and if they come into that
space, they stick up theirjavelins and lances, all at the first poles,
and come on unarmed; but if any violence is offered them, and
the truce thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay
hold of their weapons, and then the truce is at an end.

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a
greater number of their people came down than usual, but all
was very friendly and civil, and they brought in several kinds
of provisions, for which we satisfied them with such toys as we
had; their women also brought us milk and roots, and several
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made
us a little tent, or hut, of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore
all night.

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well sa~
tisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the boat riding at an an-
chor about a stone east from the land, with two men in her to
take care of her, I made one of them come on shore; and get-
tingsomeboughsoftreeatocoverusalso intheboat,lspread
the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the cover of
the branches of trees, all night in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men
make a terrible noise on the shore calling out for Goo's sake to
bring the boat in, and come and help them, for they were all
liketobe murdered; at the same time I heard the fire of five
musquets, which was-the number of the guns they had, and
that three times over; for, it seems the natives here were not
so easily fi-ighted with guns as the savages were in 1min,
where I had to do with them. _

All this while I knew not what was the matter; but rousing
immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be
thrust in, and resolved, with three fusils we had on board, to
land and assist our men.

We got the boat soon to the shore; but our men were in too
much haste; for, being come to the shore, they plunged into
the water, to get to the boat with all the expedition they could,
being pursued by betWeen three and four hundred men. Our
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had fusees with
them; the rest had indeed pistols and swards, but they were of
small use to them.

We took up seven of our men, and with difiiculty enough
too, three of them being very ill wounded; and that which was
still worse, was, that while we stood in the boat to take our men
in, we were in as much danger as they were in on shore; for
they poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we were fain
to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches, and two
or three loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we had,
by mere accident, or providence, in the boat. ~

And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it seems, such exact
marksmen, that if they could have seen but the least part of any
of us, they would have been sure of us: we had, by the light of
the moon, :1 little sight of them, as they stood pelting us fi'om
the shore with darts and arrows; and, having got ready our fire-
arms, we gave them a volley; that we could hear by the cries
of some of them, that we had wounded several; however, they
stood thus in battle array on the shore till break of day, which
we suppose was, that they might see the better to take their aim
at us.

_ In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our
anchor. or set up our sail, heeause we must needs stand up in
the boat, and theywere assuretohit us, asweweretohita
birdinatreewithsmallshot: wemadesigmlsofdistreaseo
the ship, which though we rode a league of, yet my nephew,
the eaptain, hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiving the
_ posture we lay in, and that we fired towards the shore, pretty
well understood us; and, weighing anchor with all speed, he
stood as near the shore as he duxst with the ship, and then sent
' another boat, with ten hands in her, to assist us; but we ealled
to them not to come too near, telling them what condition we ~
were in: however, they stood in nearer to us, and one of the
men, taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping our
boat between him and the enemy, so that they could not per-
fectly see him, swam on board us, and made the line fast
to the boat; upon which we slipt our little cable, and leav-
5 ing our anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach of
: the arrows; we all the while lying close behind the barrieade
' we had made.

As soon as we were got fi'om between the ship and the
shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, she run
along just by them, and poured in a broadside among them,
loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets and such
stufi', besides the great shot, which made a terrible havoc
amongst them.

When we were got on board, and out of danger, we had time
to examine into the oceasion of this fray; and, indwd, our super-
cargo, who had been often in those parts, .put me upon it; for
he said he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us
after Wehadmadeatruce, ifwehadnot done something to
provoke them to it. At length it me out, viz. That an old
woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had brought it
within our poles, with a young woman with her, who also brought
some roots or herbs; and while the old woman (whether. she was
mother to the young woman or no', they could not tell), was
selling us the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to
the wench that was with her; at which the old woman made a
great noise. However, the seaman would not quit his prize,
but carried her out of the old woman's sight, among the trees,
it being almost dark; the old woman went away without her;
and, as we suppose, made an outcry among the people she came
from; who, upon notice, raised this great army upon us in three
or four hours; and it was great odds but we had been all de-
stroyed.

One of our men was killed with a lance that was thrown at
him, just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the
tent they had made; the rest me of? free, all but the fellow
who was the occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough
for his black mistress, for we could not hear what became of
him a great while. We lay upon the shore two days after,
though the wind presented, and made signals for him; made
our boat sail up shore, and down shore, several leagues, but in
vain; so we were obliged to give him over; and if he alone
had suffered for it, the loss had been the less.

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on
shore once more, to try if I could learn any thing of him or
them; it was the third night after the action, that I had a great
mind to learn, if I could by any means, what mischief we had
done, and how the game stood on the Indian:' side. I was care-
ful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again; butI
ought indeed to have been sure, that the men I went with had
been under my command, before I engaged in a thing so ha-
zardous and mischievous, as I was brought into by it, without
any knowledge or desire.

We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in the ship,
besides the super-cargo and myself; and we landed two hours
before midnight, at the same place where the Indian: stood
drawn up the evening before. I landed here, because my design,
as I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitmd the field,
and if they had left any marks behind them, or of the mischief
we had done them; and I thought, if we could surprise one or
two of them, perhaps we might get our man again, by way of
exchange.

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two
bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the other.
We neither saw or heard any body stir when We landed; and
we marched up one body at a distance fiom the other, to the
place, but at first could see nothing, it being very dark; till by and
by, our boatswain, that led the first party, stumbled and fell over
a dead body. This made them halt awhile; for knowing by
the circumstances, that they were at the place where the Indian:
had stood, they waited for my coming up here; we concluded
to halt till the moon began to rise, which we knew would be in
j less than an hour, when we could easily discern the havock we
had made among them. We told two-and-thirty bodies upon
the ground, whereof two were not quite dead.- Some had an
"' arm, and some a leg, shot off; and one his head. Those that
I: were wounded, we supposed they had carried away.

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we
could come at the knowledge of, I was resolved for going on
board; but the boatswain and his party sent me word, that
they were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where
these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go along
with them; and if they could find them-as still they fancied
. they should, they did not doubt getting a good booty; and it
might be, they might find The. fifty there: that war the man's
, me we had lost.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough
what answer to have given them: for I should have commanded
them instantly on board, knowing it was not a hazard fit for us
to run, who had a ship, and ship loading in' our charge, and a
voyage to make, which depended very much upon the lives of
the men ; but as they sent me word they were resolved to go, and
only asked me and my company to go along with them, I posi-
tively refused it, and rose up (fir I we: sitting on the ground)
in order to go to the boat. One or two of the men began to
importune me to go; and, when I refused positively, began to
grumble, and say they were not under my command, and they
would go. Come, Yuck, says one of the men, will you go with
me? I will go for one. 7nd said he would; and another
followed; and then another; and, in a word, they all left me
but one, who I persuaded to stay; so the supercargo and I, with
the third man, went back to the boat, where we told them, we
would stay for them, and take care to take in as many of them
as should be left; for I told them, it was a mad thing they were
going about, and supposed most of them would run the fate of
Thom. j'qfl'r}.

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would
come of? again ;, and they would take care, (it. So away they
went. I intruted them to consider the ship, and the voyage;
that their lives were not their owm and that they were intrusted
with the voyage, in some measure: that if they miscarried, the
ship might be lost for want of their help; and that they could
not answer it to Goo or man. I said a great deal more to them
on that head, but I might as well have talked to the main--mast
of the ship; they were mad upon their journey; only they
gave me good words and begged I would not be angry; that
they would be very cautious, and they did not doubt but they
would be back again in about an hour at farthest: for the Indian
town, they said, was not above half a mile of; though they
found it above two miles before they got to it.

Well, they all went away, as above; and though the attempt
was desperate, and such as none but madmen would have gone
about, yet, to give them their due, they went about it as warily
as boldly. They were gallantly armed, that is true; for they
had every man a fuses or musquet, a bayonet, every man a

U pistol; some of them had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers;
1 and the boatswain, and two more, had pole-axes: besides all
which, they had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes. Bolder

fellows, and better provided never went about any wicked work

in the world.
When they went out, their chief design was plunder; and

they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a circum-

stance, which none of them were aware of, set them on fire with

" revenge, and made devils of them all. When they came to the

few Indian houses, which they thought had been the town, which
i; was not above half a mile off, they were under a great disappoint-
ment; for there was not above twelve or thirteen houses; and
where the town was, or how big, they knew not; they consulted

therefore what to do, and was some time before they could
resolve: for if they fell upon these, they must cut all their
throats; and it was ten to one but some of them might escape,
it being in the night, though the moon was up; and if one es'
caped, he would run away, and raise all the town, so they should
have a whole army upon them. Again, on the other hand,

y if they went away, and left those untouched (for the people were

all asleep) they could not tell which way to look for the town.
However, the last was the best advice; so they resolved to
leave them, and look for the town as well as they could. They

. went on a little way, and found a cow tied to a tree; this they

presently concluded would be a good guide to them; for they
said the cow' certainly belonged to the town before them, or the
town behind them ; and if they untied her, they should see which
way she went: if she went back, they had nothing to say to her;

i but if she went forward, they had nothing to do but to' follow

her; so they cut the cord, which was made of ' twisted flags, and
Y
the cow went on before them. In a word, the cow led them
directly to the town, which, as they report, consisted of above
200 houses, or huts; and in some of these they found several
families living together.

Here they found all in silence; as profoundly secure, as sleep
and a country that had never seen an enemy of that kind, could
make them. And first they called mother council, to consider
what they had to do; and, in a word, they resolved to divide
themselves into three bodies, and to set three houses on fire in
three parts of the town; and as the men came out to seize them:
and bind them : if any resisted, they need not be asked what to
do then; and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder; but
they resolved to march silently first through the town, and see
what dimensions it was of, and if they might venture upon it or
no.
They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture
upon them; but while they were animating one another to the
work, three of them, that were a little before the rest, called out
aloud, and told them they had found Thom. 72f ; they all run
up to the place, and so it was indeed, for there they found the
poor fellow, hanged up halted by one arm, and his throat cut.
There was an Indian house just by the tree, where they found
sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians, who had been con-
cemed in the fray with us before, and two or three of them
wounded with our shot; and our men found they were awake,

and talking one to another in that house, but knew not their
number.

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as
before, that they swore to one another they would be revenged,
and that not an India>> that came into their hands should have
any quarter; and to work they went immediately; and yet not
so madlyas bytherageandfurytheywereinmightbe ex--
pected. Theirfirstearewas to get something thatwouldsoon
takefire; butafeeralittle search, theyfound that would be to
no purpose; but the most of the houses were low, and thatched
withflzgsor rushesmfwhich the oountryis full; so they pre-
sently made some wild fire,aswe all it, bywetting a little pow.
der in the palmsoftheirhands; and in aquarterofan hour-they
set the town on fire in four or five places; and particularly that
housewherethe Indianswerenotgone to bed. Assoonasthe
fire began to blaze,thepoorfi-ighted creatures beganeo rushout
to save their lives; but met with their fate in the attempt, and
especially at the door, where they drove them back, the boatsde
himself killing one or two with his pole-axe; the house being
large, and many in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a
hand-grenado, and threw it among them, which at first frighmd
them; but when it burst, made such havock among them, that
they cried out in a hideous manner. .

In short, most of the Indians who were in the open part of the
house, were killed or hurt with the grmado, except two or three

more, who pressed to the door, which the boatswain and two

more kept, with the bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and
dispatched all that came that way. But therewasanother apart-
ment in the house, where the prince, or king, or whatever he
was, and several others, were; and these they kept in, till the
house, which was by this time all of: light flame, fell in upon
them, and they were-smothered, or burnt together.

While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, and
especially, when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being
night, seemed to be just by me.

My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men too,
seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what the matter
was, or what danger I was in; especially hearing the guns too;
for by this time they began to use their fire-arms. A thousand
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the supercargo,
what should become of us; and at last, though he could ill spare
any more men, yet, not knowing what exigence we might be in,
he takes another boat, and with thirteen men and himself comes
on shore to me.

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat,
with no more than two men ; and though hewas glad that we were
well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to know what
was doing; for the noise continued, and the flame increased. In
short it was next to an impossibility for any men in the world to
restrain their curiosity to know what had happened, or the con-
cern for the safety of the men. In a word, the captain told me,
he would go and help his men, let what would come. I argued
with him, as I did before with the men, the safety of the ship,
the danger of the voyage, the interests of the owners and mer-
chants, (it. and told him I would go, and the two men, and only
see if we could, at a distance, learn what was like to be the event,
and come back and tell him.

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk to the
rest before; he would go, he said, and he only wished he had
left but ten men in ship; for he could not think of having his
men lost for want of help: he had rather lose the ship, the voy-
age, and his life and all. And away went he. '

In a word,.I was no, more able to stay behind now than I was
to persuade them not to go; so, in short, the captain ordered
two men to row back the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more,
leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and that when they came
back, six men should keep the two boats, and six more come after
us; so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the whole
ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were lost
in the late quarrel which brought this mischief on.
. Being now on the march, ou may be sure we felt little of the
ground we trod on; and being guided by the fire, we kept no
path, but went directly to the place of the flame. If the noise of
the guns were surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people
were now of quite another nature, and filled us with horror. I
must confess I never was at the sacking a city, or at the taking
a town by storm. I had heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drag-
lmla, in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and child; and I had
- ' read of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdebaurg, and cutting
the throats of 22,000 of all sexes; but I never had an idea of the
- - thing itself before; nor is it possible to describe it, or the horror
that was upon our minds at hearing it.
However, we went on, and at. length, came to the town, though
there was no entering the streets of it for the fire. The first ob-
4' ject we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or rather the
ashes of it, for the house was consumed; and just before it: plain
now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and three
women killed; and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the
heap among the fire. In short, there Were such instances of a
. rage altogether barbarous, and of a fiiry something beyond what
was human, that we thought it impossible our men could be
guilty of it; or if they were the authors of it, we thought they
; ought to be every one of them put to the worst of deaths. But
F thiswasnotall; wesawthe fireincreesed forward,and theory
went on, just as the fire went on, so that we were in the utmost
confusion. ' We advaneed a little way farther; and beheld, to our

3"
'7
astonishment, three women naked, and crying in a most dreadful
manner, come flying, as if they had indeed had wings, and after
them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror and
consternation, with three of our English butchers (for I can all
them no better) in their rear; who, when they could not over-
take them, fired in among them. and one that was killed by their
shot, fell down in our sight; when the rest saw us, believing us
to be their enemies, and that we would murder them, as well as
those that pursued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek,
especially the women; and two of them fell down as if already
dead with the fright.

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood run chill in
my veins when I saw this ; and I believe, had the three English
sailors that pursued them come on, I had made our men kill them
all. However, we took some ways to let the poor flying crea-
tures know that we would not hurt them; and immediately they
came up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands lifted up,
made piteous lamentation to us to save them, which we let them
know we would: whereupon they crept all together in a huddle,
close behind us, as for protection. I left my men drawn up to-
gether, and charged them to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get
at some of our people, and see what devil it was possessed them,
and what they intended to do; and, in a word, to command them
all"; assuring them, that if they staid till day-light, they would
have a hundred thousand men about their ears; I say, I left them,
and went among thme flying people, taking only two of our men
with me; and there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among them.
Some of them had their feet terribly burnt with trampling and
running through the fire; others their hands burnt; one of the
women had fallen down in the fire, and was very much burnt
before she could get out again; and two or three of the men had
cuts in their backs and thighs, from our men pursuing; and an-
other was shot through the body, and died while I was there.
I would fain have learned what the occasion ofsall this was,
but I could not understand one word they said, though by signs
I perceived that some of them knew not what was the ocea-
sion themselves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this out-

rageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back to

my own men, and resolved to go into the middle of the town
through the fire, or whatever might be in the way, and put an
end to it cost what it would: accordingly, as soon as I came back
to my men, I told them my resolution, and commanded them to
follow me, when in the very moment came four of our men, with
the boatswain at their head, roving over the heaps of bodies they

, had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they wanted
3' more people to massacre; when our men hallooed to them as

loud as they could halloo; and, with much ado, one of them made
them hear; so that they knew who we were, and came up to us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a

. shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come;
' and without bearing to hear me, Captain, says he, noble captain,

I am glad you are come; we have not half done yet. Villanous
hell--hound dogs! I will kill as many of them as poor Tom has

. hairs upon his head. We have sworn to spare none of them; we
" will root out the very nation of them from the earth: and thus

he run on, out of breath too with action, and would not give us
leave to speak a word.

At last, raising my voice that I might silence him a little.
Barbarous dog! said I, what are you doing? I will not have one
creature touched more, upon pain of death. I charge you, upon
your life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a

' dead man this minute.

. Why, Sir, says he, do you know what you do, or what they
have done? If you want a reason for what we have done, some
hither; and with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging
upon a tree, with his throat cut.
I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time should
have been forward enough; but I thought they had carried their
rage too far, and thought of jacob': words to his sons Simeon and
Levi, " Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath,
for ii was cruel." But I had now a new task upon my hands;
For when the men I carried with me saw the sight, as I had done,
I had as much to do to restrain them as I should have had with
the other; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and told
me, in their hearing, that he was only concemed for fear of the
men being overpowered; for, as to the people, he thought not
one of them ought to live ; for they had all glutted themselves with
the murder of the poor man, and that they ought to be used like
murderers: upon these words, away run eight of my men with
the boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody work; and
I, seeing it quite out of my power to restraint them, came away
pensive and sad; for I could not bear the sight, much 'less the
horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into their
hands.

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and
two men, and with these I walked back to the boats. It was a
very great piece of fully in me, I confess, to venture back as it
Were alone; for as it began now to be almost day, and the darm
had run over the country, there stood about forty men, armed
with lances and bows, at the little place where the twelve or thir-
teen houses stood, mentioned before; but by accident] missed
the place, and came directly to the sea-side; and by the time I
got to the sea-side, it was broad day: immediately I took the
pinnace, and went aboard, and sent her back to assist the men in
what might happen.

I observed, about the time that I came to the boat-side, that
the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in about
half an hour after I got on board, I heard a volley of our men's
fire-arms, and saw a great smoke; this, as I understood after-
wards, was, our men falling upon the men, who, as I said, stood
at the few houses on the way; of whom they killed sixteen or
seventeen, and set all thme houses on fire, but did not meddle

with the women or children.

By that time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace,
our men began to appear ; they came dropping in, some and some ;
not in two bodies, and in form, as they went, but all in heaps,
straggling here and there in such a manner, that a small force of
resolute men might have cut them all ofl'.

But the dread of them was upon the whole country. And the
men were amazed and surprised, and so frighted, that, I believe,
a hundred of them would have tied at the sight of but five of our
men. Nor in all this terrible action was there a man that made
any considerable defence; they were so surprised between the
terror of the fire, and the sudden attack of our men in the dark,
that they knew not which way to turn themselves; for if they

.- fled one way they were met by one party; if back again, by

, another; so that they were every where knocked down. Nor
' did any of our men receive the least hurt, except one that strained

m_v_w-.

his foot, and another had one of his hands very much burnt.

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and, indeed,
withiall the men, in my mind, but with him in particular; as
well for his acting so out of his duty, as commander of the ship,
and having the charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompt~
ing, rather than cooling, the rage of his men in so bloody and
cruel an enterprise. My nephew answered me very respectfully;
but told me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman, who
they had murdered in such a cruel and barbarous manner, he was
not master of himself, neither could he govern his passion; he
owned he should not have done so, as he was commander of the

I ship; butashewasaman, and naturemoved him,hecould not

bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not subject to me
v a
at all ; and they knew it well enough, so they took no notice of
my dislike.

The next day we set sail; so we never heard any more of it.
Our men differed in the account of the number they killed; some
said one thing, some another. But, according to the best of their
accounts put altogether, they killed, or destroyed, about 150
people, men, women, and children; and left not a house standing
in the town.

As for the poor fellow, Tho. yefiiyr, as he was quite dead, for
his throat was so cut that his head was half off, it would do him
no service to bring him away; so they left him where they found
him, only took him down from the tee where he was hanged by
one hand.

However just our men thought this action, I was against them
in it; and I always, after that time, told them GOD would blast
the voyage; for I looked upon all the blood they shed that night
to be murder in them; for though it is true that they had killed
9720. 2740:, yet it was as true that yefliy: was the aggressor, had
broken the truce, and had violated or debauched a young woman
of thde who came down to them innocently, and on the faith of
their public capitulation.

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterwards
on board. He said, it. is true that we seemed to break the
truce, but really had not; and that the war was begun the night
before by the natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed
one of our men without any just provocation; so that as we were
in a capacity to fight them now, we might also be in a capacity
to do ourselves justice upon them in an extraordinary manner;
that though the poor man had taken a little liberty with a wench,
he ought not to have been murdered, and that in such a villanOus
manner; and that they did nothing but what was just, and what
the laws of Goo allowed to be done to murderers

One would think this should have been enough to have warned
as against going on shore among hesthens and barbarians; but it
is impossibletomake mankind wise, but at their own expense;
and their experience meme to be always of most use to them,
when it is dearest bought.

We were now bound to the gulph of Persia, and from thence
to the coast of Cormandel, only to touch at Surat; but the chief
of the supercargo's design lay at the bay of Bengal, where if he
missed of his business outward-bound, he was to go up to China,
and return to the coast as he came home.

The first disaster that befel us was in the gulph of Persia,
where five of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian side

of the gulph, were surrounded by the Arabian, and either all
killed, or carried away into slavery; the rest of the boat's crew
were not able to rescue them, and had but just time to get off
their boat. I began to upbraid them with the just retribution of
Heaven in this case; but the boatswain very warmly told me, he
thought I went farther in my consul-es than I could shew any
warrant for in scripture, and referred to the I 3 St. Luke, vets.
4th. where our Saviour intimates, that those men on whom the
Tower of Silva>>; fell were not sinners above all the Galilean: ; '
but that which, indeed, put me to silence in the ease, was, that
none of those five men, who were now lost, were of the number
of those who went on shore to the massacre of Mdagasear (to I
always called it, though our men eauld not hear the word massacre
with an] patience) : and, indeed, this last circumstance, as I have
said, put me to silence for the present.

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse
consequences than I expected; and the boatswain, who had been
the head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told"
me, he found that I continually brought that affair upon the
stage; that I made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the
men very ill on that account,andhimselfin particular; that as I
was but a passenger, and had no command in the ship, or con-
cern in the voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they
did not know but I might have some ill design in my head, and,
perhaps, to call them to an account for it, when they came to
England; and that therefore, unless I would resolve to have done
with it, and also not to concern myself any farther with him, or
any of his afiiiirs, he would leave the ship; for he did not think
it was safe to sail with me among them.

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told
him, that I did confess that I had all along opposed the mum:
of Madagauar, for such I would always call it; and that I had
on all occasions spoken my mind freely about it, though not
more upon him than any of the rest; that as to my having no
command in the ship, that was true, nor did I exercise any
authority, only took my liberty of speaking my mind in things
which publicly concerned us all; and what concern I had in the
voyage, that was none of his business; that I was a considerable
owner of the ship, and in that claim I conceived I had a right to
speak, even farther than I had yet done, and would not be
accountable to him, or any one else; and began to be a little
warm with him: he made but little reply to me at that time, and
I thought that affair had been over. We were at this time in
the road to Bengal ,- and, being willing to see the place, I went
on shore with the supermrgo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself;
and towards evening was preparing to go on board, when one of
the men came to me, and told me, he would not have me trouble
myself to come down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry
me on board any more. Any one may guess what a surprise I
was in at so insolent a message; and I asked the man who bade
him deliver that errand to me? He told me the cockswain. I
said no more to the fellow, but bad him let them know he had
delivered his message, and that I had given him no answer to it.

I immediately went, and found out the supermgo, and told
him the story, adding, what I presently foresaw, viz. that there
wouldeertainly be a mutinyin the ship; and entreated him-to
go immediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint
the captain of it: but I might have spared this intelligence, for,
before I hadspolten tohim on shore, the matterwas efi'ectedon
board: the boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and in a word,
all the inferior ofiicers, as soon as I was gone of in the boat,
came up to the quarter--deck, and desired to speak with the cap-
tain; and there the boatswain, making a long harangue (for the
fellow talked very well), and repeating all he had said to me,
told the captain in few words, that as I was now gone peaceably
on shore, they were lath to use any violence with me; which, if
I had not gone on shore, they would otherwise have done, to

r oblige me to have gone. They therefore thought lit to tell him,

E that as they shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his

1' command, they would perform it well and faithfully: but if I
would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they
would all leave the ship, and sail no farther with him: and at that
word ALL, he turned his face about towards the main-mast,
which was, it seems, the signal agreed on between them ; at which
all the seamen being got together there, cried out, One and ALL,
On and ALL!

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great
presence of mind, and though he was surprised, you may be
sure, at the thing, yet he told them calmly he would consider of
the thing; but that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken
to me about it: he used some arguments with them, to shew
them the unreasonablenees and injustice of the thing; but it was
all in vain; they swore, and shook hands round, before his face,
that they would go all on shore, unless he would engage to them
not to suffer me to come any more on board the ship.

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation
tome,anddidnotknowhowl might takeit; so hebegan to
talk cavalierly to them; told them that I was a very considerable
owner of the ship, and that in justice he could not put me out of
my own house; that this was next door to serving me as the
famous pirate Kid had done, who made the mutiny in a ship, set
the captain on shore in an uninhabited island, and run away with
the ship; that let them go into what ship they would, if ever they
came to England again, it would cost them clear; that the ship was
mine, and that he could not put me out of it; and that he would
rather lose the ship, and the voyage too than disoinge me so
much ; so they might do as they pleased. However, he would
go on shore, and talk with me on shore; and invited the boat--
swain to go with him, and perhaps they might accommodate the
matter with me.

But they all rejected the proposal; and said they would have
nothing to do with me any more, neither on board, or on shore;
and if I came on board, they would all go on shore. Well,
said the captain, if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore,
and talk with him : so away he came to me with this account,
a little after the message had been brought to me from the cock-
swam.

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; forI was
not without apprehensions that they would confine him by
violence, set sail and run away with the ship; and then I had
been stripped naked, in a remote country, and nothing to help
myself; in short, I had been in a worse case then when I was
all alone in the island.

But they had not come that length, it seems, to my great
satisfaction; and when my nephew told me what they had
said to him, and how they had sworn, and shook hands, that they
would one and all leave the ship, if I was sufi'ered to come on
board, I told him, he should not be concerned at it at all, for I
would stay on shore: I only desired he would take care and send
me all my necessary things on shore, and leave me a sufficient
sum of money, and I would find my way to England as well as I
could.
This was 'a heavy piece of news to my nephew; but there
was no way to help it but to comply with it. So, in short, he went
on board the ship again, and satisfied the men, that his uncle had
yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his goods from
on board the ship. So the matter was over in a very few hours,
the men returned to their duty, and I began to consider what
course I should steer.

I was now alone in the remotest part of the world, as I think
I may all it; for I was near three thousand leagues, by sea,
farther off from England than I was at my island; only, it is
true, I might travel here by land, over the Great Mogul's coun-
try to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up the
gulph of Persia, and from thence might take the way of the
caravans, over the desert of dralia to Aleppo and Seanderaan;
from thence by see again to Italy, and so over land into France ;
and this, put together, might be, at least, a full diameter of the
globe; but, if it were to be measured, I suppose it would appear
to be a great deal more.

I had another way before me, which was to wait for some
English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Ashen, on the
island of Sumatra, and get a passage on board them for England,
but as I came hither without any concern with the English East
India Company, so it would be difficult to go from hence without
their licence, unless with great favour of the captains of the
ships, or of the company's factors; and to both I was an utter
stranger.

, HercI had the particular pleasure, speaking by contraries, to
. see the ship set sail without me; a treatment, I think, a man in
R my circumstances scarce ever met with, except from pirates run-
'ng away with the ship, and setting those that would not agree
'th their villany on shore: indeed, this was the next door to it,
both ways. However, my nephew left me two servants, or
7 rather, one companion, and one servant; the first was clerk to520 - Lira mu Abyss-runs

the purser, who he engaged to go with me; and the other was
his own servant. I took me also a good lodging in the house of
an English woman, where several merchants lodged, some French,
two Italians, or rather Jews, and one Englirhmn. Here I was
handsomely enough entertained; and, thatI might not be said
to run rashly upon any thing, I stayed here above nine months,
considering what course to cake, and how to manage myself.
I had some English goods with me of value, and a considerable
sum of money; my nephew fumishing me with a thousand
pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for more, if I had occasion,
that I might not be straitened, whatever might happen.

I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage too; and,
as I originally intended, I bought here some very good dia-
monds, which, of all other things, was the most proper for me
in my present circumstances, bemuse I might always carry my
whole estate about me.

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my re-
turn to England, but none falling out to my mind, the English
merchant, who lodged with me, and who I had contracted an
intimate acquaintance with, me to me one morning: Country-
man, says he, I have a project to communicate to you, which,
as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with
yours also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it.

Here we are posted, my: he, you by accident, and I by my
own choice, in a part of the world very remote from our own
country; but it is in a country where, by us who understand
trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got: if you
will put a thousand pound to my thousand pound, we will hire
a ship here, the first we can get to our minds; you shall be cap-
min, I will be merchant, and we will go a trading voyage to
China : for what should we stand still for? The whole world
is in motion, rolling round and round; all the cmturu of Goo,
heavenly bodies and earthly. are busy and diligent: why should
we be idle? There are no drones in the world but men: why
should we be of that number?

I liked his proposal very well; and the more, because it
:- seemed to be expressed with so much good-will, and in so
7- friendly a manner. I will not say, but that I might, by my
; loose and unhinged circumstances, be the fitter to embrace a
" proposal for trade, or, indeed, for any thing else; whereas,
' otherwise, trade was none of my element: however,-I might,
' perhaps, say, with some truth, that if trade was not my ele-
_ ment, rambling was; and no proposal for seeing any part of
3' the world which I had never seen before, could possibly come
I. amiss to me.
' It was, however, some time before we could get a ship to
' our minds; and when we got a vessel, it was not easy to get
3 English sailors; that is to say, so many as were necessary to
; govern the voyage, and manage the sailors which we should
- pick up there. After some time we got a mate, a boatswain,
' = d a gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, and three Portugueu,
oremast men; with these, we found we could do well enough,
. ving Indian seamen, such as they are, to make up.
. There are so many travellers who have wrote the history of
_' ' eir voyages and travels this way, that it would be very little
o'version to any body, to give a long account of the places we
* ent to, and the people who inhabit there: those things I leave
0 others, and refer the reader to those journals and travels of
uglirhm, of which, many I find, are published, and more
romised every day. It is enough to me to tell you, that I made
. is voyage .to Arm the island of Sumatra, and from thence
. Sim, where fie exchanged some of our wares for opium, and
'j ome arraclt; the first, a commodity which bears a great price
4'; among the Chinese, and which, at that time, was very much
' wanted there; ins word, wewent up to Subaru; made avery
great voyage; was eight months out; and returned to Bengals
and I was very well satisfied with my adventure. I observe,
that our people' in England often admire how the officers, which
the Company send into India, and the merchants which gene-
rally stay there, get such very great estams as they do, and
sometimes come home worth 60 to 70 and too thousand pounds
at a time.

But it is no wonder, or, at least, we shall see so much farther
into it, when we consider the innumerable ports and places where
they have a free commerce, that it will then be no wonder; and
much less will it be so, when we consider, that at all those places
and ports where the English ships come, there is so much, and
such constant demand for the growth of all other countries, that
there is a certain vent for the returns, as well as a market abroad
for the goods carried out.

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much
money by the first adventure, and such an insight into the me-
thod of getting more, that, had I been twenty year younger, I
should have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought no
farther for making my fortune: but what was all this to a man
on the wrong side of threescore, that was rich enough, and came
abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world,
than a covetous desire of getting it? And, indeed, I think, it
is with great justice that I now call it a restless desire; for it
was so: when I was at home, I was restless to go abroad; and
now I was abroad, Iwas restless to be at home. I say, what
was this gain to me? I was rich enough; nor had I any uneasy
desires about getting more money; and therefore, the profits of
the voyage to me, were things of no great'rce for the prompt-
ing me forward to farther undertakings; and I drought, that by
thisvoyage I had madenoprogress atall; becauselwas come
back, as I might call it, to the place fi'om whence I came, as to
a home; whereas my eye, which, like that which Solomon speaks
of, was never ratin with racing, was still more desirous of
wandering and seeing. I was come into a part of the world
which I wasneverin before; and that part in particular, which
Ihadheardmuchof; andwas resolved tosee asmuchofasl
could; and then I thought, I might say, I had seen all the world
that was worth seeing.

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions. Ido
not name this to insist upon my own, for I acknowledge his
were the most just, and the most suited to the end of a mer-
chant's life; who, when he is abroad upon adventures, it is his
wisdom to stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he is
like to get the most money by. My new friend kept himself
to the nature of the thing, and would have been content to have
gone, like a carrier's horse, always to the same inn, backward
and forward, provided he could, as he called it, find his account
in it; on the other hand, mine wasthe notion of a mad rambling
boy, that never ones to see a thing twice over.

But this was not all. I had a kind of impatience upon me
to be nearer home, and yet the most unsettled resolution imagi-
nable which way to go. In the interval of these consultations,
my friend, who was always upon the search for business, pro-
posed anothcr voyage to me, among the Spice Islands; and to
bring home a loading of cloves from the Mnillar, or there-
abouts; places where, indeed, the Dtmh do trade, but islands
belonging partly to the Spaniards; though we went not so far,
but to some other, where they have not the whole power as they
have at Botanic, Ceylon, &c. We were not long in preparing
for this voyage; the chief difficulty was in bringing me to come
into it; however, at last, nothing else offering, and finding that
really stirring about and trading, the profit being so great, and,
as I may say, certain, had more pleasure in it, and moreaatisfac-
tion to the mind, than sitting still; which, to me especially, was
the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on his voyage too: which
we made very succesfirlly, touching at Borneo, and several islands,
whose names I do not remember, and came home in about five
months. We sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves, and some
nutmegs, to the Perrier: merchants, who carried them away for
the Gulph; and, making near five of one, we really got a great
deal of money.

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me.
Well now, said he, with a sort of agreeable insulting my indo-
lent temper, is not this better than walking about here like a man
of nothing to do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense
and ignorance of the Pagans? Why, truly, says I, my friend,
I think it is; and I begin to be a convert to the principles of
merchandizing. But I must tell you, said I, by the way, you do
not know what I am a doing; for if once I conquer my back
wardness, and embark heartily, as old as I am, I shall harass you
up and down the world till I tire you; for I shall pursue it so
eagerly, I shall never let you lie still.

But to be short with my speculations: a little while after this,
there came in a Dutch ship from Bala'via; she was a coaster,
not an European trader, and of about two hundred ton burden:
the men, as they pretended, having been so sickly, that the cap-
tain had not men enough to go to sea with, he lay by at Bengal,-
and, having it seems got money enough, or being willing, for
other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public notice, that he
would sell his ship: this came to my ears before my new partner
heard of it; and I had a great mind to buy it. So I goes home
to him, and told him of it: he considered awhile, for he was no
rash man neither; but musing some time, he replied, She is a
little too big; but, however, we will have her. Accordingly
We bought the ship; and, agreeing with the master, we paid for
her, and took possession: when we had done so, we resolved to
entertain the men, if we could, to join them with those we had,
for the pursuing our business; but on a sudden, they having,
received not their wages, but their share of it: money, not one
of them was to be found. We inquired much about them, and
at length were told, that they were all gone together, by land,
to Agra, the great city of the Mogul': residence; and from
thence were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to the gulph of
Persia.

Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, as that I
missed the opportunity of going with them, for such a ramble,
I thought, and in such company as would both have guarded
me, and diverted me, would have suited mightily with my great
design; and I should both have seen the world, and gone home-
wards too; but I was much better satisfied a few days after,
when I came to know what sort of fellows they were; for, in
short, their history was, that this man they called captain was
the gunner only, not the commander; that they had been a
trading voyage, in which they were attacked on shore by some
of the Malaccans, who had killed the captain and three of his
men; and that after the captain was killed, these men, eleven in
number, had resolved to run away with the ship, which they
did; and had brought her in at the bay of Bengal, leaving the
mate and five men more on shore; of whom we shall hear
farther.

Well; let them come by the ship how they would, we came
honesrly by her, a: we thought; though we did not, I confess,
examine into things so exactly as we ought; for we never in-
quired any thing of the seamen, who, if we had examined, would
certainly have faltered in their account, contradicted one another,
and perhaps have contradicted themselves; or, one how or other,
we should have seen reason to have suspected them: but the
man shewed us a bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clot.
tars/town, or some such name (for I suppose it was all a forgery),
and called himself by that name; and we could not contradict
him; and being withal a little too unwary, or at least, having
no suspicion of tile thing, we went through with our bargain. ;
We picked up some more English seamen here after this, and
some Dutch; and now we resolved for a second voyage to the
south--east, for cloves, 5:. that is to say, among the Philippine
and Malacca isles; and, in short, not to fill this part of my story
with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remarkable, I Spent,

from first to last, six years in this country, trading from, port to
port, backward and forward, and with very good success; and
was now the last year with my new partner, going in the ship
above-mentioned, on a voyage to China; but designing first to
go to Siam, to buy rice.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up
and down a great while in the straits of Mlacca, and among the
islands, we were no sooner got clear of those diflicult seas, but
we found our ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by
all our industry, to find out where it was. This forced us to
make for some port; and my partner, who knew the country
better than I did, directed the eaptain to put into the river of
Camhmlia; for I had made the English mate, on: Mr. Thompson,
captain, not being willing to take the charge if the ship upon in}-
:rlf. This river lies on the north side of the great bay or gulph
which goes up to Siam.

While we were here, and going often on shore for refi'esh-
ment, there comes to me one day an Englishman, and he was,
it seems, a gunner's mate on board an English East India ship,
which rode in the same river, up at or near the city of Cambodia.
What brought him hither we knew not; but he comes up to
me, and, speaking English, Sir, says he, you are a stranger to
me, and I to you; but I have something to tell you, that very
nearly concerns you.

I looked steadily at him a good while, and thought at first 1
had known him, but I did not. If it very nearly concerns me,
said I, and not yourself, what moyes you to tell it me? I am
moved, says he, by the imminmt danger you are in; and, for
aught I see, you have no knowledge of it. I know no danger
I amin,said I,butthat myship is leaky, andIeannotfindit
out; but I purpow to lay her aground to-morrow, to see if I can
find it. But, Sir, says he, leaky or not leaky, find it or not find
it, you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore to-morrow,
. when you hear what I have to say to you. Do you know, Sir,
said he, the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this
' river? And there are two large English ships about five league;
on this side, and three Dutch. Well, mid I, and what is that to
me? Why, Sir, my: be, is it for a man that is upon such ad-
, ventures as you are, to come into a port, and not examine first
' what ships there are there, and whether he is able to deal with
them? I suppose you do not think you are a match for them?
I was amused very much at his discourse, but not amazed at it;
for I could not conceive what he meant; and I turned short
upon him, and said, Sir, I wish you would explain yourself; I
cannot imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any Com-

pany's ships, or Dun/z ships; I am no interloper; what an they
have to say to me?

. He looked like a man half angry, half pleased; and, pausing

awhile, but smiling, Well, Sir, my: be, if you think yourself se-
cure, you must take your chance; I am sorry your fate should
blind you against good advice; but assure yourself, if you do
not put to sea immediately, you will the very next tide be attacked
by five long-boats full of men; and, perhaps if you are taken,
you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined
afterwards. I thought, Sir, added he, I should have met with
.abetterreoeptionthan this, for doing youapieoeofserviceof
such importance. I can never be ungrateful, .m'd I, for any
Iavicgortoanymanthatoifers me anykindnea; butitis
past my comprehension, said I, what they should have such a
designuponmefor. Howeyer, sin-cyan] thereisnotimeto
belosganddutthereissomevillanous design in hlndagainat
me, Iwill go on board this minute, and put to sea immediately, if
my men can stop the leak, or if we can swim without stopping
it. But, Sir, said I, shall I go away ignorant of the reason of
all this? Can you give me no farther light into it?

I can tell you but part of the story, Sir, says he; but I have
a Dutch seaman here with me, and, I believe, I could persuade
him to tell you the rest; but there is scarce time for it. But
the short of the story is this, the first part of which, I suppose,
you know well enough, viz. That you was with this ship at
Sumatra; that there your captain was murdered by the Malaa
cam, with three of his men; and that you, or some of those that
were on board with you, ran away with the ship, and are since
turned PIRATES. This is the sum of the story, and you will
all be seized as pirates, I can assure you, and executed with very
little ceremony ; for you know merchants' ships shew but little
law to pirates, if they get them into their power.

Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank you ; and
though I know nothing that we have done, like what you talk
of, but am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship; yet
seeing such work is a doing, as you say, and that you seem to
mean honestly, I will be upon my guard. Nay, Sir, says he, do
not talk of being upon your guard; the best defence is to be out
of the danger: if you have any regard to your life, and the life
of all your men, put out to sea without fail at high-water; and
as you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone too far
out before they can come down; for they came away at high--
water; and as they have twenty miles to come, you get near two
hours of them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the
length of the way: besides, as they are only boats, and not ships,
they will not venture to follow you out far to sea, especially if it
blows.

Well, say: I, you have been very kind in. this: What shall I
do for you to make you amends? Sir, says he, you may not be so
willing to make me any amends, beeause you may not be con-
vincedofthe truthofit: Iwill make an ofi'erto you; Have"
nineteen months pay due to me on board the ship --, which-
I came out of England in; and the Dateline>>, that is with me,-
has seven months' pay due to him; if you will make good our
pay to us, we will go along with you. If you find nothing
more in it, we will desire no more; but if we do convince you,
that we have saved your lives, and the ship, and the lives of all

' the men in her, We will leave the rest to you.

I consented to this readily ; and went immediame on board,
and the two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's side,
my partner, who was on board, came on the quarter-deck, and
called to me with a great deal of joy, 0 1w! 0 Ito! we have
stopped the leak! we have stopped the leak ! Say you so, said I,
thank Goo; but weigh the anchor then immediately: Weigh!
my: he, what do you mean by that? What is the matter? so]:
71!. Ask no questions, my: I, but all hands to work, and weigh
without losing a minute. He wa'surprised: But however, he
called the captain, and he immediately ordered the anchor to be
got up; and though the tide was not quite done, yet a little

- land--breeze blowing, we stood out to sea; then I called him into
'; the eabin, and told him the story at large; and we ealled in the
E men,andtheytold us the rest ofit: but as it tookusup a great

deal of time, so before we had done, a seaman comes to the cabin-
door,andeallsout to us,that theeaptain bade him tell us,we
were chased: Chased, Mid I, by who, and by what? By five
sloops, or boats, says the fellow, full of men. Very well, said
I; then it is apparentthercis something in it. Inthenext
place, I ordered all our men to be ealled up: and told them,
thattherewasadesigntoseizethe ship, andtotake us'for
pirates; and shed them, ifthey would stand by us, andbyone
another? The men answered, cheerfully, that one-and ill,
they would live and die with'us. Then I asked the eaptain,
z
what way he thought best for us to manage a fight with them:
for resist them I was resolved we would, and that to the last
drop. He said, readily, that the way was to keep them off with
our great shot as long as we could, and then to fire at them with
our small arms, as long as we could, but when neither of these
would do any longer, we should retire to our close quarters; per-
haps they had not materials to break open our bulk-heads, or
get in upon us.

The gunner had, in the mean time, order to bring two guns
to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and
loaded them with musquet-bullets, and small pieces of old iron,
and what next came to hand; and thus we made ready for fight;
but all this while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could
see the boats at a distance, being five large long-boat: following
us, with all the sail they could make.

Two of those boats, which, by our glasses, we could see were
English, out-sailed the rest, were near two leagues a-head of
them, and gained upon us considerably ; so that we found they
would come up with us: upon which we fired a gun without a
shot, to intimate that they should bring to; and We put out a
flag of truce, as a signal for parley; but they kept crowding
after us, till they came within shot: upon this we took in our
white flag, they having made no answer to it, hung out the red
flag, and fired at them with a shot. Notwithstanding this, they
came on till they were near enough to call to them with a speck-
ing trumpet, which we had on board; so we called to them, and
bade them keep off at their peril.

It was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavoured to come
under our stern, so to board us on our quarter. Upon which,
seeing they were resolute for mischief, and depended upon the
strength that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so
that they lay upon our broadside, when immediately we fired
five gunsat them; one ofthem had beenlevelled so true, aseo
carry away the stern of the hinder-most boat, and bring them to
the necessity of taking down their sail, and running all to the
head ofthe boat to keep her from sinking; so she lay by, and
had enough of it; but seeing the foremost boat crowd on after
us, we made ready to fire at her in particular.

While this was doing, one of the three boats thatwas behind,
being forwarder than the other two, made up to the boat which
we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could afterwards see her
take out the men: we called again to the foremost boat, and
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what was her busi-
ness with us; but had no answer: only she crowded close under
our stern. Upon this our gunner, who was a very dexterous
fellow, run out his two chase guns, and fired again at her; but
the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their caps,
and came on; but the gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired
among them the second time; one shot of which, though it
missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could
easily see had done a great deal of mischief among them; but
we, taking no notice of that, weared the ship again, and brought
our quarter to bear upon them; and, firing three guns more,

' we found the boat was split almost to pieces; in particular, her

rudder, and a piece of her stern, was shot quite away; so they
handed their sail immediately, and were in great disorder: but,
to complete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at
them again; where he hit them we could not tell, but we found
the boat was sinking, and some of the men already in the water.
Upon this I immediately manned out our pinnace, which we
had kept close by our side, with orders to pick up some of the
men, if they could, and save them from drowning, and immedi-
ately to come on boardwith them; because we sawthe rest of
the boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnaee followed
their orders, and took upthreemen; one ofwhichwasjust
drowning, and it was a good while before we could recover him.
As soon as they were on board, we crowded all the sail we could
make, and stood farther out to see; and we found that when the
other three boats came up to the first two, they gave over their
chace.

Being thus delivered from a danger, which though I knew not
the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I appre-
hended, I took care that we would change our course, and not
let any one imagine whither we were going; so we stood out to
sea eastward, quite out of the course of all European ships, whe-
ther they were bound to China, or any where else, within the
commerce of the European nations.

When we were now at sea, we began to consult with the two
seamen, and inquire first, what the meaning of all this should
be? And the Duttlmmn let us into the secret of it at once;
telling us, that the fellow that sold us the ship, a: we said, was
no more than a thief that had run away with her. Then he told
us how the captain, whose name too he told us, though I do not
remember, was treacherously murdered by the natives on the
coast of Alalacca, with three of his men; and that he, this
Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods, where they wan-
dered about a great while; till at length, he, in particular, in a
miraculous manner, made his escape, and swam of to a Dutch
ship, which, sailing near the shore, in its way from China, had
sent their boat on shore for fresh water; that he durst not come
to that part of the shore where the boat was, but shift in the
night to take the water farther off, and the ship's boat took him
up.

He then told us, that he went to Batam'a, where two of the
seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest
in their travels; and gave an account, that the fellow who had
run away with the ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates,
which were gone a cruising in her; and that they had already
taken an Englirlz ship, and two Date/z ships, very richly laden.

- Thislatterpartwefoundtoconcemusdirectly; andthough
we knew it to be false, yet, as my partner said very well,.if we
had fallen into their hands, and they had had such a prepwes--
sion against us before-hand, it had been in vain for us to have
defended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at their
hands; and especially considering that our accusers had been
our judges, and that we could have expected nothing from them
but what rage would have dictated, and an ungoverned passion
have executed; and therefore it was his opinion, we should go
directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, without putting
in at any port whatever; because there we could give a good
account of ourselves, could prove where we were when the ship
put in, who we bought her of, and the like; and, which was
more than all the rest, if we were put to the necessity of bring-
ing it before the proper judges, we should be sure to have some
justice; and not be hanged first, and judged afterwards. ,
I was some time of my partner's opinion; but after a little

; more serious thinking, I told him, I thought it was a very great

hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were

<< on the wrong side of the straits of Malacca; and that if the

alarm was given, we should be sure to be way-laid on every side,
as well by the Dutch of Bata'via as the English elsewhere; that

- if we should be taken, as it were, running away, we should even

condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence to
destroy us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who said,
he was of my mind, and that we should certainly be taken.
This danger a little startled my partner, and all the ship's
company; and we immediately resolved to go away to the coast
of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China ,- and pursuing the
firstdssign, as to trade, find somewayor otherto disposeofthe
ship, and some back in some of the vessels of the country, such

rasweeouldget. Thiswasapprovedofasthebestmethodfor

our security; and accordingly we sacred away N. N. E. keep-
ing above fifty leagues off from the usual course to the east-
ward.

This, however, put us to some inconveniences; for first the
winds, when we came to the distance from the shore,- seemed to
he more steadily against us, blowing almost trade, a: we call it,
from the east and E. N. E. so that we were a long while upon
our voyage; and we were but ill provided with victuals for so
long a voyage; and, which was still worse, there was some dan-
ger, that those English and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued
us, whereof some were bound that way, might be got in before
us; and if not, some other ship, bound to China, might have
information of us from them, and pursue us with the same
vigour.

I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought myself,
including the late escape from the long-boats, to have been in
the most dangerous condition that ever I was in through all my
past life; for, whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I was
never pursued for a thief before; nor had I ever done any thing
that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, much less
thievish. I had chiefly been my own enemy ; or, as I may
rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but my own. But now
I was embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable ; for though
I was perfectly innocent, I was in no condition to make that in-
nocence appear. And if I had been taken, it had been under a
supposed guilt of the worst kind; at least, a crime esteemed so
among the people I had to do with.

This made me very anxious to make an escape, though which
way to do it,I knew not; or what port or place we should go to.
My partner, seeing me thus dejected, though he was the most
concerned at first, began to encourage me; and describing to me
the several ports of that coast, told me, he would put in on the
coast of Cathinchina, or the bay of Tonquin; intending to go
afterwards to Macao, a town once in the powession of the Portu-
guese, and where still a great many European families resided, and
particularly the missionary priests usually went thither, in order
to their going forward to China.

Hither then we resolved to go; and accordingly, though after
a tedious and irregular coune, and very much straitened for pro-
, visions, we came within sight of the coast very early in the
morning; and, upon reflection upon the past circumstances we
were in, and the danger if we had not escaped, we resolved to
put into a small river, which, however, had depth enough of
' water for us, and to see if we could, either over land or by the
, ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were in any port there-
abouss. This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance; for
- though we did not immediately see any European ships in the
bay of Tonqain, yet, the next morning, there came into the bay
. two Dim/x ships, and a third without any colours spread out, but
I which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two
: leagues distance, steering for the coast of China; and in the
' afternoon went by two English ships, steering the same course;
and thus, we thought, we saw ourselves beset with enemies, both
one way and the other. The place we were in was wild and
barbarous, the people thieves, even by occupation or profession ;
and though, it is true, we had not much to seek of them, and
except getting a few provisions, cared not how little we had to
do with them; yet it was with much difiiculty that we kept our-
selves from being insulted by them several ways.

We were in a small river of this country, within a few leagues
of its utmost limits northward; and by our boat we coasted
: north-east to the point of land which opens the great bay of
- Tonquin ,- and it was in this beating up along the shore, that we
discovered as above, that, in a word, we were surrounded with
enemies. The people we were among were the most barbarous
of all the inhabitants of the coast; having no correspondence
with any other nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, and such
gross commodities; and it may be particularly seen, that they
are, a: I raid, the most barbarous of any of the inhabitants, viz.
that among other customs they have this as one, that if any vessel
have the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they
presently make their men all prisoners or slaves; and it was
not long before we found a spice of their kindness this way, on

the occasion following. '

I have observed above, that our ship sprang a leak at sea, and
that we could not find it out; and however it happened, that as
I have said, it was stopped unexpectedly, in the happy minute of
our being to be seized by the Dutch and English ships, in the
bay of Siam; yet, as we did not find the ship so perfectly fit and
sound as we desired, we resolved, while we were in this place, to
lay her on shore, take out what heavy things we had on board,
which were not many, and to wash and clean her bottom; and if
possible, to find out where the leaks were.

Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought all our
guns, and other movable things, to one side, we tried to bring
her down, that we might come at her bottom; but, on second
thoughts, we did not care to lay her dry on ground, neither could
we find out a proper place for it.

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a
sight, came wondering down to the shore to look at us; and
seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and
heeling towards the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at
work on her bottom, with stages, and with their boats on the of?
side, they presently concluded that the ship was cast away, and
lay so fast on the ground.

On this supposition they came all about us in two or three
houis' time, with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them
eight, some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come
on board and plundered the ship; and if they found us there, to
have carried us away for slaves to their king, or whatever they
call him, for we knew nothing who was their governor.

When they came up to the ship, and began to row round her,
they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's
bottomandside,washingandgraving,andstopping,asevery
seafaring man knows how.

They stood forawhile gazing at us, and we, who were alittle
surprised, could not imagine what their design was; but being
willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us
into the ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunition to
those that were at work to defend themselves with, if there should
beoceasion; anditwas no more than need; for, in less than a
quarter of an hour's consultation, they agmd, it seems, that the
ship was really a wreck; that we were all at work, endeavouring
to save her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats; and
when we handed our arms into the boats, they concluded, by that
motion, that we were endeavouring to save some of our goods.
Upon this they took it for granted we all belonged to them; and
awaytheyeame down uponourmen,asifit hadbeeninaline
of battle.

Ourmen, seeingsomanyofthem, began tobefrighted; for
we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know
what they should do? I immediately enlled to the men who
worked upon the stages, to slip them down, and get up the side
into the ship; and bade thwe in the boat to row round and come
on board; and thosefew ofus who were on board, worked with
allthesu'engthand handswehad,to bring the shiptorights;
but however, neither the men upon the stage nor those in the
boats, could do as they were ordered, before the Cochimhinu:

The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a stout
strong fellow, who having a musquet in his hand, never offered
tofireit,but laid it down in the boat,liPSeafaal,a:1tfiouglu.

of their own boat into ours; where, taking him by the two ears,
he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died
instantly in his hands; and, in the mean time, a Dutchman, who
stood next, took up the musquet, and with the butt-end of it, so
'laid about him, that he knocked down five of them who attempted
to enter the boat: but this was doing little towards resisting
thirty or forty men, who fearless, bemuse ignorant of their dan-
ger, began to throw themselves into the long-boat, where we
had but five men in all to defend it: but one accident gave our
men a complete victory, which deserved our laughter rather than
any thing else; and that was this--

Our carpenter being preparing to grave the outside of the ship,
as well as to pay the seams where he had caulked her, to stop
the leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the boat; one
filled with boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and
oil, and such stuff as the Shipwrights use for that work; and the
man that tended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand,
with which he supplied the men that were at work with that hot
stufl': two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where this
fellow stood, being in the fore--sheets; he immediately saluted
them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and
scalded them, being half-naked, that they roared out like two
bulls, and enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. The
carpenter saw it, and cried out, Well done, 7441, give them
some more of it; and stepping forward himself, takes one of
their mops, and dipping it in the pitch--pot, he and his man threw
it among them so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in
three boats, there was not one that was not scalded and burnt
with it in a most frightful pitiful manner, and made such a howl-
ing and crying that I' never heard a. worse noise, and, indeed,
nothing like it; {or it is worth observing, that though pain
naturally makes all people cry out, yet every nation has a par,
ticular way of exclamation, and make noises. as different from one
another as their speech.' I cannot give the'noise these creatines
made,abetser name than howling, noranam'e more properto
the tone of it; for I never heard any thing more like the noise
of the wolves, which, as I have said, I heard howl in the forest
on the frontiers of langudoc. -

I was never pleased with a victory better 1n my life; not only
asoitwasaperfectsurprise to me, andthat _ourda.ngerwasim-
minent before; but as we got this victory without any blood--
shed, except of that man the fell0w killed with his naked hands,
and which I was very much concerned at; for I was sick of kill-
ing such poor savage wretches, even though it was in my own
defence, knowing they eame on errands which they thought just,
and knew no better: and that though it may be a just thing,
beeause necessary, for there is no necessary wickedness in nature;
yet I thought it was a sad life, which we must be always obliged
to be killing our fellow-creatures to preserve; and, indeed, I
thinkso still; and I would, even now, suffer agreat deal, rather
than I would take away the life even of that person injuring me.
And I believe all considering people, who know the value of
life, would be of my opinion, at least they would,.if they entered
seriously into the consideration of it.

Buttoreturntomystory: all the while thlswasdomg, my
partnerandI, whomanagedtherestofthemenonboard,had,
with great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights; and,
having gotten the guns into their places again, the gunner called
to me, to bid our boat get out ofthe way, for he would let fly
amongthem. Icalled backagain to him, andbid him not'oEer
to fire, for the earpentel' would do thework without him; but
bade him heat' another pitch-kettle; which our cook, whom
on board, took care of. Butthe enemywas so terrified-with
what they had met with in theirfint attack, thattheywouidnot
come on again; and some of.them,thatwere'fartheat of, seeing
theship swim,as it were, upright, begun, awe Summons
their mistake, and give over the enterprise, finding it was not as
they expected. Thus we got clear of this merry fight; and,
having gotten some rice, and some roots and bread, with about
sixteen good big hogs, on board, two days before, we resolved to
stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of it; for
We made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day
with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would
dispose of for us.

We therefore got all our things on board the same evening,
and the next morning was ready to sail. In the mean time,
lying at an anchor at some distance, we were not so much con-
cemed, being now in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing
posture, if any enemy had presented. The next day, having
finished our work within board, and finding our ship was per-
fectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail: we would have gone
into the bay of Toxquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves of
what was to be known concerning the Dutch ships that had been
there; but we durst not stand in there, because we had seen
several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before; so we
kept on N. E. towards the isle of Formosa, as much afraid of
being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship, as a Dutch or
English merchant ship in the Mcditerrancan is of an Algeria:
man of war.

When we were thus got to see, we kept out N. E. as if
we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine islands, and this
we did that We might not fall into the way of any of our Europ-
ean ships; and then we sacred north, till we came to the latitude
of 22 degrees, 30 min. by which means we made the island
Formosa directly, where we came to an anchor, in order to get
water and fresh provisions, which the people there, who are va-y
courteous and civil in their manners, supplied us with willingly,and
dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all their agreement: and
bargains; which is what we did not find among other people;
and maybe owing to the remainsofChristianity,whichwasonce
planted here by a Dania missionary of proscenium, and is a
testimony of what I have often observed, viz. That the Chris-
tian religion always civilizes the people, and reforms their man-
ners, where it is received, whether it works saving effects upon
them or no.

From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China
at an equaldistancqtillweknewwewerebcyond all theports
of China, where our European ships usually come; being re-
solved, if poaible, not to fall into any of their hands, especially
in this country, where, as our circumstances were, we could not
fail of being entirely ruined; nay, so great was my fcar in par-
ticular, as to my being taken by them, that I believe firmly I
would much rather have chosen to fill into the hands of the
Spank}: Inquisition.

Being now come to the latitude of3o degrees," resolved to put
into the first trading port we should come at; and standing in for
the shore, a boat came of? two leagues to us, with an old Portu-
gtm: pilot on board, who knowing us to be an European ship,
came to ofi'er his service, which, indwd, we were very glad of,
and took him on board; upon which, without asking us whither
we would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent them
back.

I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old
mancarryuswhitherwewould, that I began to talkwith him
about carrying us to the Gulph of Nuggin, which is the mom
northern part of the coast offline. The old man said he knew
the Gulph of Nuguiu verywell; but smiling, asked us what we
would do there?

I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase Chin warm,
calimrawailks,tea,wrought silks,PSslc. andsowouldreturn
bythe same coursewecsme. Hetold useurbestporthad
been to have put in <<Mamwherewe could not have fiiledof
a market for our opium, to our satisfaction, and might, for our
money, have purchased all som of China goods as cheap a we
could at Nanguin.

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which
he was very opiniated or conceited, I told him we were gentle-
men as well as merchants, and that we had a mind to go and see
the great city of Pekin, and the famous court of the monarch
of China. Why then, says the old man, you should go to
Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the see there, you
may go up within five leagues of the great canal. This canal is a
navigable river, which goes through the heart of that vast empire
of Claim, crosses all the rivers, passes some considerable hills by
the help of sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of Pekin,
being in length near 270 leagues. .

Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our business
now: the great question is, If you can carry us up to the city of
Nanquin, from whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards? Yes,
he said, he could do so very well, and that there was a great
Date/z ship gone up that way just before. This gave me a little
shock; and a Dutch ship was now our terror, and we had much
rather have met the devil, at least if he had not come in too
frightful a figure: and we depended upon it, that a Dutch ship
would be our destruction, for we were in no condition to fight
them; all the ships they trade with in those parts being of great
burden, and of much greater force than we were.

The old man found me a little confused, and under some con--
cern, when he named a Dutch ship; and said to me, Sir, you
need be under no apprehension of the Date/1, I suppose they are
not now at war with your nation. No, said I, that's true; but
I know not what liberties men may take, when they are out of
the reach of the lawsof their country. Why, said he, you are
no pirates, what need you far? They will not meddle with
peaceable merchants, sure.
Hi hadanybloodinmybodythat didnotflyupintomy
fwe at thatword,itwashinderedbysomestop inthevessels
appointed by nature to prevent it; for it putme into the greatest
disorder and confusion imaginable; nor was it possible for me
to conceal it so, but that the old man easily perceived it.

Sir, said he, I find you are in some disorder in your thoughts
at my talk: pray bepleasedto gowhich way youthinkfit; and
depend upon it, I will do you all the service I ean. Why,
Seignior, said I, it 18 true, I am a little unsettled in my resolution
at this time, whither to go in particular; and I am something
more so, for what you said about pirates: I hope there are no
pirates in these seas; we are but in an ill condition to meet with
them; for you see we have but a small force, and but. very
weakly manned.

0, Sir, raid he, do not be concerned; I do not know that
there has been any pirates in these see these fifteen years, except
one, which was seen, as I hear, in the bay of Siam, about a
month since; but you may be assured she is gone to the south:
ward; nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the work:
she was not built for a privateer, but was run away with by a
reprobate crew that were on board, after the esptain and some
of his men had been murdered by the Maw", at or near the
island of Sumatra.

What! said I, seeming to brow nothing qf tlre matter, did they
murder the captain? No, said he, I do not understand that they
murdered him; but as they afterwards run away with the ship,
it is generally believed they betrayed him into the hands of the
Mica-arm who did murder him; and, perhaps, they procured
them to do it. 'Whythen,uidI, theydeserveddeath,asmuch
as ifthey had done it themselves. Nay, raid the oldm, they
dodeserveit; andtheywilleertainlyhave itiftheylight upon
any English or Dam-la ship; for they have all agreed together,
that iftheymeetthatmgugtheywillgivehimnoqmrta. -
But, said I to him, you say the pirate is gone out of these
sens; how canthey meetwithhim then? Why,thatistrue,
said he, they do say so; but he was, as I tell you, in the bay of
Siam, in the river Cambodia, and was discovered there by some
Dutchmen, who belonged to the ship, and who were left on shore
when they run away with her; and some English and Dutch
traders being in the river, they were within a little of taking him.
Nay, said he, if the foremost boats had been well seconded by
the rest, they had certainly taken him; but he, finding only two
boats within reach of him, tacked about, and fired at these two,
and disabled them before the other came up; and then standing
of? to sea, the other were not able to follow him, and so he got
away. But they have all so exact a description of the ship, that
they will be sure to know him; and wherever they find him,
they have VOWed to give no quarter to either the captain or sea-
men, but to hang them all up at the yard-arm.

What! said I, will they execute them right or wrong; hang
them first, and judge them afterwards? 0, Sir, said the old
pilot, there is no need of making a formal business of it with
such rogues as those; let them tie them back to back, and set
them a diving; it is no more than they richly deserve.

Iknewlhadmyoldmanfast aboard, andthat he could do
me no harm ; so that I turned short upon him : Well now,
Seignior, said I, and this is the very reason why I would have
you carry us up to Nanquin, and not to put back to Macao, or
to any other part of the country; where the English or Dutch
ships come; for, be it known to you, Seignior, those captains of
the English and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent
fellows, that neither know what belongs to justice, nor how to
behave themselves as the laws of Goo and nature direct; but
being proud of their oflices, and not understanding their power,
they would act the murderers to punish robbers; would take
upon them to insult men falsely accused, and determine them
guiltywithout due inquiry; and perhaps Imaylive to call same
of them to an account for it, where they may be taught how
justiceis to be executed; and thatnomnoughttobeu'eaoed
asacriminal tillsomeevidencemaybehadofthe crime,and
that he is the man.

Withthisltoldhim, thatthiswastheveryshipthcyattack-
ed; andgave him a full account ofthe skirmishwe hadwith
their boats, and how foolishly and coward-like they behaved. I
told him all the story of our buying the ship, and how the
Dutchmen served us. I told him the reasons I had to believe
that this story of killing the master by the Malacca>>: was true;
as also the runningawaywith the ship; butthat it wasall a
fiction of their own, to suggest that the men were turned pirates;
and they ought to have been sure it was so, before they had
ventured to attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them;
adding, that they would have the blood of those men, who we
killed there, in our just defence, to answer for.

The old man was amazed at this relation; and told us, we
were very much in the right to go away to the north; and that
if he might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China,
which we might very well do, and buy or build another in the
country: and, said he, though you will not get so good a. ship,
yet you may get one able enough to carry you and all your
goods back again to Bengal, or any where else.

I told him I would take his advice, when I came to any port
where I could find a ship for my turn, or get any customer to
buy this. He replied, I should meet with customers enough for
the ship at Nanquiu, and that a Chinese junk would serve me very
well to go backagain; and that he would procure me people both
to buy one, and sell the other.

Well, but, Sgigm'ar, says I, as you say they know the ship so
well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instrumental
to bring some honest innocent men into a terrible broil, and,
perhaps, to be murdered in cold blood; for wherever they find
the ship they will prove the guilt upon the men, by proving this
was the ship; and so innocent men may probably be overpowered
and murdered. Why, says the old man, I will find out a way
to prevent that also; for as I know all those commanders you
speakof very well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I will
be sure to set them to rights in the thing, and let them know
that they had been so much in the wrong; that though the
people who were on board at first might run away with the ship,
yet it was not true that they had turned pirates; and that in par--
ticular these were not the men that first went off with the ship,
but innocently bought her for their trade: and I am persuaded
they will so far believe me, as, at least, to act more cautiously
for the time to come. Well, my: I, and will you deliver one
message to them from me? Yes, I will, my: 11:, if you will give
it under your hand, in writing, that I may be able to prove that
it came from you, and not out of my own head. I answered,
that I would mdily give it him under my hand. So I tool: a pen
and ink, and paper, and wrote at large the story of assaulting me
with the long--boats, &c. the pretended reason of it, and the un-
just cruel design of it; and concluded to the commanders, that
they had done what they not only should have been ashamed of,
but also, that if ever they came to England, and I lived to see
them there, they should all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my
country were not grown out of use before I arrived there.

My old pilot rad this over and over again, and asked me
several times if I would stand to it. I answered, I would stand
to it as long as I had any thing left in the world; being sensible
that I should, one time or other, find an opportunity to put it
home to them. But we had no occasion ever to let the pilot
carry this letter; for he never went back again. While those
things were passing between us, by way of discourse, we Went
forward'directly for Nanquin, and, in about thirteen days' sail,
came to an anchor at the south-West point of the great gulph of
Marquis; where, by the way, I came by accident to understand,
that two Dsteh ships were gone that length before me, and that
I should certainly fall into their hands. I consulmd my partner
againinthis exigency,snd hewas asmuchat slossas Iwas,
and would very gladly have been safe on shore almost any
where. However, I was not in such perplexity neither, but I
asked the old pilot if there was no creek, or harbour, which
I might put into, and pursue my business with the Chase pri-
vately, and be in no danger of the enemy? He told me, if I
would sail to the southward about two and forty leagues, there
was a little'port eslled Quinehang, where the Fathers of the
mission usually landed from Mean, on their progress to teach
the Christian religion to the Chinese, and where no European
ships ever put in; and ifl thought to put in there, I might con-
siderwhat farther courseto take whenlwas on shore. He
confessed, he said, it was not a place for merchants, except that
at somecermin timestheyhad akindofa fairthere,whend1e
merchants from 74pm: me over thither to buy the Chinese
merchandizes.

Weallagrecdtogobacktothisplace: the name ofthe port,
as he called it, I may, perhaps, spell wrong; for I do not par-
ticularly remember it, having lost this, together with the names
of many other places set down in a little-pocket-book, which
was spoiled by the water, on an accident which I shall relate in
its order; but this I remember, that the Chinese or yspmre
merchants we corresponded with all itbyadifi'ering namefrom
that which our Portuguere pilot gave it, and pronounced it as
above Quinclzabg.

Aswewereunanimousinourresolutionstogoto this place,
we weighed the next day, having only gone twice on shore,
whereweweretogetfieshwater; on bothwhichoccssiomthe
people of the country were very civil to us, and brought us
abundance of things to sell to 11:; I mean of prwisiam, plants,
roots, tea, rice, and some fowls; but nothing without money.

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till
five days; but it was very much to our satisfaction; and I was
joyful, and, I may say, thankful, when I set my foot safe on shore;
resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible to dispose
of ourselves and effects any other way, though not every way to
our satisfaction, We would never set one foot on board that
unhappy vessel more: and indeed, I must acknowledge, that of
all the circumstances of life that ever I had any experience of;
nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as that of being
in constant fear. Well does the scripture say, " the fear if man
brings a warn" it is a life of death; and the mind is so entirely
suppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief; the animal spirits
sink, and all the vigour of nature, which usually supports men
under other afflictions, and is present to them in the greatest
exigencies, fails them here.

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by
heightening every danger; representing the English and Dutch
captains to be men uncapable of hearing reason, or of distin-
guishing between honest men and rogues; or between a story
calculated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose
to deceive, and a true genuine account of our whole voyage,
progress and design; for we might many ways have convinced
any reasonable creature that we were not pirates; the goods we
had on board, the course we steered, our frankly shewing our-
selves, and entering into such and such ports; even our very
manner, the force we had, the number of men, the few arms,
little ammunition, and short provisions; all these would have
served to convince any man that We were no pirates. The
opium, and other goods we had on board, would make it appear
the ship had been at Bengal; the Dutchmen, who, it was said,
had the names of all the men that was in the ship, might easily
see that we were a mixture of Euglbh, Portuguese, and Indian,
and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and many other par-
ticular circumstances, might have made it evident to the under-
standing of any commander, whose hands we might fall into,
that we were no pirates.

But fear, that blind useless passion, wodted another way, and
threw us into the vapours; it bewildered our understandings,
and set the imagination at work, to form a thousand terrible
things, that, perhaps, might never happen. We'iirst Supposed,
as indeed every body had related to us, that the seamen on board
the English and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so
enraged at the name of a pirate, and especially at our beating of
their beans, and escaping, that they would not give themselves
leave to inquire whether we were pirates or no; but would erre-
cute as off-hand, as we call it, without giving usany room for
a defence. We reflected that there was really so much appa-
rent evidence before them, that they would searce enquire after
any more; as, first, that the ship was certainly the same, and
that some of the seamen among them knew her, and had been
on board her; and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at
the river of Cambodia, that they were coming down to examine
us, we {onght their boat, and fled. So that we made no doubt
but they were fully satisfied ofour being piratss as we were sa-
tisfied of the contrary; and as I often said, I know not but I
should have been apt to have taken those circumstances for evi-
dence, if the tables were turned, and my ease was theirs; and
have made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without
believing, or perhaps considering, what they might have to ofi'er
in their defence

But let that be how it will, thwe were our apprehensions;
and both my partner and I too, scarce slept a night without
dreamingofhalters andyard--arms; that is to say, gibbets; of
fighting, and being taken; ofkilling and being killed; and one
night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutch-u
had boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamen down,
that I struck my double fist against the side of the cabin I lay
in, with such a force as wounded my hand most grievously,
broke my knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh, so that it not
only waited me out of my sleep, but I was once afraid I should
have lost two of my fingers.

Another apprehension I had, was, of the cruel usage we might
meet with from them, if we fell into their hands: then the story
of Antigua came into my head, and how the Dutch might, per-
haps, torture us, as they did our countrymen there; and make
some of our men, by extremity of torture, confess those_crimes
they never were guilty of; own themselves, and all of us, to be
pirates; and so they would put us to death, with a formal ap-
pearance of justice; and that they might be tempted to do this,
for the gain of our ship and cargo, which was worth four or five
thousand pound, put all together.

These things tormented me, and my partner too, night and
day; nor did we consider that the captains of ships have no au-
thority to act thus; and if we had surrendered prisoners to them
they could not answer the destroying us, or torturing us, but
Would be accountable for it when they came into their own
country. This, I say, gave me no satisfaction; for, if they
will act thus with us, what advantage would it be to us that
they would be called to an account for it; or, if we were first
to be murdered, what satisfaction would it be to us to have them
punished when they came home?

I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I now had
upon the vast variety of my particular circumstances; how hard
I thought it was, that I, who had spent forty years in a life of
continued difficulties, and was at last come, as it were, to the
port or haven which all men drive at, viz. to have rest and
plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows, by my own un-
happy choice; and that I, who had escaped so many dangers in
myyouthshofildnowcometo be hanged in my old age,and
insoremoteaplace,foracrimelwasnot in the lent inclined
to, much less really guilty of; and in a place and circum-
stance,whereinnocencewasnot like to be anyprotectionatall
to me.

After these thoughts, something of religion would come in;
andIshouldbeconsideringthatthis seemed tometobeadis-
position of immediate Providence; and I ought to look upon it,
and submit to it, as such: that although I was innocent a to
men,IwasfarfiomheinginnocentastomyMake1-;andl
ought to look in, and examine what other crimes in my life
were most obvious to me, and for which Providence might justly
inflict this punishment as a retribution; and that I ought to
submittothis,justaslwouldtoashipwreck, ifithadpleased
Goo to have brought such a disaster upon me.

In its turn, natmal courage would sometimes take its place;
and then I would be talking myself up to vigorous resolution,
that Iwouldnothetakentobebarbarouslyusedbyaparcelof
mercilesswretches in cold blood; that it were much better to
have fallen into the hands of the savages, who were man--eaters,
and who, I was sure, would feast upon me when they had taken
me, than by those who would, perhaps, glut their rage upon me
by inhuman tortures and barbarides; that, in the cue ofthe
savages, I always resolved to die fighting, to the last gasp; and
why should I not do so, neing it was much more dreadful, to
mathat,tothinkoffallingintotheaemen'shands,thanever
itwastothinkofbeingeatenbymen: forthesavages, give

prevailed,lwassmetoputmyselfina kindoffever, with the
agitations of a suppwd light; my blood would boil, andmy
eyessparkle,aifIwas engaged; andIalways resolvedthatl
would take noquarter attheir hands; butevenatlast, ifIcould
resist no longer, I would blow up'the ship, and all that was in
her, and leave them but little booty to boast of.

By how much the greater weight the anxieties and perplexitiee
of these things were to our thoughts while we were at sea, by
so much the greater was our satisfaction, when we saw ourselves
on shore; and my partner told me, he dreamed, that he had a
very heavy load upon his back, which he was to earry up a hill,
and found that he was not able to stand long under it; but that
the Portuguese pilot came, and took it ofl" of his back, and the
hill disappeared, the ground before him shewing all smooth and
plain: and truly it was so; we were all like men who had a
load taken of? of their backs.

For my part, I had a weight taken of? from my heart, that
it was not able any longer to bear; and, as I said above, we re--
solved to go no more to sea in that' ship. When we eame on
shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodging,
and a warehouse for our goods, which, by the way, was much
the same: it was a little house or hut, with a larger house join-
ing to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with large
canes, to keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there
were not a few in the country. However, the magistrates al-
lowed us also a little guard, and we had a sentinel with a kind
of halbert, or half-pike, who stood sentinel at our door; to
whom we allowed a pint of rice, and a little piece of money,
about the value of three-pence, per day: so that our goods were
kept very safe.

The fair or mart, usually kept in this plane, had been over
some time; however, we found that there were three or four
junks in the river, and two yapaunerr, I mean, ships from
174134>>, with goods which they had bought in China, and were
not gone away, having some 744713;: merchants on shore.

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us, was, to
bring us acquainted with three missionary Ram's]: priests, who
werein-town, andwhohadbeenthere some time, converting
the people to Christianity; but we thought they made but poor
work ofit; andmade them but sorry Christianswhenthey had
done. However, that was none of our business. One of these
was a Frenchman, who they ealled father Simon; he was a jolly
well-conditioned man, very free in his conversation, not seeming
so serious and grave as the other two did, one of whom was
a Portuguese, and the other a Game,- but father Sims was
courteous, easy in his manner, and very agreeable company; the
other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and
applied seriously to the work they came about, viz. to talk with
and insinuate themselves among the inhabitants, wherever they
had opportunity: we often eat and drank with those men: and
though I must confess, the conversion, as the call it, of the
Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the true conversion re-
quired to bring heathen people to the faith of Cmusr, that it
seems to amount to little more than letting them know the name
of CHRIST, and say some prayers to the Virgin M73 and her
Son, in a tongue which they understand not, and to cross them-
selves, and the like; yet it must he confessed, that these religious,
who we call Missionaries, have a firm belief that these people
shall be saved, and that they are the instruments of it; and, on
this account, they undergo not .the fatigue of the voyage, and
the hazards of living in such places, but oftentimes death itself,
with the most violent tortures, for the sakeof this work: and it
would be a great want of charity in us, whatever opinion .we
have of the work iself, and the manner of their doing it, if we
should not have a good opinion of their zeal, who undertook it
with so many hazards, and who have no prospectof the.least
temporal advantage to themselves.

But, to return to my story: This French priest, father Sines,
:was appointed, ithems, byorderofthe chiefofthe mision, to
go up to Petty, the royal seat of the Chinese unperor; and

AA554 Lin nun onnrruazs

waited only for another priest, who was ordered to come to him
from Macao, to go along with him; and we scarce ever met
together, but he was inviting me to go thatjourney, telling me,
how he would shew me all the glorious thing of that mighty
empire; and among the rest, the greatest city in the world; a
city, said he, that your London, and our Paris, put together,
cannot be equal to. This was the city of Petin, which, I eon-
feas, is very great, and infinitely full of people; but, as I looked
on those things with different eyes from other men, so I shall
give my opinion of them in few words, when I come, in the
course of my travels, to speak more particularly of them.

But first, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with
him one day, and being very merry together, I shewed some
little inclination to go with him; and he pressed me and my
partner very hard, and with a great many persuasions, to con-
sent. Why, father Simon, says my partner, why should you
desire our company so much? You know we are heretics, and
you do not love us, nor can not keep us company with any plu-
sure. 0! says he, you may, perhaps, be good catholics in time;
my business here is to convert heathens; and who knows but I
may convert you too? Very well, fatha, said I, so you will
preach to us all the way. I will not be troublesome to you,
says he; our religion does not divest us ofgood manners; be-
sides, says he, we are here like countrymen; and so we are,
compared to the place we are in; and ifyouare Hugunots, and
I a Catholic, we may be all Christians at last; at least, said he,
we are all gentlemen, and we may converse so, without bdng
uneasy to one another. I liked that part of his discourse very
well, and itbeganto put me inmind ofmypriest thatIhad
left in the Brasils; but this father Siam did not come up to his
character by a great deal; for though father Sim hadnoap--
pearance of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had notahat
fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere afi'ection to reli-
gion,thatmy othergoodecclmintichad,ofwhomlhaveaaid

Providence, Isa], beganhere todwuponrwayalittle; and
the first thing that offered was, that our old Portuguese pilot
brought a yoga: merchant to us, who began to inquire what

and would send them from thence to the Philippine islands with
another loading, which he would pay the freight of, before they
went from yapan; and that, at their return, he would buy the
ship. I began to listen to his proposal; and so eager did my
head still run upon rambling, that I could not but begin to en-
tertain a notion of going myself with him, and so to sail from
the Philippine islands away to the South Seas; and accordingly
I asked the Japanese merchant, if he would not hire us to the
Philippine islands, and discharge us there. He said, no, he
could not do that; for then he could not have the return of his
cargo; but he would discharge us in 74pm, he said, at the ship's
return. Well, still I was for taking him at that proposal, and
going myself: but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded
me from it, representing the dangers, as well of the seas as of
the yaparme, who are a fdse, cruel, and treacherous people;
and then of the Spaniard: at the Philippine: ; more false, more
cruel, and more treacherous than they.

But, to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion;
the first thing we had to do, was to consult with the eapeain
of the ship, and with his men, and know if they were willing to
go to yapan; and, while I was doing this, the young man, who, .
as I said, my nephew had left with me as my companion for my
travels, came to me and told me, that he thought that voyage
promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect of advan'
tage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but that if
I would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a mer-
chant, or how I pleased to order him; that if ever he came to
England, and I was there, and alive, he would render me a faith-
ful account of his success, and it should be as much mine as I
pleased.

I was really loth to part with him: but, considering the pros-
pect of advantage, which was really considerable, and that he
was a young fellow as likely to do well in it as any I knew, I
inclined to let him go; but first I told him I would consult my
partner, and give him an answer the next day. My partner
and I discoursed about it; and my partner madeamostgene-
rous ofi'er: he told me, you know it has been an unlucky ship,
andwe both resolve not to go to sea initagain; ifyoursteward
(so he called n9 nan) will venture the voyage, I will leave my
share ofthe vessel to him, and let him make the best of it; and
if we live to meet in England, and he meets with success abroad,
he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship's freight
to us, the other shall be his own.

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young
man, made him such an ofi'er, I could do no less than ofi'er him
the same; and all the ship's company being willing to go with
him, We made over half the ship to him in property, and took
a writing fi'om him, obliging him to account for the other; and
away he went to .741)". The 74):>>: merchant proved a very
punctual honest man to him, protected him at yap", and got
him licence to come on shore, which the European: in general
have not lately obtained; paid him his freight very punctually,
sent him to the Philippines, loaded with 74pm and China wares,
. and a super-cargo of their own, who traficking with the Spaniardt,
brought back European goods again, and a great quantity of
cloves, and other spice; and there he was not only paid his
freight very well, and at a very good price, but being not wil-
ling to sell the ship then, the merchant furnished him with
goods on his own account; that, for some money, and some
spices of his own, which he brought with him, he went back to
the Mullins, to the Spaniardr, where he sold his cargo very
well. Here, having gotten a good acquaintance at Willa, he
got his ship made a free ship; and the governor of Mlle
hired him to go to Acapulco in Almeria, on the coastofllrfeflo;
and gave him a licence to land there, and travel to Mexico,- and
to pass in any Spank]: ship to Europe, with all his men.
He made the voyage to Arapaho very happily, and there he
sold his ship; and having there also obtained allowance to travel
by land to Parts Bella, he found means, some how or other, to
get to 7mica, with all his treasure; and about eight years
after came to England, exceeding rich; of the which I shall take
notice in its place: in the mean time, I return to our particular
afl'airs.

Being now to part with the ship, and ship's company, it came
before us, of course, to consider what recompense we should
give to the two men that gave us such timely notice of the design
against us in the river of Cambodia. The truth was, they had
done us a considerable service, and deserved well at our hands;
though, by the way, they were a couple of rogues too: for, as
they believed the story of our being pirates, and that we had
really run away with the ship, they came down to us, not only
to betray the design that was formed against us, but to go to sea
with us as pirates; and one of them confessed afterwards, that
nothing else but the hopes of going a roguing brought him to
do it. However, the service they did us was not the less; and
therefore, as I had promised to be grateful to them, I first ordered
the money to be paid them which they said was due to them on
board their respective ships; that is to say, the Englishman
nineteen months' pay, and to the Dutchman seven; and over and
above that, I gave them each of them a small sum of money in
gold, and which contented them very well: then I made the
Englishman gunner in the ship, the gunner being now made
second mace and purser; the Dutchman I made boatswain: so
they were both very well pleased, and proved very serviceable,
being both able seamen, and very stout fellow.

We were now on shore in China. If I thought myself
banished, and remote from my own country at Bengal, where I
had many ways to get home for my money, what could I'thinl:

Otherwise,what,are their buildingstothe palaces and royal
buildings of Europe? What their trade to the universal com-
merce of England, Halland, France, and Spain 4? What are their
cities to our's, for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furni-
ture, and an infinite variety? What are their ports, supplied-
with a few junks and barks, to our navigation, our merchant
fleets, our large and powerful navies? Our city of London has
more trade than all their mighty empire. One English, or
Dutch, or French man of war of eighty guns, would fight and
destroy all the shipping of China. But the greatness of their
wealth, their trade, the power of their government, and strength
of their armies, is surprising to us, because, as I have said, con--
sidering them as a barbarous nadon of pagans, little better than
savages, we did not expect such things among them; and this,
indeed, is the advantage with which all their greatness and power
is represented to us: otherwise, it is in itself nothing at all; for,
as I have said of their ships, so may be said of their armies and
troops; all the forces of their empire, though they were to bring
two millions of men into the field together, would be able to do
nothing but ruin the country, and starve themselves. If they
were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or to fight a disciplined
army, one line of German cuirassiers, or of French cavalry, Would
overthrow all the horse of China ; a million of their foot could
not stand before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so
as not to be surrounded, though they were to be not one to
twenty in number: nay, I do not boast if I say, that 30,000
German or English foot, and 10,000 French horse, would fairly
beat all the forces of China. And so of our fortified towns, and
of the art of our engineers, in assaulting and defending towns;
there is not a fortified town in China could hold out one month
against the batteries and attacks of an European army; and at
the same time, all the armies of China could never take such a
town as Dunkirk, provided it was not starved; no, not in a ten
years' siege. They have fire-arms, it is true, but they are awk-
ward, clumsy, and uncertamingoingofi'; theyhavepowder,

therefore I must confess it seemed strange to mewhenlcame

As this is the only excursion of this kind which I have made
in all the account I have given of my travels, so I shall make
no more descriptions of countries and people: it is none of my
business, or any part of my design; but giving an account of
my own adventures, through a life of inimitable wanderings, and
a long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few that come after
me will have heard the like of, I shall therefore say very little of
all the mighty places, desert countries, and numerous people, I
have yet to pass through, more than relates to my own story,
and which my concern among them will make necessary. I was
now, as near as I an compute, in the heart of China, about
the latitude of thirty degrees north of the line, for we was
returned from Nanqm'n: I had indeed a mind to see the city of
Pekin, which I had heard so much of, and father Simon impor-
tuned me daily to do it. At length his time of going away being
set, and the other missionary, who was to go with him, being
arrived from Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve
either to go, or not to go; so I referred him to my partner, and
left it wholly to his choice; who, at length, resolved it in the
affirmative; and we prepared for our journey. We set out
with very good advantage as to finding the way; for We got
leave to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins, a kind of
Viceroy, or principal magistrate, in the province where they
reside, and who take great state upon them, travelling with
great attendance, and with great homage from the people, who
are sometimes greatly impoverished by them, because all the
countries they pass through are obliged to furnish provisions for
them, and all their attendants. That which I particularly
observed, as to our travelling with his baggage, was this; that
though we received sufiicient provisions, both for ourselves and
our horses, from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet
we were obliged to pay for every thing we had after the market--
price of the country, and the mandarin's steward, or commissary.
of the provisions, collected it duly from us; so that our travel-
ingin the ntinueofthemandarin, though it was sverygreat
kindness to us, was not such a mighty favour in him, but was,
indeed, a great advantage to him, considering there were above
thirty other people travelled in the same manner besides us,
under the protection of his retinue, or, as we may call it, under
his convoy. This, I say, was a great advantage to him; for
the country furnished all the provisions for nothing, and he took
all our money for them.

We were five-and-twenty days travelling to Palm's, through a
country infinitely populous, but miserably cultivated; the hus-
bandry, the (economy, and the way of living, miserable; though
they boast so much of the industry of the people: I say miserable ;
and so it is; if we, who understand how to live, were to endure
it, or to compare it with our own; but not so to thwe poor
wretches, who know no other. The pride of these people is
infinitely great, and excwded by nothing but their poverty,
which adds to thatwhichleall their misery. And I must needs
think the naked savages of America live much more happy,
because, as they have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas
these are proud and insolent, and, in the main, are mere beggars
and drudges; their ostentation is inexpressible, and is chiefly
shewed in their clothes and building, and in the keeping multi--
tudes of servants or slaves, and, which is to the last degree -
ridiculous, their contempt of all the world but themselves.

I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly afterwards, in the
deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartan, than here; and yet
the roads here are well paved, and well kept,' and very conveni-
ent for travellers: but nothing was more awkward to me, than
to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the midst
of the grossest simplicity and ignorance; for all their famed in-
genuity is no more. And my friend, father Sim, and I,used
to be very merry upon these occasions, to see the beggarly pride
of these people: for example, coming by the house of a country
gentleman, as father Simon called him, about ten leagues of of
the city of Nanquin, we. had, first of all, the honour to ride with
the master of the house about two miles; the state he rode in
was a perfect Don Quin/ism, being a mixture of pomp and
poverty.

The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a scara--
mouch, or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with all the taw-
dry and trapping of a fool's coat, such as hanging sleeves, tassels,
and cuts and slashes almost on every side; it covered a tafi'ety
vest, as greasy as a butcher, and which testified, that his honour -
must needs be a most exquisite sloven.

His horse was a poor, lean, starved, bobbling creature, such as
in England might sell for about thirty or forty shillings; and he
had two slaves followed him on foot, to drive the poor creature
along: he had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast
as fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail; and thus
he rode by us with about ten or twelve servants; and we were
told he was going from the city to his country seat, about half a
league before us. We travelled on gently, but this figure of a
gentleman rode away before us; and as we stopped at a village
about an hour to refresh us, when we came by the country seat
of this great man, we saw him in a little place before his door,
eating his repast; it was a kind of a garden, but he was easy to be
seen ; and we were given to understand, that the more we looked
on him, the better he would be pleased.

He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto-tree, which
effectually shaded him over the head, and on the south side; but
under the tree also was placed a large umbrella, which made that
part look well enough: he sat lolling back in a great elbow-
chair, being a heavy cotpulent man, and his meat being brought
him by two women slaves; he had two more, whose office, I
think, few gentlemen in Europe would accept of their service in,DrmEyTSus-hnx a...

belowhimtoemployhis mth in anyofthose familiar
oflices which kings and monarchs would rather do than be
troubled with the clumsy fingers of their servants.

I took this fime to think what pain men's pride puts them to;
and how troublesome a haughty temper, thus ill-managed, must be
toamanofcommonsense: and, leaving the poorwretch to please
himself with our looking at him, as if we admired his pomp,where-
as we really pitied and oontemned him, we pursued ourjourney;
only father Sim had the curiosity to stayto inform himself
what dainties the oountryjustice had to feed on, in all his state;
whichhesaid hehadthe honour to taste of, andwhichwas, I
think, a dose that an English hound would scarce have eaten, if
ithadbeenofi'eredhirn,viz. amessofhoiledriee,withagreat
piece of garlick in it, and a little bag filled with green pepper, and
another plant which they have the-e, something like our ginger,
but smelling like musk, and tasting like mustard; all this was
put together, and a small lump or piece of lean mutton boiled in
it; and this was his worship's repast, four or five servants more
attending at a distance. If he fed them meaner than he was fed
himself, the spice excepted, they must fare very coarsely indeed.

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, hewas respected
like a king; surrounded always with his gentlemen, and attend-
edin all hisappearanoeswithsuchpomp,dlatlsawlittleofhim
but at adistanoe; but this I obwved, that there was not a
horse in his refinuc, but that our carriers' pack-horses in Exglad

equipage, mantles, trappings and such like trumpery, that you
eannotwewhether theyare fat or lean. In aword,weoouldsee
searce any thing but their feet and their heads.

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perpleaity
that I have given an account of being oven-,1 had no anxious
thoughts about me; which made this journey the pleasanter to
me; nor had I any ill accident attended me, only in the passing
or fording a small river, my horse fell, and made me free of the
country, as they call it; that is to say, threw me in; the place
was not deep but it wetted me all over. I mention it, because
it spoiled my pocket book, wherein I had set down the names
of several people and places which I had occasion to remember,
and which not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, and the
words were never after to be read, to my great loss, as to the
names of some places I touched at in this voyage.

At length we arrived at Pehin : I had nobody with me but the
youth, whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend me
as a servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent; and my
partner had nobody with him but one servant, who was a kins-
man. As for the Portuguete pilot, he being desirous to see the
court, we gave him his passage, that is to say, bore his charges
for his company; and to use him as an interpreter, for he un-
derstood the language of the country, and spoke good French
and a little English,- and, indeed, this old man was a most
useful implement to us every where; for we had not been above a
week at Pekin, when he came laughing: Ah, Seignior Inglese,
says he, I have :ornething to tell you, will maheyour heart gladt
A!) heart glad! says I : What can that he ? I do not know any
thing in this country can either give "1er or grief, to any great
degree. Tee, yet, said the old man in broken English, make you

inquisitive. Why, said I, will it make you sorry? Became,
said he, you have brought me here twentyzfi've dayt' journey, and
will leave me to go hack alone; and which way shall I get to ill]
port afterwards, without a ship, without a horse, without pecunei
So he called money; being his broken Latin, of which he had
abundance to make us merry with.
In short he told us therews a great earavanof Memoir: and
Polish merchants in the city, and they were preparing to set out
on their journey, by land, to Murray, within four or five weeks,
and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go with them,
and leave him behind to go back all alone. I confess I was
surprised with his news: a secret joy spread itself over my whole
soul, which I cannot describe, and never felt before, or since;
and I had no power, for a good while, to speak a word to the
old man; but at last I turned to him: How do you know this i
said I: are you sure it is true? Yes, says he, I met this morning,
in the street, an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one
you call a Grecian, who is among them; he came last from d:-
tracan, and was designing to go to Tanqm'n, where I formerly
knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go
with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Walga to
Amman. Well, Seignior, says I,' do not be uneasy about being
left to go back alone; if this be a method for my return to
England, it shall be your fault if you go back to Mean at all.
We then went to consulting together what was to be done, and I
asked my partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and
whether it would suit with his affairs: he told me he would do
just as I would; for he hadsettledall his affairs sowell at Ben-
gal, and left his effects in such good hands, that as we had made
a good voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks, wrought
and raw, such u might be worth the carriage, he would be con-
tent to go to England, and then make his voyage. back to Bengal
by the compmy's ships.

Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our Portugal
pilot would go with us, we would bear his charges to Mum,
or to England, if he pleased; nor, indeed, were we to be esteem-
ed overgenerous in thatpart neither,ifwe had notrewarded
himfarther; fortheservicehehaddonemwasmllyworthall
"that, and more; for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea,
buthe hadbeen like abrokerforusonshore; andhisprocuring
for us the 75pm: merchant, was some hundreds of pounds in
our pocket. 80 we consulted together about it; and being
willing to gratify him, which was, indeed, but doing him justice,
and very willingalsotohave him withus besides,forhewasanms_t
necessary man on all occasions, we agrwd to give him a quantity
of coined gold, which as I compute it, came to about 175 pounds
sterling between us, and to bear all his charges, both for himself
and horse, except only a horse to carry his goods.

Having settled this among ourselves, we called him to let
him know what we had resolved. I told him, he had com-
plained of our being to let him go back alone, and I was now to
tell him we was resolved he should not go back at all: that as we
had resolved to go to Europe with the caravan, we resolved also
he should go with us, and that we called him to know his mind.
He shook his head, and said it was a long journey, and he had
no pun: to carry him thither, or to subsist himself when he
came there. We told him, we believed it was so, and therefore
we had resolved to do something for him, that should let him
see how sensible we were of the service he had done us; and
also how agreeable he was to us: and then I told him what we
had resolved to give him here, which he might lay out as we
would do our own; and that as for his charges, if he would go
with us, we would set him safe ashore (life and casualties ex-
cepted) either in Mama or England, whichever he would, at
our own charge, except only the carriage of his goods.

He received the proposal like a man transported, and told us,
he would go with us over the whole world; and so, in short, we
all prepared ourselves for the journey. However, as it was
with us, so it was with the other merchants, they had many
things to do; and instead of being ready in five weeks, it was
four months and some odd days before all things were got
together.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when we set out
from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot had gone expres
backtotheport wherewehad firstput in,to dispose of some
goods which we had left there; and l, with a Chinese merchant,
who I had some knowledge of at Nanqru'n, and who came to
Pekin on his own affairs, went to Nanqain, where I bought

' ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two hundred pieces of
other very fine silks, of several sorts, some mixed with gold, and.
had all these brought to Pekin against my partner's return:
besides this we bought a very large qmntity of raw silk, and
some other goods; our eargo amounting, in these goods only,
to about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling, which,
together with tea and some fine ealicoes, and three mmels' loads
of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our
share, besides those we rode upon; which, with two or three
spare horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made us,
in short, twenty--six camels and horses in our retinue.

The company was very great, and, as near as I can remem-
ber, made between three and four hundred horse, and upward of
a hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all
events. For, as the eastern caravans are subject to be attacked
by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartar: ,~ but they are not
altogether so dangerous as the Arab, nor so barbarous when
they prevail.

The company consisted of people of several nations, such as,
Murmim chiefly; for there were above sixty of them who
were merchants or inhabitann of Marrow, though of them some
were Uooniaur; and, to our particular satisfaction, five of them
were Scots, who appeared also to be men ofgreat experience in busi-z -
ness, and men of very good suMnce.

Whenwe had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who were
five in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants; that is

tosay,allthepassengers,excepttheservants,toagreateouncil,.
as they called it. At this great council every one deposited at
certain quantity of money to a common stock, for the neces-
sary expense of buying forage on the way, where it was not
otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses,
and the like. And here they constituted the journey, as they
called it, viz. They named captains and officers to draw us all
up, and give the command in case of an attack, and gave every
one their turn of command. Nor was this forming us into
order any more than what we found needful upon the way, as
shall be observed in its place.

. The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and
is full of potter: and earth-makers; that is to say, people that
tempered the earth for the China ware; and, as I was coming
along, our Portugal pilot, who had always something or other
to say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and told me, he
would show the greatest rarity in all the country ; and that I should
have this to say of China, after all the ill-humoured thingsI had
said of it, that I had seen one thing which was not to be seen in
all the world bside. I was very importunate to know what it
was; at last he told me, it was a gentleman's house, built all
with China ware. Well, says I, are not the materials of their
building the product of their own country; and so it is all China
ware, is it not? No, no, says he, I mean it. is a house all made
of China ware such as you call it in England; or, as it is called
in our country, porcelain. Well, says I, such a thing may be.
How big is it? Canwe earryit in aboxupona camel? IfWe
can, we will buy it. Upon a camel ! says the old pilot, holding
up both his hands, why there i: a family if thirty people live:
in it.

I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came to it,
it was nothing but this: it was a timber house, or a house built,
as we call it in England, with lath and plaster, but all the plaster-
ing was really China ware, that is to say, it was plastered with
the earth that makes China ware.
The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and
looked vay well, perfect white, and painted with blue figures,
asthelargeChiuwareinEngludispainted,andhard,asifit
had been burnt. Asto theinside,all flwwdlginsmdofwains-
cot, were lined up with hardened and painted tiles, like the little
square files we all gally tiles in England, all made of the finest
China, and the figures exceeding fine indeed, with macrdinary
variety of colours, mixed with gold, many tiles making but one
figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar being made of the
same arth,that it wasvery hard to seewhere the tiles met.
The floors of the rooms were of the same composition, and as
hardas theearthen floorswe have inusein several pamof
England, especially Lincolnrhire, Nottinghmhin, Direrterrhire,
8m. as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burnt, and painted,
except some smaller rooms, like closets, which were all, as it
were, paved with the same tile; the ceilings, and in a word, all
the plastering-work in the whole house, were of the same earth;
and, after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of
a deep shining black.

This was a China ware house indeed, truly and literally to be
called so; and, had I not been upon the journey, I could have
said some days to we and examine the particulars of it. They
told me there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all
paved at the bottom and sides with the same, and fine statues
set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain
earth, and burnt whole.

As this' is one of the singularities of China, so they may he
allowedto excel in it; butlam verysure theyexcel in their
accounts of it; for they told me such incredible things of their
perfonnanceincroclerjwe, forsuch itis, thatlcarenotto
relate, as knowing it could not he true--They told me, in par-
ticular, of one workman that made a ship, with all its tackle,
and masts, and sails, in earthen-ware, big enough to carry fifty
men. If he had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to
yapan in it, I might have said something to it indeed; but as it
was, I knew the whole of the story, which was, in short, asking
pardon for the word, that the fellow lied; so I smiled, and said
nothing to it.

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for
which the leader of it for the day fined me about the value of
three shillings; and told me, if it had been three days' journey
without the wall, as it was three days' within, he must have fined
me four times as much, and made me ask pardon the next coun-
cil day: so I promised to be more orderly; for, indeed,I found
afterward the orders made for keeping all together were absolutely
necessary for our common safety.

In two days' more we passed the great China wall, made for a
fortification against the Tartars; and a very great work it is,
going over hills and mountains in a needless track, where the
rocks are impassable, and the precipice: such as no enemy could
possibly enter, or, indeed, climb up, or where, if they did, no
wall could hinder them. They tell us, its length is near a thou--
sand English miles; but that the country is five hundred, in a
straight measured line, which the wall bounds, without measur-
ing the windings and turnings it takes: it is about four fathom
high, and as many thick in some places.

I stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without trespassing on
our orders, for :0 long the caravan we: in passing the gate ; I say,
I stood still an hour to look at it, on every side, near, and far
all", I mean, that was within my view; and the guide of our
caravan, who had been extolling it for the wonder of the world,
was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was
a most excellent thing to keep off the Tartan, which he hap-
pened not to understand as I meant it, and so took it for a com-
pliment: but the old pilot laughed. O Seignior bugle>>, says
he, you speak in colours, In colours! my: I, what do you
mean by that? Why you speak what looks white thir' may, and
black that way,- gay one way, and dull another way; you tell
him it is a good wall to keep out Tartan,- you tell me, h; that,
it is good for nothing but to keep out Tartan; or, will keep
out none but Tartan. I understand you, Seignior Inglere, I
understand you, says he; but Seignior Chinese understood you
his own way.

Well, says I, Seignior, do you think it would stand out an
army of our country people, with a good train of artillery; or
our engineers, with two companies of miners? Would not they
batter it down in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia,
or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there should be
no sign of it left? Ay, ay, says he, [know that. The Chinese
wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gave him leave to
tell him a few days' after, for we was then almost out of their
country, and he was to leave us in a little time afterward; but
when he knew what I had said, he was dumb all the rest of the
way, and we heard no more of his fine story of the Chine." power
and greatness while he said.

After we had passed this mighty nothing, ealled a wall, some-
thing like the Pict: wall, and so famous in Northumherland, and
built by the Romans, we began to find the country thinly inha--
bited, and the people rather confined to live in fortified toms
and cities, as being subject to the inroads and depredations of
the Tartan, who rob in great armiesfind therefore are not to
be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open country.

And here I began to find the necessity of keeping together in
a caravan, as we travelled; for we saw several troops of Tartar:
roving about; but when I came to see them distinctly, I won-
dered more that the Chinese empire could be conquered by such
contemptible fellows ; for they are amere horde orcrowd of wild
fellows, keeping no order, and understanding no ~discipline,or
manner of fight.
Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, taught nothing,
and fit for nothing; andthiswesaidthe firstday wcaaw them,
which was after we entered the wilder part of the country. Our
leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen ofus to go a
hunting, as they call it; and what was this but hunting of sheep!
However, it may be called hunting too; for the creatures are
the wildest, and swifteet of foot, that ever I saw of their kind;
only they will not run a great way, and you are sure of sport
when you begin the chace; for they appear generally thirty or
forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep together when
th fl .

61);: gursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet
with about forty Tartar-s. Whether they were hunting mutton
as we were, or whether they looked for another kind of prey,
I know not; but as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a
kind of a horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had
never heard before; and, by the way, never we to hear again.
We all supposed this was to call their friends about them; and
so it was : for in less than half a quarter of an hour, a troop of
forty or fifty more appeared at about a mile distance; but our
Work was over first, as it happened.

One of the Scot: merchants of Moscow happened to be amongst
us; and as soon as he heard the horn, he told us, in short, that
we had nothing to do but to charge them immediately, without
loss of time; and, drawing us up in a line, he asked, If we were
resolved? We told him, We were ready to follow him; so he
rode directly up to them. They stood gazingat us, like a mere
crowd, drawn up in no order, nor showing the face of any order
at all; but as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their
arrows; which, however, missed us very happily. It seems
they mistook not their aim, but their distance; for their arrows
all fell a little short of us, but with so true an aim,' that had we
been about twenty yards nearer, we must have had several men
wounded, if not killed.

and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the whole
world, though we were to go over some much larger.

In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at the first
very frightful to me, we saw two or three times little parties of
the Tartan, but they seemed to be upon their owu afi'airs, and
to have no design upon us; and so, like the man who met the
devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say
to them; we let them go.

Once, however, a party of them came so near as to stand and
gaze at us; whether it was to consider what they should do,
whether attack us, or not attack us, that we knew not; but
when we were passed at some distance by them, we made a rear-
guard of forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan
pass half a mile, or thereabouts, before us. But after a while
they marched of, only we found 'they saluted us with five arrows
at their parting; one of which wounded a horse, so that it dis-
abled him; and we left him the next day, poor creature, in great
need of a good farrier. We suppose they might shoot more
arrows, which might fall short of us; but we saw no more arrows,
or 'l'artars, that time.

We travelled near a month after this, the ways being not so
good as at first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor of
China,- but lay, for the most part, in villages, some of which
were fortified, because of the incursions of the Tartan. When
we came to one of these towns (it was about two days and a half
journey before we were to come to the city Nauru), I wanted to
buy a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold all the way
upon that road, and of horses also, such as they are, because so
many caravans coming that way, they are very often wanted.
The person that I spoke to to get me a camel, would hate gone
and fetched it for me; but I, like a fool, must be officious, and
go myself along with him. The place was about two miles out

of the village, where, it seems, they kept the camels and horses
feeding under a guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot, being very desirous,
forsooth, of a little variety. When we came to the place, it.
was a low marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled
up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a
little guard of China: soldiers at the door. Having bought a
camel, and agreed for the price, I came away; and the China:
man that went with me led the camel, when on a sudden came
up five Tartar: on horsebmk; two of them seized the fellow,
and took the camel from him, while other three stepped up to
me and my old pilot; seeing us, as it were, unarmed, for I had
no weapon about me but my sword, which could but ill defend
me against three hommen. The first that came up stopped
short upon my drawing my sword (for they are arrant cowards);
but a second coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the head,
which I never felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I came
to myself, what was the matter with me, and where 1 win, for
he laid me flat on the ground, but my never-failing old pilot,
the Portuguese (so providence, unlocked for, directs deliveranoes
from dangers which to us are unforeseen,) had a pistol in his
pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartar: neither; if
they had, I suppose they would not have attacked us; but
cowards are always bolth when there is no danger.

Theoldman,seeing me down,withaboldheartsteppedup
to the fellow that had struck me, and laying hold of his arm
with one hand, and pulling him down by main force a little
towards him with the other, he shot him into the head, and laid
himdeadupon thespot; he then immediatelyateppeduptohim
who had stopped us, as I said, and before he could come forward
again (for it was-all done as it were in a moment) made a blow
at him with a scymitar, which he always wore, but missing the
man,cnthis horseintothesideofhishead,cut oneofhisears
ofbydnmmdagreatslieedowntheaideofhilfase.
Thepoorbeast,enngedwiththewound,wasmmoretobe
governed by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough too;
but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach;
and at some distance, rising up upon his hind legs, threw down
the Tartar, and fell upon him.

In this interval the poor China: came in, who had lost the
camel, but he had no weapon; however, seeing the Tartar
down, and his horse fallen upon him, he runs to him, and seiz-
ing upon an ugly ill--favoured weapon he had by his side, some-
thing like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe neither, he wrenched it
from him, and made shift to knock his Tartariaa brains out
with it. But my old man had the third Tartar to deal with
still; and, seeing he did not fly as he expected, nor come on to
fight him, as he apprehended, but stand stock still, the old man
stood still too, and falls to work with his tackle to charge his
pistol again: but as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, whether
he supposed it to be the same or another, I know not; but away
he scoured, and left my pilot, my champion I called him after-
ward, a complete victory.

By this time I was a little awake; for I thought, when I first
began to awake, that I had been in a West sleep: but, as I said
above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the ground,
and what was the matter: in a word, a few moments after, as
sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know where; I
clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then I
felt my head ache; and then, in another moment, memory re.
turned, and every thing was present to me again.

[jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my
sword, but no enemies in view. I found a Tartar lie dead, and
his horse standing very quietly by him; and looking farther, I
saw my champion and deliverer, who had been to see what the
Chinese had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand.
The old man, seeing me on my feet, came running to me, and
embraced me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that I
had been'kill'ed; and seeing me bloody, would see how I was
hurt; but. it was not much, only what we call a broken head;
neither did I afterwards find any great inconvenience from the
blow, other than the place which was hurt, and which was well
again in two or three days.

We made no great gain, however, by this victory; for we
lost a camel, and gained a horse : but that which was remarkable,
when we came back to the village, the man demanded to be paid
for the camel; I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing
before the Chinese judge of the place; that is to say, in English,-
we went before a justice of the peace. Give him his due, he'
acted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality; and hav-
ing heard both sides, he gravely asked the Chinese man that
went with me to buy the camel, whose servant he was? I am
no servant, says he, but went with the stranger. At whose re-
quest? says the justice. At the stranger's request, says he.
Why then, said the justice, you were the stranger's servant for
the time; and the camel being delivered to his servant, it was
delivered to him, and he must pay for it.

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word to say;
but admiring to see such just reasoning upon the consequence,
and so accurate stating the cause, I paid willingly for the camel,
and sent for another; but you may observe,I sent for it; I did
not go to fetch it myself any more; I had enough of that.

The city of Nana>> is a frontier of the Chinese empire: they
call it fortified, and so it is, as-fortifieations go there; for this I
will venture to afiirm, that all the Tartar: in Karakarhay, which,
I believe, are some millions, could not batter down the walls
with their bows and arrows; but to call it strong, if it were at-
tacked with cannon, would be to make those who understand it
laugh at you.

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of this

city, when messengers were sent express to every part of'the
road, to tell all travellers and caravans to halt, till they had a
guard sent for them; for that an unusual body of Tartan,
making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about
thirty miles beyond the city.

This was very bad news to travellers; however, it was are-
fully done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we
should have a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had 200
soldiers sent us from a garrison of the China: on our left, and
three hundred more flour the city of Nana, and with those we
advanced boldly: the three hundred soldiers from Nam: marched
in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and our men on each
side of our camels with our baggage, and the whole caravan in
the centre: in this order, and well prepared for battle, we thought
ourselves a match for the whole ten thousand Mongul Tartan, if
they had appeared; but the next day, when they did appear, it
was quite another thing.

It was early in the morning, when marching from a little well
situated town, called Changu, we had a river to pass, where we
were obliged to ferry; and had the Tartar: had any intelligence,
then had been the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan
being over, the rear-guard was behind: but they did not appear.

About three hours after, when we were entered upon a desert
of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by a cloud of dust
they raised, we saw an enemy was at hand; and they were at
hand indeed, for they came on upon the spur. '

The China, our guard on the front, who had talked so big
the day before, began to stagger, and the soldiers frequently
looked behind them; which is a certain sign in a soldier, that
he is just ready to run away. My old pilot was of my mind;
and being near me, he called out: Seignior Inglere, ray: be, those
fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if the
Tartar: come on, they will never stand it. I am of your mind,
said I : But what course must be done? Done, said he; let fifty
ofourrnen advance, andflanltthern oneschwing,andencou-
rage them, and they will fight like brave fellows in brave com
pany; but without, they will every man turn hisbaclt. Imme-
diately I rode up to our leader, and told him, who was exactly
of our mind; and accordingly fifty of us marched to the right
wing, and fifty tothe left, and the restmade alineofrescue;
and so we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to make
another body by themselves, and to guard the camels; only
that, ifneed were, they should send a hundred men to assist the
last fifty.

In a word, the Tsrlar: came on, and an innumerable company
they were; how many, we could not tell, but ten thousand we
thought was the least. A party of them came on first, and
viewed our posture, traversing the ground in the front of our
line; and as we found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered
the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on each
wing with their shot, which was done; but they went off, and I
suppose back to give an account of the reception they were like
to meet with; and, indeed, that salute clogged their stomachs;
for they immediately halted, stood awhile to consider of it, and,
wheeling of to the left, they gave over the design, and said no
more to us for that time; which was very agreeable to our cir-
cumstances, which were but very indifi'erent for a battle with
such a number.

Two days afterthis we came to the city of Nana, orNuu:
We thanked the governor for his care for us, and collected to
the value of 100 crowns, or thereabouos, which we gave to the
soldiers sent to guard us; and here we rested one day. This is
a garrison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers kept
here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the Mumvits fron-
tiers lay nearerto them thantheydonow,theMnmimhaving
abandoned that part of the country (which lies from this city
west, fm' about two hundred miles)asdesolsteand unfitfotme;
and more especially, being so very remote, and'so dificult to
send troops thither for its defence; for we had 'yet above two
thousand miles to Mum-0y, properly so called. ' '

After this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful
deserts, one of which we were sixteen days passing over, and
which, as I said, was to be called No Man's Land; and on the
13th of April, we came to the frontiers of the Mummite domi-
nions. I think the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it
might be called, that belonged to the Czar of Marco-v}, was
called drgun, being on the west side of the river Argun.

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction, that I was so
soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country; or, at least,
in a country governed by Christians; for though the Muscom'te:
do, in my opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians (yet
such they pretend to be, and are very devout in their way); it
would certainly occur to any man who travels the world as I
have done, and who had any power of reflection: I say, it would
occur to him, to reflect, what a blessing it is to be brought into
the world where the name of GOD, and of a Redeemer, is known,
worshipped, and adored--and not where the people, given up
by Heaven to strong delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate
themselves to stocks and stones; worship monsters, elements,
horrible shaped animals, and statues, or images of monsters.
Not a town or city we passed through but had their pagods,
their idols, and their temples; and ignorant people worshipping
even the works of their own hands!

Now we came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship
appeared,.where the knee was bowed to Jesus; and'whether
ignorantly or not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and the
name of the true Goo was called upon and adored; and it made
the very recesses of my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted the brave
Scotch merchant I mentioned above, with my first acknow1edg-
ment of this; and, taking him by the hand, I said to him, Blessed
be Goo, we are once again come among Christians! He smiled,
and answered, Do not rejoice too soon, countryman; these
MIMI!" are but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the
name of it, you may see very little of the substance for-some
months farther of our journey. _

Well, says I, but still it is better than paganism and wor-
shipping of devils. Why, I'll tell you, says he; except the
Ram's): soldiers in garrisons, and a'few of the inhabitants of the
cities upon the road, all the rest of this country, for above a
thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and most
ignorant of pagans: and so indeed we found it.

We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth,
if I understand any thing of the surface of the globe, that is to
be found in any part of the earth: we had at least twelve hundred
miles to the sea, eastward; we had at least tviro thousand to the
bottom of the Baltic sca,-westward; and'above three thousand
miles, if we left that see, and went on west, to the Brim]: and
French'channels; we had full five thousand miles to the Indian
or Persian sea, south; and about eight hundred miles to the
frozen sea, north: nay, if some people may be believed, there
might be no sea north-east till we came round the pole, and
consequently into the north-west, and so had a continent of land
into America, the Lord knows where; though I could give some
reasons why I believe that to be a mistake.

As we entered into the Mun-wit: dbminions, a good while
before we came to any considerable towns, we had nothing to
observe there but this: first, that'all'the rivers run to the east;
as I understood by the charts which some in our caravan had
with them, it was plain all those rivers run into the great river
Tamar, or Ganmmtr. This river, by the natural course of it,
must run into the east sea, or China: ocean. The story they
tell us, that the mouth of this river is choked up with bulrushee
of a monstrous growth, viz. three foot about, and twenty or
thirty foot high, I must be allowed to say, I believe nothing of;
but as its navigation is of no use, because there is no trade that
way, the Tartan, to whom alone it belongs, dealing in nothing
but cattle; so nobody that ever I heard of, has been curious
enough either to go down to the mouth of it in boats, or come
up from the mouth of it in ships ; but this is certain, that this river
running due east, in the latitude of sixty degrees, carries a vast
concourse of rivers along with it, and finds an ocean to empty
itself in that latitude; so we are sure of sea there.

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several con-
siderable rivers, whose streams run as due north as the Tamar
runs east; and these are all found to join their waters with the
great river Tartarru, named so from the northernmost nations of
the Mongul Tartan, who, the Chinese say, were the first Tartar:
in the world; and who, as our geographers allege, are the Gog
and Magag mentioned in sacred story.

These rivers running all northward, as well as all the other
rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident that the northern
ocean bounds the land also on that side; so that it does not
seem rational in the least to think that the land can extend itself
to join with America on that side, or that there is not a com-
munieation between the northern and the eastern ocean; but of
this I shall say no more; it was my observation at that time, and
therefore I take notice of it in this place. We now advanced
from the river Argana by easy and moderate journeys, and were
very visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Murray has taken
to have cities and towns built in as many places as are possible to
place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, something like the
stationary soldiers placed by the Roma: in the rcmotcst countries
of their empire, some of which I had read particularly were
placed in Britain for the security of commerce, and for the
lodging travellers; and thus it was here; for wherever we came,
though at these towns and stations, the garrison: and governor
were Russian: and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants of
the country were m'ere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and won-
shipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven;
and not only so, but were, of all the heat/mt: and pagan: that ever
I met with, the most barbarous, except only that they did not eat
man's flesh, as our savages of America did.

Some instances of this we met with in the country between
Arguna, where we enter the Murrow}: dominions, and a city of
Tartar: and Russian: together, ealled Nerlziml'ay; in which is
a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days totravel
over it. In a village, near the last of those places, I had the
curiosity to go and see their way of living; which is most brutish
and insufferable: they had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that day;
for there stood out upon an old stump of a tree, an idol made of
wood, frightful as the devil; at least as any thing we can think
of to repraent the devil can be made. It had a head certainly
not so much as resembling any creature that the world ever
saw; ears as big as goats' horns, and as high; eyes as big as a
crown piece; a nose like a crooked ram's horn, and a mouth
extended four-comered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth,
hooked like a parrot's under bill. It was dressed up in the
filthiest manner that you could suppose; its upper garment was
of sheep-skins, with the wool outward; a great Tartar bonnet
on the head, with two horns growing through it: it was about
eight foot high, yet had no feet or legs, or any other proportion
of parts. .

This searecrow was set up at the outer side of the village;
and when I eame near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen
creatures, whether men or women I could not tell, for they
make no distinction by their habits, either of body or head;
these lay all flat on the ground, round this formidable. block of
shapeless wood. I saw no motion among them any more than
if they had been all logs of wood-like the idol; and at iii-st'reslly

332
thought they had been so; but when I came a little nearer, they
started up upon their feet; and raised a howling ery, as if it
had been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away as if
they were displeased at our disturbing them. A little way of
from the island, and at the door of that tent or hut, made all of
sheep-skins and cow-skins, dried, stood three butchers. I thought
they were such; when I came nearer to them, I found they had
long knives in their hands, and in the middle of the tent appeared
three sheep killed, and one young bullock, or steer. These, it
seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol; and these
three men priests belonging to it; and the seventeen prostrated
wretches were the people who brought the offering, and were
making their prayers to that stock.

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish
worship of a hobgoblin, than ever I was at any thing in my life:
to see 6013's most glorious and best creature, to whom he had
granted so many advantages, am: by creation, above the rest of
the works of his hands, vested with a reasonable soul, and that
soul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both to honour
his Maker, and be honoured by him; sunk and degenerated
to a degree so more than stupid as to prostrate itself to a frightful
nothing, a mere imaginary object dressed up by themselves, and
made terrible to themselves by their own contrivanee, adorned
only with clouts and rags; and that this should be the effect of
mere ignorance, wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil
himself; who, envying (to his Maker) the homage and adoration
of his creatures, had deluded them into such gross, surfidting,
sordid, and brutish things, as one would think should shock
nature itself.

But what signified all the astonishment and reflection of
thoughts? Thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes; and
there was no room to wonder at it, or think it impossible. All
my admirationturnedto rage; andI rodeup tothe imageor

ears,sothatlwasgladtoscourforit; forwesawsomehad

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about
four miles of, in order to provide some horses, which they
wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with
the badnessofthe way, and longmarchover thelastdesert; so
we had some leisure here to put my design in execution. l
communieawd my project to the Scot: merchant of Mounts, of
whose courage I had had suficient testimony, as above. I told
him what I had seen, and with what indignation I had since
thought, that human nature could be so degenerate. I told him,
Iwas resolved, ifI could get but four or live menwell armed

abominable idol; and let them see that it had no power to help
itself, and consequently could not be an object of worship, or to
he prayed to, much less help them that ofi'ered sacrifices to it.
He laughed at me: so}: be, Your zeal may be good; but
what do you propox to yourself by it? Propose! .m'd I,- to
vindicate the honour of God, which is insulted by this devil-
worahip. But how will it vindicate the honour of Goo? raid

Writing! said he, why there is not a man in five nations of
them, that know any thing of a letter, or how to read a word in
any language, or in their own. Wretched ignorance! said I to
him; however, I have a great mind to do it; perhaps nature
may draw inferences from it to them, to let them see how brutish
they are to worship such horrid things.- Look you, Sir, said he,
if your zeal prompts you to it so warmly, you must do it; but
in the next place, I would have you consider these wild nations
of people are subjected by force to the Czar of Murcm':
dominions; and if you do this, it is ten to one but they will
come by thousands to the governor of Nertzimkay, and com-
plain, and demand satisfaction, and if he cannot give them satis-
faction, it is ten to one but they revolt; and it will occasion a
new war with all the Tartar: in the country.

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for a while;
but I harped upon the same string still; and all that day I was
uneasy to put my project in execution. Towards the evening,
the Scot: merchant met me by accident in our walk about the town,
and desired to speak with me. I believe, said'he, I have put
you off of your good design; I have been a little concerned
about it since; for I abhor the idol and the idolatry as much as
you can do. Truly, said I, you have put it of? a little as to
the execution of it, but you have not put it at all out of my
thoughts; and, I believe, I shall do it still before I quit this
place, though I were to be delivered up to them for satisfaction.
No, no, say: 11:; Con forbid they should deliver you up to
such a crew of monsters; they shall not do that neither; that
would be murdering you indeed. Why, says I, how would they
use me? Use you! says he; I will tell you how they served a
poor Rum'au, who afl'ronted them in their worship just as you
did, and who they took prisoner, after they had lamed him with
an arrow, that he could not run away; they took him and strip-
ped him stark naked, and set him upon the top of the idol mon-
st'er', and stood all round him, and shot as many'arrows into him
as would stick over hiswhole body; and then they burnt him
and all the arrows sticking in him,'as a sacrifice to the idol,
And was this the same idol? Yes, says he, the very.same.
Well, my: I, I will tell you a story. So 1 related the story of
our men" at .Madagamzr, and how they burnt and sacked the
village there, and killed man, woman, and child, for their mur-
dering one of our men, just as is related before; and when
I had done, I added, that I thought we ought to do so to this
village.

He listened very attentively to the story; but when I talked
of doing so to that village, :4}: be, you mistake very much ; it
was not this village, it was almost a hundred miles from this
place; but it was the same idol, for they carry him about in pro-
cession all over the country. Well then, says I, then that idol
ought to be punished for it; and so it shall, says I, if I live this
night out.

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told
me, I should not go alone, but he would go with me; and bring
a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us; and
one says he, as famous for his zeal as you can desire any one-to
be against such devilish things as these. In a word, he brought
me his comrade, a Scots-man, who he called Captain Richardson ,-
and I gave him a full account of what I had seen, and, in a word,
of what I intended; and he told'me readily, he would go with
meifiteosthim his life. Sowe agreed to go,onlyus three.
I had, indeed, proposed it to my partner; but he declined it.
He said, he was' ready to assist me to the utmost,'and upon all
messiom,'for my defence; but that this was an adventure. quite
out of his way: so, I say,- we molved upon our work, only us
three, and my man- servant, and so put it in execution-that night
about midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable.

However, upon second thoughts, we were. willing to delay it
till the next night, because the caravan being to set forward in
the morning, we supposed the governor could not pretend to
give them, any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his
power.--The Scat: merchant, as steady in his resolution for the
enterprise, as bold in executing, brought me a Tartar': robe or
gown of the sheep--skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows,
and had provided the same for himself and his countryman,
that the people, if they saw us, should not be able to determine
who we were.

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible
matter with aqua-vita, gunpowder, and such other materials as
we could get; and, having a good quantity of tar in a little pot,
about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and
found that the people had not the least jealousy of danger at-
tending their idol; the night was cloudy, yet the moon gave us
light enough to see that the idol stood just in the same posture
and place that it did before. The people seemed to be all at
their rest; only that in the great hut, or tent as we called it,
where we saw the three priests, who we mistook for butchers,
we saw a light, and going up close to the door, we heard people
talking, as if there were five or six of them; we concluded,
therefore, that if we set the wild-fire to the idol, these men
would come out immediately, and run up to the place to rescue it
from the destruction that we intended for it; and what to do
with them we knew not. Once we thought of carrying it away,
and setting fire to it at a distance; but when we came to handle
it, we found it too bulky for our carriage; so we were at a loss
again. The second Scotmn was for setting tire to the tent or
hut, and knocking the creatures that were there on the head,
when they came out; but I could not join with that; I was
against killing them if it was possible to be avoided. Well then,
said the Scot: merchant, I will tell you what we will do; we
willtrytotakethemprisoners,tietheirhandsbehindthem,and
make them stand still, and see their idol destroyed.

Asit happened,wehadtwineorpackthread enoughaboutus,
whichwasusedtotieour fire-workatogetherwith; sowere-
solved to attack these people first, and with as little noise as we
could. The first thing, we did, we knocked at the door, which
issuedjust as we desired it, for one of their idol priests came to
the door, we immediately seized upon him, stopped his mouth,
and tied his hands behind him, and led him to the idol, where
we gagged him that he might not make a mine; tied his feet
also together, and left him on the ground.

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another
would come out to see what the matter was; but we waited so
long till the thitde came back to us; and then, nobody
coming out we knocked again gently, and immediately out me
two more, and we served them just in the same manner, but was
obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by the idol
some distance from one another; when, going back, We found two
more were come out to the door, and a third stood behind diem
within the door. We seized the two, and immediately tied
them: when the third stepping back, and crying out, my Sm:
merchant went in after him, and aking out a composition we
had made, that would only smoke and stink, he set fire to it,
and threw it in among them: by that time the other Scotsman
andmymantakingchargeot'thewomenwhowerealready
bound, and tied together also by the arm, led them away to the
idol, and left them there, to see iftheir idol would relieve them,
making haste ba'ck to us.

and,followingitin,we foundthetewasbutfourpeopleleft,
who,itseeins,weretwo menandtwowomen, and,aswe sup-
posed, had been about some of their diabolic sacrifices. They
appeared, in short, frighted to death, at least so as to sit trem-
bling and stupid, and not able to speak neither, for the smoke.

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had the other,
and all without any noise. I should have said, we brought them
out of the house, or hut, first; for, indeed, we were not able to
bear the smoke any more than they were. When we had done
this, we carried them altogether to the idol: when we came there,
we fell to work with him; and first we daubed him all over, and
his robes also, with tar, and such other stuff as we had, which
was tallow mixed with brimstone; then we stopped his eyes,
and ears, and mouth full of gunpowder; and then we wrapped
up a great piece of wild-fire in his bonnet; and then sticking all
the combustibles we had brought with us upon him, we looked
about to see if we could find any thing else to help to burn him;
when my man remembered, that by the tent, or hut, where the
men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw or
rushes I do not remember: away he and one of the Scotsman run,
and fetched their arms full of that. When we had done this, we
took all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their
feet, and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and
set them just before their monstrous idol, and then set fire to the
whole.

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till the
powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up,
and, we could perceive, had split and deformed the shape; and,
in a word, till we saw it burn into a mere block or log of wood :'
and then setting the dry forage to it, we found it would be quite
consumed; when we began to think of going away; but the
Scotsman said, No, we must not go; for these poor deluded
wretches will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn them-
selves with the idol. So we resolved to stay till the forage
was burnt down too, and then we came away and left them.

travellers might be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the
fatiguea of that day's journey.

But it did not end so; the next day came a great multitude
of the country people, not only of this village, but of a hundred
more, for aught I know, to the town gates; and, in a most out-
rageous manner, demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor,
for the insulting their priests, and burning their great Chem-Ciri-
'I'lmmgu; such a hard name they gave the monstrous creatrue
they worshipped: the people of Nertzimkay were at first in a
great consternation; for they said, the Tartar: were no less than
thirty thousand, and that in a few days more, would be one
hundred thousand stronger.

The Rania)! governor sent out messengers to appease them,
and gave them all the good words imaginable. He assured
them he knew nothing of it, and that there had nota soul of his
garrison been abroad; that it could not be from any body
there; and if they would let him know who it was, they should
be exemplarily punished. They returned haughtily: That all
the country reverenced the great Cham-Chi-Thaanga, who dwelt
in the sun, and no mortal would have decrmd to ofi'er- violence
to his image, but some Christian miscreant; so they called them,
it seems; and they therefore denounced war against him, and
all the Rania: ,deg who, they said, were miscreants and Chris-
trans.

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach,
or to have anyeause ofwarallegedtobe given by him, the
Czar having straightly charged them to treat the conquered
country with gentleness and civility, gave them still all the good
wordsheoould; atlasthe told them, therewataurm gone .
towards Ram's that morning, and perhaps it was some of them
who had done them this injury; and that, if they would be
satisfied-with that, he would send after them, to inquire into it.
This mined to appease them a little; and accordingly the
governor sent after us, and gave us a particular account how the
thing was; intimating withal, that if any in our caravan had
done it, they should make their eseape; but that, whether they
had done it or no, we should make all the haste forward that
was possible; and that in the mean time, he would keep them
in play as long as he could.

This was very friendly in the governor. However, when it
came to the caravan, there was nobody knew any thing of the
matter; and, as for us that were guilty, we were the least of all
suspected; none so much as asked us the question; however,
the captain of the caravan, for the time, took the hint that the
governor gave us, and we marched .or travelled two days and
two nights without any considerable stop, and then we lay at a
village called Plot/ms,- nor did make any long stop here, but
hastened on towards yarawma, another of the Czar of Musco'vy':
colonies, and where we expected we should be safe; but it is to
be observed, that here we began, for two or three days' march,
to enter upon the vast nameless desert, of which I shall say more
in its place; and which, if we had now been upon, it is more
than probable we had been all destroyed. It was the second
day's march from Platlms, that by the clouds of dust behind us
at a great distance, some of our people began to be sensible we
were pursued; we had entered the desert, and had passed by a
great lake, called Schank: Ou'er, when we perceived a very great
body of horse appear on the other side of the lake to the north,
we travelling west. We observed they went away west, as we
did; but had supposed we would have taken that side of the

' lake, whereas we very happily took the south side; and in two
days more we saw them not, for they, believing we were still
beforethem, pushed on, till they came to the river Udda. This
is avery great riverwhen itpasses farther north; but wherewe
came to it, we found it narrow and fordable.

The third day they either found their mistake, or had intelli-
gence of us, and came pouring in upon -us, towards the dusk of
the evening. We had, to our great satisfaction, just pitched
upon'a place for our camp, which was very convenient for the
night; for as we were upon a desert, though but at the beginning
of it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had no towns
to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the city yarawm,
which we had yet two days' march to; the desert,' however, had
some few woods'in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all
into the great river Udda. It was in a narrow strait between'
two little, but very thick woods, that we pitched our little amp
for that night, expecting to be attacked in the night.

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for; but
as it was usual for the Mange] Tartar: to go about in troops in
that desert, so the earavans always fortify themselves every
night against them, as against armies of robbers; and it was
therefore no new thing to be pursued.

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a
most advantageous camp , for we lay between two woods, with
a little rivulet running just before our front; so that we could
not be surrounded or attacked any way, but in ourfront or rear:
we took are also to make our front as strong as we could, by
placing our packs with our eamels and horses, all m a line on the
inside of the river, and felling some flees in our rear.

In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy
was upon us before we had finished our situation. they did not
come on us like thieves, as we expected, but sent three messengers
to'us, todemand the men to'be delivered to them,thathad
abused their priests, and burnt their god Chain-Cbi--Thaulgu
with fire, that they might burn them with fire; and, upon this,
they said they would go away, and do us. no farther harm,
otherwise they would burn us all with fire. Our men looked
very blank at this message, and began to stare at one another, to
see who looked with most guilt in their faces, but, nobody was
the word, nobody did it. The leader of the caravan sent word,
he was well assured it was not done by any of our camp; that
we were peaceable merchants, travelling on our business; that
we had done no harm to them, or to any one else; and that
therefore they must look farther for their enemies, who had
injured them, for we were not the people; so desired them not
to disturb us; for if they did, we should defend ourselves.

They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer,
but a great crowd of them came down in the morning, by break
of day, to our camp; but, seeing us in such an unaccountable
situation, they durst come no farther than the brook in our front,
where they stood, and shewed us such a number, that indeed
terrified us very much; for those that spoke lust of them, spoke
of ten thousand. Here they stood, and looked at us a while,
and then setting up a great howl, they let fly a cloud of arrOWs
among us; but we were well enough fortified for that, for we
sheltered under our baggage; and I do not remember that one
man of us was hurt.

Some time after this, we see them move a little to our right,
and expected them on the rear, when a cunning fellow, a Cossack,
as they call them, of 7amwma, in the pay of the Murrwiter,
calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him, I will go send
all these people away to Sibeilka. This was a city four or five
days' journey, at least, to the south, and rather behind us. So
he takes his bow and arrows, and, getting on horseback, he
rides away from our rear directly, as it were, back to Nert~
zim'ka} ; after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes to
the army of the Tartan, as if he had been sent express to tell
them a long story, that the people who had burnt their Cham-
Chi-Thangu were gone to Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants,
as he called them; that is to say, Christians; and that they
had resolved to burn the god Sal Irarg, belonging to the
Tongues".

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly spoke
their language, he counterfeited so well, that they all took it
from him, and away they drove, in a most violent hurry, to
Sibeilka, which, it seems, was live days' journey to the north;
and in less than three hours they were entirely out of our sight,
and we never heard any more of them, and we never knew
whether they went to that other place called Sibeilba, or no.

So we passed safely on to the city of yumma, where there
was a garrison of Murcwiter; and there we rested five days, the
caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last day's hard
march, and with want of rest in the night.

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us three-
and-twenty days' march. We furnished ourselves with some
tents here, for the better accommodating ourselves in the night ,
and the leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or
waggons, of the country, for carrying our water and provisions ,
and these earriages were our defence every night round our little
camp; so that had the Tartar: appeared, unless they had been
very numerous indeed, they would not have been able to
hurt us.

We may well be supposed to want rest again after this long
journey; for in this desert we saw neither house or tree, or
scarce a bush; we saw abundance of the sable-hunters, as they
called them. These are all Tartar: of the .Mongul Tartar), of
which this county is a part; and they frequently attack small
caravans; but we saw no numbers of them together. I was'
curioustoseethesable-skinathey catched; butcouldneverspeak
withany ofthem; fortheydurstnotcome nearus; neither durst

Afterwe had passedthis desert,weearneintoacmmtrypmty
well inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and castles
settled by the Czar of Murrow, with garrison: of stationary
soldiers to protect the caravans, and defend the country against
the Tartan, who would otherwise make it very dangerous
travelling, and his czarish majesty has given such strict orders
for the Well guarding the caravans and merchants, that if there
are any Tartar: heard of in the country, detachments of the
garrisons are always sent to see the travellers safe from station to
station.

And thus the governor of Adinskoy, who I had opportunity
to make a visit to, by means of the Seal: merchants, who was
acquainted with him, offered us a guard of fifty men, if we
thought there was any danger, to the next station.

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe,
we should find the country better peopled, and the people more
civilized; but I found myself mistaken in both, for we had yet
the nation of the Tongues" to pass through; where we saw the
same tokens of paganism and barbarity, or worse, than before;
only as they were conquered by the Mu:cwite:, and entirely re-
duced, they were not so dangerous; but for rudeness of manners,
idolatry, and multi-theism, no people in the world ever went
beyond them. They are clothed all in skins of beasts, and their
houses are built of the suite. You know not a man from a
woman, neither by the ruggedness of their countenances, or their
clothes; and in the winter, when the ground is covered with
snow, they lived under ground, in houses like vaults, which have
cavities going from one to another.

If the Tartar: had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for a whole village,
or country, these had idols in every hut, and in every cave; besides,
they worshipped the stars, the sun, the water, the snow; and, in
a word, every thing that they do not understand, and they under-
stand but very little; so that almost every element, every un-
common thing, sets them a sacrificing.
But I am no more to describe people than countries, any far>>
ther than my'own story comes to be concerned in them. I met
with nothing peculiar to myself in all this country, which, I'
reckon, was, from the desert which I spoke of last, at least four
hundred miles, half of it being another desert, which took us up
twelve days' severe travelling, without house, or tree, or bush;
but were obliged again to carry our own provisions, as well water
as bread. After we were out of this desert, and had travelled two
days, we me to yawn}, a Murcwit: city or station, on the
great river 7amzay. This river, they told us, parted Europe
from Aria, though our map-makers, as I am told, do not agree
to it; however, it is certainly the eastern boundary of the ancient
Siberia, which now makes up a province only of the vast Mme-
m'tr empire, but is itself equal in bigness to the whole empire of
Germany.

And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed,
except in the Mumm'te garrisons. All the country between the
river Ob), and the river 17411an is as entirely pagan, and the
people as barbarous as the remotest of the Tartan,- nay, as any
nation, for ought I know, in Asia or America. I also found,
which I observed to the Marcwit: governors, who I had oppor-
tunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are not much the
wiser, or the nearer Christianity, for being under the Mumvite
governinent; which they acknowledged was true enough, but,
as they said, was none of their business; that if the Czar ex-
pected to convert his Siberian, or Tongue", or Tartar subjects, it
should be done by sending clergymen among them, not soldiers;
and they added; with more sincerity than I expected, that they
found it was not so much the concern of their monarch to make
the people Christians, as it was to make them subjects.

Fromthisrivertothegreatriver 06y,wecrossed awild im-
cultivatedcountry; Icannot aayit isabarrensoil; itis only
barren of people, and good management; otherwise it is in itself
a most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What inha-
bitants we found in it are all pagans, except such as are sent
among them from Russia; for this is the country, I mean on
both sides the river Ob), whither the Mime-vita criminals, that
are not put to death, are banished, and from whence it is next
to impossible they should ever come away.

I have nothing material to say of my particular affairs, till I
came to T050155, the capital city of Siberia, where I continued
some time on the following occasion:

We had been now almost seven months on our journey, and
winter began to come on apace; whereupon my partner and I
called a council about our particular affairs, in which we found
it proper, considering that we were bound for England, and not
for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told
us of sledges and rein-deer to carry us over the snow in the
winter--time; and, indeed, they have such things, that it would be
incredible to relate the particulars of, by which means the Ru:-
rian: travel more in the winter than they can in summer; be-
cause in these sledges they are able to run night and day: the
snow being frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which
the hills, the vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all smooth, and
hard as a stone; and they run upon the surface, without any
regard to what is underneath.

But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of this kind;
I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two
ways: eitherI must go on as the caravan went, till I came to
7arislaw, and then go ofl' west for Narva and the gulph of
Finland, and so either by sea or land to Dantzic, where I might
possibly sell my China cargo to good advantage; or I must
leave the caravan at a little town on the Davina, from whence I
had but six days by water to Arch-dngrl, and from thence might
be sure of shipping, either to England, Holland, or Edinburgh.

Now to go any of these journeys in the winter would have
been preposterous; for as to Dunk, the Baltic would'lie frozen
up,andlcouldnotgetpassage;andtogobylandintbose
countries was far less safe than among the Magi] Tartan; like-
wise to go to Arch-Angel, in Omhr all the ships would be
gone from thence; and even'the merchants, who dwell there in
summer, retire south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships
are gone; so that I should have nothing but extremity of cold
to encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie there in
an empty town all the winter: so that, upon the whole, I thought
it much my better way to let the caravan go, and to make pro-
vision to winter where I was, via. at Tobalski, in Siberia, in the
latitude of fixty degrees, where I was sure of three things to wear
out a cold winter with, viz. plenty of provisions, such as the
country afforded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent
company; of all which I shall give a full account in its place.

I was now in a quite difi'erent climate from my beloved island,
where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague; on the
contrary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my back,
and never made any fire but without doors, and for my necessity,
in dressing my food, (it. Now I made me three good vests,
with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down to the feet,
and button close to the wrists, and all these lined with furs, to
make them sufiiciently warm.

As to a warm house, I must confess, I greatly disliked our
way in England, of making fires in every room in the house, in
open chimniea, which, when the fire was out, always kept the
air in the room cold as the climate. But taking an apartment
in a good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built
like a furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove;
the funnel to carry the smoke went up. one way, the door so
come at the firewent in another, and all the roomsweze kept
equally warm, but no fire seen; just as they heat thebagniss-in
England. ~ .

c c
By this means we had always the same climate in all the
rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and how cold soever
it was without, it was always warm within; and yet we saw no
fire, nor was ever incommoded with any smoke.

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be pos-
sible to meet with good company here, in a country so barbarous
as that of the most northerly parts of Eurape, near the frozen
ocean, and within but a very few degrees of Nova Zambia.

But this being the country where the state criminals of Ma:-
(01)}, as I observed before, are all banished, this city was full of
noblemen, princes, gentlemen, colonels, and, in short, all degrees
of the nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of Murrow. Here
was the famous Prince Galiczen; the old general Roboslisl'y, and
several other persons of note, and some ladies.

By means of my Scot: merchant, who nevertheless, I parted
with here, I made an acquaintance here with several of these
gentlemen, and some of them of the first rank; and from these,
in the long winter nights, in which I staid here, I received several
very agreeable visits. It was talking one night with Prince
one of the banished ministers of state belonging to the Czar of
Murray, that my talk of my particular case began. He had
been telling me abundance of fine things, of the greatness, the
magnificence, the dominions, and the absolute power of the em'
peror of the Russians. I interrupted him, and told him, I was
a greater and more powerful prince than ever the Czar of Mus-
twy was, though my dominions were not so large, or my people
so many. The Russian grandee looked a little surprised, and
fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder what! meant.

I told him his wonder would cease when I had explained my--
self. First, I told him, I had the absolute disposal of the lives
and fortunes of all my subjects. That notwithstanding my ab-
solute power, I had not one person disaffected to my government
or to my person, in all my dominions. He shook his head at
that, and said, There, indeed, I outdid the Czar of Maxim. I
told him, that all the lands in my kingdom were my own, and
all my subjects were not only my tenants, but tenants at will;
that they would all fight for me to the last drop; and that never
tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever so uni-
versally beloved, and yet so horribly feared by his subjects.
After amusing them with these riddles in government for a
while, I opened the case, and told them the story at large of my
living in the island, and how I managed both myself and the
people there that were under me, just as I have since minuted it
down. They were exceedingly taken with the story, and es-
pecially the prince, who told me with a sigh, that the true great-
ness of life was to be master of ourselves; that he would not
have exchanged such a state of life as mine to have been Czar of
thwy; and that he found more felicity in the retirement he
seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found in the highest
authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the Czar: that
the height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down to
our circumstances, and to make a calm within, under the weight
of the greatest scorns without. When he came first hither, he
said, he used to tear the hair from his head, and the clothes from
his back, as others had done before him; but a little time and
consideration had made him look into himself, as well as round
him, to things without; that he found the mind of man,' if it
was but once brought to reflect upon the state of universal life,
and how little this world was concerned in, its true felicity, was
perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself, fully satisfying
to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and desires, with but
very little assistance from the world; that air to breathe in, food
to sustain life, clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise, in
order to health, completed, in his opinion, all that the world
could do for us; and though the greatness, the authority, the
riches, and the pleasures, which some enjoyed in the world, and
which he had enjoyed his share of, had much in them that was
agreeable to us, yet he oburved, that all thou things chiefly
gratified the coarsest of our afi'ections; such as our ambition,
our particular pride, our avarice, our vanity, and our sensuality;
all which were, indeed, the mere product of the worst part of
man, were in themselves crimes, and had in them the seeds of all
manner of crime; but neither were related to or concerned with,
any of those virtues that constituted as wise men, or of those
graces which distinguished us as Christians: that being now de-
prived of all the fancied felicity, which he enjoyed in the full
exercise of all those vices, he said, he was at leisure to look upon
the dark side of them, where he found all manner of deformity;

and was now convinced, that virtue only makes a man truly wise, I
rich, and great, and preserves him in the way to a superior hap-- "

piness in a future state; and in this, he said, they were more

happy in their banishment, than all their enemies were, who had '
the full possession of all the wealth and power that they (the ,

banished) had left behind them.

Nor, Sir, said he, do I bring my mind to this politically, by
the necessity of my circumstances, which some all miserable;
but, if I know any thing of myself, I would not now go back,
though the Czar, my master, should call me, and reinstate me in
all my former grandeur; I say, I would no more go back to it,
than I believe my soul, when it shall be delivered from this
prison of the body, and has had a taste of the glorious state be-
yond life, would come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it is
now enclosed in, and leave heaven to deal in the dirt and crime
of human affairs.

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much
earnestness and motion of his spirits, which were apparent in his
countenance, that it was evident it was the true sense of his soul;
there was no room to doubt his sincerity.

I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a monarch in my
old station, of which I had given him an account, but that I
thought he was not a monarch only, but a great conqueror; for
that he that has got a victory over his own exorbitant desires,
and has the absolute dominion over himself, whose reason en-
tirely governs his will, is certainly greater than he that conquers
a city. But, my lord, said I, shall I take the liberty to ask you
a question? With all my heart, says he. If the door of your
liberty was opened, said I, would you not take hold of it to
deliver yourself from this exile?

' Hold, said he, your question is subtle, and requires some
serious just distinctions to give it a sincere answer; and I will
give it you from the bottom of my heart. Nothing that I know
of in this world would move me to deliver myself from this state
of banishment, except these two. First, the enjoyment of my
relations; and, secondly, a little warmer climate; but I protest
to you, that to go back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the
power, the hurry of a minister of state; the wealth, the gaiety,
and the pleasures, that is to say, follies of a courtier; if my
master should send me word this moment, that he restores me
to all he banished me from; I protest, if I know myself at all, I
would not leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these frozen
lakes, for the palace of Moscow.

But, my lord, said I, perhaps you not only are banished from
the pleasures of the court, and from the power, and authority,
and wealth, you enjoyed before, but you may be shunt too from
some of the conveniences of life; you estate, perhaps, con.
fiseated, and your efi'ects plundered; and the supplies left you
here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life.

Ay,saidhe,thatisasyousupposemetobe,alord,ora
prince, (5:. So, indeed, I am; but youarenowtoeonsiderme
onlyasaman,ahuman creature,notatslldistinguished from
another; andsolansuii'ernowant, unlessIshould bevisited
with sickness and distempers. However, to put the question
out of dispute; you see our manner; we are'in this place five
persons ofrank; we live perfectly retired, as suited to a state of
banishment; we have something rescued from the shipwreck of
our fortunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting
for our food; but the poor soldiers who are here, without that
help, live in as much plenty as we; who go into the woods, and
catch sable: and foxes; the labour of a month will maintain them
a year; and as the way of living is not expensive, so it is not
hard to get sufficient to ourselves. So that objection is out of
doors. '

I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable
conversation I had with this truly great man; in all which he
shewed that his mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge
of things, so supported by religion, as well as by a vast share of
wisdom, that his contempt of the world was really as much as he
had expressed, and that he was always the same to the last, as
will appear in the story I am going to tell.

I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadful winter I
thought it to be; the cold was so intense, that I could not so
much as look abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a mask
of for before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for

1 breath, and two for sight. The little day-light we had, was, as
we reckoned, for three months, not above five hours a day, and
six at most; only that the snow lying on the ground continually,
and the weather clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were
kept (or rather starved) under ground; and, as for our servants
(for we hired three servants here to look after our horses and
selves), we had every now and then their fingers and toes to thaw,
and take are of, lest they should mortify and fall oil".

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close,
the walls thick, the lights small, and the glass all double. Our
food was chiefly the flesh ofdeer. dried and cured intheseason;
good bread enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of several
sorts, and'some flesh of mutton, and of the bufi'aloes, which is
pretty good beef. All thestores ofprovisions for the winterare
laid upinthesummer,andwell cured; ourdrinkwaswater
mixed with aqua vita: instead of brandy; and, for a treat, mead
instead of wine, which, however, they have excellent good. The
hunters, who venture abroad all weathers, frequently brought us
in fresh venison, very fat and good; and sometimes bear's flesh,
but we did not much care for the last. We had a good stock
of tea, with which we treated our fiiends as above; and, in a
word, we lived very cheerfully and well, all things considered.

It was now March, and the days grown considerably longer,
and the weather at least tolerable; so the other travellers began
to prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and to get things
ready to be going; but my measures being fixed, as I have said,
for Arch-Angel, and not for Mama, or the Baltic, I made no
motion, knowing very well, that the ships from the south do
not set out for that part of the world till Illa] or 27101:; and that
if I was there by the beginning of August, it would be as soon
as any ships would be ready to go away; and therefore, I say, I
madeno haste to be gone, as others did; in a word, I saw a
great many people, nay, all the travellers, go away before me.
It seems, every year they go from thence to Mum for trade;
viz. to earry fins, and buy necessaries with them, which they
bring back to furnish their shops; also others went of the same
grand to Arch-Angel,- but then they also, being to come back
again above eight hundred miles, went all out before me.

In short, about the latter end of file}, I began to make all
ready to pack'up; andas I was doing this, it occurred to me,
that seeing all these people were banished by the Czar of Mum
to Siberia, and yet, when they came there, were left at liberty to
go whither they would; why did they not then go away to any
part of the world wherever they thought fit? and I began to
examine what should hinder them from making suchan attempt.
But my wonder was over, when I entered upon that subject
with the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus.
Consider, first, sir, said he, the place where we are; and secondly,
the condition we are in; especially, said he, the generality of the
people who are banished hither. We are surrounded, said he,
with stronger things than bars and bolts: on the north side an
unnavigable ocean, where ship never sailed, and boat never
swam; neither, if we had both, could we know where to go with
them. Every other way, said he, we have above a thousand
miles to pass through the Czar's own dominions, and by ways
utterly impassable, except by the roads made by the governor,
and by the towns garrisoned by his troops; so that we could
neither pass undiscovered by the road, or subsist any other way;
so that it is in vain to attempt it.

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were in a
prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the
castle at Moscow; however, it came into my thought, that I
might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape of
this excellent person, and that whatever hazard I run, I would
certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this I took an
occasion one evening to tell him my thoughts: I represented to
him, that it was very easy for me to carry him away, there being
no guard over him in the country; and as I was not going to
Moscow, but to Arch-Angel, and that I went in the nature of a
caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns
in the desert, but could encamp every night where I would, we
might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-Angel, where I would
immediately secure him on board an English or Dutch ship, and
carry him of? safe along with me; and as to his subsistence, and
other particulars, it should be my are, till he could better supply
himself.

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all
the while I spoke: nay, I couldsee inhis very face, thatwhat I
said put his spirits into an excwding ferment; his colour fre-
quently changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered,
that it might be even perceived in his countenance; nor could
he immediately answer me when I had done, and, as it were,
expectedwhathewould saytoit; butafterhehadpauseda
little, he embraced me, and said, How unhappy are we! un-
guarded creatures as we are, that even our greatest acts of friend-
ship are made snares to us, and we made tempters of one another !
My dear friend, said he, your offer is so sincere, has such kind-
ness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so calculated for my
advantage, that I must have very little knowledge of the world
if I did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge the obligation I
have upon me to you for it. But did you believe I was sincere
in what I have so often said to you of my contempt of the
world? Did you believe I spoke my very soul to you, and
that I had really obtained that degree of felicity here, that had
placed me above all that the world could give me, or do for me? .
Did you believe I was sincere, when I told you I would not go
back,ifI was recalled even to beallthatoncelwasinthe
court, and with the favour of the Czar my master? Did you
believe me, my friend, to be an honest man, or did you think
me to be a boasting hypocrite i--Here he stopped, as if he
would hear what I would say; but, indeed, I soon after per-
ceived, that he stopped because his spirits were in motion; his
great heart was full of struggles, and he could not go on. I was,
Iconfess,astonished at the thing,aswell asatthemsn,and I
usedsomeargumentswithhimtourgehimto sethimselffi'ee;
that he ought to look upon this as a door opened by Heaven for
his deliverance, and a summons by Providence, who has the care
anddispositionofall events,todohimselfgood,andto render
himself useful in the world.

He had by this time recovered himself. How do you know,
sir, says he, warmly, that, instead of -a summons from Heaven,

C C 2
it may not be a feint of another instrument, nepmenting, in all
the alluring colours, to me, the shew of felicity as a deliverance,
which may in itself be my snare, and tends directly to my ruin?
Here I am free from the temptation of returning to my former
miserable greatness; there I am not sure, but that all the seeds
of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in
nature, may revive and take root, and in a word, again over-
whelm me; and then the happy prisoner, who you see now
master of his soul's liberty, shall be the miserable slave of his
own senses, in the full of all personal liberty. Dear Sir, let me
remain in this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of
life, rather than purchase a shew of freedom at the expense of
the liberty of my reason, and at the expense of the future happi-
ness which now I have in my view, but shall then, I fear,
quickly lose sight of ; for I am but flesh, a man, a mere man,
have passions and affections as likely to possess and overthrow

me as any man. 0 be not my friend and my tempter both
together!

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood
silent, looking at him; and, indeed, admired at what I saw; the
struggle in his soul was so great, that though the weather was
extremely cold, it put him into a most violent sweat, andI found
he wanted to give vent to his mind; so I said a word or two,
that I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on him again;
and then I withdrew to my own apartment.

About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near the door
of my room, and I was going to open the door; but he had
opened it, and came in. My dear friend, says he, you had
almost overset me, but I am recovered: do not take it ill that I
do not close with your offer; I assure you, it is not for want of
a sense of the kindness of it in you; and I came to make the
most sincere acknowledgment of it to you; but, I hope, I have
got the victory over myself.
5 My lord, said I, I hope you are hilly satisfied, that you do
not resist the call ofHeaven. Sir, said he, ifit had been from
Heaven, the same power would have influenced me to accept it;
but I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I
decline it; and I have infinite satisfaction in the parting, that you
shall leave me an honest man still, though not a free man.

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make profsssions to
him of my having no end in it, but a sincere desire to serve him.
He embraced me very passionately, and assured me, he was
sensible of that, and should always acknowledge it; and with
that he offered me a very fine present of sables, too much indeed
for me to accept from a man in his circumstances; and I would
have avoided them, but he would not be refused.

The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship, with a
small present of tea, and two pieces of China damask, and four
little wedges of yap" gold, which did not all weigh above six
ounces, or thereabout; but were far short of the value of his
sables, which, indeed, when I esme to England, I found worth
near 2001. He accepted the tea and one piece of the damask,
and one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it,
of the 74pm: coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of it,
but would not take any more, and he sent word by my servant,
that he desired to speak with me.

When I eame to him, he told me, I knew what had passed
between us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that
affair; but that, since I had made such a generous ofl'er to him,
he asked metif I had kindness enough to offer the same to
another person that he would name to me, in whom he had a
great share of concern. I told him, that I could not say, I
inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for whom I had
a particular value, and should have been glad to have been the
instrument of his deliverance: however, if he would please to
name the person to me,Iwouldgive him myanswer,andhoped
he would not be displeased with me, if he was with my answer.
He told me, it was only his son, who, though I had not seen,
yet was in the same condition with himself, and above two hun-
dred miles from him, on the other side the Ob; but that, if I
consented, he would send for him.

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made
some ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on
his account; and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would
shew my respect to him by my concern for his son: but these
things are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the next
day for his son, and in about twenty days he came back with
the messenger, bringing six or seven horses loaded with very
rich furs, and which, in the whole, amounted to a very great
value.

His servants brought the horses into the town, but left the
young lord at a distance till night, when he came incognito into
our apartment, and his father presented him to me; and, in
short, we concerted there the manner of our travelling, and every
thing proper for the journey.

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox-
skins, fine ermines, and such other furs as are very rich; I say,
I had bought them in that city in exchange for some of the
goods I brought from China,- in pam'cular, for the cloves and
nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part here; and the rest
afterwards at Arch-Angel, for a much better price than I could
have done at London; and my partner, who was sensible of the
profit, and whose business, more particularly than mine, was
merchandize, was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of
the traffic we made here.

It was the beginning of 7mm when I left this remote place, a
city, I believe, little heard of in the world; and, indeed, it is so

far out of the road of commerce, that I know not how it should
be much talked of. We were now come to a very small cara-
van, being only thirty-two horses and'carnela in all, and all of
them passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor of
eleven of them. It was most natural also, that I should-salts
more servants with me than I had before, and the young lord
passed for my steward; what great manlpassed for myself!
know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. We had here
the worst and the largest desert to pass over that we met with
in all the journey; indeed I call it the worst, because the way
was very deep in some places, and very uneven in others; the
best We had to say for it, was, that we thought we had no troops
of Tartar: and robbers to fear, and that they never came on this
side the river 05}, or at least but very seldom; but we found
it otherwise.

My young lord had with him a faithful Marconi>> servant, or
rather a Siberian servant, who was perfectly acquainted with the
country; and led us by private roads, that we avoided coming
into the principal towns and cities upon the great road, such as
Tamil, Solo} Kamqu, and several others; because the Marco-
m'te garrisons, which are kept there, are very curious and strict
in their observation upon travellers, and searching lest any of
the banished persons of note should make their escape that way
into Mama ; but by this means, as we were kept out of the
cities, so our whole journey was a desert, and we were obliged
to enearnp and lie in our tents, when we might have had very
good accommodation in the cities on the way: this the young
lord was so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad,
when we came to severalcitiesonthe way; but layabroad him-
self,with his servant, inthewoods, and met us always at the
appointed places.

We were just entered Europe, having passed the river Km,
which, inthae parts, is the boundary between Europe and Air's,-
andthe firstcityontheEuropemsidewascslledSalg Masks},
which is as much as sosay,thegreat cityon the riverKua;
and here we thought to have seen some evident alteration in the
people, their manner, their habit, their religion, and theit busi-
ness; but we were mistaken; for as we had a vast desert to
pass, which, by relation, is near seven hundred miles long in
some places, but not above two hundred miles over where we
passed it; so, till We came past that horrible place, we found
very little difference between that country and the Mongul Tar--
rary; the people mostly Pagans, and little better than the sa-
vages of Amerita; their houses and towns full of idols, and their
way of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities as above,
and the villages near them; where they are Christians, as they
call themselves, of the Greek church; but have their religion
mingled with so many reliques of superstition, that it is scarce
to be known in some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft.
In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must, after all
our dangers were, in our imagination, escaped, as before, have
been plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered by a troop
of thieves; of what country they were, whether the roving
hands of the Orrin/ii, a kind of 'l'arrarr, or wild people on the
bank of the 05}, had ranged thus far; or whether they were
the sable-hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a loss to know; but
they were all on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were
at first about five-and-forty in number; they came so near to us
as within about two musquet shot; and, asking no questions,
they surrounded us with their horse, and looked very earnestly
upon us twice ; at length they placed themselves just in our way;
upon which we drew up in a little line before our camels, being
not above sixteen men in all; and being drawn up thus, we
halted, and sent out the Siberian servant who attended his lord,
to see who they were; his master was the more willing to let
him go, because he was not a little apprehensive that they were
a Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came up near
them with a flag of truce, and called them; but though he spoke
several of their languages, or dialects of languages rather, he
could not understand a word they said: however, after some
signs to him not to come nearer to them at his peril, so he said
he understood them to mean, offering to shoot at him if he ad-
vanced, the fellow came back no wiser than he went, only that
by their dress, he said, he believed them to be some 'l'errerr of
Kclnmk, or of the Cinema hordes; and that there must be
more of them upon the great desert, though he never heard that
any of them ever were seen so far north before.

This was small comfort to us; however, we had no remedy:
there was on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile's distance,
a little grove or clump of trees, which stood close together, and
very near the road; I immediately resolved we would advance
to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could there;
for, first, I considered that the trees would in a great measure
cover us from their arrows; and in the next place, they could
not come to charge us in a body: it was, indeed, my old Por-
tuguese pilot who proposed it; and who had this excelleney It-
tending him, namely, that he was always resdiest and most apt
to direct and encourage us in cases of the most danger. We
advanced immediately with what speed we could, and gained
that little wood, the 'l'arrarr, or thieves, for we know not what
to call them, keeping their stand, and not attempting to hinder
us. When we came thither, we found, to our great satisfaction,
that it was a swampy, springy piece of ground, and, on the one
side, a very great spring of water, which running out in a little
rill or brook, was a little farther joined by another of the like
bigness; and was, in short, the head or source of a considerable
river, called afterwards the Wirnta. The trees which grew
about this spring, were not all above two hundred, but were
verylargesndstoodprettythick; sothat assoonsswegotin,
we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy, unless they
alighted and attacked us on foot.616 LIFE um onxni'mus

But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese, with indefa-
tigable application, cut down great arms of the trees, and laid
them hanging, not at quite of from one tree to another; so
that he made a continued fence almost round us.

We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy some hours,
without perceiving they made any motion; when about two
hours before night, they came down directly upon us; and
though we had not perceived it, we found they had been joined
by some more of the same,so that they were near fourscore horse,
whereof, however, we fancied some were women. They me
on till they were within half shot of our little wood, when we
fired one musquet without ball, and called to them in the Russian
tongue, to know what they wanted, and bid them keep 05; but,
as if they knew nothing of what we said, they came on with a
double fury directly up to the wood-side, not imagining we were
so' barricaded, that they could not break in; our old pilot was
our captain, as well as he had been our engineer; and desired of
us not to fire upon them till they came within pistol shot, and
that we might be sure to kill: and that when we did fire, we
should .be sure to take good aim. We bade him give the word
of command, which be delayed so long, that they were, some of
them within two pikes length'of us when we fired.

We aimed so true (or Providence directed our shot so sure)
that we killed fourteen of them, and wounded several others,.as
also semen! of their horses; for we had all of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets, at least.

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated im-
mediately about one hundred rod from us; in which time we
loaded our pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance, we
sallied out, and catched four or five of their horses, whose riders,
we suppou, were killed; and coming up to the dead, we could
easily perceive they were Tartan, but knew not from what
country, or how they came to make an excursion such an unusual
length.
About an hour after, they made a motion to attack us again,
and rode round our little wood, to see where else they might
break in; but finding us always ready to face them, they went
off again, and we resolved not to stir from the place for that
night.

We slept little, you may be sure; but spent the most part of
the night in strengthengig our situation, and harrieading the
entrances into the wood; and, keeping a strict watch, we waited
for day-light, and, when it came, it gave us a very unwel-
come discovery indeed: for the enemy, who, we thought, were
discouraged with the reception they had met with, were now in.
creased to no less than three hundred, and had set up eleven or
twelve huts and tents, as if they were resolved to beseige us;
and this little camp they had pitched upon the open plain, at
about three quarters of a mile from us. We were indeed sur-
prised at this discovery; and now, I confess, I gave myself over
for lost, and all that I had. The loss of my effects did not lie so
near me (though they were wry considerable) as the thoughts of
falling into the hands of such barbarians, at the latter end of my
journey, after so many difficulties and hazards as I had gone
through; and even in sight of _ m where we expected
safety and deliverance. As for planer he was raging: he
declared, that to lose his goods would be his ruin; and he would

rather die than be starved; and he was for fighting to the last
dro .

ghe young lord, as gallant as ever flesh shewed itself, was for
fighting to the. last also; and my old pilot was of the opinion
we were able to resist them all, in the situation we then were in:
and thus we spent the day in debates of what we should do; but
towards evening, we found that the number of our enemies still
increased: perhaps, as they were abroad in several parties for prey,
thefirsthadsent outscoutstocallfor help,andto aequaintthemof
thebooty; andwedid notknow but by themorningthey might
still be a greater number; so I began to inquire of those people
we had brought from Tabolski, if there was no other or more
private ways, by which we might avoid them in the night, and
perhaps, either retreat to some town, or get help to guard us
over the desert.

The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord, told us, if
we designed to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to
carry us oil: in the night to a way that went north towards the
Petraz, by which he made no question but we might get away,
and the Tartar: never the wiser; but he said, his lord had told
him he would not retreat, but would rather chuse to fight. I
told him, he mistook his lord; for that he was too wise a man to
love fighting for the sake of it; that I knew his lord was brave
enough by what he had shewed already; but that his lord knew
better than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen men fight five
hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced them to it; and
that if he thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we
had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He answered, if his lord
gave him such orders, he would lose his life if he did not perform
it. We soon brought his lord to give that order, though pri-
vately, and we immedkcly prepared for the putting it in practice.

And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in
our little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to
make it burn all night, that the Tartar: might conclude we were
still there; but, as soon as it was dark, that is to say, so as we
could see the stars (for our guide would not stir before), having
all our horses and mels ready loaden, we followed our new
guide, who, I soon found, steered himself by the pole, or north
star, all the country being level for a long way. .

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be
lighter still; not that it was quite dark all night, but the 'moon
began to rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter than we
wished it to be; but by six o'clock the next morning we were
gotten near forty miles, though the truth is, we almost spoiled
our horses. Here we found a Rania village, named Kinse-
zr'arqu, where we rested, and heard nothing of the Mark
Tartar: that day. About two hours before night we set out
again, and travelled till eight the next morning, though not quite
so hard as before; and about seven o'clock we passed a little
river, called Kirtza, and came to a good large town inhabited by
Rumbas, and very populous. called Ozmfi. There we heard,
that several troops, or hordes of Kala-rick: had been abroad upon
the desert, but that we were now completely out of danger of them,
which was to our great satisfaction, you may be sure. Here we
were obliged to get some fresh horses, and having need enough
of rest, we staid five days; and my partner and I agreed to give
the honest Siberian, who brought us thither, the value of ten
pistoles for his conducting us.

In five days more we came to Veuuima, upon the river "'17-.
zogda, and running into the Dwiaa, we were there very happily
near the end of our travels by land, that river being navigable
in seven days' passage to Arch-Angel: from hence we came to
Laws-rude}, the third of 720; and providing ourselves with
two luggage-boats, and a barge, for ovvm convenience, We
embarked the seventh, and arrived all e at Arm-Angel the
eighteenth, having been a year, and live months, and three days
on the journey, including our stay of eight months and odd days
at Tobolski.

We were obliged to stay at this place six Weeks for the arrival
of the ships, and must have sarried longer, had not a Harshrglur
come in above a'month sooner than any of the English ships;
when, after some consideration that the city of Hamburg): might
happentobeasgoodamarltetforourgoods as London, weal]
tookfeight with him; and having put my goods on board, it
wasmostnaturalformetoput my stewardonboardtotalte
eare ofthern; by which means my younglordhadasuficient
opportunity to conceal himself, never coming on shore in all the
time we staid there; and this he did, that he might not be seen
in the city, where some of the Moscow merchants would certainly
have seen and discovered him. _

We sailed fiom Arch-Angel the twentieth of August thesame
year; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived in the
Elle the thirteenth of September. Here my partner and I found
a very good sale for our goods, as well those of China as the
sables, 8c. of Siberia; and dividing the produce of our effects,
my share amounted to PS347 5 17:. 3d. notwithstanding so many
losses we had sustained, and charges we had been at; only re-
membering that I had included in this about six hundred pounds'
worth of diamonds which I had purchased at Bengal.

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up the
Elle, in order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved
to seek protection, and where he could correspond with those of
his father's friends who were left alive. He did not part with-
out all the testimonies he could give me of gratitude for the ser-
vice I had done him, and his sense of my kindneas to the prince
his father.

To conclude: M staid near four months'in Hamburg/1, I
came fi-om thence over land to the Hague, where I embarked in
the packet, and arrived in London the 10th of ffarmary 1705,
having been gone from England ten years and nine months.

And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I am prepar-
ing for a longer journey than all these, having lived seventy-two
years a life of infinite variety, and learned sufficiently to know
the value of retirement, and the blessing of ending our days in
peace.

THE END.
