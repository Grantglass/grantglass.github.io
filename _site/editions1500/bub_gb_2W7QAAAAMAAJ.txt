PREFACE 4 , 


If ever the storjr of any private man’s adven- 

m - • 

tures in die world were worth making pub- 
lic, and were acceptable when published, the 
Editor of this account thinks this will be so. 

The wonders of this man’s .life exceed all 
that (he thinks) is to be found extant ; the 
life of one man being scarce capable of a great- 
er variety;- 

The story is told with modesty, with seri- 
ousness, and with a religious application of 
events to the uses to which wise men always 
apply them, viz. to the instruction of others 
by this example, and to justify and honour the 
wisdom of Providence in all the variety of our - 
circumstances, let them happen how they will* 

The Editor believes this narrative to be a 
just history of fact ; neither is there any appear- 
ance of fiction in it and though he is well

CRUSOE

T WAS born nl York, in the year 1632, of a reputable fa* 
J.L mily. My father was a native of Bremen, w ho by mer- 
chandising at Bull for some time, gained a very plentiful 
ifortune. He married my mother at York, who received 
her first breath in that country ; and as her maiden name 
was Robinson, 1 was called Robin-son K reutmaer ; which not 
Being easily pronounced in the English tongue, we are com- 
monly known by the name of Crusoe. 

I was the youngest of three brothers. The eldest was a 
lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart’s regiment, but slain by the 
Spaniards.: what became of the other I could never learn. 

No charge or pains were wanting in my education. — 
My father designed me for the law ; yet nothing woifld 
nerve me but I must go to sea, both against the will of my 
father, the tears of my mother, and the entreaties of friends. 
One morning my father expostulated very warmly with me: 
What reason, says he, have you to leave your native coun- 
try, where there must be a more certain prospect of con- 
-tent and happiness, to enter into a wandering condition of 
nneasiness and uncertainty ? He recommended to me 
Augur’s w'ish, “Neither to desire poverty nor riches:” 
that a middl^ state of life was the most happy, and that 
■the high towering thoughts of raising our condition by wan- 
dering abroad, w ere surrounded with misery and danger, 
and often ended with confusion and disappointment. I 
entreat you, nay, I command' you, (says he) to desist from 
these intentions. Consider your older brother, w ho laid 
down his life for his honour, or rather lost it for his disobe- 
dience to my will.- If you will go (added he) my prayer* 
®hall however be offered for, your preservation ; but a time 
may come, when desolate, oppressed, or forsaken, . yoa

mrv wish you had taken your poor despised father's counsel. 
He pronounced these words with such a moving and pater- 
nal eloquence, wjiile floods of tears ran down his aged cheeks, 
that it seemed to stem the torrent of my resolutions. But 
this soon wore off, and a little after ! informed my mother, 
that I could not settle to any business, my resolutions were 
so strong to see the -world ; and begged she would gain my 
father's consent only to go one voyage ; which if it did not 
prove prosperous, 1 would never attempts second. But my 
desire w as as vain as my -folly in asking. - Aly mother pas- 
sionately expressed her dislike of this proposal, telling me 
/'"That as she saw I was bent upon mwown destruction, con- 
“ trary to their will and my duty, she would say no more* 

*• but leave me -to myself to do whatever 1 pleased." 

1 was then, I. think, nineteen years old, when one time be- 
ing at Hall, 1 met a school-fellow of mine going along with 
his father, wIkv was master of a ship, to London; and ac- 
quainting him with my wandering desires; he assurer! me of 
a free passage, and a plentiful share of what was necessary. 
Thus-, without imploring a blessing, or taking farewell of my 
parents', I took shipping on the first of September IGo 1. We 
set sail soon after, and our ship had scarce left the Humber 
•e-stern, when there arose so violent a storm, that being ex- 
tremely sea-sick, 1 concluded the judgment of God deserv- 
edly followed me for my disobedience to my dear parents. 

It was then I called to mind the good advice of 'my father ; - 
how easy and comfortable was. a middle state of life ; and 
I firmly resolved, if it pleased God to set me on dry land 
once more, I would return to my parents, implore their for- 
giveness, and hid a final adieu to my wandering inclinations. 

Such were my thoughts while the storm continued ; but 
these good resolutions decreased with the danger ; more 
especially when my companion came to me clapping me on 
the shoulder : “ What, Bob l” said he, “ sure you was not 
" frightened last night with scarce a capful of wind r" — . 

“ And do you,” cried I, “call such a violent storm a capful 

of wind r" “ A storm you fool you," said he, “ this is no- 
**' thing j a good ship and sea-room always baffles such a 
•* foolish squall of wind as that: But you’re a fresh water 
“ sailor : Come boy, turn out, see what fine w eather vve have 
“ now, and a good bowl of punch will drow n all your past 
“ sorrows." In short, the punch was made, 1 w as drunk, and 
iu one night’s time drowned both my repentance and my

f ood resolutions, forgetting entirely the vows and promises 
made in my distress : and whenever any reflections would 
return on me, what by company, and what by drinking, I 
soon mastered those fits, as I-derklingly called them, liut 
tins only made way for another trial, .whereby I could not 
but see how much I was beholden to kind Providence. 

Upon the sixth day we came to an anchor in Harwich road, 
where we lay wind-bound with some Newcastle ships ; and 
there being good anchorage, and our cables sound, the sea- 
men -forgot their late toil and danger, and spent the time as 
merry as ifthey had been on shore. Buton the eighth day 
there arose a brisk gale of wind, which prevented our tiding . 
it up the river ; and still increasing, our ship rode f'orecasti j 
in, and shipped several large seas. v . 

It was not long before horror seized the seamen them- 
selves, and I heard the master express this melancholy ejacu- 
lation, “ JLord have mercy upon us, we shall be all lost and 
M undone !” For my part, sick unto death, I kept my cabin*, 
till the universal and terribly dreadful apprehensions of our 
speedy fate made me get upon deck; and there I was af- 
frighted indeed. ^The sea went mountains high : I co 1 1 
see nothing but distress around us ; two ships had cut their 
masts on board, and another was foundered ; two more thaf 
had lost tbeir anchors,, were forced out to the mercy of the 
ocean : and to save our lives we were forced to cut cur . 
horemast and mainmast quite away. *. 

Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of my dreadful 
oondition ? I was bat a fresh water sailor, and therefore it 
seemed more terrible. • Our ship was very good,Jsut over- 
loaded ; which made the sailors often cry out. “She would 
“ founder \ M Words I then was ignorant of. All this while 
the storm continuing, and rather increasing, the master and 
the most sober part of his men went to prayer's, expecting 
death every moment. In the middle .of the night one cried 
out, “ We had sprung a leak another, “ Tiial there w^s 
“four feet water in the hold.”- I was just ready to expire 
with fear, when, immediately all hands were called to tire 
pump;, and the men forced me also in that extremity to . 
share with them in their labour. While thus employed, the 
master espying some light colliers, fired a gun as a signal of 
distress ; and I, not understanding what it meant, and think, 
ing that either the ship broke, or some dreadful thing hap- 
pened, fell into a *v.®*n_ Even in that oomiaon condition 1

of wop, nobody minded me, excepting to thrust me aside 
with their feet, thinking me dead, and it was a great whilw 
before 1 recovered. 

Happy it was for us, when upon the signal given, they 
ventured out their boats to save our lives. All our pumping 
had been in vain, and vain had all our attempts been, had they 
not cometo our ship’s side, and our men cast them a rope over 
the stern with a buoy to it, Which after great labour they got 
hold of, and we hauling them up to us gotjnto their boat^ 
and left our ship, which we perceived sink within less than a 
quarter of an hour ; and thus I learned what was meant by 
foundering at sea. And how the men incessantly laboured to 
recover their own ship; but the sea ran so high, and tire wind 
blew so hard, that they thought it convenient to hale within 
shore ; which, with great difficulty and danger, at last we 
happily effected, landing at a place called Cr.omer, not far front 
Winterlon light-house; from whence we all walked to Yar- 
mouth, where as objects of pity, many good people furnish- 
ed us with necessaries to carry us either to Hull or London. 

Strange, after ail this, like tire prodigal son, I did not re- 
turn to my father ; who hearing of die ship’s calamity, for a 
long time thought me entombed in the deep. No doubt 
but I should have shared on his fatted Half, as thfe scripturc- 
expresseth it ; but my ill fate still pushed me on., in spite of 
the powerful convictions of reason au«£ consciehce. 

When we had been Jt Yarmouth three days, I met my 
old companion, who had given me the invitation to go on 
board along with his father. His behaviour and speech, 
were altered, ami in a melancholy manner asked me how I 
did, telling his father who I Was. and how I had made this 
voyage only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Upon 
which the old gentleman turning to me gravely, said, 

“ Young man, you ought never to go to sea anymore, but to. 

“ take this for a certain sign that you never will prosper in 
“ a. seafaring condition.” ** Sir,” answered I, " vVill yon 
“ take the same resolution ?”. “ It is a different case,” said 
lie, “it is my calling, and consequently my duty ; but as 
“ you have made this voyage for a trial, you see what ilfc 
“ success Heaven has set before your eyes ; and perhaps 

our miseries have been on your account, like Jonah in the 
“ ship of J arshish. But pray what are you, and on what. 

“ account did you go to Sea r” Upon which I very freely 
declared my whole story ; at the end of whic'k he made thi-s.

exclamation : ■“Ye sacred powers: what had I committed, 

*• that such a wretch should enter into my ship to heap up- 
*' on me such a deluge of miseries !” But soon recollecting 
I»is passion, “ Young man, ,r said he, if you do not go back, 

** depend upon it, wherever you go> you will meet with - 
" disasters, and disappointments till your father’s words are 
*' fulfilled upon you.” And so we parted. 

I thought at first to return home ; , but shame opposed that, 
good motion, as thinking I should be laughed at by ray neigh- 
bours and acquaintance. So strange is the nature of youth, 
who are not ashamed to sin, but yet ashamed to repent ; and , 
so far from being ashamed of those actions for which they -- 
may be accounted fools, they think it folly '•.> return to their 
duty, which is the principal mark of' wisdom. In short, I 
travelled up to London, resolving .upon a voyage ; and a 
voyage I soon heard of, by my acquaintance with a captain ,* 
who took a fancy to me, to go to the coast of Guinea • Hav- 
ing some money, and appearing like a gentleman, I went- 
on board, nQt as a common sailor or foremast man ; nay, 
the commander agreed I should go that voyage with him 
. without any expence ; that I should be his messmate and 
companion, - and I was . very welcome to carry any thing 
with me, and make the best merchandise I could. 

I blessed my happy fortune, and humbly thanked my cap- 
* tain for this offer; and acquainting my friends in Yorkshire^ 
forty pounds were sent me, the greatest part of which my 
dcar.iathcr and mpther contributed to, vfith which I bought 
toys and trifles, as the captain directed me. My captain 
also, taught me navigation, how to keep an account of the 
ship’s course, take an observation, and led me into the know- 
ledge of several useful branches of the mathematics. And 
indeed this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant j 
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for 
my adventure, which produced, at my return to London, 
almost three hundred pounds. But in this voyage I wan " 
extremely sick, being thrown into a violent calenture through 
the excessive beat, trading upon the- coast from the latitude 
of fifteen degrees north, even to the line itself. 

But alas ! my dear friend the captain soon departed this 
life after his arrival. This was a sensible grief to me ; yet 
I resolved to go another voyage with his mate, who had 
now got command of the ship. This proved a very unsuc- 
cessful one ; for though I did not carry quite a hundred -

pounds-of my late acquired, wealth, (so that I had two hun- 
dred pounds left, which- 1 reposed with the Captain’s widow 
who was an honest gentlewoman) yeti my misfortunes in 
this unhappy voyage were very great. For our ship sailing 
towards the Canary islands, we were chased by a Saloe 
rover ; and in spite of all the haste we could. make, by crowd- 
ing as much canvas as eur yards could spread, or our masts 
carry, the pirate gained upon uv so that we prepared our— 
sel ves to fight*. They had eighteen guns, and we had but 
twelve. About three in she afternoon there was a desperate 
engagement, wherein many, were killed and wounded cm* 
both sides ; but finding ourselves overpowered w ith nmn-. 
bers, our ship dvabied, and ourselves too impotent to have 
the leastliopes of success, we were forced to surrender; and; 
accordingly were all carried prisoners into the port of Salee.. 
Our men were sent to the Emperor’s court to be sold there 
but the pirate captain taking notice of me, kept, me to be- - 
bis own slave-.. 

In this coudition, T thought myself the most miserable 
creature on earth, and. the prophecy of my father came afresh. 

% into my thoughts.. However, my condition was better than. 

1 thought itto'be, as will soon appear. Some hopes indeed. 

I had that my new. patron would go to sea again, where he 
might be taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and. 
then I should be set at liberty. But in this I was mistaken 
for he never v took me with him, but left me to look after his 
little garden, and dj the drudgery of his house, and when he 
returned from sea,, would make me lie in the cabin, and?: 
look after the ship. I had no one that X-couldcommuhicate- 
auy thoughts to, which were continually meditating my. 
escape ; no Englishman, irishman, or Scotchman here, butt 
myself and for two years I could sec nothing practicable^, 
but only pleased myself with the imagination. 

After scaie length of time, my patron, as 1 found, grew so, 
poor that he could noi fit out his ship as usual ; and then her 
used constantly, once or twice a week, if the weather was 
fair, to go out a fishing, taking roe aud a young Moresco boy 
to row the boat ; and so much pleased was he with me for 
my dexterity, in catching the fish, that he would often send; 
me with a Moor, who was one of his kinsmen, and the Mo- 
resoo youth, to catch a dish of fish for hitn. 

One morning, as we Wert? at the sport, there arose such, 
a ihtck fog, tj’at we lost sight of the shore,; t owing

knew not which way, we laboured all the night^and in the 
morning found ourselves in the ocean, two leagues trora land. 
However, we attained there at length, and made the greater 
haste, because our stomachs were exceedingly sharp and 
hungry. In order to prevent such disasters tor the future, 
ia>v patron ordered a carpenter to build a little state room or 
cabin in the middle of the long-boat, with a place behind it 
to steer and hale home the main sheet, with other eonveni- 
encies to keep in from the weather, as also lockers to put in ad 
manner of provisions* with a handsome shoulder of mutton 
sail, gibing over the cabin. 

In this he frequently took us out a fishing ; and one time 
inviting two or three persons of distinction to go with him, 
made provision extraordinary, providing also three fusees, 
with powder and shot, that they might have some sport at 
fowling along the sea-coast. The next morning, the' boat 
-was made clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every 
thing ready ; but their minds altering, my patron ordered 
lis to go a fishing,, for that h'is guests would certainly sup 
with him. that night. . 

And now I began to think of ray deliverance indeed. In 
order to this I persuaded the Moor to get some provisions 
«n board, as not daring to meddle with our patron’s ; and. 
be taking my advice, we stored ourselves with rusk buiseuit, 
and three jars of water. Besides,. I privately conveyed 
into the boat a. bottle of brandy, some twine, thread, a ham- 
mer, hatchet, and a saw ; and, in particular, ;ome bees wax,, 
w hich was a great comfort to me, and served to make can- 
dies. I then persuaded Mnley (for so was the Moor called) 
to procure some powder and shot,. pretending to-kiil seacur- 
leus, which he innocently and readily agreed to. In short, 
being provided with all things necessary, we sailed out, re- 
solving for my own part to make mv escape, though it should 
cost me my life. 

When we had passed the castle* we fell a fishing ; but 
though I knew there was-a bite, I dissembled the matter, in 
order to put Out further to sea. Accordingly we ran a league 
further ^ when giving the boy the helm, arakpretending to 
stoop for something, I seized Mtiley by surprise udc! threw 
him overboard. As he was an excellent swimmer, he soon 
arose, and made towards the boat ; upon which, I took out 
a fusee, and presented at him : “ Mu ley,” said I, “ I never. 
y yet designed to do you any barm, and seek nothing nqyr

" but my redemption. I* know you are able enough te swin* 

,f to shore, and save your life ; but if you are resolved to 
“ follow me, to the endangering of mine, the very moment 
“you proceed, L will shoot you through the head.” The 
harmless creature at these words, tumedhimself from me, 
and I make no doubt got safe to land. Then taming to the- 
boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at the action ; but I put. 
him out of all fear, telling him* that if he would be true and* 
faithful to me, I would do w r ell by him. " And therefore,” 
said I, “ you must stroke your face to be faithful ; and, as the* 

** Turks have learned you, swear by Mahomet, and the beardi 
“ of your father, or else I will throw you into the sea also.” 

So innocent did the child then look, and with such an oblige . 
iiig smile consented, that I readily believed him, and front. , 
that day forward began to love him entirely. 

We then pursued our voyage ; and least they should think 
me gone to the Straits’ mouth", I kept to the southward to« 
the truly Barbarian coast ; but in the dusk of the evening, I: 
changed my course, and steering directly S. and by E. that; 

I might keep near the shore; and.having a fresh gale of windy „ 
with a pleasant smooth sea, by three o’clock, next day I was 
one hundred and fifty miles beyond the Emperor. of Morocco’s* 
dominions. Yet still having the dreadfull apprehension of- 
being retaken, I continued sailing for five days successively,, 
till such lime as the wind shifting to the southward, made me. 
conclude, that if any vessel was in chase of me, they would 
proceed no farther. After so much fatigue and thought, I. 
anchored at the mouth of a little river, Lknew not what or 
where; neither did 1 thensce any people.. What I principally, 
wanted was fresh water ; and I was resolved about dusk to 
swim ashore. But no sooner did the gloomy clouds of night- . 
Begin to succeed tire declining day, when we heard such* 
barking, roaring, and howling, of wild creatures, that one- 
might have thought the very strongest monsters of nature, on 
infernal spirits had their residence there. Poor Xury, almost 
dead with fear, entreated me not to go on shore that night,. 
“Supposing I dont, Xury,” said I, “and in the morning we- 
“ should see men who are worse than those we fear, what 
“then?” “O den we may givedem deshoot gun,” replied Xury,. 
laughing, 1 " and degun make dem all run away.” The w’it and 
broken English which the boy had learned among thecaptives 
of our nation, pleased me entirely ; and to add to his cheer— 

. iyiness, I gave him a drain of the bottle ; we could get

little sleep all the night for those terrible howlings they made; 
and, indeed, we were both very much atfrighted, when, by 
the rollings of the water, 6nd other tokens, w r e justly con- 
cluded one of those monsters made towards our boat. 1 could 
not see, till it came within two oars length, when taking my 
fusee, I let fly at him. Whether I hit him or no, I cannot 
tell ; but he made towards the shore, and the noise of my 
gun increased the stupendous noise of the monsters. 

7'he next morning I was resolved to go on shore to get 
fresh water, and venture my life among the beasts or savages, 
should either attack me. Xury said, he would take one of 
the jars and bring me some. I asked him, why he would 
go, and not I ? The poor bov answered, "If wild mans come, 
they eat me, you go -away.” A mind scarcely now to be 
ifnitated, so contrary to self-preservation, the most powerful 
few of Nature. This indeed increased'my affection to the 
child. t " Well, dear Xury,” said I, "we will both go ashore* 
bbth kill wiki mans,, arid they shall eat neither of us”. So 
giving Xury a piece of rusk-broad to eat, and a dram* war 
waded a shore, carrying nothing with us but our arms, and 
two jars for water. I did not go out of sight of the boat, as 
dreading the savages coming down the river in their canoes; 
but the boy seeing a low descent or vale about a mile in the 
country, he wandered to it : and then running back to me 
with great precipitation, I thought he was pursued by some 
savage or wild beast ; upon which I approached, resolving 
to perish or protect him from danger. As he came nearer - 
to me, I saw' something hanging over his shoulders, which 
was a creature he had shot like a hare, but different in colour, 
and longer legs ; how ever. We were glad of it, for it proved 
wholesome and nourkhiBg meat : but what added to our jof 
was, my bdy assured ane there was plenty of water, and that 
be see ]io ivitd mans. And greater still was *>ur comfort,, when 
tne tide was out, without going so far up into the conptry. 

In this place I began to consider that the Canary and Cape 
de Verde islands lay not far olf ; but having no instrument, 

I knew not what latitude, or when to stand off to sea for 
them ; yet my hopes were, I should meet some of the Eng- 
lish trading vessels, who would relieve and take us in. 

The place I was in was no doubt that wild country, in- 
habited only by a few, that lies between the "Emperor of 
Morocco’s dominions and the Negroes.. It is filled with” 
w i!d beasts, and the Moors use it for hunting chiefly. Fro*

this place I thought I saw the top of the mountain TeneriiR 
in the Canaries ; which made me try twice to attain it; but, 
as often was I drove back, and so forced to pursue my for- 
tune along shore. 

Early one rooming we came to an anchor under a little- 
point of land, .But pretty high ; and the tide beginning to 
ilow, we lay ready to go further in. But Xury, whose 
youthful and penetrating, eyes were sharper than mine,, in a 
soft lone, desired me to Keep far from land, lest we should be 
devoured.. " For look yonder, mayter," said he, and seer 
" de dreadful monster fast asleep on de side of de hill." — 
Accordingly looking where he pointed, I espied a fearful 
monster indeed. It was a terrible great lion that lay cn* 
shore, covered as it v ere by a shade of a piece of the hill.. 

" Xury,” said I, " You shall go on shore and kill him." But 
the boy looked amazed : " Me led! him!” says he, “ he eat 
me at one mouth meaning one .mouthful. Upon which I 
bid him lie still, and charging my biggest gun with two* - 
slugs, and a good charge of powder, 1 took the best aim L-..' 
could to shoot him through the head, but his leg lying over 
liis nose, the slug broke his. knee-bone. The lion awaking- 
with the pain, got up, but soon fell down, giving the most. . 
hideous groan 1 ever heard : but takipg my second pieeej 
1 shot him through the head, and then he lay struggling for. 
life. Upon this»Xury took heart, and desired my leave t®, , 
on shore. "Go then,” said I. Upon which taking a, _ 
ittle gun in one hand, he swam to shore with the other, and. 
coming close to the lion, put a period to his life by shooting* 
him again through the head. 

But this was spending our ammunition in vain, the flesh, 
not being good to eat. Xury was like a champion, ancL 
comes on hoard for a hatchet, to cut off the head of his ene- 
my ; but not having strength to perform it, he cut off and 
brought me a foot. I bethought me, however, that his ski*, 
would be of use. This work cost Xurv and me a whole 
dav ; when spreading it on the top of our cabin, the hot, 
beams of the sun effectually dried it in two days time, and 
it afterwards served me for a bed to lie on. 

And now we sailed southerly, living sparingly on our 
provisions, and went no oftneron shore than w-e were obliged 
for fresh water. My design was to make the river Gambia 
or Senegal, or any where about the Cape de Y 7 crde, in hopes

IS 


•tr*ur rfte, my next course was to seek for the islands, or lose 
my life among the Negroes. And in a word, I put mj 
whole stress upon this, “ Either that I must meet w ith some 
ship or certainly perish.” 

One day as we were sailing along, we saw people stand 
♦n the shore looking at us,; we could also perceive they 
were black and stai k naked. I was inclined to go On shore, 
but Xury cried, “No, no;” however, I approached nearer, 
and 1 found they run along the shore by me a good way. 
They had no w eapons in their hands, except one, who held 
a long stick, which Xury told me was a lance, with which 
they could kill at a great distance. I talked to them by signs 
and made them sensible I wanted something to eat ; they 
beckoned me to stop my boat, while two of them ran up 
into the country, and in less than half ah hour came back, 
and brought w r ith them two pieces of dried llesh, and some 
corn, which we kindly accepted ; and to prevent any fears 
on either side, they brought the tood 10 the shore, laid it 
down, then went and stood a great way otf till we fetched 
it on board, arid then came close to us again. 

but while we were returning thanks to-ihcm, being all we 
could afford, two mighty creatures came from the mountains ; 
©lie as it were pursuing the other with great fury, w hich we 
were the. rather inclined to believe, as they seldom appear 
but in -the night ; and both these swiftly passing by the ne- 
groes, jumped into the sea r wantonly swimming about, as 
' tho’ the diversion of the waters had put a stop to their fierce- 
ness. At last onejof them coming nearer to my boat than I 
expected or desired, I shot him directly thro’ the head > upon 
which he sunk immediately, yet rising again, would have 
willingly made the shore ; but between the wound and the 
strangling of the water, he died beiore he could reach it. 

It is impossible to express the consternation the poor Ne- 
groes were in at the firing of my gun ; much less can I men- 
tion their surprise, when they perceived the ' creature to be 
slain by it. I made signs to them to draw near it with a 
rope, and then gave it them to hale on shore. . It was a beau- 
.tiful leopard, which made me desire its skin : and the Ne- 
groes seeming to covet the carcase, I freely gave it to them. 
As for the other leopard, it made to shore, and ran with pro- 
digious swiftness out of sight. The Negroes having kindly 
furnished me with water, and with what roots and grains 
their country . afforded, 1 took my leave, and, after -elevo*

days sail, came in sight of the Cape de Verde, and thos« 
islands called by its name. But the great distance I was from 
it, and fearing contrary winds would prevent my reaching 
them, 1 began to grow melancholy and dejected, when, upon 
a sudden, Xury cried out, “ Master ! Master ! a ship with a 
sail ! and looked as afrighted as if it wa<s his master's ship 
sent in search of us. But I soon discovered she was a Por- 
tuguese ship, as I Thought bound to the coast of Guinea for 
Negroes. Upon which I strove for life to come up to them. 
But vain had it been, if through their perspective glasses they 
had not perceived me and shortened their sail to let me conic 
vip. Encouraged at this, I set up my patron’s ancient, and 
fired a gun, both as signals of distress ; upon which they 
very kindly lay to, so that in three hours time I came up 
with them. They spoke to me in Portuguese, Spanish, and 
French, but neither of these did I understand ; till at length 
a Scots sailor called, and then I told him I was an English- 
man, who had escaped from the Moors at Salee } upoa 
which they took me kindly on board, with all mv effects. 

Surely none can express the inconceivable joy I felt at 
this happy deliverance ! who from being a late miserable 
and forlorn creature, was. not only relieved, but in favour 
with the master of the snip, to whom, in return tor my de- 
liverance, I offered all I had. “ God forbid/’ said he, 
“ that I should lake any thing from you. Every thing shaH 
“be delivered to you when you come to Brazil. If I have 
** saved your life, it is no more than I should expect to ro*> 
“ r eive myself from any other, when in the 'same circum- 
“ stances I should happen to meet the like deliverance — ■ 
** And should 1 take from you what you have, and leave yon 
at Brazil, why, this would be only taking away a life I 
,e had given. My charity teaches me better. Those effects 
“ you have will support you there, and provide you a pas- 
sage home again.” Anri, indeed, he acted with the strict- 
est justice in what he did, taking my things into his posses- 
sion, and giving me an exact inventory, even to my earthen 
jars. He bought my boat of me for the ships use, giving 
me a -note of eighty pieces of eight, payable at Brazil ; and 
if any body offered more he would make it op. He also 
gave me sixty pieces for my boy Xury. It was with great 
reluctance I was prevailed upon to sell the child’s liberty, 
who had served me so faithfully j but the boy was willing 
himself ; and it was agreed, that after ten years he should

be made Tree, upon his renouncing Mahometanism, and 
embracing Christianity. 

Having a pleasant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived in 
the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in twenty- 
two days after. And here I cannot forget the generous 
treatment of the captain. He would take nothing for iny 
passage, gave, me twenty ducats for the leopard’s skin, and 
thirty for the lion’s. Every thing he caused to be delivered, 
and what I would sell he bought. In short I made about 
220 pieces of my cargo ; and with this stock I entered once 
more, as I may say into the scene of life. 

Being recommended to ari honest planter, I lived with 
him till such time as I was informed of the manner of their 
planting and making sugar ; and seeing how well they 
lived, and how suddenly they grew rich, I was filled with a 
desire to settle among them and resolved to get my money 
remitted ro me, and to purchase a plantation. 

To be brief, I bought a settlement next door to an honest 
and kind neighbour, born at Lisbon, of English parents, 
whose plantation joining to mine, we improved it very ami- 
cably together. Both our stocks were low, and lor two 
years we planted only for food : but the third year we 
planted some tobacco, and each of us dressed a large piece 
of ground the ensuing year for planting canes. But now 
I found how much Ig wanted assistance, and repented the 
loss of my dear boy Xury, 

Having none to assist me, my father’s words came ini* 
my mind ; and I used' to ask myself, if what I sought wag 
only a middle station of life, why could it not as well be ob- 
tained in England as here ? When I pondered on this with, 
regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance forsook ne. I 
had none to converse with but my neighbour ; no work to be 
done but by my own hands ; it often made me say, my con- 
dition was like to that of a man cast upon a, desolate island. 
So unhappy arc we in pur reflections, so forge dul of what 
^ood things we receive ourselves, and so unthankful for our 
deliverance from those calamities that others endure. 

I was in some measure settled, before the captain who 
took me up departed from the Brazils. One day I went t 
. him, and told him what stock I had in London, desiring hi* 
assistance in getting it remitted ; to which the gootl gentle- 
man readily consented, but would only have me send for 
half my money, lest it should miscarry ; which, if it did, I

might still have the remainder to support me : and so taking 
letters of procuration of me, bid me trouble myself no far- 
ther about it. 

And indeed wonderful was his kindness towards me ; for 
he not only procured the money I had drawn for upon my 
captain’s widow, but sent me over a servant? with a cargo 
proportionable to my condition. He also sent me over tools 
of all sorts,- iron-work, and utensils necessary for my planta- 
t ion, which proved to be of the greatest use to me in my 
business. 

Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon success 
crowning my prosperous labours, 1 might have rested happy 
in that middle state of life ray father had so often recommend- 
ed : yet nothing would content me, such was my evil ge- 
nius, but 1 must leave this happy station, for a foolish am- 
bition in rising ; and thus, once more, I east myself into the 
gieniest gulph of misery that ever poor creature fell into. 
Having lived four years in Brazil, I had no; only learned 
the language, but contracted acquaintance with the most 
eminent planters, and even the merchants of St. Sal vadore ; 
to w horn, once, by way of discourse, having given account 
of my two voy ages to the coast of Guinea, and the manner 
of trading there for mere trifles, by which w e furnish our 
plantations with negroes, they gave such attention to whatl 
said, that three of -them came one morning to me, and told 
me they had a secret proposal to make. After enjoining me 
to secrecy (it being an infringement on the powers of the 
kings of Portugal and Spain) they told me they had a mind 
to fit out a ship to go to Guinea, in order to slock the plan- 
tation with Negroes, which as they could not be publicly 
sold, they would divide among them ; and if I would go 
their super-cargo in the ship to manage the trading part, I 
should have an equal share of the Negroes, withouL provid- 
ing any stock. The thing indeed was fair enough, had I 
been in another condition. But I was born to be my own 
destroyer, could not resist the proposal, but accepted the of- \ 
fer upon condition of their looking after my plantation. So 
making a formal will, I bequeathed my effects to my good 
friend the captain, as my universal heir ; but obliged him 
to dispose of my effects as directed, one half «i the produce 
to himself’, and the other to be shipped to England. 

The ship being fitted out, and all things ready, we set 
sail the first of September, 1659, being the same day eight

years I left my father and mother in Yorkshire. We sailed 
northward upon the coast, in order to gain Africa, till we 
made Cape Augustine ; from whence going farther into the 
ocean, out of sight of land, we steered as though \ve were 
bound for the isle Fernand de Noreriba, leaving the islands 
on the east ; and then it was that we met with a terrible 
tempest, which continued for twelve days successively, so 
that the winds carried us wheresoever they pleased. In this 
perplexity one of our men died, and one man and a boy 
■were washed overboard. When the weather cleared up a 
little, we found ourselves eleven degrees north latitude, upon 
the coast of Guinea. Upon this the captain gave reasons 
for returning ; which I opposed, counselling him to stand 
away for Batbadoes, which, as I supposed, might be attain- 
ed in fifteen days. So altering our coarse, ive sailed north- 
. west and by west, in order to reach the Leeward islands ; 
but a second storm succeeding, drove us to the westward ; 
so that we were justly afraid of falling into the hands of 
cruel savages, or the paws of devouring beasts of prey. 

In this great distress, one- of our men, early in the morn-' 
ing cried out, “ Land, land !” which he had no sooner, cried 
out, but our ship struck ttpen z axil in a moment 

the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected 
we should all have perished immediately. We knew no- 
thing where we were, or upon what land we were driven ; 
w nether an island or the main, inhabited or not inhabited ; 
-and we could not so much as hope that the ship woukl hold out 
many minutes, without breaking in pieces, except the wind 
by a miracle, should turn about immediately. While we 
stood looking at one another, expecting death every moment. 
The mate lays ljold of the boat, and with the help of the rest 
got her flung oyer the ship’s side, and getting all into her, 
being eleven of us, committed ourselves to God’s mercy and 
the wild sea. And now we saw that this last effort would 
not be sufficient protection from death ; so high did the sea 
rise, that it was impossible the boat should live. As to 
making sail, we had none ; neither if we had, could we 
make use of any. So that when we had rowed, or rather 
were driven about a league and a half, a raging wave, like 
a lofty mountain, came rolling a-storn of us, and took us 
with such fury, that at once it overset the boat. Thus being 
swallowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to call upon 
the tremendous name of God ; much less to implore, in dying

ejaculations, his infinite mercy to receive our departing souTs. 

Men are generally counted insensible, when struggling in 
the pangs of death ; but while 1 was overwhelmed w ith 
water, Lhad the most dreadful apprehensions imaginable, 
her the joys^of heaven and the torments of hell, seemed to 
present themselves before me in these dying agonies, and 
even small space of time, as it were, between life and death. 

3 was going I thought I knew not whither, into a dismal 
gulp!) unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold 
iny friends, nor the light of this world any more ! Could I 
even have thought ot annihilation, or a total dissolution of ' 
ioul as vVell as body, the gloomy thoughts of havingoo far- * . 

ther being, no knowledge of what we hoped for, but an 
eternal quietus, without life or sense : even that, I say, 
v onld have been enough to strike me with horror and con- 
fusion ! I strove, however, to the last extremity, while all . 
my companions 'were overpowered and entombed in the 
deep : and it was with great difficulty I kept my breath till 
the wave spent itself, and retiring back, left me on the shore - 
half deaH with the water I had taken in. As soon as I got 
on my feet, 1 ran as fa.>t as I could, least another wave * 
should pursue nre, and carry me back again. But for all 
the haste I made, I could not avoid it : for the sea came 
after me like a high mountain, or furious enemy ; so that 
n;y business tvas to hold my breath, and by raising myself \ 
on the water, preserve it by swimming. The next dread- 
ful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep, but at 
the same time carried me with a mighty force and swiftness 
toward the shore ; when raising myself, I held out as well 
as possible, till at length the water having spent itself, be- 
gan to return, at which I struck forward and feeling ground 
with my feet, I took to my heels again. Thus being served • 
twice more, I was at length dashed against a piece of rock, 
in such a manner as left me senseless ; but recovering a 
little before the return of the wave, which, no doubt, would 1 
then have overwhelmed me, I held fast by the rock till those . t 
succeeding waves abated ; and then fetching another run, 
was overtaken by a small wave, which was scon conquered. ' ' 
But before any more could overtake P.ie, I reached the main 
land, where clambering up the cliits of the shore, tired and 
almost spent I sat down on the grass, free from the dangers . \ 
of the foaming ocean. 

No tongue can express tire ecstasies and transports that 
my soul felt at llie happy deliverance. It was like a reprieve

to a dying malefactor, with a halter about his neck, and 
ready to be turned off. I was wrapt up in contemplation, 
and often lifted up my hands, with the profouhdest humility, 
to the Divine Powers, for saving my life, when the rest of 
my companions were all drowned. And now I began to 
cast my eyes around, to behold what place I was in, and 
what 1 had next to do. I could see no house nor people ; I 
was wet, yet had no clothes to shift me ; hungry and thirsty, 
*yet had nothing to eat or drink ; no weapon to destroy any 
creature for my sustenance, nor defend myself against de- 
vouring beasts; in short, I had nothing but a. knife, a 
tobacco-pipe, and a box half filled with tobacco. The 
darksome night coming on upon me, increased my fearsfof 
being devoured by wild creatures ; my mind was plunged 
in despair, and having no prospect, as 1 thought, of life be- 
fore me, I prepared tor another kind of death than what I 
had lately escaped. I walked about a furlong to see if I 
could find- any fresh water, which I did, to my great joy : 
and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, 1 got up 
into a thick busby, tree, and seating myself so that 1 could 
•not fall, a deep sleep overtook me, and for that night buried 
my sorrows in a quiet repose. 

It was broad day the next morning before I awaked ; 
when I not only perceived the tempest was ceased, but saw 
the ship driven almost as far as the rock before-mentioned, 
which the waves had dashed me against, and which was 
about a mile from the place where 1 was. When I came 
down from my apartment in the tree, I perceived the ship’s 
boat two miles distant on my right-hand, lying on shore, as 
the waves had cast her. I thought to have got to her; but 
there being an inlet of water of about half a mile’s breadth 
between it and me, I returned again towards the ship, as 
hoping to find something for my more immediate subsistence. 
About nooni when the sea was calm, that 1 could come 
within a quarter of a mile of her, it was to my grief that I 
perceived, that if we had kept on board all our lives had 
been saved. These thoughts, and my solitude drew tears 
from my eyes, though all in vain. So resolving to get to 
the Ship, I stripped and leapt into the water, when swim- 
ming round her, I was afraid I should not get any thing to 
Jay hold of ; but it was my good fortune to espy a small 
piece of rope hang down by the fore-chains, so low that, by 
the help oi it, though with great difficulty, I got into tire

forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship wa$ 
bulged, and had a great deal of water- in her hold ; her stern 
was lifted up against a bank, and her head almost to the 
water. All her quarter, and what was there, was free and 
dry. The provisions I found In good'order,- with which I 
crammed my pockets, and losing no time, ate while I was 
doing other things ; I also found some rum, of which I took 
a hearty dram; and now I wanted for nothing except a 
boat, which indeed w as all, to carry aw ay what w as need- 
ful for me. 

Necessity occasions quickness of thought; We had se- 
veral spare yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or three 
large spars of wood. With these I fell to work, and slung 
as many of them overboard as I could manage, tying every 
one of them with a rope, that they might not drive away- 
This done I went down to the ship’s side, and tied four of 
them fast together at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying 
two or three short pieces of plank upon them crosswise, 1 
found it would bear me, but not any considerable weight. 
Upon which I went to work again, cutting a spare topmast 
into three lengths, adding t|iem to my raft with a great deal 
of labour and pains. 1 then considered what I should load, 
it with, it being not able to bear a ponderous burden. And 
this I soon thought of, first laying upon it all the planks at»d 
boards I could get ; next I lowered down three of the sea- 
men’s chests, alter 1 had filled them with bread, rice, three 
Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat’s flesh, and some 
European corn, what little the rats hud spared; and for 
liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our 
skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and four or 
five gallons of rack, which I stowed by themselves. By 
tiiis time the tide beginning to flow, I perceived my coat,, 
waistcoat, and shirt, sw im away, which 1 had left on the 
shore ; as for my linen-breeches and stockings, I swam with 
them to the ship ; but I soon found clothes enough, though I 
took no more than I wanted for the present. My eyes w ere 
chiefly on tools to work vs itii ; and, after a long search, I 
found out the carpenter’s chest, which 1 got safe down on tny 
Zait. I then looked for arms and ammunition, and in the 
great cabin found two good fowling pieces, 'two pjstols, se- 
veral powder horns filled, a small bag of shot, and two old 
rusty swords. I likewise found three barrels of powder, 
two of which were good, but the third had taken water.

also two or three broken oars, two saws, an ax, and a ham- 
mer, 1 then put to sea, and in getting to shore had three 
encouragements. 1, A smooth calm sea. 2. The tide 
rising and setting in to shore. 3. The little wind there was 
blew towards the land. Alter 1 had sailed about a mile, I 
found the raft to drive a little distance from the place where 
1 first landed; and then I perceived a little opening of the 
land, w ith a strong current of the tide running into it : up- 
on w hich I kept the middle of the stream. But great was 
my concern, when on a sudden the forepart of my raft ran 
aground, so that had I not, with great difficulty, for near 
half an hour, kept my back straining against true chests to 
keep my effects in their places, all I had would have gone 
into the sea. But after some time, the rising of the water 
caused the raft to float again, and coining up a little river 
with land on both sides, 1 landed in a little cave, as near the 
mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail, if any such 
providentially passed that way. 

Not far off, I espied a lull of stupendous height, sur- 
rounded w ith lesser hills about it, and thither I was resolv- 
ed to go and view the country, that I might see wbat part 
was best to fix my habitation. Accordingly, arming my- 
. self with a pistol, a fowling-piece, powder and ball, I as- 
cended the mountain. There I perceived I was in an 
islaud, encompassed by the sea ; no distant lands to be seen, 
but scattering rocks that lay to the west : that it seemed to 
be a barren place, and as 1 thought, inhabited only by wild 
beasts. 1 perceived abundance of fowls, but ignorant of 
w hat-kind, or whether good for nourishment ; I shot one of 
them at my return, which occasioned a confused screaming 
among the other birds, and I found it, by its colour and beak 
to be a kind of a hawk, but its flesh was-perfect carrion. 

When I came to my raft, 1 brought my effects on shore, 
jvhich work spent that day entirely ; and fearing that some 
cruel beastsmight devour me in the nighttime w hile J slept, I 
made a kind of hut or barricade with the chests and boards 
1 had brought on shore. That night I slept very comforta- 
bly ; aud the next morning my thoughts w r ere employed to 
make a further attempt on the ship, and bring away witat 
necessaries I could find, before another storm should break 
her to pieces. Accordingly I got on board as before, and 
prepared a second raft far more nice than the first, upon 
-which I brought away the carpenter’s stores, two or three

bags full of nails, a great jack-screw, a dozen or two of 
hatchets, and a grind stone. I also took away several things* 
that belonged to the gunner, particularly two or three iron 
crows, two barrels of musket-bullets, another fow ling-piece, 
a small quantity of powder, and a large bagful of small shot. 
Besides these, I took all the men’s clothes I could find, a 
spare fore top-sail, a hammock, and some bedding ; and 
thus completing my second cargo, I made all the baste to 
shore I could, fearing some wild beast might destroy w'hat 
I had there already. But I only found a little -wild cat 
sitting on one of the chests, which seeming not to fear me 
or the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a piece of 
biscuit, which she instantly ate and departed. 

When I had gotten these effects on shore, I went to w'erk 
in order to make me a little tent w ith the sail and some poles 
which I had cut for that purpose ; and having finished 
it, what tilings might be damaged by the weather l brought 
in, piling all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the 
belter to fortify it against any sudden attempt of man or 
beast. After tiiis, I blocked up the doors with some boards, 
and an empty chest, turned the long way out. I then 
charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed on the 
ground, slept as comfortably, till next morning, as though I 
had been in a Christian country. 

Now r , though I had enough to subsist me a long time, yet 
despairing of a sudden deliverance, or that both ammunition 
and prov ision might be spGnt before such thing happened, I 
coveted as much as I could ; and so long as the ship re- 
mained in that condition, I daily brought away one neces- 
sary or other ; particularly the rigging, sails, and cordage, 
some twine, a barrel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel 
of meal, three casks of rum, and, w hat indeed was most 
welcome to me, a whole hogshead of bread. 

The next time I w r ent I cut the cables in pieces, carried 
off a hawser whole, w'ilh a great deal of iron-work,, and 
made another raft with the mizen and sprit-sail-yard ; but 
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy burden 1 had upon 
it, and not being able so dextrously to guide it, as the former „ 
botii my cargo and I w r ere overturned. For my part, all 
the damage I sustained was a wet skin ; and, at low water, 
after much labour in diving,- 1 got most of tire cables, and 
some pieces -of iron.

OF ROBINSON CRUSORl 


25 


Thirteen clays I had now been in the island, and eleven 
times on board, bringing- -away all that was possible ; and I 
believe, had the weather been calm, I should have brought 
awav the whole ship, piece by piece. As I was going the 
twelfth time, the wind began to rise ; however, I ventured 
at low' water, and rummaging the cabin, in a locker l found 
several razors, scissors, and some dozens of knives and 
forks; and in another thirty-six pounds of pieces of eight, 
silver and gold. “Ah! simple vanity,” said l, “whom 
“ Ihis world so much dotes on, where is now thy virtue, thy 
“ excellency to me ? You cannot procure me one thing 
“ needful, nor remove me from this desolate island to a 
“ place of plenty. One of these knives, so meanly esteemed, 
“ is to me more preferable than all this heap, t/en there- 
“ fore remain w'here thou art, to sink in the deep as unre- 
“ garded, even as a creature whose life is not worth preserv- 
ing.” Yet, after all this exclamation, I wrapt it up in a 
piece of canvas, and began to think of making anotlier raft j 
but I soon perceived the wind began to ari«e, a fresh gale 
blowing from the shore, and the sky overcast with clouds 
and darkness ; so -thinking a raft to be in vain, I let myself 
into the water with what things I had about me, and it >vas 
with much difficulty I got ashore, when soon after it blew a 
fearful storm. 

1 hat night I slept very contentedly in my little tent, sur- 
rounded with all my effects ; but when I looked out in the 
morning no more ship was to be seen. This much sur- 
prised me for the present ; yet, when I considered I had lost 
no time, abated no pains, and had got every thing useful 
out of her, I comforted myself in the best manner, and en- 
tirely submitted to the w ill of Providence. 

My next thoughts w ere, how I should defend and secure 
myself from savages and wild beasts, if anv such were in 
the island. At one time I thought of digging a cave, at. 
another I was for erecting a tent ; and, at. length, 1 resolved 
to do both : The manner or form of which w ill not, 1 hope, 
-she unpleasing to describe. 

When I considered the ground where I was, that it was 
moorish, and had no fresh water near it, ray resolutions 
were to search for a soil healthy and well watered, w here I 
might not only be sheltered from the sun's scorching heat, 
but be more conveniently situated, as well to be secured 
frtm wild men and beasts of prey, as more easily to. dis- 
cover any distant sail, should it ever so happen.

And, indeed, it was not long before I had my desire. T 
found a little plain near a rbjrg hill, the front toward.? 
which being as steep as a house 9‘de, nothing could descend 
on me from the top'. On tne side of this rock was a little’ 
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a cave. ' 
Just before this place, on the circle of the green, I rcsol ved 
my tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed 
n hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a de- 
lightful green before my door, with a pleasing, though an 
irregular descent every w ay to the low grounds by the. sea- 
side, lying on the N . W. side of the hill, so that it was 
sheltered from the Excessive heat of the sun. After this, I 
drew a semi-circle, containing ten yards in a semi-diameter, 
and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows of 
strong stakes, not six inches' from each oilier. Then with a 
piece of cable which I had cut oil board, I regularly laid 
them in a- circle between the piles up to their tops, which 
were more than five feet out of the earth, and after drov« 
another row of piles looking within side against them, be- 
tween two or three feet high, which made me conclude it a 
little impregnable castle against .men and beasts. And for 
my better security 1 would have no door, but entered in 
and came out by the help or a ladder, which I also made. 

Kc<s w r as my fence and fortress, into which I carried all 
my riches, ammunition «nd stores. After which, working 
on the rock, what with dirt and, stones I diig out, I not 
only raised my grmuid two feet, but made a little cellar ter 
my mansion-house ; and this cost me many days labour ami 
pains. One day in particular a shower of rain falling - , 
thunder and lightning ensued, which put me in terror lest 
siy powder should lake foe, % and not only hinder my ne- 
cessary subsistence my killing me food, but even blow up 
me and my habitation To prevent which, I fell to making 
boxes and bags, in order to separate it, having by me near 
I50lb. weight And thus being established as king of the 
island, every day I went out with my gun to see what I 
could kill that was fit to eat. I soon perceived numbers of 
goats, but very shy, yet having watched them narrowly, 
and seeing I could better shoot off the rocks than when in 
the low grounds, 1 happened to shoot a she goat suckling a 
young kid ; which not thinking its dam slain, stood by her 
unconcerned ; and when 1 took the dead creature up, the 
young one followed me even to the inclesurc. 1 lifted lire

kid over the pales, and would willingly have kept it alive ; 
but finding it could not be brought to eat, 1 was forced to 
slay it also For my subsistence. 

Thus entered into as strange a scene of life as ever any 
man was in, I had most melancholy apprehensions concern- 
ing my deplorable condition ; and many times the tears 
would plentifully run down my face, when I considered 
how I was debarred from all communication with human 
kind. Yet while these desponding cogitations would seem 
to make me accuse Providence, other good thoughts would 
interpose and reprove me after this manner : Well, suppos- 
ing you s re desolate, is it not better to be so thap totally 
perish ? Why were you singled out to be saved, and the rest 
destroyed ? Why should you complain, when not only your 
life ispreserved, but the ship driven even into your reach, in 
-order to take "what was necessary out of her for your sub- 
sistence ? But to proceed. It .was, by the account I kept, 
the 30th of September, when I first landed'on this Island. 
About , twelve days after, fearing least I should lose my 
reckoning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath days, for 
want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife upon a 
large post, in great letters, and set it up, in the similitude of 
a cross, on the sea-shore where 1 landed, I came on shore. 
Sept. 30, 1659. Every day I cut a notch with my knife on 
the sides of this square post, ahd that on (he Sabbath was as 
long again as the rest; and every first day of the month as 
long again as that long one- In this manner . I kept my ca- 
lendar, w eekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning of time. But 
had I made a more strict search (as afterwards I did) I 
needed not have set up this mark ; for among the parcels 
belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and captain’s mate, l 
found those very things I w anted ; particularly pens, ink, 
and paper ; also 'I found two or three compasses, some ma- 
thematical instruments, dials, perspective glasses, books of 
navigation, three English Bibles, and several other good 
books, which I carefully put up. — Here I cannot but call to 
mind our having a dog and two cats on board, whom I 
made inhabitants with me in my castle. Though one might 
think 1 had all the necessaries that were desirable, yet soli 
I found several things wanting. My ink was daily wasting ; 
I wanted needles, pins, and thread to mend or keep my 
clothes together ; and particularly a spade, pickax, or 
shovel, to remove the earth. It was a year before I (busked

rr.y little bulwark ; and having some intervals of relaxation, 
aiier my daily wandering abroad for provision, I drew up 
tii is plan, alternately, as creditor and debtor, to remind me 
of die miseries ana blessings of my life, under so many 
various circumstances. 


EVIL. 

1 am cant upon a desolate 
island, having no hopes, no pro- 
mpt ct of a welcome deliverance. 

How miserable am I singled 
out from the enjoyment or com- 
pany of all mankind. 

I.ikean hermit ( rather should 
J soy a lonely anchorite) am l 
forced) ) ojh h u man conversation j 

My clothes after some time : 
will be worn out ; and then I 
shall hare none to cover me. 

When my ammunition is 
wasted, then shall I remain 
without any defence against 
wild men and beasts. 

I have no creature , no soul , 
to speak to ; none to beg assist- j 
once from. Some con fortwould l 
it be to resound my woes where 
1 am understood, and beg as- 
sistance where J might hope 
for relief. 


GOOD. 

But yet J am preserved, 
while my companions are pe- 
rished in the raging ocean. 

Yet set apart to be spared 
from death. And he, who Inis 
so preserved me, can deliver 
! me from this condition. 

However, I have food to eat, 
and even a happy prospect of 
j subsidence whilst life endures. 
j At present J enjoy what is 
1 absolutely needful ; and the cti- 
! mate is so hot, that had / nev er 
! so many, 1 should hardly wear 
them. 

Yet (fit does, I see no dan- 
ger of any hurt to me, as in 
Africa : And what if I hud 
been cast away upon that coast. 

Is there not God to converse 
to, a od is not he able to re- 
lieve thee f Already has he 
afforded thee sustenance, and' 
put it in thy power to provide 
for thyself till he sends thee a 
deliverance. 


And now easing my mind a little by these reflections, 
I began to render my life as easy as possib'e. 

1 must here add, to the description I have given of my 
habitation, that having raised a turf-wall against the outside 
of it, I thatched it so close, as might keep it from the incle- 
mency of the weather ; 1 also improved it within, enlarged 
my cave, and made a passage and door in thetrock, which 
came out beyond the pale of my fortification, .i next pro- 
ceeded to make a chair and a table, and so began to study 
such mechanical arts as seemed lo me practicable.; Whea

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

I wanted a plank or board, I hewed down a tree with ray 
hatchet, making it as thin with my ax as possible, and then 
smooth enough with an adz to answer ray designs: yet 
though I could make no more this way than one board out 
of a tree, in length of time I got boards enough to shelter 
all my stores, every thing being regularly placed, and my 
guns securely hanging against the side of the rock. This 
made it a very pleasant sight to me, as being the result of 
vast labour and diligence ; which leaving for a while, and 
me to the enjoyment of it, I shall give the reader an account 
of my Journal from the day of my landing, till the fixing 
and settling of my habitation, as heretoforo shewn. 


JOURNAL. 

September 30th 1659, r, unhappy Robinson Crusoe, 
having suffered shipwreck, was driven on this desolate 
Island, which I named the Desolate Island of Despair, my 
companions, being swallowed up in the temjpestuous ocean. 
The next day I spent in consideration of my unhappy cir- 
cumstances, having no prospect but of death, either to be 
starved with hunger; or devoured with beasts or merciless 
savages. • 

Oct. 1. That morning, with great comfort, I beheld tlie 
ship drove ashore. Some hopes I had, that when the storm 
was abated, I might be able to get some food and neces- 
, saries out of her, which I conceived were not damaged, be- 
cause the ship did stand upright. At this time I lamented 
the loss of my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the 
vessel. When I perceived the ship as it were lie dry, I 
waded^ through {he sands, then swam aboard, the weather 
being very rainy, and with scarcely any wind. 

To the 1+th of this month, my time was employed in 
making voyages, every tide getting what I could out of the 
ship. The weather very wet and uncertain. 

Oct. 20. My raft and all the goods thereon were ovef- 
set ; yet I recovered most again at low water. 

Oct. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and day, when 
the ship went in pieces,, so that nothing was seen of her but s' 
the wreck at low water. This day 1 secured my goods 
from the inclemency of the weather.

Oct. ?H. I wandered to see where I could find a place 
convenient for my abode. 1 fixed upon a rock in the even- 
ing, marked out a half-moon, intending to erect a wall, 
fortified with piles, lined within with pieces of cables, and 
covered with turf. 

Nov. 1. I erected my tent under a rock, and took up 
tny lodgings very contentedly in a hammock that night. 

Nov. 2. This day I fenced myself in with timber, chests, 
and boards. 

Nov. 3. I shot two wild fowl, resembling ducks, which 
were good to eat, and in the afternoon made me a table. 

Nov. +. I began to live regularly. In the morning I 
allow ed myself two or three hours to walk out with tny gun ; 

I then worked till near eleven o’clock, and alter wards re- 
freshed myself with what I had to eat. .From twelve -to 
two I would lie down to sleep. Extremely sultry weather. 
In the evening go to work again. 

Nov. 5 Went out with my gun and dog, -shot a wild 
oat with a soft skin, but her flesh was good for nothing. 
The skins of those I killed, I preserved. In my return, I 
perceived many \vild birds, and was terrified by some seals 
which made off to sea. 

Nov. 6. Completed my table. 

Nov. 7. Fair weather. 1 worked till the 12(h, but 
omitted the 1 1th, which,' according to my calculation I sup- 
posed to be Sunday. 

Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which, however, much 
cooled the air ; with thunder and lightning, caused in me a 
terrible surprise. The weather clearing, l secured my pow- 
der in separate parcels. 

Nov. ].{, — ic. i made little boxes for my powder, lodg- 
ing them iil several places. I also shot a large fowl, which 
proved excellent meat. • '* y 

Nov. 17, I began to dig in the rock, yet was obliged to 
desist for want of a pickax, shovel, and wheelbarrow. Iron 
crows I caused to supply the place of the first ; but with all 
my art I could not make a wheelbarrow. 

'Nov. 13. It was my fortune to find a tree, resembling 
what Brazilians call ah iron tree. I had like to have spoil- 
ed iny ax with cutting it, being very hard and exceedingly-

that it might serve inc, not only for a warehouse, but kit- 
chen, parlour, and cellar. I commonly lay in the tent, un- 
less the weather was rainy that I could not lie dry. So wet 
would it be at certain seasons, that I was obliged to cover 
all within the pale with long poles, in the form of rafters, 
leaning against the rock, and loaded them with flags and 
large leaves of trees, resembling a thatch. 

Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habitation finished, 
but suddenly a great deal of the top broke in, so that it was 
a mercy I was not buried in the ruins. This occasioned a 
great deal of pains and trouble to me, before I could make 
it firm and durable. 

Dec. 17., I nailed up some shelves and drove nails and 
staples in the wall and posts to hang things- out of the way. 

Dec, 120. Every thing I got into its glace, then made a 
s»rt of a dresser, and another table. 

Dec. 24, ‘25. Rain iii abundance. 

l)ec. 25. V ery fair weather. 

Dec. 27. 1 chanced to light on some goats, shot one, and 
wounded another. 1 led it home in a string, bound up its 
leg, and cured it in a little time ; at length it became so 
tame and familiar as to feed before the door, and follow me 
where 1 pleased. This put me in mind to bring up tame 
creatures, in order to supply me with food after iny ammu- 
nition was spent. 

Dec. 23, 29, 30. The weather being excessively hot, 
with little air, obliged me for the most part, to keep within 
doors. 

Jan. 1. Still sultry, however, obliged by necessity, I went 
.•ut with my gun, and found a great store of goats in the 
valleys ; they were ■ exceedingly shy, nor could my dog 
hunt them down. 

Jan. 3 to 14. My employment this time was to finish the 
wall before described, and search the island. I discovered 
a kind of pigeons like our house-pigeons in a nest among the 
rocks. I brought them home, nursed them till they could 
fly, and then they left me. After this, I shot some, which 
proved excellent food. Some time I spent vainly in con- 
triving to make a cask ; I may well say it was vain, because 
I could neither joint the staves, nor fix the heads, so as to 
make it tight : So, leaving that, took some goal’s tallow I 
had about me, and a little okum for the w ick, and provided 
myself witk a lamp, which served me instead of candles. 


•32 


L!F» AND ADVENTURES 


But now a very strange event happened. For being in 
the height of my search, what should come into my hand, 
but a bag, which used to hold torn (as I supposed)* for the 
fowls ; so immediately resolving to put gunpowder in it, I 
.shook all the husks and dirt upon one side of the rock, little 
expecting what the consequence would be. The rain had 
fallen plentifully a few days before ; and about a month 
after to my great amazement, something began jto look out 
ivery green and flourishing ; and when I came to view it 
more nicely, every day as it grew, I found about ten or 
twelve ears of green barley appeared in the very same 
.shape and make as that in England. 

I can scarce express the agitations of my mind at this 
sight. Hitherto I had looked upon the actions of this life 
no otherwise than only as the events of blind chance and 
fortune. But now the appearance of this barley, flourishing 
in a barren soil, and my ignorance in not conceiving how it 
should come there, made me conclude, that mlrades Here not 
yet ceased : nay, I even thought that God had appointed it 
to grow there without any seed, purely for my sustenance 
in this miserable and desolate island. And indeed such 
great effect this had upon me, that it often made me melt 
into tears, through a grateful sense of God’s mercies ; and 
the greater stili Was my thankfulness, when I perceived 
about this little field of barley some rice stalks, also wonder- 
fullj flourishing. 

While thus pleased in mind, I concluded there must be 
more corn in the island ; and therefore made a diligent 
search narrowly among the rocks; but not being able to 
find any, on a sudden it came into mind, how I had shaken 
the husks of corn Out of the bag, and then my admiration 
ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as thinking 
it was but natural and not to be conceived a miracle ; though 
even the manner of its preservation might have made me 
own it as a wonderf ul event of God’s kind Providence. 

It -was about the latter end of June when the ears of 
this corn ripened, whiqh I laid up very carefully together 
with 20 or 30 stalks of rice, expecting one day I should reap 
the fruit of my labour ; yet four years were expired be- 
fore I could allow myself to eat any barley bread, and much 
longer time before 1 had any rice. After this, -with indefa- 
tigable pains and industry, for three or four months, ast last I 
finished my wall on the 14th of April, having no way to g* 
into it, but by a ladder against the wall. 



• F ROBINSON CRUSOE. $3 

*■* '» \ ^ # # 

April 16 . I finished my ladder, and ascended it; after- 
wards palled it up, then let it down on the other side, and 
descended into my new habitation, where I had space 
enough, and so fortified that nothing could attack, me with- 
out scaling the walls. 

But what does all human pains and industry avail, if the 
• blessing of God does not crown our labours ? Or w r ho can 
stand before the Almighty, when he stretcheth forth hisarm? 
For one time as I was at the entrance of my cave, there hap- 
pened such a dreadful earthquake* that not only the roof of 
the cavecame rumbling about my ears, but the posts seemed 
to crack terribly at the same time. This put me in great 
amazement ; and running to the ladder, and getting over the 
wall, I then plainly knew it was an earthquake, the place I 
stood on sustaining three terrible shocks in less than three 
minutes., But judge of my terror when I saw the top of a 

g reat rock roll into the sea; I then expected the island would 
e swallowed up every moment : And what made the scene 
still more dreadful, was to see the sea thrown into the most 
violent agitations and disorders by this tremendous accident. 
. For my part I stood like a criminal at the place of execu- 
tion ready to expire. * At the moving of the earth, I was, 
as it were, sea-sick ; and very much afraid lest the rock, 
under which was my fence and. habitation, should over- 
whelm it and myself in a lasting tomb. 

When the third dreadful shock had spent itself, my spirits 
began to revive ; yet still I would not venture to ascend 
the ladder, but continued sitting, not knowing what I should 
do. So little grace had I then, as only to say; Lord hare 
mercy upon- me ! add no sooner was the earthquake over, 
but that pathetic prayer left me. 

It was not Jong after, \vhen a horrible tempest arose, at 
the same time attended with a hurricane of wind. Thesea 
> seemed mountains high, and the waves rolled so impetuously, 
that nothing could be perceived but froth and foam. Three 
hours did this storm continue, and in so violent a manner, as 
to tear the very trees up by the roots, which was succeeded 
by abundance of rain. When . the tempest was over I went 
to my tent: but'thc rain coming on in a furious manner, I 
was obliged to take shelter in the cave, -where I was forced 
Jo cut a channel through my fortification to lei the water out. 
It continued raining all thab night, and some time the next 
day. These accidents made rue resolve, as soon as the-

weather cleared up, to build me a little hut in sortie ope* 
place, walled round to defend me from wild creatures and 
savages ; not doubting but at the next earthquake, the 
mountain w ould fall upon my habitation and me, and swal- 
low up all in its bowels. 

April 16 — 20. These days I spent in contriving how 
and in what manner I should fix my place of abode. All 
this while I w'as under the most dreadful apprehensions. — 
When I looked round my habitation, every tiling I found in 
its proper place. I had several resolutions whether I should 
move or not ; but at length resolved to stay where I was, till 
I found out a convenient place where I might pitch my tent. 

April 22. When I begun to put my resolutions in prac- 
tice, I was stopt for want of tools and instruments to work 
■with. Most of my axes an^l hatchets were useless, occa- 
sioned by cutting the hard timber that grew on the island. 
It took me up a lull week to make my grind stone of use to 
me, and at last I found out a way to turn it about with my 
foot, by help of a wheel and a string. 

April 28, 29. These days were spent in grinding my tools. 

April 30. My bread falling short, I allowed myself but 
one biscuit a day. 

May 1. As I walked along the sea shore, I found a barrel 
of gunpowder, and several pieces of the wreck, the sea had 
flung up. Having secured those, I made to the ship, whose 
stern w as torn off, and washed a great distance ashore ; but 
the rest lay in the sands. This I suppose was occasioned 
by the earthquake. I now resolved to keep my old place 
of abode ; and also to go to the ship that day, but then 
found it impossible. 

May 3. This day I went on board, and w'ith my saw 
sawed off one of the beams, which kept her quarter-deck. 
1 then cleared the sand till flood. 

May 4. ^ caught some fish, but they were not wholesome. 
The same day 1 also catched a young dolphin. 

May 5. This day I also repaired to the wreck, and sawed 
another piece of timber, and when the flood came I made 
a float of three great planks, which were driven ashore by 
the tide. 

May 6, 7, 8, 9. These days I brought ofF the iron bolts 
opened the deck with the iron crow, and carried two planks 
lo land, having made a way into the very middle of the 
wreck.

ploy ing myself in looking tor pigeons, I outstaid my time. .. 

May 17. I perceived several pieces of the wreck driven 
ashore. Which I found belonged to the head of the ship. 

May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck, and with 
great difficulty loosened 3omy things so much with the crow, 
that at the first flowing tide several casks floated out, and 
many of the seamens’ chests, yet that day nothing came to 
land but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had some 
Brazil pork in it. I continued working to the 15th of June; 
(except necessary times for food or rest) and had I known 
how to have built a boat, I had timber and planks enough ; 
l had also near 1 00 weight of sheet lead. 

June 1 6. As I was wandering towards the sea-side, I 
found a large tortoise or turtle, being the first I had seen on 
the island, though, as 1 afterwards found, there were many

June 27. AH this day I was afflicted with an ague ; 
thirsty, yet could not help myself to water : Prayed to God 
ip. these words : “ Lord, in pity look upon me : Lord have 
" mercy upon me : have mercy upon me ! ” After this I 
fell asleep, which I found had much refreshed me when I 
awaked. I fell fast asleep a second time, and fell into thi*- 
strangc and terrible sort of dream. 

Methought I was sitting on the same spot of ground at the 
•utside of the wall where I sat when the storm blew after 
the earthquake ; and that I saw a man descending from a 
great black cloud, and alight upon the ground. He was all 
over as bright as a flash or fire that a little before surrounded 
him ; his countenance inconceivably terrible ; the earth as 
it were trembled when he step* upon the ground, and flashes 
of fire seemed to fill all the air. No sooner I thought him 
landed upon the earth, but with a long spear or other wea- 
pon, he made towards me ; but first ascending rising 
grouud, his voice added to my amazement, when I thought 
I heard him pronounce these dreadful words, “Unhappy 

wretch ! seeing all these things have not brought thee to- 
“ repentance, thou shalt immediately die.” In pronouncing 
th is dreadful sentence, I thought he meant to kill me with 
the spear that was in his hand. 

Any body may think it impossible for mo to express th* ' 
horrors of my inirid at this vision : and even when I awaked, 
this very dream made a deep impression upon my mind. — 
The little divine knowledge I had, I received from my far- 
thers instructions, and that was worn out by an uninter- 
rupted series of sea faring impiety for eight years, space. Ex- 
cept what sickness forced from me, l do not remember I had 
one thought of lifting up my heart towards God, but rather 
had a certain stupidity of soul, not having the least sense or 
fear of the Omnipotent Being when in distress, nor of gra- 
titude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when I was on the 
desperate expedition on the desert African shore, I cannot 
remember I had .one thought of what would become of me, 
or to beg his consolation and assistance in my sufferings and' 
distress When the Portugal captain took me up, and ho- 
nourably used me, nay, farther, when I was even delivered 
from drowning by escaping to this island, I never looked 
upon it as a judgment, but only said I was an unfortunates* 
dog, and that’s all. Indeed, some secret transports of soul f .

of joy, that I was yet alive, when my Companions were all 
drowned, and no other joy could I conceive but what is 
common with the sailors over a bowl of punch, after they 
have escarped the greatest dangers. 

The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor conveni- 
ences, might have called upon me for a 'thankful acknow- 
ledgment to Providence. Indeed the growth, of my corn 
touched me w ith some sense ; but that soon wore oft’ again/ 
The terrible earthquake pointed to me, as it were, the fin- 
ger of God, but my dreadful amazement continued no longer 
than its duration. But now, when my spirits began to sink 
under the burden of a strong distemper, and I could leisurely 
view the miseries of death present themsqlves before mV 
eye*, then my awakened conscience began to reproach mo 
with my past life, in which I had 1 so wickedly provoked the 
justice of God to pour down his vengeance upon me. 

Such reflections as these oppressed rae even in the violence 
of distemper. Some prayers I uttered, which only proceeded 
from the fear of death. But w hen I considered my lather’s 
advice and prophecy, I could not forbear weeping : for he 
told me, ■“ That if I did persist in my folly, I should not only 
" be deprived of God’s blessing, but have time enough to 
"reflect upon my despising his instructions, and this in a 
" wretched time, when none could help me.” And now 
concluding it to be fulfilled, having no soul in the island Iq 
administer any comfort To me, 1 prayed earnestly to the 
Lord, that he would help me in tiiis my great calamity. — r 
And thi«, I think* was the first time I prayed in sincerity for 
many years. But now I must return to my journal. 

June 28 . Something refreshed with sleep, and the fit 
quite off, I got up. My dream still occasioned in me a great 
consternation ; and, fearing. that the ague might return the 
succeeding day, I concluded it lime to get something to com- 
fort me. I filled a case bottle w T ith water, and set it within 
reach of my bed ; and, to make it more nourishing and less 
chilly, I put some rum in it. The next thing laid was to 
broil me a piece of goat’s flesh, of which I ate but little, 1 
was very weak ; however, walked about, dreadingthe return 
of my distemper; and at night I supped on ttiree of live 
turtle’s eggs, whicTl roasted and ate, begging God’s bles- 
sing therewith. 

After 1 had eaten, I attempted to walk again out of doom 
with my gun ; but was so weak, that 1 sat down, and look-

ed at tlie sea, which was smooth and calm. While I con- 
tinued here, these thoughts came into my mind. 

In what manner is the production of the earth and sea, of 
which I have seen so much ? Front whence came myself, 
and all other creatures living, and of what ate they made h 
Our beings were assuredly created by scute almighty in- 
visible Povycr,' who framed the earth, the sea, and air, anti i 
all therein. But what is that Power ? 

Certainly it must follow that God has created it all. Yet, 
said I, if God lias made all this he must be the Ruler of 
them all, and what is relating thereto ; for ceitainly the 
Power that makes, must indisputably have a power to guide 
and direct them. And if this be so, (as certainly it must) 
nothing can happen w ithout his knowledge and appoint- 
ment. Then, surely, if nothing happens without God’s ap- 
pointment, certainly God has appointed these my sufferings 
to befal me. Ami here I fixed my firm belief that it w r as 
his w ilt that it should be so ; and then proceeded to enquire^ 
why should God deal with me in this manner ? Or what 
have I done thus to deserve his indignation ? 

Here conscience flew in my face, reprehending me as a 
blasphemer ; crying with a loud and pierc ing voice, “ IJn* 

“ worthy wretch ! now dare you ask what you have done? 

“ Look on your past life, and see what you have left undone ? 

" Ask thyself, why thou wert not long ago in the merciless 
“ hands of death : Why not drowned in Yarmouth Roads* 

“ or killed in the fight, when the ship was taken by th« 

“ Sallee man of war ? Why not entombed in the bowels of 
“ w ild beasts on the African coast, or drowned here when 
“all thy companions suffered shipwreck in the ocean r” 

Struck dumb with these reflections, I rose up in a pea- 
si ve manner) being so thoughtful that I could not go to- 
slecp ; and fearing the dreadful return of my distemper, it 
caused me to remember, that the Brazilians use tobacco for 
almost all diseases. I then went to my chest in order to 
find some, where Heaven, no doubt, directed me to find a 
cure for both soul and body ; for there I found one of the 
Bibles, which, till this time, I had neither leisure nor inclina- 
tion to look into. I took both the tobacco and that out of 
the chest, and laid them on the table. Several experiments 
did I try with the tobacco: First, I took’a piece of leaf, and 
chewed it j but it being very green and strong, almost 
. stupefied me. Next I steeped it ia seta* mm an hour ft

two, resolving when I went to bed to take a dose of it; 
and, in the third place, 1 burnt some over a pan of fire, 
holding my nose over it as long as I could endure it with- 
out- suffocation. 

In the intervals of this operation, though my head was 
giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to 
read. No sooner did I open it, but there appeared to me 
these words, ** Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will 
‘'deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." 

At first this sentence made a very deep impression on my 
heart, but it soon wore off again, when I considered the 
word deliver was foreign to me. Ami as the children of 
Israel said, when they were promised flesh to eat, “ Can 
God spread a table in the wilderness? In like manner I 
began to say, " Can God himself deliver me from this deso- 
late island ? • However, the words would still return to my 
mind, and afterwards made a greater impression upon me. 

As it was now very late, and the tobacco had dozed my 
head, I was inclined to sleep ; but before I would lie down 
1 fell on my knees, and implored the promise that God had 
made to me in the Holy Scriptures, that " if I called upon him 
in the day of trouble he would deliver me." With much 
difficulty I afterwards drank the rum, wherein I had steeped 
the tobacco, which flying into my head, threw me into such 
a profound sleep, that it was three o’clock the next day before 
I awaked ; or rather, I believe, 1 slept two days, having cer- 
tainly lost a day in my account, and I could never tell any 
-other way. W'hen I got up, my spirits were lively and 
cheerful ;• my stomach much better, being very hungry ; 
and, in short, no fit returned the next day, which was the “ 
29th, but I found myself much altered for the better. 

The 30th I went abroad with my gun, but not far, and 
lulled a sea-foul or two, resembling a brand goose, w hich, 
however, I cared not to eat when I brought them home, 
but dined on two more of the turtle’s eggs. In the evening 
1 renewed my medicine, excepting that I did not take so 
iar<ge a quantity, neither did 1 chew the leaf, or hold my 
lead over the smoke : but the next day, which was'the 1st 
of July, having a little return of the cold fiti I again took 
my medicine as I did the first time. 

July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In this 
condition, 1 often thought of these words, “ 1 wHl deliver 
thee j” and while, at some times, 1 would think of the im-

possibility of it, other thoughts would reprehend me for dis- 
regarding the deliverances I had received, even from the 
most forlorn and distressed condition. I asked myself, what 
regard have 1 had to God for his abundant mercies ? Have 
I done my part ? “ He has delivered me* but I have not 
"glorified him — as if I had said, I had not owned .and 
been thankful for these as deliverances, and how could I 
expect greater? So much did this sensibly touch my heart, 
that I gave God thanks for my recovery from sickness in 
the most humble prostration. 

July 4. This morning I began seriously to ponder on what 
is written in the New Testament, resolving to read a chap- 
ter every morning and night as long as my thoughts would 
engage me. As soon as I set about this work seriously, I 
found my heart deeply affected with the impiety of my past 
life ; these words that I thought were spoken to me in my 
dream revived, "All these things have not brought thee to 
"repentance.” After this, I begged of God to assist me 
with his ,Ho]y Spirit in returning to my duty. . One day, in 
perusing the Scriptures I came to these words, " He is ex- 
" silted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and to 
“ give remission Immediately I laid down the book, 
and with up lifted hands to Heaven, loudly cried " O 
blessed Jesus, thou son of David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince 
and Saviour, give me repentance!” And now indeed l pra> ed 
w ith a true sense of my condition, and a more certain hope, 
founded on the word of God. Now I had a different sense 
of these w ords, " Call on me and I will deliver thee,” that 
is from the dreadful load of guilt which oppressed my sinful 
soul, and not from a solitary life, which might rather be 
called a blessing, seeing I wanted neither food nor 
raiment, whc*i compared with living among the human 
race, surrounded w'jth so much oppression, misery, and af- 
fliction : In a word, I came to this conclusion, that a deli- 
verance from sin was a much greater blessing, than a deli- 
verance from affliction. But again 1 proceed to my journal. 

To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gun, little 
ai d little at a time, having been reduced to the greatest 
extremity of weakness. The applications and experiments 
1 used were perfectly now : neither could I recommend 
them to any one’s prac tice. For though it carried off the 
til, it very much weakened me, a,nd I had frequent convuU 
sic ns in my nerves and limbs for some time. ^From this I

-teamed, that going abroad in rainy weather, especially wheta 
it was attended with storms and hurricanes of wind, was 
most pernicious to health. -I had now been about tt?*i 
months in the island ; and as 'I never had seen any of this 
human kind, 1 therefore accounted myself as sole monarch*; 
and as I grew better, having secured my habitation to tny 
mind, I resolved to make* a tour round my kingdom, in cr- 
. dec to make new discoveries. >< 

The 15th of July, I began my journey ; d first Went 
the creek, where i had brought my rafts on shore ; and tra- 
velling farther, found -the tide went no higher than two 
miles up, where there was a little brook of running Water, 
on the bank of which were many pleasant savannahs or 
meadows* plain, smooth, and covered with; grass. On the 
rising parts, where I supposed the svhter did not reach, F. 
perceived a great deal of tobacco growing - to a very strong 
stalk. Several other plants I likewise found, the virtues of 
which I did not understand. 1 searched a long time for the 
Cassava resot, which knew the - Indians in that climate 
made their bread of, but all in vain. There Were several 
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not what they 
were ; likewise I saw several sugar canes, but imperfect for 
want of cultivation. -.With these few discoveries, I cam* 
back that night, and slept contentedly in my little castle. 

The- next day, being the 16th, going the same wag, but 
farther than the day before, I found the coun try more adorned 
with w oods and trees. Here ] perceived different fruits i* 
great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and 
clusters of- grapes, ripe and very rich, spread over the trees.. 
You may imagine I was glad of this, discovery, yet ate very 
sparingly, least I should ' throw myself into -a flux or fevei*. 
l ire grapes. I found of excellent use-.; for when 1 had dried 
them in the, sun, which preserved them - as dried, raisins ark 
kept, they proved very wholesome 'and nourishing, and 
served me hi those seasons when no grapes wore to be l»?d. 

Tire, night drawing on apace, I ascended up a (ref, and 
sJept very comfortably, though it was the first time I had 
lain out of iny habitation. And when the morning came, d 

'I proceeded with great pleasure on my way, travelling about 
four miles, as I imagined, by the length of the valley, 'di- 
recting my course northward, there being a ridge of hills on 
•the south and north side of me. At the end of this valigyv

*J came to an. opening, where the country seemed tocfesceiwl 
to the west ; there 1 found a little spring of fresh watery 
proceeding out ot the. side of the hill, with its crystal streams 
j mining directly ’east. And, indeed, here my senses were 
•charmed with the most beautiful landscape nature could af- 
ford; lor the -country appeared flourishing, green, and de- 
lightful, that to me it seemed like a planted garden. I then 
descended on the side of that delicious vale, when I found 
abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon hud citron trees, but 
•very wild and barren at that time. As for the limes, they 
were delightful and wholesome, the juice ol Which 1 after 
.used to mix in water, which made it very cooling and re- 
freshing. And now -I was resolved to caTry home and lay 
slip a store of grapes, limes and lemons, against the approach- 
ing wet season. So laying them up in separate parcels, and 
then taking a few of each with me, 1 returned to my jittle 
castle, after h^vihg. spent three days in this journey. Before 
1 got home, the grapes were so bruized that they were 
utterly spoiled ; the limes indeed were good, but of those 
I could bring only a few. 

July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned thither 
again, but, to my great surprise, found all the grapes spread . 
about, trod to pieces, and abundance eaten, which made me 
conclude there were wild beasts thereabouts. To prevent 
this happening again, 1 gathered a large quantity of the- 

i jrapes, and hung them upon the out branches of the tree, 
x>th to keep them unhurt, and that they might cure and dry- 
in the sun : and having well loaded myself with limes and 
lemons, I returned once more to my old place of residence. 

And now contemplating on the fruitfulness of this valley, 
and pleasantness of its situation, its security from storms, 
and the dclightfulncss pf the adjacent woods, I concluded 
I was settled in the worst part of the country, and there- 
fore was thinkirtg to remove my "habitation. 

‘ But when I considered again, that though it was pleasant, 
it was off from the sea side, where there was a possibility 
some time or other, a ship might either be driven or sail by^ 
and that to inclose myself among hills and woods must cer- 
tainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance ; I resolved 
to let my castle remain where Providence had first assigned 
it. Yet so ravished was I with this place, that i made me 
a little kind of bovver, surrounding it with a double hedge, 
as high as 1 could reach, well staked and filled with bull-

jpshes : and having spent a great part of the month of July,. 

I think it vyas the first of August before. I begun to enjoy* 
my labour. 

Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took them fronv 
the trees, and they proved excellent good raisins of the sun : 
the most of which i carried to, my cave ; and happy for me £ 
did so ; by which,! sayed the best part of my winter food. 

Aug. IJi, This day it began to rain; and though I had 
made me a tent like U 19 ether, y et having no shelter of a hilt 
tf> keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat to* 

I w%s obliged to return to my old castle. The rain con- 
tinued more or less every day, till the middle of October ; 
arid sometimes so violently; that [ could not stir out of my 
c,a.ve for several days. This season I found my family to 
increase ; for or^ of' my cats that ran away from me, and 
■which l thought ..had been dead, returned about August, 
with three kittens at her heels, like herself, which I thought 
Strange, because both my cats were females, and the wild, 
cats of the island scenral tp be of a different kind from . ur 
European cats ; but mprn these cats proceeded such num- 
bers, that I was forcecrtp ki;l and destroy them as I would 
do wild hea»ts and vermin. 

To tli a 26th of this month, I could not stir out, it raining 
incessantly ; when beginning to want food, I was compelled 
to venture twice, thq first of which I shat a goat, and af- 
terwards found a very large tortoise. The manner cf my 
regulating mv food was thus ; a bunch of raisins served mu 
for my breakfast, a piece of goat’s flesh or turtle bailed fi r 
my dinner, and two or three turtle’s eggs for iny supper. 
While the rain lasted, I daily worked two or three hours at 
enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards 
ene side, till l came to the outside of the hill, and made a 
door, or way out, which came beyond my fence or wall, and 
so I came in and-out this way. But after I had done this, [ 
was troubled to see mySelf thus exposed; though I could 
not pereeive any tiling- to fear, a goat being the biggest 
creature I had seen upon this island. '; 

Sept. 30. Casting up my notches on my post, which 
amounted to 365, I concluded this to be the anniversary ».£ 
my landing ; and, therefore, humbly prostrating mySel? on 
the ground, confessing my sins, acknowledging God’s 
xightcous judgments upon me, and praying to Jesus Christ

of my life. The rainy and dry seasons appeared now regular

much failed me. You-.ma 
tioned of some barley an 


‘1 


call to mind what I have men- 
ace which I had saved } about 
thirty stalks of the, former, and twenty of the latter : and, at 
that time, the sun being in its southern position, going from 
rye, together with the rains, made me conclude it a very 
proper season to sow it, Accordingly I dag up a piece of 
grcnfid, with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two-, 
parts, sowed about two thirds of my seed, preserving by 
ipe about a handful each. And happy it was I did so ; for 
no rains falling, it was choaked up, and. never appeared* 
above the. earth till? the wet season came- again, and theu , 
part of it grew-, as if it had been newly sown. - • 

I was resolved still to make another trial; and seeking 
for a moister piece of ground near my bower, I there sowed 
the rest of my seed in February, a little before the vernal, 
equinox ; which having the rainy months of March and 
April to wuter it*. yielded a noble crop, and sprang up very 
pleasantly. I had still saved part of the seed, not daring to., 
venture all ; and by the time I found out the proper seasons- 
to sow it in, and thatl might expect every year two seed- 
times and two, harvests, my stock amounted to above half a- 
peck of e&ch sort of grain. 

* No sooner were the rains oa’er, but the slakes which I had 
cut from the trees, shot out like willows, the first year after, 
fopping their heads. I was ignorant of the tree I cut thenv 
worn : but they. grew' so regularly beautiful, that they made 
a. most lively appearance, and so, flourished in three year* 
time, that I resolved to cut more of them; and these sooik. 
growing made a glorious fence, as afterwards.! shall observe. 

And now 1 perceived that, the seasons of the year might 
generally be divided, not into supmier and winter, as in, 
Europe, bat iutp. wet^aud.dr^ seasons, as in tins niauqer :

The wet season would continue longer or shorter, as the 
winds happened to blow. But having found the ill conse- 
quences of being abroad in the rain, I took care beforehand 
to. furnish myself with provisions ; and during the wet 
months sat within doors as mm h as possible. At this time ( 
contrived to make many things that I wanted, though it cost 
me much labour and pains, before I could accomplish them. 
The first ! tried was to make a basket ; but all the twigs l 
could get proved so brittle, that I could not then perform it. 
It now proved of great advantage t© me, that when a boy, t 
took a great delight in standing at a basket maker’s in the 
same town where my father lived, to view them at work ; 
and like other boys, curious to see the manner of their 
working lyese things, and very officious to assist, I perfect- 
ly learned the method of it, and wanted nothing but the toob. 
And it coming into my mind,, that the twig^-of that tree t‘,f 
which I made my stakes, might be as tough as a sallow 
willow, or osiers, growing in England, I resolved to make 
an experiment, and vventuhe next day to my country-seat, 
and found seme fit for my turn ; and after Cutting down a 
quantity with my hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and, 
when fit to work with, carried them to my cave, where I 
employed my«elf in <■ making several sorts of baskets, inso- 
. much that 1 could put in whatsoever I pleased. It is time, 
they were not cleverly made, yet they served my turn upon 
all occasions, : -• ■

I. . kept myself employed in planting my . second row of

island. I spent the whole day in acknowledging God'* 
mercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life ai. 
agreeable, and less sinful, than that of human society ; and"' 
for the communications of his grace to my soul, in support- 
ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon hi# 
Providence, and hope for his eternal presence in the world 
to come. 

'Indeed, I often did consider how much more happy I was 
in this State of life, than in tliat accursed manner of living E 
formerly used ; and sometimes when hunting, or viewing 
the country, the anguish of my soul, would break out upon 
jne, and my very heart would- sink within me, to think of the 
v. oods, the mountains, the desarts I was in ;, and hovy I was- 
a prisoner locked up within the eternal bars and bolts of the 
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without hopes, and 
without redemption. In this condition I would often wring 
my hands, and weep like a child : And even sometimes, in 
tire middle of my work, this fit would take me ; and then I 
would sit down and sigh, looking on the ground for an hour 
or two together,, till such time as my 'grief got vent in a flood 
of tears. 

One morning as I w r as sadly employed in this manner, I 
opened my Bible, when I immediately fixed my eyes upon 
these w ords, “ I w ill never leave ihce, nor forsake thee t’ f 
Surely, thought I, these words are directed to me, or else why 
should they appear just at a moment when I am bemoaning 
my forlorn condition ? and if God does not forsake, what 
matters it, since he can make me more happy in this state of 
life, than if I enjoyed the greatest splendour in the world ? 

, JBut while I was going to return God thanks for my present 
state, something seemed to shock my mind, as if it had thus 
said: Unworthy wretch; can you pretend to be thankfuL 
for a condition, from which you would pray to be delivered f 
Here I stopt ; — and though I could not say, I thanked the 
Divine Majesty for being there, yet I gave God thanks for 
placing to my view' my former course of life, and granting 
oec a true knowiedgeof repentance. And whenever i opened

*r sfiuf the Bible, I blessed kind Providence, that directed 
30 v good friend in England to send it among my goods with- 
out any order, and for assisting me to save it from the power 
•f the raging oceam 

< And now beginning my third year, my several daikt' em- 

E loyments were these: First, My duty to Heaven, and di- 
gently reading the Holy Scriptures, which I did twice or 
thrice every day : Secondly, Seeking provision with my gun, 
which commonly took me- up, when it did not rain," three 
hours every morning : Thirdly, The ordering; curing, pre- 
serving, and cooking what I killed, or catched for my sup- 
f>ly, which took- me up great part of the day : for, in the- 
middle of the day, the sun being**]* its height, it was so hot, 
that I could not stir out ; so that I had only but four hours' 
hi the evening to work in : and then the want of tools, of 
assistance, and skill, wasted a great deal of time to little 
purpose. I was no less than two and forty days making a- 
board fit for a long shelf, which twd sawyers, with their 
tools and saw-pit, would have cut off the same tree in- 
half a day. I-t was of a large tree, as my board was to be- 
broad. I was three days in cutting it down, and two more- 
ifi lopping off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece of lim- 
ber. This I hacked and hewed off oach.sid.c, till it became? 
light to move ; then I turned it, made one side of it 
smooth and flat as a board from end to end, then turned it 
downward, cutting the other side, till- 1 brought the plank- 
to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both- sides. 
Any body may judge my. great labour and fatigue in such a 
piece of work ; but this I went through with patience, a» 
also many other tilings thatmy circumstances made necessary- 
fer me to dov ' - •" 

The harvest months, November and December, wer© 
now at hand, in which I bad the pleasing prospect of a very 
good crop. But here* I met with a new misfortune ; fop 
the goats imd hates, having tasted of the sweetness of the 
blade, kept it so short that it had not strength to shoot up into 
a staik. To- prevent this, I inclosed it with a hedge, and 
by day shot some-of its devourers ; and my dog which I had 
tied to the field-gate, keeping barking all night, so frightened 
those creatures, that I got entirely rid of them. 

'* But no sooner did 1 get rid of these, than other enemies 
appeared, to wit, whole flocks of several sorts ot birds who 
•yjy. -waited till my back was turned, to ruin me. So-ini*>h

did this provoke me, that I let fly, and killed throe of?th«r 
malefactors ; and afterwards. served them as they do notorfo 
ous thieves in England, hung them lip in. chains as a terror 
to others. And, indeed, so good an effect had this tfeat thoyt 
not only forsook the corn, but all that part of the island, so 
long as these criminals hung there. 

My com having ripened .apace, the latter end of Doetmvy 
her, wluch was my second harvest, I reaped it whha scythe* 
made ol one of mv broad swords. I had no, fatigue, in cut» 
ling down my, first crop it w as. so slender. ' The ears I car- 
ried home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands, instead oli 
threshing ii ; and when die harvest W13& o-ver, found niff 
half peck of seed produced near two bushels of rice, and 
two bushels and a half of barley . And now I plainly fore-* 
saw, that, by God’s goodness, I should be furnished will* 
bread ; but ) et I was concerned, because I knew not houfe 
to grind or make meal of my corn, nor bread, neither knew: 
how to bake it. I would not, however, taste any of the 
crop, but resolved to preserve it against next season, and, 
in the moan while, use my best endeavours to provide, myd 
seif with other food.' 

, But where were by labours to end? The want of .% 

{ lough to turn up the earth, pr shovel to dig it, I coiu^uered- 
y making me a wooden spade. The want of a harrow fc 
supplied myself with dragging over the corn a great bough; 
of a tree. When it was growing, 1 was forced to fence it ; 
when ripe to mow it, carry it home, thrash it, part it front 
the chaff and save it. And, after all, l wanted a mill to grind, 
if, sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and 
an oven to bake it- This set my brains to work to find 
some expedient for every one of these accessaries against 
the nest harvest. 

And now hav ing more seed, my first care was to prepare- 
»ie more land. 1 pitched upon two large flat pieces of' 
ground near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sowed 
apy seed, and. fenced it with a good hedge. This took nue 
up three months : by which time the wet season coming on, 
and tire -rain keeping me w ithin doors, I found several oc*. 
easiens to employ myself; and while at work, used to di- 
vert myself in talking to my parrot, learning him to know 
and speak his ownname Poll, the first welcome word I ever 
heard spoke in the island. I had been a long time coatriv-. 
tug how to. make, eatUioc vessels,, which I wanted extremely 


»«d whew T considered the heat Of ! the cliihtitc, 1 did not 
doubt but if 1 1 couki find any such Clay, I might potch up a 
pot, strong enough", when dried in the sun, to beat handling, 
*nd to hold any thing tliat was dry, as corn , meal, and other 
things. , - 

To be short, the clay I found ; btit it would occasion'the 
tnost serious person to smiley to see what awkward Ways I 
took, anti what ugly roishapen things I made ; 1 how many 
either fell out or cracked by the violent heat of the sun.and 
fell in pieces when they were removed : so that T think it 
was two months time before I eouldperfcct any thing : and 
even then but two clumsy things in imitation of earthen jars. 
These, however, I very gently- placed in wicker baskets, 
made on purpose for them, and between the pot and the 
baskets, stuffed it full of rice and barley straw, and these I 
presumed -would hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal 
when the corn was bruised. As for the smaller things, I 
made them with better success j such as little round pots, 
flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the sun baking them very 
hard. 

Vet still l wanted one thing absolutely necessary, and that 
Was ah earthen pot, not only- to -hold my liquid, but also to 
•bear the fire, which none of these^edtild J do. It once hap* 
pened, that as I was putting out roy fire, I found therein a 
broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard as rock, and 
red as a tile. ‘This made me think Qf burning some pots ; 
and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead, 
I fixed three large pipkins, and two Or three pots in a pile 
one upon another, l ire fire I piled round the outside, and 
dry wood on the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red 
-hot, and found that they were not crackt at all : and when 
I perceived them perfectly red, I let one of them stand in 
the fire about five or six hours, till the clay melted by the ex- 
tremity of the heat, and would have run to glass had I suf- 
fered it : upon which 1 slackened my fire by degrees, till the 
-redness abated'; and watching them till the morning, I found 
I had three very good pipkins, and two earthen pots, as 
Well burnt and nt tor my burn as I could desire. 

» No joy could be greater than mine at this discovery. For 
*rtfter this, I may say, I wanted for no sort of earthen svare. 
I filled one of my pipkins with water toboil me some meat, 
-which it did admirably well, and with a piece of kid I made 
me some good broth, as well as my circuipshuices would 
. fiord me at that time. 



■sQ "UTt. AVI) -ADVENT CRTS 

The next concern I had was to get me a stone mortal*, 
"beat some corn in, instead of a mill to grind it. Here in- 
deed I was at a great loss, as not being fit for a stone-cutter'; 
and man) days 1 spent to find out a .-great stone big enough 
to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar, and strong enough 
to bear tiie weight ofa pesfij, and that would break the com 
>v ithuut filling it with sand. ‘But ali the stones of the island 
being of a mouldering nature, rendered my search fruitless; 
and then I resolved to look out for a great block of hard* 
vvoed, which having found, I formed it with mv ax and 
hammer., and then, w ith infinite-labour, -made a hollow in it, 
just as the Indians ot Brazil make their canoes. .When f 
had finished this, I made a great postil of iron wood, and 
then laid them up against my succeeding harvest. 

• My next business was to make me a sieve, to sift my meal, 
and part it from the bran and husk. Having no fine thirt 
canvass to search the meal through, I could not tell what to 
do. What linen I had was reduced to rags : I hail goats* 
hair enough, but neither tools to work, it, nor. did 1 know 
how to spin it : At length I remembered I had some neck* 
cloths of calico or mtisljp of the sailors. Which! had brought 
out of the ship, and wjlK.ftfaese, I made, three 'small sivetf , 
proper enpugh fpr, the- work. .o . 

I come now to c onsider the baking part. The want of 
an oven I supplied by, making some earthen pans very broad 
but not deep. When .I had a mind to bake, I made a great 
fire upon the hearth, the tiles of which ! had made myself: 
and when the wood was burnt into live coals, 1 spread then* 
over it, till it became very hot ; then sweeping them away/ 
I set down mv loa . es, and whelming down the earthen pots 
upon them, drew the ashes and coals all aroandthe outsides- 
of the .pots Co continue the heat; and in this manner 1 baked 
my bai ley loavc-s, as well as if I had been a complete pastry» 
cook, and al o made of the rice several cakes and puddings. 

It is no wonder that these things took me up the best- 
part of a year, since what intermediate time I bad was be- 
stowed in managing my new harvest and husbandry » for in 
the proper season I reaped mv. corn, carried it home, and' 
laid it up in the ear in my large baskets, till 1 had time to 
rub, instead of thrashing it. And now, indeed, my corn 
increased so -much, that it produced me twenty bushels of- 
barley, and as much rice, that l not only began tp use it 
freely, but was thinking how to enlarge mv barns,- and ros

solved to sow as much at a time as would be sufficient for 
me tor a whole year. 

All this while, the prospect of land, which I had seen 
from the other side ot'the island, ran in my mind. I still 
meditated a deliverance from this place, though the fear 
of greater misfortunes might have deterred me from it. For, 
allowing that I had attained that place, I run the hazard of 
being killed and eaten by the devouring cannibals ; and if 
they were not so, yet I might be slain, as other Europeans 
had been, who fell into their hands. Notwithstanding all 
this, my thoughts ran continually upon that shore. I now 
wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat, with the shoul- 
der of mutton sail : I went to the ship’s boat that had been 
cast a great way on the shore in the late storm. She was 
removed but a little ; but her bottom being turned up by 
the impetuosity and fury of the waves and wind, I fell to 
work with all the strength I had, with levers and rollers I 
had cut from the wood, to turn her, and repair the damages' 
she had sustained. This work took me up three or four 
weeks, wh'en finding my little strength all in vain, 1 fell to 
undermining it by digging away the sand, and so to make 
it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it 
in the fall. But after this was done, I was still unable to 
stir it up, or to get under it, much less to move it forward 
towards the water, and so I was forced to give it over. 

This disappointment, however, did not frighten me. I 
began to think whether it was not possible for me to make 
a canoe or perigua, such as the Indians make of the trunk 
of a tree. But here I lay under particular inconveniences ; 
w ant of tools to make it, and w ant of hands to move it in 
the water when it was made. However, to work I went 
upon it, stopping all the inquiries I could make, with this 
very simple answer I made to myself. Let’s first make it. 
I’ll warrant I’ll find some way or other to get it along when 
it is done. 

I first cut down a cedar-tree, which was five feet ten 
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four 
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, 
after which it lessened for a space, and then parted into 
branches. Twenty days was 1 a hacking and hewing this 
tree at the bottom, fourteen more in cutting off the branches 
and limbs, and a whole month in shaping it like the bottom 
of a boat. As for the inside, I was three weeks with a

mallet and chissel, clearing it in swell a manner, as that it 
was big enough to carry twenty-six men, much bigger than 
any canoe I ever saw in my life, and consequently sufficient 
to transport me and all my effects to that wished- lor shore 
I so ardently desired. 

Nothing remained now, but, indeed, the greatest diffi- 
culty'to get it into the water, it lyittg about one hundred 
yards from it. To remedy the first inconvenience, which 
was a rising hill between the boat and the creek,, with, won- 
derful pains and labour I dug, into the bowels of the earth, 
and made a declivity. But when this was done, all the 
strength I had was as insufficient to remove it, as it was when 
I attempted to remove the boat, I then proceeded to measure 
the distance of ground, resolving to make a canal in order 
to bring the water to the canoe, since I could not bring the 
canoe to the water. But as this seemed to be impracticable 
to myself alone, under the space of eleven or twelve years, 
*, brought me into some sort of consideration ! so that I 
concluded this also to be impossible, and the attempt alto- 
gether vain. I now saw', and not before, what stupidity it 
is to begin work before we rec kon its costs, or judge rightly 
our own abilities to go through with its performance. 

In the height of this work my fourth year expired; from 
the time I was cast on this island. At this time I did not 
forget my anniversary ; but kept it with rather greater der 
votion than before. lor now' my hopes being frustrated, I 
looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do with ; 
and very well might I say, as father Abraham said unto Dives, 

Between thee and me there is a gulph fixed.” And in- 
deed I was separated from its wickedness too, having nei- 
ther the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride 
of life ; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king, and em- 
peror over the whole country I had in possession, without 
disputeand without controul; I had loadings of corn, plenty 
of turtles, timber in abundance and grapes above measure. 
What was all the rest to me t the money I had lay by me 
as despicable dross, which I would freely have given for a 
gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand mill to grind my corn : in 
a w ord the nature and experience of these things dictated 
to me this just reflection : That the good things of this world 
are no farther good to us, than they arc for our use ; and 
that whatever we may heap up to give to others, we can 
but enjoy as much as we use, and no more. 


<VF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5 5 

These thoughts rendered my mind more easy thorn usual. 
Every time 1 sat down to meat, I did it with thankfulness, 
admiring the providential hand of God, who, in this •wilder- 
ness had spread a table to me. And now I considered what 
X enjoyed, rather titan what I wanted, compared my present 
condition with what 1 at first expected it should be; how 
I should have done, if 1 had got nothing out of the ship ; 
that I must have perrshed before I had caught fish or turtles ; 
or lived, had I round them, like a mere savage, by eating 
them raw, and pulling them to pieces with my claws, like a 
-beast. I next compared my station to that winch I deserv- 
ed: how ondutiful I bad been to my parents; how destitute 
©f the fear of God : how void of every thing that was good ; 
and how ungrateful for those abundant mercies I had re- 
ceived from Heaven, being fed, as it were, by a miracle, 
even as great as Elijah’s being fed by ravens; and cast on 
a place where there is no venomous creatures to poison or 
devour me; in short, making* God’s tender mercies matter 
of great consolation, i relinquished all sadness, and gave 
•way to coetentmetit. 

As long as my ink continued, w hich with water I made 
_ last as long as I.couid, 1 used to minute down the days of the 
month, on whkh any remarkable event happened. — And, 

First, .1 observed, that the same day 1. forsook my parents 
and friends, and ran away to Huh, in order to go to sea, the 
Same dAy afterwards in the next year, 1 was taken and- made 
a slave by the Salee rovers : 

That the Very day 1 escaped out of the wreck of the ship in 
Yarmouth roads, a year after, on the- same day, I made my 
» escape from Sallee ut my patron’s fishing-boat : 

And, on (he 30th ©f September, being tlie day of the year 
1 w.vs born on, ou that day twenty-six years after. Was 1 
miraculously saved, and cast ashore on this island. 

The next tiring that wasted after my ink, was the buis- 
euit which I had brought out of the ship, and though I al- 
lowed myself but one cake a day, for above a twelvemonth, 
jet 1 was quite out of bread for near a year, before I got 
any corn ot my own. ' . 

In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and my 
linen had been gone long before. However, i had pre- 
served ahoutthree dozen of the sailors chequered shirts which 
proved a great refreshment tso me, when the violent beams 
of the sua would not suffer me to bear any of the seamen’s

.heavy watch-coats ; which made me turn tailor, and after a 
miserable botching manner, convert them to jackets. To 
preserve my head, I made me a cap of goat-skins, with the 
hair outwards to keep out the rain ; which, indeed served 
me so well, that afterwards I mademe a waistcoat andopen- 
cd kneed breeches of the same : And then I contrived a 
sort of an umbrella, covering it with skins, which not only 
keep out the heat of the sun, but rain also. Thu)s being easy 
and settled in my mind, my chief happiness was to converse 
with God, in most heavenly and comfortable ejaculations. 

For five years after this I cannot say any extraordinary 
thing occurred to me. My chief employment was to cure 
my raisins and plant my barley and rice, both of which I 
had a year’s provision beforehand. But though I was dis- 
appointed in my first canoe, I made it, at intermediate times, 
my business to make a second, of much inferior size ; and it 
was two years before I had finished it. But as I perceived 
it would no wise answer my design of sailing to the other 
..shore, my thoughts were confined to take a tour round the 
island, to see what further discoveries I could make To 
this intent, after having moved her to the water, and tried 
how she would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and 
made a sail of the ship’s sail that lay by me. I then-made 
lockers or boxes at the end of it, to put in necessaries, pro- 
vision, and ammunition, which would preserve them dry, 
either from rain or the spray of the sea ; and in the inside 
of the boat, I cut me a long hollow place to lay ray gun in, 
and to keep it dry, made a flag to hang over it. My um- 
brella I fixed in a step in the stern, like a mast, to keep the 
heat of the sun off me. And now resolving to see the cir- 
cumference of.my little. kingdom, I victualled my ship for 
the voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley-bread loaves, 
an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little Bottle of rum, 
half a goat, powder and shot, and two watch coats. It was 
the 6th of November, in the 6th year of my reign, or capti- 
vity, that I set out in this voyage ; which was much longer 
than I expected, being obliged to put farther out, by reason 
of the rocks that lay a great way in the sea. And indeed 
so much did these rocks surprise me, that I was for putting 
back, fearing that if I ventured farther it would be out of 
my power to return. In this uncertainty I came to an an- 
chor just offshore, to which I waded with my gun on my 
shoulder, and then climbing up a hill, which overlooked 



cflp ROfeiJtso’y cttvsar.. • 

-that point, l saw the full extent of ft, and so resolved to ran 
•11 hazards. 

>' in this prospect from the hHI, I perceived a violent cur- 
**Wt Tunning to the cost, coming very close to the point ; 
which *1 the more carefully observed, thinking it dangerous, 
-»nd that when I emae to it, I might be drove into the sea 
by its force, and not able to return to the island ; and cer- 
tainly it must have been so, had [ not made this Observation ; 
for ■on the other fide was the like current, with this differ- 
ence, that it set off at a greater distance ; and I perceived 
there Vvas a strong eddy under the land ; so that my chief 
business was to work out of the first current, and conveni- 
«ptiy get into the eddy. Two days I staid hero, the wind 
blowing very briskly E. S. E. which being contrary to the 
earreht, leaves a great breach of the sea upon the point ; 
so it was neither fit for me to. keep tOo near the shore, on 
aocmmr of tile breach ; nor stand at too great a distance, for 
fear of the streams. That night the wind abating, it grew 
so calm thnt I ventured out ; and here I may be a monu- 
ment to all ra«h and ignorant pilots ; fori was no Sooner 
borne ttTtbe pofnt, and hot above the boat’s length from » 
Shore, but I was got into a deep water, with a current like 
a<mitl, winch drove m v boat along sO violently, that it was 
impossible for me to keep near the edge of It, but foiced 
sne more and more out from the eddy to the left of me ; and 
all I could do w ith my paddles were useless, there being no - 
wind to help me: 

Now I began to look upon myself as quite lost, since as,, 
the current run on borh sides of the island, I was very cer- 
tain they must join again, aud then I had no hopes but of 
perishing for 1 want in the sea, after what provision I had 
was spent, or before, if a storm should happen to arise. 

Who can conceive the present anguish of tny mind at 
this calamity ? with longing eves did I look upon my little 
kingdom, anti thought tire island the pleasantest place in 
the universe. Happy, thrice happy destrt, said I, shall I 
never see the more? Wretched creature! whither am I 
going ?- Why did I murmur'at my lonesome condition, when 
now I would give the whole world to be thither again? 
While I was thus complaining, I found myself to be driven 
about two leagues into the sea ; however, I laboured till 
lTty strength was far spent, to keep my boaters tar north as 
possibly 1 could, to that side of the current where the eddy

lay on. About noon I perceived a little breeze of wind 
spring up from the S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart ; and 
was still more elated, when in about halt an hour, it blew a 
gentle fine gale. Had any thick weather sprung up, I had 
been lost another way ; for having no compass on board, I 
should never have found the Way to steer towards the island, 
if once it had disappeared ; but it proving the contrary, I 
set up thy mast again, spread my sail, and stood away 
northward as much as ] could, to get rid of the current. And 
no sooner did the boat begin to stretch aw8y, but I perceiv- 
ed, by the clearness of the water, a change of the current 
was near ; for, w here it was strong, the water was foul ; 
and where it was dear the current abated. To the east, I 
soon saw, about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some 
rocks, which caused it again to separate ; and as the main 
lorce of it drove away more southwardly, leaving the 
rocks to the north-east, so the other came back by the re- 
pulse of the rocks, making a sharp eddy, which returned 
back again to the north west with a very swift stream. 

They who have experienced what it is to be reprieved 
upon the ladder, or to be saved from thieves, just going to 
take away their lives, or such as have been in the like cala- 
mities with my ow n, may guess my present excess of joy ; 
how heartily 1 ran my boat into the stream of this eddy, and 
how joyfully f spread my sail to the refreshing w r ind, stand- 
ing cheerfully before it, with a smart tide under foot. By 
the assistance of -this eddy, I was carried above a league 
home again, when being in the wake of the island, betwixt 
the two currents, I found the water to be in a sort of a stand. 
About four o’clock in the afternoon, I reached within a 
league of the island, and perceived the points of the rock, 
which caused this disaster, stretching out, as I observed be- 
fore, to the southward, which throwing off the current more 
southwardly had occasioned another eddy to the north. But 
having a fair brisk gale, I stretched across this eddy r and io 
an hour came within a mile 'of the shore, where 1 soon 
landed to my unspeakable comfort ; and after an humble 
prostration, thanking God for my deliverance, with a reso- 
lution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my 
l>oat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take a wel- 
come repose. When 1 awoke, I was considering how I 
might get my boat home ; and coasting along the shore, I 
came to a good bay, which ran up to a rivulet or brook.

•where finding a safe harbour, I stowed her as safe as if she 
had been in a dry dock made on purpose tor her. 

1 dow perceived myself not far, from the place where be- 
fore l had travelled on foot; so taking nothing with me, 
.except my gun and umbrella, I began my journey, and in 
the. evening came to my bower, where I sfgain laid me down 
to rest. 1 had not slept long beiore 1 was awakened Jn 
great surprise, by a strange voice that called me several 
times, “Robin, Robin, Robinson Crusoe, poor Robin! 
‘•Where are you Robinson Crusoe? Where arC you? 
“ Where have you been r” , „ 

So fast was 1 asleep at first, that I did not awake thorough- 
ly; but half asleep and half awake, I thought I dreamed 
that somebody spoke to me. But, as the voice repeated 
Robinson Crusoe several times, being terribly affrighted, 1 
started up in the utmost confusion ; and, no sooner were 
my eyes fully open, bat I beheld my pretty Poll fitting on 
. the top of the hedge, and soon knew that it was he that call- 
ed me; for just in such bewailing language I use# to talk 
and teach him ? which he so exactly learned, that lie would 
sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, anti 
cry, “ Poor Robinson Crusoe, where are you ? where have 
“ you been ? how came you here r” and such like prattle-f 
had constantly taught him. But even though I knew it to 
be the parrot, it was a gteat while before 1 could adjust my- 
self; being amazed how the creature got thither, and that 
he should fix about that place, and no where else. But 
How being assured it could be no other than my honest 
Poll, tpy wonder ceased, and reaching out my hand, and 
calling familiarly Poll, the creature came to me, and perch- 
ed upon my thumb as he was wont, constantly prating to 
me with “ Poor Robinson Crusoe, and how did l come here, 
and where had I been?” as if the bird was overjoyed to see 
me ; and so 1 took him home along with me. 

I was now pretty well cured of my rambling to sea ; yet 
I could wish my boat, which had cost me so much trouble 
and pains, on this side the island once more, but which in- 
deed was impracticable. I therefore began to lead a very 
retired life, living near a twelvemonth in a very contented 
manner, wanting for nothing except conversation. As to 
mechanic labours, which my necessities obliged me to, I 
■fancied I could, upon occasion, make a tolerable carpenter 
were the poor tools I had to work withal but good. Be- 
sides, as I improved in my earthen Ware, I contrived to

make them with a wheel, which I found much easier and 
better, making m y work shapely, which before was rude 
and ugly, diut, I think, I was never so elated with my 
ow n performance or project, than for being able to make a 
tobacco-pipe, which though it proved an awkward clumsy 
thifcg, yet it was very sound, and carried the smoke per* 
feetly well, to my great satisfaction. 

1 also improved my wicker ware, making me abundanec of’ 
necessary baskets, which though not very handsome, were 
very handy and convenient to fetch things home in, as also 
for holding iny stores, barley, rice, and other provisions. 

My powder beginning to fail, made me examine aftos 
what manner i should kill the goats or birds to live on after 
it was all gone. Upon which L contrived many ways to 
ensnare the goats, and see if I could catch them alive, parti- 
cularly a she-goat with young. At last I had my desire j 
for making pitfalls and traps baited with barley and nee, J. 
found one morning, in one of them, an o'd hc-goat, and in 
tl>e otH^r three kids, one male, the other two females. 

So boisterous was the old one, that I could not bring him 
away.. But I forgot the old proverb, That hunger wrJF 
" tame a lion For had I kept him three or lour days with- 
out provisions, and then given him some water, with a little 
corn, lie a ould im , e beeu as tame as a young kid. The 
oilier creatures l bound with strings together ; but I had 
great difficulty before I could bring them to my habitation, 

£t was some time before they would feed ; but throwing 
them sweet corn it so much tempted them, that they began- 
to lie lamer. From them e I concluded, that if I designed 
to furnish myself with goat's flesh, when ray ammunition 
was spent, the tamelv Breeding them Up, like a flock of 
sheep, about my settlement, was the only method I could 
take. I concluded also I must separate the wild from the 
tame, or else they would always run wild as they greiy up ; 
and the best way for this, was to have some inclosed piece 
of ground well fenced, either with a hedge or } fo*, to keep 
them so effectually, that those within might not break out, 
or those without Break in. Such an undertaking was very 
great for one pair of hands ; but as there was an absolute 
necessity for doing it, my first care was to find a convenient 
piece of ground vyhere there was likely to be herbage for 
them to eat, water to drink, and cover to keep them from 
the sun. • . • * ,• v - •• v - *

Here again I gave another instance of my ignorance and 
inexperience, pitching upon a piece of meadow land so large, 
that had I enclosed it, the hedge or pale been at least 
two miles about. Indeed had it been ten miles, I had 
time enough to do it in, but then I did not consider that my 
goats would be as wild in so much compass, as if they bid 
liad the whole Island, and consequently as difficult for me 
to catch them This thought came into my head, after I 
had carried it on, I believe, about fifty yards ; I therefore 
altered my scheme, and resolved to inclose a piece of ground 
about one hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hun- 
dred in breadth, sufficient enough for as many as would main- 
tain me, till such time as my flock increased, and then I could 
add more ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work, 
and it took me about three months in hedging the first piece, 
in which time I tethered the three kids in the best part of 
it, feeding them as near me as possible, to make them fami- 
liar : and indeed I very often would carry some ears of bar- 
ley or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand ; by 
which they grew so tame, that when my inclosure was fi- 
nished, and I had let them loose, they would run after me 
for a> handful of corn. This indeed answered my end; and 
in a year and a half’s time I had a flock of about twelve 
goats, kids and all ; and in two years after they amounted 
to forty-three, besides what I had taken and killed for my 
sustenance. After which I - enclosed five several pieces of 
ground to feed them in, with pens to drive them into, that I 
might take them as I had occasion. 

In this project I likewise found additional blessings ; for 
I* not only had plenty of goat’s flesh ..but milk too, which in 
my beginning 1 did not so much as think of. And, indeed, 
though I had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen 
butter or cheese made, yet, after some essays and miscar- 
riages, I made me both, and never afterwards wanted. 

How mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort his 
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest calamities ? 
How can he sweeten the bitterest providencies, and give us 
reason to magnify him in dungeons and prisons ; what a • 
bounteous table was here spread in a wilderness for me # 
where I expected nothing at first but to perish for hunger. 

Certainly a Stoic would have smiled to see me at dinner.

J (leased, i eoukl either hang, draw, quarter, give them' 
iberty, or take it way. When I dined, I soeined a king, 
eating atone, none daring to presume to do so till, 1 had • 
done. Poll , as it" he had been my principal court favourite 
was tlie only, person penniued to talk, with me. My old, 
but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, and who 
had no species to multiply his kind upon, continually sat on 
my right hand ; white my two cats sat on each 6itie of the 
table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a principal mark of 
my royal favour. These were not the cats I had brought 
from the ship ; they had been dead long before, and mterred 
near juy habitation by nvy own hand. B.ut one of them, as 
1 suppose, generating with a wild cat, a couple of their 
youug I had made tame ; the rest run wild into the woods, 
and in time grew so impudent as to return and plunder me 
of my stores, till such time as I shot a great many, and the 
rest left me without troubling me any more.- In this plen- 
tiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing but conversa- 
tion. One thing iiuieed concerned me, the want of my 
boat ; I knew not which way to get her round the island. 
One time I resolved to go along the shore by land to her.; 
but bad any one in England met such a figure, it would 
either have affrightened them, ofr made them burst into 
laughter j nay, l could a 01 but smile myself at my habit, 
which I thiuk in this place will be very proper to describe. 

The cap I wore on ray head, was great, high, and shape- 
less, made of a goat s skin, with a flap or pent- house hang- 
ing down behind, not only to keep the sun from me, but to 
shoot dje rain off" from running into say neck, nothing being 
more pernicious than the rain falling upon the flesh ia these 
climates. I had a shoft jacket of goat’s skin, whose hair 
hung down such a length, on each side, that it reached down 
to the calves of my legs. As for shoes and stockings l had 
none, but made a semblance of something, I know not what- 
local] theny they were made like buskins, and laced on 
the sides like spatterdashes, barbarously shaped like the rest 
of my habit. I had a broad belt of goat's «ki« dried, girt 
« round l»c with a couple of thongs, instead of buckles ; oa 
each cf which, to supply th# deficiency of sword arid dag- 
ger, hung my hatchet and saw. f haa another belt, not so 
.broad, yet iastened in the same manner, which hung oyer 
my shouider, and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung 
two pouches, made ot goat’s skin, to hold my powder ana

shot. My basket I carried on my back, and my gun on my 
shoulder ; and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat’s 
skin umbrella., which, however, next to my gun, was the 
most necessary thing about me. for my fac e, the colour 
was not so swarthy as the Mulattoes, or might have been 
expec ted from one w ho took so little care of it, in a climate 
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time 
my beard grew so long that it hung down aboot a quarter 
‘Of a yard ; but as I had- both raizors amt sissors in store, I 
cut it all off, and suffered none to grow, except a large pair 
of Mahometan whiskers, the like of which I had seen wore 
by some Turks at Salee, not long enough indeed to Jiang a 
bat upon, but of such a monstrous size, as would have 
amazed any in England to have seen. 

But all this was of no consequence here, there being none 
• to observe my behaviour or habit. And so, withput fear 
and without control, I proceeded on my journey, the? prose- 
cution of which took me up five or six days. I first travelled, 
along the sea shore, directly to the place where I first brought 
my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks ; but now hav- 
ing no boat to take care of, I went overland a nearer way 
to the same height that I was before upon ; when looking 
forw ard to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which 
1 was forced to double with my boat, I was amazed to see 
the sea so smooth and quiet, there being no ripling motion,, 
nor current, any more than in other places. This made me 
ponder some time to guess the reason of it, when at last I 
was convinced that the ebb setting from the west and joining 
with the current of water from some great river on shore, 
must be the occasion of these rapid streams ; and that, con- 
sequently, as the winds blew more westwardly or more 
southwardly* so the current came the nearer, or went the 
farther from the shore. To satisfy my curiosity, I waited 
there till 'evening, when the time of ebb being made, I 
plainly perceived from the rock the current again as before, 
with this difference, that it ran farther off, near half a league 
from the shore ; whereas, in my expedition, it set close up- 
on it, fimously hurrying me and my canoe along with it, 
which at another time it would not have done. And now 
I was convinced, that, by observing the ebbing and flow ing 
of the tide, I might easily bring my boat round the island 
again. But when l began to think of putting it in prac tice, 
the remembrance of the late danger struck me with such 



64 - * LIFE A'VD AKVEWTCICHS 

horror, that I changed my resolution, and formed an other, 
which was more safe, though more laborious ; and this was 
to make another canoe, and so have one fqr one side of the 
island, and one for the other; \ ’■* 

I had now two plantations in the island ; the first my 
little fortification, fort, or castle, with many large and spa- 
cious improvements ; for by this time I had enlarged thecave 
behind me with several little caves, one within another, 
to hold my baskets, corn, and straw. The piles with which 
I made my wall were grown so lofty and great as obscured 
my habitation. And near this commodious and pleasant 
settlement, lay my well-cultivated and improved corn-fields, 
which kindly yielded me their fruit in the proper season. 
My second plantation was that near my country-seat, or 
little bower, where my grapes flourished, and where, having 
planted many stakes, 1 made inclosures for my goats, so 
strongly fortified by labor and time, that it was much strong- 
er than a wall, and consequently impossible for them to 
breakthrough. As for my bower itselt, I kept it constantly 
in repair, and cut the trees in such a manner, as made them 
grow thick and wild, and form a most delightful shade. In 
the centre of this stood my tent, thus erected : I had driven 
four piles in the ground, spreading over it a piece of the 
ship’s sail ; beneath which I made a sort of a couch with this 
skins of the creatures I had slain, and other things ; and 
having laid thereon one of the sailor’s blankets, which 1 had 
saved from the wreck of the ship, and covering myself with a 
great watch-coat, 1 took up this place for my country retreat. 

Very frequently from this settlement did I use to visit 
my boat, and keep her in very good order. And sometimes 
1 would venture in her a cast or two from the shope, but 
no farther, lest either a strong current, a sudden stormy 
wind, or some unlucky accident should hurry me from the 
island as before. But now I entreat your attention, whilst 
I proceed to inform you off a new, but most surprising 
.scene of life which here bcfel me. 

You may easily suppose, that after having been here so 
long, nothing could be more amazing than to see a human 
creature. One day it happened, that, going to my boat, I 
saw the print ol a man’s naked foot on the shore, very evi- 
dent on the sand, as the toes, heels, and every part of it. — 
Had I seen an apparition of the most frightful shape, I could 
not have been more confounded. My willing ears gave 


• P ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

the strictest attention. I cast my eyes around, but could 
satisfy neither the one nor the other. I proceeded alter- 
nately to every part of the shore, but with equal effect ; 
neither could 1 see any other mark, though the sand about 
it was as susceptible to take impression, as that which was 
so plainly stamped. Thus, struck with confusion and hor- 
ror, I returned to my habitation, frightened at every bush 
and tree, taking every thing for men ; and possessed with 
the wildest ideas ! That, night my eyes never closed. I 
formed nothing but the most dismal imaginations, concluding 
it must be the mark of the devils’ foot which I had seen. 
For otherwise how could any mortal come to this island ? 
where was the ship that transported them ? and what signs 
of any other footsteps ? Though these seemed very strong 
reasons for such a supposition, yet (thought I) why should 
the devil make the print of his foot to no purpose, as I can 
see, when he might have taken other ways to have terrified 
me ? why should he leave his mark on the other side of the 
island, and that too on the sand, where the surging waves 
of the ocean might soon have erased the impression. Surely 
this action is not consistent with, the subtlety of Satan, said 
I to myself ; but rather must be some dangerous creature, 
some wild savage of the main land over against me, that, 
venturing too far in the ocean, has been driven here, either 
by the violent currents or contrary winds ; and not caring 
to stay on this desolate island, has gone back to sea again. 

Happy, indeed, said I to myself, that none of the savages 
had seen me in that place : yet I was not altogether with- 
out fear, lest, having found my boat, they should return in 
numbers and devour me, or at least carry away all my corn 
and destroy my flock of tame goats. In a word all my reli- 
gious hopes vanished, as though I thought God would not 
now protect me by his power, who had so wonderfully pre- 
served me so long. 

_ What various chains of Providence are there in the life 
of man ? How changeable afe our affections, according to 
different circumstances ? We love to-day, what we hajte 
to-morrow ; we shun one hour what we seek the next. 
This was evident in me in the most conspicuous manner; 
For I, who before had so much lamented my condition, in 
being banished from all human kind, was now even ready 
Id expire, when I considered that a man had set his foot on 


' . tlElt -AHD AtrVSKTUIlR* 

; this desolate island. But when I considered mv station of 
bfo decreed by tins infinitely w ise and good providence of 
. God, that I ought not to dispute my .Creator’s sovereignty, 
who has an unbounded right to govern ar.(i dispose of his 
creatures as he thinks convenient; and that his justice and 
mercy could either punish or deliver me;, I say^ wht yi | 
consixlercd all 'tins, 1 comfortably found it. my duty to trust 
sincerely in him, pray ardently to him, and humbly resign 
^njysclt to his divine .will. 

One morning lying on my bed, these words of (ire sacred 
writings came into . my mind, “ Call upon me in the day of 
“ trouble, anil I vviil deliver thee, and thou .shall, glorify me." 
Upon this sentence, rising more cheerfully from my bed,; I 
offered up my .prayers in the most heavenly manner ; and 
when I had done, taking up my bible to read, these worda 
appeared first hi my sight; — “Wait on the -Lord, and be 
• “ of,good cheer, and be shall strengthen thy heart : Wait 
“I say, on the Lord.” Such divine comfort did this give n*e, 
as to remove all cause of sadness npon that occasion. . 

Thus, alter a world of, apprehensions and fears, for three 
days and nights, I at last ventured out of my .castle, and 
* irmAed my, goals, one oTwhich was. almost spoiled for want 
. of it. I next (though in great fear) visited my bower, and 
milked my flocks there also ; when, growing bolder, I went 
down to, the shore again, and measuring tbeprint of the foot 
to mine, to see, perhaps, whether d myself had not occasion* 
t -cd that mark, I found it much superior in largeness i and so 
returned home, now absolutely convinced that either .v«ne 
men had been ashore, or that the . island must be . inhabited, 
and therefore, that I. might .be surprised before I< was aware, 

I now began .to think of providing for my security, and 
resolved in. my mind many different schemes for tliat pur- 
pose. -I first proposer! to cut downmy inolosures,, and turn 
my tame cattle wild into the woods, that theeoefoy might 
not find them, and frequent the island in hopes of killing 
.the same. Secondly, I was for digging up, my corn .fields 
fqr'the very same reason. And, lastly, I concluded to de- 
molish my bower, lest, seeing a place of human contrivance, 
they might come farther and find out, and attack me in my 
Ijttfe castle. .• 

Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to me ; and I 
looked I thought like the unfortunate king Saul, when note 
t only oppressed by the Philistines, but also forsaken by God

himself. Ami, if is strange, that a little before, having en- 
tirely resigned myself to the mil of God, I should now have 
little confidence in hitn{ fearing those more who could kill" 
this fading body, than him who • could destroy my immortal 
: soul. ' ■ ..... 

Sleep was an utter stranger to my eyes that' Might ; yet 
nature spent and tired,’ submitted 'to a silent repose the next 
morning, and then joining reason with fear, I considered 
that this delightful and pleasant island might not bo so en- ' 
tirely forsaben aS l ndg-ht thrrrk ; but that the inhabitants 
'from the -other shore might sail, either with design or from 
necessity, by cross winds ; and, if the latter circumstance, 

I had reason to believe they would depart the first oppor- 
tunity. However, my fear made me think of a place for re- 
treat upon aft-attack. I now repented that ‘I'had mnde my 
door to come out beyond my fortification ; to remedy which, 

I resolved -to make me a second one : I fell to work, there- 
fore, and drove betwixt that double row of trees, which I 
planted above twelve years before, several strong piles, 
tbickening.it with pieces of timber and old cables; and 
1 Strengthening the fort: of rt with earth which I dug out of roy ’ 
''cave; l also, made me seven holes, wherein I plant, dr.: y 
^muskets like cannon, fitting them into frames resemblnu; 

* carriages. This being finished with indefatigable industry . 
for a great way every where, I planted sticks ef osier like a 
wood; about twenty -thousand of' them, leaving a large space 
between them and my wall, that I might have, room ip see 
an enemy, and that tlrey might not be sheltered among the 
young trees, if they’offered to approach the. outer wall — - 
And, indeed, scarce two years had. passed over my head, 
When there appeared a -lovely shady grove, and- in six years 
it became a thick wood, perfectly impassible, for my safe- 

• ty, I left no avenue to go- in or oitt ; instead of whichd set 
tsCO ladders, one to a part of a rock whiehr was tow, and 
then broke in, leaving room to place another fodder upon 
that ; so that when I took these down, it was impossible for 
any man to descend without hurting himself; and if tlicy 
had, they would still be at the outside of my outer wall. — - 
But while I took all these measure of human prudence for 
my own preservation I 'was not altogether unmindful of other 
aftairs. To preserve my stock of tame goats, that the ene-

retired part of the island, which was the place where I had 
lost myself before-mentioned; and there finding a clear piece 
•f land, containing three acres, surrounded- with thick woods, 

I wrought so hara, that in less than a month’s time, I fenced 
it so well round, that my flocks were very well secured in 
it, and I put therein two he goats and ten she ones. 

AU this labour w as occasioned purely by fearful appre- 
hensions, on account of seeing the print of a man’s foot. — 
And not contented yet with what I had done, I searclied 
for another place towards the west point of the island, 
where I might also retain another flock. Then wandering 
on this errand more to the west of the island than ever I had 
yet done, and casting my eyes towards the sea, methought 
1 perceived a boat at a great distance ; but could not possi- 
bly fell what it was for want of my perspective glass. I 
considered then it was no strange thing to see the print of 
a man’s foot; and concluding them cannibals, blessed God 
for being cast on the other side of the island, where none of 
the savages, as I thought, ever came. But when I came 
down the hill to the shore, which was the S. W. point of 
the island, I was soon confirmed in my opinion ; nor can 
any one describe my horror and amazeme'nt, when I saw 
the ground spread with skulls, hands, feet, and bones of 
human bodies ; and, particularly, I perceived a space like 
a circle, in the midst of which had been afire, about which 
I conjectured these wretches sat, and unnaturally sacrificed 
and devoured tlieir fellow-creatures. 

The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle, 
both confounded my senses, and made me discharge from my 
stomach in an excessive manner. I then returned towards 
my habitation ; and, in my way thither, shedding floods of 
tears, and falling down on my bended knees, gave God 
thanks for making my nature contrary to these wretches, 
and delivering me so long out of their hands. 

Though reason and my long residence here had assured 
me, that these savages never came up to the thick woody 

E art of the country, and that I had no reason to be appre- 
ensive of a discovery ; yet such an abhorrence did I still 
retain, that, for two years after, I confined myself ouly to 
my three plantations ; I mean my castle, country-seat, and 
inclosure in the woods. And though in process of time my 
dreadful apprehensions began to wear away, yet my eye* 
were more vigilant for fear of being surprised, and I was

very cautious of firing my gun, lest, being heard by those 
creatures, they should proceed to attack me. I resolved, 
liowevec, . n*antully to lose my life if they did, and went 
armed with three pistols stuck in my girdle, .which, added 
|p the description 1 have given of myself before; made me 
look with a very formidable, appearance.' 

Thus yny circumstances for some time remained very 
calm and undisturbed ; jrndwjjen I compared my condition 
others, 1 found it far frpm being miserable. And, indeed', 
would all persons- compare their circumstances, not with 
ifhose above thorn, but with those innumerable unhappy ob- 
jects beneath them, I am sure we should not hear those 
daily murmurings and complainings that ase in- the world. 
For my part, I wanted but few things. Indeed, the terror 
'which the savages had put me in, spoiled some inventions 
for my own conveniences. One ofirty projects was to brew 
me some beer; a very whimsical one indeed, when it is - 
considered that I had neither casks sufficient, nor could I 
make any to preserve it in neither had- I hops to make it

this to bear, as I had dpneothor things.. But now jny inve i- 
tions were placed another way; and day and night I could 
tliink of nothing but how I might destroy some oi these 
cannibals, when-proceeding to then* bloody entertainments ;

in execution, I was not long in seeking for a place conve-

each of which was loaded with a brace of slugs* and four

And thus all things being prepared, no sooner would the 
welcome light spread over the element, but, like a giant re- 
freshed, n-ith nine, as the Scripture has it, would I is$u'e forth 
from my castle, and from a lofty hill, three miles distant, 
view if I could see any invaders approach unlawfully to 
my kingdom. ' r But having waited in vain two or three 
months, it not only grew very tiresome to me, but brought 
me to some consideration, and made me examine myself, 
what right I had to kill these creatures in this manner. 

I? (argued I to myself) this unnatural custom of theirs Jbe 
a sin offensive to Heaven, it belongs to the Divine Being, 
•who alone has the vindictive power in his hands, to shower 
down his vengeance upon them. And perhaps he does so, 
’in making them become one another's executioners. Or, 
if not, if God thinks these doings just, according to the 
knowledge they conceive, what authority have I to pretend 
•to thwart the detrees of Providence, which has permitted 
these actions for so many ages, perhaps from almost the be- 
ginning of the creation ? They never offended me, what 
right have I then to concern myself in their shedding one 
•another’s blood : And, indeed, I have since known, they 
•value no more to kill and devour a captive taken in war, 
than we do to kill an ox or eat mutton. I then concluded 
'it necessarily followed, that these people were no more 
murderers than Christians, who many times put all troops, 
to the stvord, after throwing down their arms.' — Again, I- 
"Considered, that if 1 fell upon them, 1 should be as much in 
the wrong as the Spaniards, Who had committed the great- 
est barbarities upon these pebple who had never offended^ 
them in their whole lives ; as if the kingdom of Spain was- 
emirierft for a race of men without common compassion to 
the miserable, a principal sign of the most generous temper: 
thesi’c'onsiderations made me pause, and made me think I 
had taken wrong measures in my resolution : I now argued 
with myself, it was better forme never to attack, blit to re- 
in am undiscovered as long as i possibly could ; that an op-

posite conduct would certainly prove destructive.; for as it 
-was scarcely to be supposed I could kill them all, I might 
either be overpowered by the remaining, or that some’ es- 
caping, might bring thousands to my certain destruction*— 
And, indeed, religion took their part so much as to convince 
me how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of shedding 
human blood, innoccntas to my particular, whatever they 
are to one another;; that I had nothing to dorvvith it, but 
- leave it to the God of all power and dominiort, as I said 
before, to do therein what seemed convenient to his heaven- 
ly wisdom. And, therefore on my knees I thanked the Af- 
mighty for delivering me from blood guiltiness, and begged 
his -protection that I might never tall into their hands. 

Thus giving over an attempt which I liad rashly begun, T 
never ascended the hill on that occasion afterwards : 1 only 
removed my boat, which lay on the other side of the island, 
and every thing that belonged to her, towards the east, into 
a little cove, that there might not be the least shadow of any 
boat near, or habitation upon the island — My, castle then 
became ray cell, keeping always retired in it, except when 
I went out to milk my she goats, and order my little flock in 
the wood, which was quite out of danger: for sure I was 
that these savages never came here with expectations to 
find any thing, and consequently never wandered from the 
coast : however, as they might have several times, been - on 
*. shore, as well before as after my dreadful apprehensions, I 
looked back with horror to think m what state I might have 
been, had l suddenly met them slenderly armed, vvhh one 
*gnn only loaded with small shot ; ami how great would 
have been my amazement, if, instead, of one man's foot, I 
had perceived fifteen 01 twenty savages, who having once 
set their eyes upon, me, by the swiftness of their feet would 
. have left me.no possibility of escaping? These thoughts 
‘ would sink my very soul, so that I w ould fait into a deep 
melancholy, till such time as the, consideration ofiny grpti- 
3 tude to the Divine Being moved it from my heart. „ Xthcn 
fell info a conteinplat ion of the sacred springs of Providence, 
and how wonderfully we are delivered, when insensible of - 
it ; and when intricated in uncertain maj^es or. labyrinths of 
doubt or hesitation, what secret hint directs us iu foe right 
way, when, we intended to go out of it ; nay, perhaps con- 
trary to our business, sen>e, or inclination. f Upon which, l

secret impressions of the mind, to the acting or not actings- 
any thing that offered, for which I yet could assign no rea- 
son. But let it be how it will, the advantage of this con- 
duct very eminently- appeared in the latter part of my abode 
on this island ; I am a stranger in determining whence these 
secret intimations of Providence derive ; yet metliinks they 
are not only some proof of the converse of spirits, but also 
of the secret communications they are supposed to have 
with those that have not passed through the gloomy vale o£ 
death. 1 « 

These anxieties of mind, and the care of my preservation,, 
put a period to all future inventions and contrivances,.either' 
for accommodation or convenience. I now cared not to 
drive a nail, chop a stick, fire a gun, or make a fire, lest 
either the noise should be heard, or the smoke discover me. 
And on this account I used to burn my earthen ware private-, 
ly in a cave which I found ip the wood, and which I, made 
convenient for that purpose j the principal cause that 
bfought me here was to make charcoal, so that I might bake 
and dress my bread and meat without any danger. At thflt 
time a curious accident happened me, which I shall nqw 
relate. 

While I was cutting dowii\ some wood for making ray - 
charcoal, Lperceived a cavity behind a very thick branch . 
of underw ood. Curious to loolfc into it, I attained its mouth, 
and perceived it sufficient for me to stand upright in. But* 
when,. I had entered, and took a further view, two rolling 
shinin^eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to- dart themselves 
at me ; so that I made all the haste out thatl could, as not * 
knowing w hether it was a devil or a monster that had taken i 
his residence in that place. When I recovered a little from 
my surprise, I called myself a thousand fools, for being \ 
afraid to see the- devil one moment, who had now lived 
almost tw'enty years in the most retired solitude. And 
therefore resuming all tho courage I had, I'took a flaming 
firebrand, and in I rushed again. I had not proceeded 
above three steps, when I was more affrighted than before ; 
for then I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a human crea- 
ture in the greatest agony, succeeded with a broken noise,.. . 
resembling words halt expressed, and then a broken sigh- 
again. Stepping back. Lord ! (thought I to myself) where- , 
am I got, into what enchanted place have I plunged my-

death puts an end to their sorrows ? And, indeed, in such 
great amazement was I, that it struck me into a cold sweat ; 
and had my hat been on my head, I believe my hair would 
have moved it off. But again encouraging myself with the 
hopes of God’s protection, I proceeded forward, and by the 
light of my firebrand perceived it to be a monstrous hc-goat, 
lying on the ground, gasping for life, and d} ing of mere old 
age. At first I stirred him, thinking to. drive him out, but 
the poor ancient creature strove to get upon his loot, but 
was not able ; so I e’en let him lie still to affright the sava- 
ges, should they venture into this cave. I now looked 
round me and found the place but small and shapeless At 
the farther side of it, I perceived a sort of an entrance, yet 
so low, as must oblige me to creep upon my hands and 
knees to it ; so, having no candle, I suspended my enter- 
prise till the next day, and then I came provided with two 
large ones of my own making. 

Having crept upon my hands and feet, through this strait, 
I found the roof higher up, I think about twenty feet. But 
surely mortal never saw such a glorious sight before ! The 
roof and walls of this cave reflected, a hundred thousand 
lights to me from my two candles, as though they were in- 
dented with shining gold, precious stones, or sparkling 
diamonds. And indeed it was the most delightful cavity or 
grotto o'f its kind, that could be desired, though entirely 
dark. The floor was dry and level, and had a kind of 
gravel upon it ; no nauseous venomous creatures to be seen 
there, neither any damp or wet about it. 1 could find no 
fault but in the entrance, ancLI began to think that even 
this might be 'very necessary for my defence, and therefore 
resolved to make it my most principal magazine. I brought 
hither two fowling-pieces, and three muskets, leaving only 
five' pieces at rav castle, planted in the nature of cannon. 
Of the barrel ©^gunpowder which I took up out of the sea, 
I brought away about sixty pounds of good powder, which 
tv^s not damaged ; and this, with a great quantity of lea** 
for bullets, I removed from my castle to this retreat, now' 
fortified both by art and nature. 

I fancied myself now like one of the giants of old, who 
were said to live in caves and holes among the rocks, inac- 
cessible to any but themselves, or, at least, a most danger- 
ous attempt. And now I despised both the cunning and 
strength of the savages, either to fiud me out or to hurt me.

But T tmut not forget the old goat, which caused my late 
dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave up the 
ghost the day after my discovery; and it being difficult to 
drag him out, I dug his grave, and honorably entombed 
Mm in the same place where hte departed, with as nujcjh. 
ceremony as any Welch goat that has been interred about 
the high' mountain Pcmnanmawr. 

I th ink I was now in the twenty-third year of my reign, 
and mv thoughts much easier than formerly, having contri- 
ved several’ pretty amusements and diversions to pass away 
the time m a pleasant manner. By this lime my pretty Poll 
had learned to speak English, and pronounce his wordsr 
very articulately and plain ; so that 1 for many hours we used 
to chat together after a familiar manner, and he lived with 
me no less than twenty-six years. Mv dog which waa. 
nineteen years old, sixteen of which he lived with me, died 
some time ago of mere old age. As for my cats, they mul- 
tiplied so fast, that I’ was forced to kill or dtive them into 
the woods, except two or t#ree which became my particu- 
lar favorites. Besides these, I continually kept two or three- 
household kids about me, w’hich I learned to feed ou t of my 
hand, and twrrmore parrots which could talk indifferently, 
and cal! Robinson Crusoe, but not so excellently as the first, 
as not taking that pains with them-. I'had also several sea- 
fowls which I had wounded and cut their' wings ; and 
growing tame, they used to breed among the low trees 
about my castle walls,, all which made my abode very 
agreeable. 

But what unforseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy- 
ment of this uncertain state of life, when we least expect 
them ! It was now the month of December, in the southern- 
solstice, and particular time of my harvest, which required- 
my attendance in the fields ; w hen going out pretty early 
one morning, before it was day-light, there appeared to me 
.from the sea shore, a flaming light, about two miles from me 
■foal the east end' of the island; where I had observed some 
savages had been before, not on the other side, but to my . 
great affliction, it was on my side the island.' 

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen- 
sions, that the savages would perceive my improvements, I 
i returned directly to my castle, pulled the ladder after me, 
making all things look as Wild and natural as I possiblv 
©ould. la. tho next place, 1 put myself iuta a posture <Jf

my last breath. T wo hours after, impatient for intelligence,

to the top, where laying myself on my belly, with my per- 
spective- glass, I perceived no less than nine naked, savages, 
silting round a small fire, eating, as 1 supposed, human flesl^ 
•with, their two canoes haled -on shore, waiting for tire flood 
to carry .them off again. ¥oa cannot eas'd)' express the 
consternation I w^s in at this sight, especially seeing them 
jpear.me^ bnt .when I. perceived their coining/ must be 
sdways. with the cumuit-of the ebb, I became more easy in 
■my. thoughts, being fully convinced that’I might go abroad 
with security .all the time of flood, if they were not before 
landed. And, indeed, tins proved just as I imagined ; for 
..no sooner did they all take boat and paddle away, but ihc 
Jtide made N. W. Before they went off, they danced, 
^making ridiculous postures , and gestures, for above an hour, 
.all stalky-naked : but whether men or women, or both, I 
could not perceive. When I saw them gone, I took two 
guns upon my shoulder s; and placing a couple of pistols- in 
my b.e(t, with ray great sword hanging by my side, I went 
to the, hill, where at first I made a discovery of these can- 
nibals,, and then saw there -had been three caaoes more of 
the savages on shore at that place, which w.itlf the rest were 
making over to the main land.

76 * LIFE AN» ADVENTURES 

But to wave this, the following accident, which demands 
attention, for a while eluded the force of my thoughts in 
revenging myself on those Heathens. ; • - - ' 

On the 16 th of May (according to my wooden calendar) 
the wind blew exceedingly hard, accompanied with abund- 
ance of lightening and thunder all day, and succeeded fey a 
very stormy night. The seeming anger of the Heavens 
made me Have recourse to my Bible. Whilst I was seri- 
ously pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed with the 
noise of a gun, which I conjectured was fired upon the 
orean. Such an unusual surprise made me start up in a 
minute, when, with my ladder, ascending the mountain a£ 
before, that very moment a flash of fire presaged the report 
of another gun, which I presently heard, and found it was 
from that part of the sea where the current drove me away. 
I could not but then think, that this must be a ship in dis- 
tress, and that these were the melancholy signals for si 
speed y. deliverance. Great, indeed, was my sorrow upon 
this occasion ; but my labours to assist them must have prov- 
ed altogether vain and fruitless. However, I brought tot 
gether all the dry wood that was at hand, and making a 
pretty large pile, set it on fire on the hill. I was certain 
they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun as soon 
as it began to blaze, and alter that several more from the 
same quarter. All night long I kept up my fire : and 
when the air cleared up, I perceived something a great way 
at sea directly E. but could not distinguish what it was, 
even with my glass, by reason the weather was so very 
foggy out at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly fisted 
upon it, and perceiving it did not stir, I presently concluded 
it must be a ship at anchor, and so very hasty I was to be 
satisfied, that taking the gun, I went to the S. E. part of the 
island, to the same rocks where I had been formerly drove 
away by the current ; in which time the weather being 
perfectly cleared up, to my great sorrow, I perceived the' 
wreck of a ship cast away upon those hidden rocks I found 
when I was out with my boat ; and which, by making a 
.kind of an eddy, were the occasion of my preservation. 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another’s ruin ; for un- 
doubtedly this ship had been driven on them in the night, 
the wind blowing strong at E. N. E. Had they perceived 
the island, as I now guessed they had not, certainly, instead * 
of firing their guns for help, they would rather have ven«.

lured in their- boat, and saved themselves that way. I then 
thought, that perhaps they bad done so, upon seeing my 
fire, and were cast away in the attempt ; tor I perceived 
no boat in the ship*. But then l again imagined, that per- 
haps* they had another vessel in company, which, upon 
signal, saved their lives, and took the boat up : or that the 
boat might be driven into tbe main ocean, where these poor 
creatures might be in the most miserable condition. But 
as all these conjectures were very uncertain, I could do no 
more than commiserate their distress, and thank God for 
delivering me, in particular, when so many perished in the 
raging oc-ean. 

When I considered seriously every thing concerning this 
wreck, and could perceive no room to suppose any of them 
saved, I cannot explain, by any possible force of words, what 
longings my soul felt on this occasion, often breaking out 
in this manner c “ O that there had been but two or three, 
44 nay even one person saved, that we might have lived 
41 together, conversed with, and comforted one another !” 
and so much were my desires moved, that when I repeated 
these words, Oh 1 that there had been but one P’ my 
hands would clench together, and my fingers press the 
palms of my hands so close, that, had any soft thing been 
between, it woukl have crushed it involuntarily, while my 
teeth would strike together, and set against each other so 
strong, that it required some time for me to part them. 

Till the last year of my being on this island, I never 
knew whether or not any had been saved out of this ship. 
I had the affection, some, time after, to see tire corpse of a 
drowned boy come on shore, at the end of tbe island which 
was next th6 shipwreck ; there was nothing on him but a 
seaman’s waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, 
and a blue linen shirt, but no particular mark to guess what 
nation he was of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight, 
and a tobacco-pipe, the last of which I preferred much 
more than I did the first. And now the calmness of the 
sea tempted me to venture out in my boat to this wreck 
not only to get something necessary out of the ship, but 
perhaps, some living creature might be no board, whose 
life I might preserve. This had such an influence upon 
my mind,, that immediately I went home, and prepared 
every thing necessary for the voyage, carrying on board

my boat provisions of all sorts, with a good quantity of fuw,, 
fresh water, aud a compass : so putting off, I paddled the 
canoe along the shore, till I came at last to the north-east 
part of the island, from whence I was to launch into the 
ocean ; but here the currents ran so 'violently, and appeared 
so terrible, that my heart began to fail me foreseeing that 
if I was driven into any of these currents, I might be can- 
lied not only out of reach or sight of the island, but even 
inevitably lost in the boiling surges of the ocean. fJ . 

So oppressed was I at these' troubles, that J gave .over 
my enterprize, sailing to a little creek on the shore, when? 
stepping out, I set me down on a rising hill, very pensive 
ana thoughtful. I then perceived that the tide was turned, 
and the flood came on, which made it impracticable for me 
to go out for so many hours. To be more certain how the 
sets of the tides or currents lay when the flood came iu,.J 
ascended a higher. piece of ground, which overlooked. the 
sea both ways ; and here I found that as the current of the 
ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so the 
current of the flood set In close by the shore of the north 
side ; and all that I had to do, was to keep to the north of 
the island in my return. 

That night 1 reposed myself in my canoe, 'covered with 
my watch-coat, instead of a blanket, the heavens being m y 
tester. I set out with the first of the tide full north, till I 
felt the benefit of the current, which carried me at a. great 
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as. before, as 
to take from me all government of ray canoe; so that In 
two hours time I came up to tire wreck, which appeared 
to me a most melancholy sight. It seemed to be a Spanish 
vessel by its building, stuck fast between two rocks ; her 
stern and quarter beaten to piece 


broken off short. As I approached near, I perceived a dog 
on board, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried, and 
no sooner did I call him, but the poor creature jumped into 
the sea, out of which I took him up, almost famished with 
hunger and thirst ; so that when I gave him a cake of bread, 
no ravenous wolf could devour it more greedily ; and he 
drank to that degree of fresh water, that he would have 
burst himsetf, had 1 sufFered him. ( , , 

The first sight I met with in the ship, were two men

another's arms : hence I very probably suppose, that when 
the vessel struck in the storm, so high and incessantly did 
the waters brehk in and over her, that the men not being 
able to bear it, were strangled by the constant rushing in of 
the waves. There were several casks of liquor, whether 
wine or brandy I could not be positive, which lay in the 
lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out 
of the water, yet were too large for me to pretend to med- 
dle with ; likewise I perceived several clients, which I 
supposed to belong to the seamen, two of which I got into 
Bay boat, without examining what was in them. Had the 
stern of the ship been fixed, and the forepart broken off, I 
should have made a very prosperous voyage; since, by 
what I after found in these two chests, 1 could not other- 
wise conclude, but that the ship must have abundance of 
wealth on board; nay, if I must guess by the course she 
steered, she roust have been bound from the Buenos Ayres, 
«r the Rio de la Plata, in the southern parts of America, 
beyond the Brazils, to the Havannah, in thegulph of Mexico, 
and so perhaps to Spain. What became of the rest of the. 
sailors, I could not certainly- tell; and all her riches signi- 
fied nothing at that time to any body. 

Searching farther, I found a cask, containing about 
twenty gallons, full of liquor, which, with some labour, I 
got into my boat ; in her cabin were several muskets, which 
I, let remain there, hut took away with me a great powder 
horn, with about four pounds of powder in it. I took also 
afire-shovel and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to 
make chocolate, and a gridiron : all which were extremely 
necessary to tnc, especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And 
so with this cargo, accompanied with my dog, I came 
away, the tide serving tor that purpose : and the same 
evening, about an hour within night, I attained the island, 
after the greatest toil and fatigue imaginable. 

That night I reposed my wearied limbs in the boat, re- 
solving the next morning to harbour what 1 had gotten in 
my new-found subterraneous grotto; and not to carry 
my cargo home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed 
myself, and got aH my effects on shore, I next proceeded 
to examine the particulars; and 99 tapping the cask, I 
found the liquor to be a kind of rum, but not like what wc 
had at the Brazil*, nor indeed mar so good. At the opeij-

ing of the chest, several things appeared very useful to me, 
for instance, I found in one a very fine case of bottles, con- 
taining the finest and best sorts of cordial waters 5 each 
bottle held about three pints, curiously tipt with silver, r. I 
found also two pots full of the choicest sweetmeats, and 
two more which the water had utterly spoiled. There 
were likewise several good shirts exceedingly welcome to. 
me, and about one dozen and a half .white linen handled-- 
chiefs and coloured neckcloths, the former of winch was- 
absolutely necessary for wiping, my face in a hot day ; and, 
in the till, 1 found three bags oi pieces of eight, about eleven 
hundred in all, in one of which, decently wrapped up in a? 
piece of paper, were six doubloons of gold, and some small, 
bars and wedges of the same metal, which 1 believe might 
weigh near a pound. In the other chest, which I guessed 
to belong to the gunner’s mate, by the mean circumstance# 
which attended it, I found only some clothes of very little, 
value, except about two pounds of fine glazed powder, in- 
three flunks, kept, as I believe, for charging their fowling-, 
pieces on any occasion ; so that, on the whole, I had no 
great advantage by this voyage. The money was indeed 
as mere dirt to me, useless and unprofitable, all which If 
would have freely par ted with for two or three pair of Eng-, 
hsh shoes and stockings - r things that for many years I had 
not worn, except lately those which I had taken off the feet 
of those unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck, 
yet. not so good as English shoes -either for ease or service. . 
J also found in the seaman’s chest about fifty pieces of eight, 
in royals, but no gold ; so concluded that what I took. , 
from the first belonged to an officer, the latter appearing t 
to have a much inferior person for its owner. However*., 
as despicable as the money seemed, 1 likewise lugged it t*> 
mv cave-, la) ing it up securely, as 1 did the rest of my , 
cargo ; and after I had done all this, I returned back to, 
my boat, rowing and paddling her along till I came to my * 
old harbour, where I carefully laid her up, and so made lho~ 
best of my way io my castle. When I arrived there, every , 
thing seemed safe and cjujet : so that now my only busines# 
was to repose myself after my wonted manner, and take 
care of my domestic affairs. But though I might have lived 
very easy, as wanting nothing absolutely needful ; yet 
still I was more vigilant than usual upon account of the sz 
vages, never going much abroad ; or, if I did, it was to the

fast part of the island, where I was well assured that the 
savages never c?mc, and where I might not be troubled tQ 
carry that heavy load of weapons for my defence, as I wa$ 
Obliged to do it I went the other way. 

'two years did I live in this anxious condition, in all which 
time, contrary to rtiy former resolutions, my head was filled 
with nothing but projects and designs, how 1 might escape 
from this island $ and so much were my wandering thoughts 
bent upon a rambling disposition that had i had the same 
boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured 
once more to the uncertainty of the raging ocean. 

I cannot, however, but consider myself as one of the un- 
happy persons, who make themselves wretched by their 
disatisfaction with the stations which God has placed them 
in ; for not to take a review of my primitive condition, and 
rny father's excellent advice, the going contrary to which 
Was, as I may say, my original sin, the following mistakes 
of the same nature certainly had been the means of niy pre- 
sent unhappy station. What business had I to leave-a set- 
tled fortune, and well stocked plantation, improving and 
increasing, where, by this time, I might have been worth 
a' hundred thousand moidores, to turn super-cargo to

strongly in my mind, that it seemed to check all the dictate? 
of reason and philosophy. And now to usher in my kind

gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among them : One 
night in March, being the rainy season, in the four and 
twentieth year of my solitude, I laydown to sleep, very 
well in health, without distemper, pain, or uncommon unea- 
siness, either of body or mind ; yet notwithstanding, I 
could not compose myself to sleep all the night long. All 
this tedious while, it is impossible to express what innumer- 
able thought? came into my head. I traced quite over the 
whole history of my life in miniature, from my utmost re- 
membrance of things till I came to this island, and then 
proceeded to examine every action and passage that had 
occurred since I had taken possession of my kingdom. In 
iny reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the happy 

f »osture of my affairs in the beginning of my reign, to this, 
ife of anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discovered a. 
print of a foot in the sand ; that while I continued without 
apprehension, I was incapable of feeling the dread and ter- 
ror I now suffered. How' thankful rather ought I ta 
have been for the knowledge of my danger, since the 
greatest happiness one can be possessed of is to have suffi- 
cient time to provide against it ? How stupendous is the 
goodness of Providence, which sets such narrow' bounds la 
the sight and knowledge of human nature, that while men. 
walk in the midst of so many dangers they are kept serene 
and calm, by having the events of things hid from their eyes 
arjd knowing nothing of those many dangers that surround 
them, till perhaps they are dissipated and vanish away. 

When I came more particularly to consider of the real 
danger I had for so many years escaped ; how I had w alked 
about in the greatest security and tranquillity, at a time,, 
perhaps, when even nothing but the brow of a hill, a great 
tree, or the common approach of night, had interposed be- 
tween me and the destructive hands of the cannibals, who 
wopld devour me with as good an appetite, as I would a 
pigeon or curlew ; surely all this, 1 say, could not but 
make me sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, whose 
singular protection I acknowledge with the greatest humi- 
lity, and without which I nust inevitably have fallen into 
the cruel hands of those devourers. 

Having thus discussed my thoughts in the clearest man- 
ner, according to my weak understanding, I next proceeded 
to consider the w'retched nature of those destroying savages, 
bv seeming, though with great reverence, to inquire, why' 
Ood should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity. 


OF ROBINSON CRCSOE. S3 

even to brutality itself, to devour its own kind ? bat as this 
was rather matter of abstruce speculation, and as my miser- 
able situation made me think this of mine the most uncom- 
fortable situation in the world, I then began rather to inquire 
what part of the world these wretches lived in ; how far off 
the coast was tram whence they came ; why they ventured 
Over so far from home > what kind of boats conveyed them 
hither ; and why I could not order myself and my business 
so, that I might be as able to attain their country, as they 
were 'to come' to my kingdom? 

‘ But then, thought I, how shall I manage myself when I 
come thither? what will become of me if I fall into the 
bands of the savages ? or how shall I escape from, them, if 
sthey ma"ke an attempt upon me ? and supposing I should not 
'fall into their power, what shall I do for provision, or which 
way shall I bend my course ? These counter thoughts threw 
me into the greatest horror and confusion imaginable; but 
''then I still" looked upon my present condition to be the most 
miserable that possibly could be, and that nothing could be 
worse, except death. For (thought T) could 1 but attain 
the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet with some re- 
lief, or coast it along, as I did with my boy Xnry, on the 
African shore, till I came to some inhabited country, where 
I might meet with some relief, or fall in with some Christian 
ship that might take me in ; and if I failed, why then I could 
; but meet with death, which would put an end to all my miser- 
ies. These thoughts, I must confess, were the fruit of a dis- 
tempered mind, an impatient temper made desperate, as it 
were,bylongcontinuanceof the troublesand disappointments 
-I had met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have found 
-some living person to speak to, by whom I might have known 
in what -place I was, and of the probable means of my de- 
liverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitated, my 
resignation to the will of Heaven was entirely suspended ! 
so that I had no power to fix ray mind to any thing, but to 
; the project of a voyage to the main land. And indeed so 
much was i* inflamed upon this account, that it set my 
blood into a ferment, and my pujse beat high, as though I 
had been in a fever ; till nature being, as it were, fatigued 
and exhausted with the thoughts of it, made me submit 
myself to a silent-repose. 

In such a situation, it is very strange, that I did not 
dream of what 1 was so intent upon ; but, instead of it, my 
mind loved on a quite different tiling, altogether foreign.

I dreamed, that as I was issuing from my castle one morn- 
ing, as customary, when I perceived upon the shore two 
canoes, and eleven savages coming to land, who had brought 
with them another Indian, whom they designed to make a 
xacrifioe of, in order to devour ; buL just as they were going 
, to give die fatal blow, mothought the poor designed victim 
jumped a* ay, and ran directly into my little thick grove 
before my fortification, to abscond from his enemies, when 
perceiving that the others did not follow him that way, I 
appeared to him ; that he humbly kneeled down before 
me, seeming to nrav for my assistance ; upon which I 
showed him my ladder, made him ascend, carried him to 
iny cave, and he became my servant; and when I had 
gotten this man, I said to myself, pow surely I may have 
snme hopes to attain the main land ; for this fellow wifi 
•erve me as a pilot, tell me what to do, and where I must 
g > for provisions, what places to shun, what to venture to, 
and what to escape. But when I awaked, and found all 
these inexpressible impressions of joy entirely vanished, I’ 
fell into'the greatest dejection of spirit imaginable. • ; 

Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that one sure way 
of escaping was to get a savage ; that after 1 had ventured’ 
*ny life to deliver him from the bloody jaws of his devourers, 
the natural sense he might have of such a preservation, 
might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and most sincere 
affection. But then this objection reasonably interposed : 
how can I effect this, thought 1, without I attack a whole 
company of them, and kill them all ? why. should I proceed 
ou such a desperate attempt, which my scruples before had 
suggested to be unlawful ( and indeed my heart trembled 
at the thoughts of so much blood, though it were a means 
to procure my deliverance. *Tis true, I might reasonably 
enough suppose these men to be real enemies to my life, 
men who would devour me, was it in tbeir power; so that 
it was self preservation in the highest degree to free myself, 
by attacking them in my own defence, as lawfully as if 
they were actually assaulting me : though all these things, 

I say, seemed to me to be of the greatest weight, yet, as I 
just said before, the dreadful thoughts of shedding human 
blood, struck such a terror to my soul, that it was a long 
time before I could reconcile myself to it. 

But how far will the ardency of desire prompt us on r For 
notwithstanding the many disputes and perplexities I had

with my self, I at length resolved, right or wrong, to get one 
of these savages into my hands, cost what it would, or even" 
though I, should lose my life in the attempt. Inspired with 
this firm resolution, I set all my wits at work, to find out 
what methods I should take to answer my design : this, in-' 
deed, was so difficult a task, that I could hot pitch upon any 
probable means to execute it: I therefore resolved continu- 
ally to be in a vigilant posture, to perceive when the sava- 
ges, came on shore, and to leave the rest to the event, let 
the opportunities offer as they would.' 

, Such was rpy fixed resolutions; and accordingly I set 
myself upon the scout, as often as I couid, till such time as I 
was heartily tired of it. I waited for above a year and a 
half, the greatest part of which l went out to the west, and" 
south-west corner of the island, almost every day, to look 
for canoes, buJL none appeared. This was a v ery great dis- 
couragement ; yet though I was very much concerned, the 
edge of niy design was as keen as ever, and the longer ft* 
seemed to be delayed, the more eager was 1 for it; in a 
•word, I never before was so careful to shun the loathing 
sight of these savages, as I was now eager to be with them ; 
and I thought myself sufficiently able to manage one, two, 
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them my en 
tire slaves, to do whatsoever I should direct them, and pre- 
vent their being able at any time to do me a mischief. Many 
times, did I use la please myself with these thoughts, with, 
long and ardent expectations ; but nothing presenting, all 
nay deep projected schemes and numerous fancies, vanished 
away, as though, while I retained such thoughts, the decree* 
•fl'rovideuce were such that no savages w<fre tocomencarme. 

, About a year and a half after, when I was seriously mu- 
sing of sundry, other ways how J should attain uny end, one 
morning early I was very much surprised by seeing no leW 
thau five canoes all on shore together, on my side the island, 
and the savages that belonged to them all landed, and out 
of trty sight. Such a number of them disconcerted all my 
measures ; for, seeing so many boats, each of which would 
contain six, and sometimes more, 1 could not tell what to 
think of it, <A‘ how to order ray measures, to attack twenty 
or thirty men, single-handed ; upon which, much dispirited 
aud perplexed, I lay still in my castle; which, however, I 
put inr a proper posture for an attack; and having formerly 
provided all that was necessary, was’ soon ready to. enter

upon an engagement, should they attempt. Having Waite# 
for some time my impatient temper would let me bear it 
longer ; I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and, ad 
usual, ascended up to the top of the hill at two stages, stand- 
ing, however, in .such a manner, that ray head did not ap- 
pear above the hill, so that they could not easily perceive- 
me ; and here, by the assistance of my perspective glass, f 
observed no less than thirty in number around a fire, feasting 
upon what meat they had dressed : how they cooked it, or 
what it was, I could not then, perfectly tell ; but they were 
all dancing and capering about the flames, using many 
frightful and barbarous gestures. 

1 But while, with a curious eye, i was beholding these 
wretches, my spirits sunk within me, when I- perceived 
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act 
afresh the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed they had done 
before. It was not long before one of them fell upon the 
ground* knocked down, as I suppose, with a club or wooden 
sword, for that was their manner ; white two or three other# 
went immediately to work, cutting, him open for their cook- 
ery, and then fell to devour him as they had done the for- 
mer, while tire last unhappy captive was left by himself 
till such time as they were ready for him. - The poof crea- 
ture looked round him vvklt a wishful eye, trembling at the 
tboughs. of death ; yet, seeing himself a little at liberty, na- 
ture, that very moment, as it were, inspired him with hope* 
•f life : He started away from them, and ran, with incre- 
dible swiftness, along tire sands, directly to that part of the 
•oast where my ancient and venerable castle stood. 

You may well imagine, I was dreadfully affrighted upon 
this occasion, when, as I thought, they pursued him in a 
whole body, all running towaras my palace. And now, 
indeed, i expected tlrat part of my dream was going to 
be fulfilled, and that be would certainly fly to my grove 
tor protection; bat, for the rest of ray dream, t could de- 
pend nothing on it, that the savages would pursue him' 
thither, and, find him there. However, my spirits begin- 
ning to recover, l still kept upon my guard; and I now 
plainly perceived there were but throe men out of the mini-' 
her that pursued him. I was infinitely pleased with what 
swiftness tire poor creature ran from his pursuers, gaining so 
nyich ground upon them, that I plainly perceived could ha

but he 'would save -his life from the power of his enemies. 

Between them and ray castle there was a creek, that 
very same which I sailed into with all my effects from the 
wreck of the ship, on the steep baifks of which I very 
much feared the poor victim would be taken, if he could 
not swim for his escape : But soon was I out of pain for 
him, when I perceived he made nothing of it, though at 
lull tide, but with an intrepid courage, spurred on by the 
sense of daBger, he plunged into the flood, swimming over 
in about thirty strokes, and then landing, ran with the 
same incredible strength and swiftness as before. When 
the three pursuers came to the creek, one of them, who I 
perceived could not swim, happily for his part, returned 
to his company, while the others, with equal courage, but 
much leas swiftness, attained the other side, as though they 
were resolved never to give over the pursuit. And now 
or never I thought was the time for me to procure me a 
servant, companion, or assistant ; and that 1 was decreed 
Jhy Providence to be the instrument to save this poor crea- 
ture’s life. | immediately descended my two ladder? w ith 
the greatest expedition ; I took up my two guns, which, I 
said before, were at the bottom of them, and getting up 
again with the same-haste towards the hill, I made nearer 
the sea. In a word, taking a short cut down the hill, I 
interposed between the pursuers and pursued, hallooing 
aloud to the latter, who, venturing to look back, was, no 
doubt, as much terrified at me as 1 at them. I beckoned 
t 4 > hun with tny hand, to return back, in the mean time 
advancing towards the pursuers,' and rushing on the fore- 
most, ;i knocked him down with the stock of my piece, 
and laid him flat on the ground. I was very unwilling to 
£re lest the rest should hear, though at a distance, ! ques- 
tioned whether they could or no ; and being out of.sight of 
the smoke, they could not easily have known what to make 
ofiit. The other savage seeing his fellow'fall, stopped aS 
if .he had been amazed ; when, advancing towards’nim, I 
could perceive him take hts bow from his back, and, Ax- 
ing an arrow to it, was preparing to shoot at me/and, with- 
cut dispute, might have lodged the arrow in my breast ; 
but, iq this absolutely necessary case of self preservation, !' 
immediately fifed at him, and shot him dead, just as his 
band was-going *to draw the fatal string. ' All this while, 
the savage who had fled before stood still, arid had the sa-

tisfaction to see his enemies killed, as he thought, wl;® ..de- 
signed to take away his life ; so affrighted was he vvithlbe 
fne and noise of my piece, that he .stood as it were, like 
;Lot’s wife, fjxed and immovable, without either sen.se or 
motion. This obliged me to halloo, to him again, making 
the plainest , signs I could to him to draw nearer. I per- 
ceived he understood those tokens by his approaching to 
me a little way, when, as if afraid l should kill him too, - 
he stopped again. Several limes did he advance, and as 
often stop in this manner, till coming more to my view, I 
perceived him trembling, as if he was to undergo the same 
fate. Upon which I looked upon him with a smiling 
countenance, and still beckoning to him ; at length h® 
came close to me and kneeled down, kissed the ground 
laid his head upon it, and taking me by the foot, set. it 
upon his head ; and this, as I understood afterwards, was 
a token of swearing to be my slave for ever.'. I took him 
up, and, making much of him, encouraged him in the 
best manner I could. But my work was not yet. finished-; 
for I perceived the , savage whom I knocked down, was 
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come 
to himself. Upon which I pointed to my new servant, and 
showed him that his enemy was not yet expired, he spoke 
some words to me, but which I could not understand ; yet 
being the first sound of a man’s voice I had heard for above 
twcnty-fh’e years, they were very pleasing to me. Bat 
there was no time for reflection now, the wounded savage 
recovering himself so far as to sit upon the ground, which 
made my poor prisoner as much afraid as before ; to put 
him out of fear, I presented my other gun at the man, with 
an intent to shoot him ; but my savage, for so I must now 
call him, prevented my firing, by making a motion to me, 
to lend him my sword, yvhich hung naked in my belt by my 
side. No sooner did I grant his request, but away he runs 
to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head as dextrously 
as the most accomplished executioner inGermany could have 
done; for, it seems, thesp creatures make use of wooden 
swords made of hard wood which will bear edge enough to 
cut off heads and arms at one blow. When this.valorous ex- 
ploit was done, he comes to me laughing, as a token of 
triumph, delivered me my sword again, with abundance of 
surprising gestures, laying it, along with the bleeding and 
ghastly head of the Indian, at ray met.

'Tfte greatest astonishment that my new servant conceived 
-eras the manHer of kflltftg the savage at sueh a distance, 
■without a bow and arrow ; and such was his longing desire 
to know it, that' he first pointed to tlie dead carcase; and 
their made signs to me to grant him leave to go to him, 
LTpon which r bade him go, and, as well as I could,. mad* 
him sensible- 1 granted, his request. But when he cam* 
-there, how wonderfully was he struck with amazement ! 
First he turned him on one side, then on another, wonder- 
ing he could perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding 
inwardly ; and after sufficiently admiring the wound the 
bullets had made in his breast, he took up his bow and ar- 
row's, and came back again : upon which I turned to go 
*way,.making my signs to him to follow, lest the rest, mis- 
sing their companions, might come ih pursuit of them, and 
this I found he understood very well ; by his making me 
understand that his'design was to bury them, that they might 
not be seen if it happened ; and which by signs again I 
made him sensible I very much approved or. Immediately 
ho fell to work, and never was grave-digger more dextrous 
in the world than he was : for in an instant, as I might say-, 
he scraped a large hole in the sand with his hands, sufficient 
to bury the-first in ; there he dragged him, and without any 
ceremony he covered him over; in like manner he served 
the other ; so that I am sure no undertaker could be more 
expert in his business ; for all this was done in less than a 
Quarter 1 df an hour. I then Called him away, and instead 
of carrying him directly to my castle at first, I conveyed him 
to my cave on the farther part of the island; and so my 
dream was now fulfilled in tiiat particular, that my grove 
should prove an asylum or sanctuary to him. 

Weary and faint, hungry and thirsty, undoubtedly must 
tjiis poor creature be) supported chiefly by the vivacity of 
spirit, and uncommon transports of joy that his deliverance 
occasioned. Here I gave him bread and a bunch oi raisin* 
to eat, and water to drink, ail which lie fed very cheerfully; 
to his exceeding refreshment. I then made him a conveni- 
ent bed with a parcel of rioe straw, and a blanket upon it* 
(n bed which I used myself sometimes) and then pointing 
to it, made signs for him to lie down to sleep, upon which 
the poor creature went to take a welcome repose. 

Indeed he was a very comely, handsome young fellow, ex* 
tremely well-made, with straight long limbs, not too laige.

but tall ami vvell-shnpcd, and, as near as I could reckon, 
about twenty-six years of age. '* His countenance had no- 
thing in it fierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty in his 
face ; and yet, especially when lie smiled, he had all the 
sweetness and softness of an European.-: His hair was not 
curled like >Vkool, as many of the blacks are, but long and 
black, with the most beautiful yet careless tresses spreading 
over his shoulders. He had a very high and large forehead, 
with a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his dves. 
H is skin was not sotawney as the Virginians, Brazilians, or 
other Americans ; but rathef of a bright dun, olive colour, 
that had something agreeable in it, though not very easy to 
give a description oh His face was round and plump, witlr 
a small nose, very different from the flatness of the ntigr.o?*, - 
a pretty small .mouth, fliin lips, fine teeth, very well set, 
and white as the driven snow. In a word, such handsome 
features, ?jid exact symmetry in every part, made me con- 
sider,’ that I had saved the life of an Indian prince, no less 
graceful and accomplished than the great Oroonoko, whose 
memorable behaviour, and unhappy contingencies of life, 
have charmed the world, both to admiration of his person, 
and compassion to his sufferings. 

But let him be either prince or peasant, all my happiness 
centered in this, that. Iliad now got a good servant or com- 
panion, to whom, as he deserved, I was resolved to prove a 
kind master and a lasting friend. He had not, I think, slept 
above an hour, when he awakened again, and while I was 
milking my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave, tow- 
ards me in my inclosure, and laying himself down on^he 
ground, in tiie lowest prostration, made all the antic gestures 
imaginable, to express his thankfulness to me for being his 
deliverer. I confess, though the manner of his bchavihur 
seemed to be ludicrous enough to occasion laughter, yet I 
was very much moved at his affection, so that my heart 
melted w ithin me, fearing he might die aw r ay in excess of 
joy, like reprieved malefactors ; especiallyas 1’Avas incapa- 
pable either to let him blood, or administer physic. It were 
Iq be wished that Christians would take example by this 
Heathen, to have a lasting remembrance of the benefits and 
deliverances they have received, by the kind mediation

ers and it. would be likewise happy for mankind, were

acknowledging favors and benefits, rather abuse and con- 
demn those who have been the instruments to save theiri 
from destruction. 

But leaving these just reflections, I return to the object 
that occasioned them ; for my man, to conclude the last 
ceremony of obedience, laid down his head again on the 

g round, close to my foot, and set niv other foot ujknrkis 
cad, as he had done before, making all the signs of subjec- 
tion, servitude, and submission imaginable, and let me uns. 
derstand he would serve me as long as his life endured. ■ ; As 
I understood him in many things, 1 made him sensible I was 
very; well pleased with him ; and, in a little time, 1 began 
to spear!; to him, and learn him to talk to me again. In the 
first place, I made him uuder^and his name was to be Fri- 
day, because it was upon that day I saved his life ; then I 
taught him to say Master, which I made him sensible was ; 
to be my name. I likewise taught him to stiy Yes and No, 
and to know what they meant. I gave him some milk in an ' 
earthen pot, making him view me while I drank it before - 
him, and soked my bread in it ; I gave him a cake of bread* 
and caused him to soak it likewise, to whith he readily con- 
sented, making signs of the greatest satisfaction imaginable. 

All that night did I keep him there ; but no sooner did 
the morning Ji^lit appear, when I ordered him to arise, and 
come along with me, with certain tokens that I would give 
him some clothes like mine, at which he seemed very glad, 
being stark naked, without the least covering whatever. — 
As we passed by the place where the two men had been ' 
interred, my man pointed directly to their graves, showing 
me the marks that lie had made to find them again, giving 
me to understand, bv signs, that we should dig them up, 
and devour them. At this I appeared extremely displeased, 
expressed my utmost abhorrence, as if 1 would vomit at the 
apprehensions of it, beckoning with my band to cotne away 
which ‘lie did. with the greatest reverence and submission. 
After this I conducted hint to the top of the hill, to view if • 
the rest of the ravages v ere yet remaining thefe ; but when 
i looked through my perspective glass, I eoiilri see no api 
peurunce of them, nor of their canoes ; so that it was very 
evident they never minded (heir deceased companions whom

Curiosity, , and a desire of satisfaction, animating me witk 
courage to sjee this scene of barbarity, 1 took my naau Fri. 
day with me, putting a sword into his hand, with the bow 
and arrows at his back, which I peref Lved be couJd use 
very dexterously, causing him to carry one gun for me, .and 
I two for myself; and thus snipped against all attacks* 
away we marched directly to the place of their bio, edy. en- 
tertainment. But when I came there, I was struek wiU* 
the utmost horror at so dreadful a spectacle, whilst Friday 
wus no way concerned about it, being no doubt in his tum 
one of these devourers. Here lay several human bones, there 
several pieces of mangled flesh, half eaten, mangled and 
scorched; whilst streams of blood ran promiscuously as 
waters from a fountain. As J was musing on this dreadful 
sight, Friday took all the pains he could, by particular 
signs, to make me understand, that they had brought over 
four prisoners to feast upon, three of whom they had eaten 
up, and that he was the fourth, pointing to himself ; that 
there having been a bloody battle between theip and bis 
great king, in the just defence of whom he was taken pri- 
soner, with many others ; all of these were carried oft - to 
different places to be devoured by their conquerors ; and 
that it was his misfortune to be brought thither by these 
wretches for the same purpose. 

After I was made sensible of these things, I caused Fri- 
day to gather those horrid remains, and lay them together 
upon a heap, which I ordered to be set on fire, and burn 
them to ashes: My roan, however, still retained the nature 
of a cannibal, having a hankering stomach after some of the 
flesh ; but such an extreme abhorrence did I express at the 
lea9t appearance of it, that he durst not but conceal it ; for 
I made him very sensible, that if he offered any such thing, 
I would certainly shoot him. 

This being done, carried my man with me to my castle, 
and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had taken 
out of the poor gunner’s cbest before mentioned ; and 
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well : in the

of the waistcbat galled his shoulders and the inside of fits 
arms ; but by a little easing where he complained they hurt- 
him, and by using himself to them, at length he took tb 
them very well. ‘ ‘ - Y 1 • 

Mv next concern was, where I should lodge him ; and * 
that I might do well by him, and yet be perfectly easy my- ’ 
self, I Erected a tent tor him in the vacant place between ' 
my two fortifications, in the inside of- the last, and the out- 
sine of the first ; and, as there was an entrance or door in- ; 
tb my*cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and-adoor 
to open on the inside ; I barred it up in the night time, ta- 
king, irr my ladders too, so that, was my manto-prove treach- 
erous, there could be no way to* conic at me in the inside ' 
of- my innermost wall, without’ making so much noise m 
* getting over, that" it must needs waken me; for my first * 
wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles, spread- 
ing over my tent, and leaning up ; to the side of the moun-t 
tain, which was again laid cross with smaller sticks instead 
of laths, and thaehed over a great thickness with the rice - 
straw, which 1 was as strong as reeds ; and at the hole of the - 
place, left on purpose to go in or out bv the ladder, had 
placed a kind of trap-door, which if it had been attempted * 
on the outside would not have opened at all* but have * 
failen dotvn. and made a great noise; and as to my wea-.- 
pons, every night I took them all to' my bed side. \ 

But there was no occasion for this precaution-; for surely »■ 
nbver master had a more sincere, faithful, ’ and loving ser- 
vant, than Friday proved to me. Without passion, sullen- 
ness, or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his affec- 
tions were as friueh tied to me, as those of a child to its 
parents; and I might venture to say, he would have sacri- 
ficed his life for the saving mine/ upon any occasion what- 
soever. And indeed the many testimonies he gave me of 
this, 'sufficiently convinced me that 1 had no occasion to use 
these precautions. And here I could not but reflect with 
great wonder, that however it hath pleased the Almighty 
in bis providence, and in the government of the creation, 
to take from so great a part Of the world of his creatures, 
the noblest uses to which their faculties, and the powers of 
their souls > are adapted; yet that he has bestowed upou

them the same reasop', affections, sentiments of kindness 
mid obligation, passions ^ resentment, sincerity, fidelity*. 
and all the capacities ui doing and receiving good that he 
.bas given us; and that when be is graciously pleased to- 
offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready* 
»ay, more ready, to apply them to the proper uses tor 
which they were bestowed, than we often are. These 
thoughts would make me melancholy, especially when I 
considered how mean a use we make of all these, even 
though we have these powers enlightened by the Holy 
Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of this world, as an 
addition to our understanding ; and why it has plea«ed the 
heavenly wisdom to conceal the like saving knowledge 
from so many millions of souk, who would certainly make 
a oiuch. better use of it than generally mankind do at this, 
time. These reflections would sometimes lead me so far,, 
as to invade the sovereignity of Providence, and, as it were, 
arraign the justice of such an arbitrary disposition; of things* 
that should obscure that light from some, and reveal it tr* 
Others, and yet expect a like duty from all. But I closed 
it up, checking my thoughts with this couclusiop ; first. 
That we were ignorant of that right and law by which 
those should be condemned ; but as the almighty was ne- 
cessarily, and by the nature of his essence, infinitely just 
and holy ; so it could not be otherwise, but that if these 
Creatures were all destined to absence from himself, it was 
•n account of sinning against that light, w'hich, as the 
Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such a rule 
as their consciences -would acknowledge to be just, though 
the first foundation was net discovered to us. And, se-

Off from this horrid way of feeding ; and to take from him 
that inhuman relish he by nature had been accustomed to, 
I thought it my duty to let him taste other flesh, which 
might the rather tempt him to the same abhorrence 1 so 
of ten expressed against their accursed way of living. Upon 
which, one morning I took him out with me, with am in- 
tention to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home, and 
dress it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying

^ Immediately I catched hoht of my man Friday, and bidding 
him stand stild, and not stir, I presented my piece, and shot 
•i*ione of the kids. My poor servant, who at adrstutiec per* 

, ceived me. kill- his adversary, and yet did not know by what 
i , means, or how it was done, stood trembling and surprised,, 
v- and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk. 

Z into the earth. He did not see tire kid I aimed at,. on be- 
hold 1 had killed it, but ripped up hi* waistcoat to^ see if He. 
v was not wounded, thinking my resolution was to kill him ; 
for coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnestly pronoun- 
cing many things which I did not understand the meaning 
- of; which at length 1 perceived was,, that I would not 
• » take away his life. >• • . 

indeed I was much’ concerned to see him in that con- 
4 .' dition, where nature is upon the severest trial, w lien the 
immediate hand of death is ready to put for ever a period ' 
. to this mortal life ; and indeed so much compassion had I 

• to this creature, that it was with difficulty 1 refrained from 
i ■> tears. But, however, as another sort of countenance was 

accessary, and to-, convince him that I would do him no 
r harm, I took him, smiling by the hand, then laughing at 
him, and pointing to the kid which 1 had slain, made signs 
to him. to fetch it, which accordingly he did. No less cu- 
c nous was he in viewing how the creature was kified, than 
he had been before in beholding tire Indian ; which, while 
he was admiring at, I charged my gun again,-, and presently 
r* •- perceived a great fowl like a hawk, perchirtgupona tree 
, within shot; and, therefore, to let Friday understand what 
i Was going to do, I called him to me again, pointing at the 
fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I made him under- 
stand that I would shoot and kill that bird ? accordingly I 
fired, and bade him look, when immediately he saw the 
pafrrot fall down. Again he stood like one amazed, not- 
withs tending all I had said to him : and the more confound- 

• ed he was, because be did not perceive me put any thing 
into ray gun. Undoubtedly a thing so utterly strange, 
carrying death along with it, far or near; either to man or 
beast, must certainly create the greatest astonishment to one 
who never had heard such a thing in his Whole life ; and 
really his amazement continued so long, that had I allowed

• with the greatest worship, and adoration. As for the gun

in particular, he wouldnot so much as touch it for several 
da) s after, but wquld come and communicate his thoughts 
to it, and talk to it, as it the senseless piece had understood 
and answered him.; all this I could perceive him do, when 
he thought my back was turned, the chief intent of which 
was, to desire it not to kill, him, as I afterwards came 
to. understand. . 

I never strove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder him 
from those comical gestures he used on such occasions ; but- 
when his astonishment was a little over, I made tokens to • 
him to run and letch the parrot that 1 had shot ; which - 
accordingly he did, staying some time longer than usual, by' 
reason the bird not being quite dead, had fluttered some- 
way further from the place where she fell- In the mean 
time, as he was looking 'for her, . I. took the advantage of 
charging. m v gun again, so that I - might be. ready, for any. 
other mark that oifered ; bat nothing more- occurred at that 
lime. So I brought home the kid, and the same evening * 
took off the skin, and divided the carcase. as. well as IcOuld. 
Part of the flesh I stewed and boiled in a pot I liad for this • 
purpose. And, then, spreading my table, I sat down; giv- 
ing my man some of it to eat, who was wonderfully pleased • 
and seemed to like it. very well • but what. was the most i 
surprising to him was to see. me eat salt with it : upon < 
which he made me understand, that the salt -was very bail 
for. me ; when putting a little into his mouth, he seemed to 
nauseate it in such a manner, as to. spit and sputter at it; .. 
and then washed his mouth .with fresh water : but to show 
him .how contrary his opinion was to mine, 1 pu-t some 
meat into my mouth without salt, and feigned to spit and • 
sputter as much for the want -of it, as. -he had done -at it ; 
yet all this proved of no signification to JFriday ; and it was 
a long while before he could endure salt in his>meat or broth, . 
arid even then but a small quantity. . ■ . - . . - ■ . . 

Thus having fed him sufficiently with boiled meat and 
brotb at that time, the next day I was resolved to feast him < 
with a roasted piece of the kid. And having no spit to 
fasten it, nor jack to turn it, 1 made use of that common 
artifice which many of the com raon-jvople of England have, .« 
that is to set two poles upon each side of the fire, and

string, and so turning round continually, roast it, in the 
same mannqr as we read bloody tyrants of old cruelly roast-

ed the holy martyrs. This practice caused great admira- 
tion in tfiy man Friday, being quite another way than that 
to which the savages were accustomed. But when he came 
to taste the sweetness and tenderness erf’ the flesh, he ex- 
pressed- bis entire satisfaction above a thousand different 
ways. And as I could not but understand his meaning, you 
may be sure I was as wonderfully pleased, especially when 
he made it also very plain to me, that lie would never, 
while he lived, eat man’s flesh more. 

it was now high time 1 should set my servant to work; 
,so next .day 1 set him to beat out some corn, and sift it in 
the same manner as I had done before. And really the fol- 
low was very quick and handy in the execution of any 1 thing 
1 ordered him to go about. I made him understand that it 
was to. make bread for m to eat, and afterwards let him see 
me make it. In short, he did every thing as I ordered him, 
and in a little time as well as I could perform it myself. 

Ifot now considering that I had two mouths to feed in- 
stead of one, it was necessary that I must provide more 
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn 
than I commonly used to do. |n upon which 1 marked out a 
larger piece of land, fencing it in, in /he same manner as 
.1 had done before ; in the execution of which I must give 
Friday this good word, that no mau could work more hardy, 
•of with better will than he did ; and when I made him sen- 
sible that it was for bread to serve him as well as me, he 
then very passionately made mp understand, that he thought 
I had much more labour on his account, than I had for ray- 
self j and that no pains or diligence should be wanting in 
him, if i would but direct him in those works wherein he 
■might proceed. 

I must .certainly own, that this was the most pleasant year 
I ever had in the island ; for aftor some time, Friday began 
to talk pretty well, and understood the names of those things . 
which X was wont to call for, and the places where I used 
to send him. So that my long silent tongue, which had been 
useless so many years, except in an exclamatory manner, 
either for deliverance or blessings, now began to be occupi- 
ed in teaching, and talking to my man Friday ; for indeed ' 
I had .such a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself, so- * 
innocent did his simple and unfeigned honesty appear mono 
and more .to me every day, that I really began. entirely to 
love him; and for his part, 1 believe there was no. love lost

and that his r.alure had been more charmed by his exceed*, 
ing kindness, and his affections more placed upon me, thafc 
any other object whatsoever among his own countrymen. 

1 once had a great mind to try if lie had any hankering in- 
clination to his own country again ; and by this time having 
learned the English so well, that he could give me tolerable 
answers to any question which I demanded. 1 asked him. 
whether that nation to which he belonged, ever conquered 
in battle ? This question made Friday to smile, and to which 
he answered, “ Yes) yes, we always tight the better as 
much as to say, they always got the better in tight. Upon 
which we proceeded on tfie following discourse: You say, 
said I, that y ou always fight the better ; why, then, Friday, 
how came ymu to be taken prisoner ? 

Friday. It ut for all that, my nation beat much. 

Muster. How say you, beat * if your nation beat them, 
how came y ou to be taken ? 

Friday. They more many mans than my nation in the 
place whore me was ; they take one, two, three, and me : 
my nation much over beat them in the yonder place where 
me no was, there my nation mans beat one, two, three great 
leu sand. :i , 

Master. Then why did not your men recover you from 
the hands of your enemies ? 

Friday. .They run one, two, or three, and me: they make 
all go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. . 

Master-. ’Tis very well, Friday; but what does your 
nation do w ilh the prisoners they take ? Do they carry them 
away and eat them as these have done ? 

Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eats mans too, eat up all. 

Master. To what placedotheycarry them to be devoured? 

Friday. Go to other nations where they think. 

Master. Do they bring them hither ? 

Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other place. 

Master. And have you been with them here, Friday? 

Friday. Yes, me been here, ( pointing to He north-vest of 
the island, heiny the side where they used to hind.) 

Thus having gotten what account 1 couid from my man, 
1 plainly understood, that he had been as bad as any of the 
rest of the cannibals, having been formerly among the sa- 
vages who used to come on shore on the farthest part of the 
island, upon the same bloody occasion as he was brought 
hither for ; and some time after I carried him t© that place

where he pointed ; and no sooner did he cdihe there, but 
he presently knew the ground, signifying to the that he was 
©neb there when they ate up twenty men, two women, and 
a yOung child: but' as he could not explain tbO number in 
English, he did it by So many stones in a row, making a 
Sign to mi£ to count’ them. ‘ ' 

This passage I have the rather mentioned, becUintfe it led 
to things more important and useful for me to know; for 
after I frad the Satisfactory discourse with him, thy next 
Question was, how far it was from the island to the shore, 
and whether the ranoes'were not often lost in' the ocean 5 ? 
to which lie answered, there was no danger ; that no canoes, 
were ever lost ; but that after a little way out to the sea, 
there wa'S a strong current, and a wind always one way in 
the afternoon. This I thought at first to be no more than 
the set£of the tide/ of going out or coming in ; but I after- 
wards understood it was occasioned by the . great draught 
and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or 

f jalph’of which I imagined my kingdom lay ; and that the 
and which I perceived to the W. or N. W. must be the 
great island Trinidad, on the north of the river. A thou- 
sand questions (if that W^uld satisfy me) did I ask Friday,- 
about the nature of the v untry, the sea, the coasts, the in-' 
habitants-, and what nations were nearest them ; to which 
questions the poor fellow declared all he knew", with the 
greatest openness, and utmost sincerity. When I demand- 
ed of him the particular names of the various nations of his 
sort of people, he could only answer me in general, that 
they wfere called Carrabce. Hence it was I considered that 
these must be the Carrabees, so much taken notice of by 
our maps, to be on that part of America, which reaches 
from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guianio, and so 
on to St. Martha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that 
up a great way beyond the moon, as much as to say, be- 
yond the setting of the moon, which must be W. from their 
country, there dwelt white bearded men, such as I was, 
pointing to my whiskers, and that they kill much man a. I 
was not ignorant with what barbarity the Spaniards treated 
these creatures ; so that I presently concluded it must be 
them, whose cruellies had spread .throughout America, to 
be remembered even to succeeding generations. 

Well, you may be sure, this ^knowledge, which the im- 
perfect knowledge of my man had led me to, was' very

comfortable to me, and made me so curious as to ask him 
how I might depart from this island, and get amongst those 
white men ? He told me, “ Yes, yes* I might go in two 
canoes.” In two canoes, thought I, what does my man 
mean ? surely he means one for himself, and another for me; 
and if not, how must two canoes hold me without being 
joined, or one part of my body being put in one, and ano- 
ther inanoflier r And indeed it was a long time before I 
understood his meaning, which was, that it must be a large 
boat, as big as two canoes, able to bear with the waves, and 
not so liable, to be overwhelmed as a small one must be. ' 

I believe there is no state of life but what may be happy,, 
if people would but endeavour for their parj to make it so. 
He is not the happiest man that has the most riches ; but he 
that is content with- what he hath, before I had ray ser- 
vant, I thought my self miserable till I had him-; and now that 
I had enjoyed the happy benefits of him, I still complained* 
and begged a -deliverance from a place of retirement, ease, 
and plenty, where Providence had sufficiently blessed me. 
In a word, from this time I entertained some hopes, that 
one time or other I might find an opportunity to make my 
escape from this island, and that this poor savage might be 
s great furtherance thereto. 

All the time since my man became so intelligent as tour** 
derstand and speak to me, I spared no pains nor diligence 
to instruct him, according to my poor share- of knowledge 
in the principles of religion,, and the -adoration that he ought 
to pay to the True God. One time,, as I very well remem- 
ber, I asked him who made him ? At first the innocent 
creature did not understand what 1 meant, but- rather thought 
I asked him who was his father ? upon which I took ano- 
ther way to make him sensible, by demanding from-him ait 
answer to this question. Friday, said I, who is it that made 
the sea, this ground whereon we walk, and all these hdls 
and woods which we behold ? And- here, indeed, I did not 
miss my intention ; for he told me it was Old Benamuckee 
(the^Sod whom I supposed these savages adored) who lived 
a great way beyond all. But as to his attributes, poor: Fri- 
day was an utter stranger. He could describe nothing of 
this great person ; and all that he could say was, that he 
was very old, much older than the sea and -land, the moon* 
or the stars. Friday, said I again, if this great and old per- 
son Iras made all things in the world, howcomesit to pass, 



«#JP ROBtSSUS CRUSOfc. 1QI 

■that ail things, as ynni.in particular, do not adore and wor- 
ship ldmiupon tins looking very grave. With a perfect 
sweet lo<)k;Ot innocence, he replied, “ Master all things say 
O to, him,” by which it may be reasonably supposed he 
meant adoration. Anil where, said l, do the people of your 
country go when they die s He answered to Bcmnmckce: 
What, , and those people that are eaten up, d© they go there? 
" fic-Jtanntokee ,’’ -said he,; “love 'em dearly; irie pray to 
V Bcnmuxecktt in de canoe, and Beuamucka: would love me 
^.whendey eat me all up.” ■ . , 

Such discourses as these had I with my man, and such 
made me sensible, that the true God is worshipped, though 
under imperfect similitudes and that the false adoration 
which tin; Heathens give to their imaginary Deity, is as 
.great an argument of the divine essence, as the most learned 
Atheists (jalsdy so cuiled) can bring against it; for God 
will be glorified in bis works, let their denomi nation be 
what it will; and I cannot bfe of that opintou which some 
dpuceive, that God should decree men to be damned for 
W ant of a right notion of faith, in a place where the wisdom 
Of the Almighty has not permitted it to be preached ; and 
therefore cannot but conclude, that dnoc obedience is the 
best sacrifice, these poor creatures, acting by that light and* 
knowledge which they are possessed of, may undoubtedly 
obtain a happy salvation, though not that enjoyment with 
Chi ist, as his, saints, confessors, amfmartyrt must enjoy. 

But laying these determinations aside* more fit for di vine* 
than me to discuss, I began to instruct my servant in the; 
saving knowledge of the true Deity, in which the directions 
of God’s Holy Spirit assisted me. I lifted up my hands to 
Heaven, and pointing thesefo, told him, that the great 
Maker of Heaven and Earth lived there ; that as his infinite? 
power fashioned this world out of a confused chaos, and 
made it in that beautiful frame which we behold, so he- 
governs ami preserves it by his unbounded knowledge, 
sovereign greatness, and peculiar providence ; that he was 
omnipotent, could do every tiling for us give every tiling to 
us, and take every thing away from us ; that he was a re- 
warder and punisher of good and evil actions; that there was 
nothing but what he knew, no thoughts so secret but what he' 
could bring to light ; and thus by degrees l opened his eyes, 
and described, to him the manner of the creation of the

world, the situation of paradise, the transgression of our 
first parents, the wickedness of God’s peculiar people, and 
the universal sins and abominations of the whole earth- — 
When these things were implanted in his mind, I told him, 
-that as God’s justice was equal to his mercy, he resolved to 
destroy this world, till his Soil Jesus Christ interposed in our 
behalf ; and, to procure our redemption, obtained leave of 
hfs heavenly Father to come down from Heaven into the 
world, where he took human nature upon him, instructed' us 
in our way to eternal life, and died as a sacrifice for our sins ; 
that he was now ascended into Heaven, mediating for bur 
pardon, delivering our petitions, and obtaining all those good 
benefits which we ask in his name, by humble and hearty 
prayers, all which were heard at the throne of Heaven. — ■ 
As very frequently I used to inculcate things into his mind; 
Friday, one dayUold me, that if our great God could hear 
us bevond the sun, he ! mast surely be a greater God than 
their Benamuckee, Who lived but a little way off, and yet 
could not hear them till they ascended the great mountains 
where he dwelt to speak to him. What, said I, Friday, 
did you go thither to speak to him too' ? He answered, 
" No, they never went that were young men, none but old 
** men, called their Ocfteukabee,” meaning the Indian priests, 
“ who went to say O, (so he called saying their prayers) 
“ and they returned back, and told them what Bvmnuickee 
“ said.” From hence, I could not but observe how happy 
we Christians are, who have God’s immediate revelation 
for our certain guide ; and that our faith is neither misled, 
nor our reason imposed upon, by any set of men, such as 
these Indian impostors. 

But, to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Friday, I 
told him, that the pretence of their ancient men going up 
to the mountain to say O to their God Benamuckee, was an 
imposture, and that their bringing back an answer was all 
a sham, if not worse ; for that, if there was any such thing 
spoken to them, surely it must proceed from an infernal 
spirit. And here I -thought it necessary to enter into a long 
discourse with him, which I did after this manner. 

Friday, said I, you must know, that before this world 
was made, there was an Almighty power existing, by whose 
power all things were made, and whose Majesty shall have 
tto end. To be glorified and adored by beings of a heaven- 
ly nature, he created angels and archangels, that is glorified

duty he owed his heavenly. Sovereign, with unbounded 
ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not only-envied him that 
adoration which was his due, but thought to usurp that 
throne, which he had neither power to keep, nor title to pre- 
tend to. He raised a dissention and civil war in Heaven, 
and had a, number of angels to take his. part. Unbounded

The recital .of this: truth made my man give the greatest 
attention, and he expressed a great satisfaction- by his ges- 
tures, that God had sent. the devil into the deep hole.— 
And then I desired hfat to give great heed to what 1 had 
farther to say, . 

No sooner, proceeded I, was God freed from, and the

as great and powerful a* he. Upon which she not only eat 
thereof hersflf, but made her husband eat also, w hich brought 
them both under the heavenly displeasure. 

* HcreFriday expressed agreat concern : “Ah, poor man's!" 
cried he, " naughty womans ! naughty devil ! make God 
“ not love de mans, make mans like devil himself.” 

Friday, said I, God still loved mankind, and though the 
devil tempted human nature so far, he would not suffer him 
to have an absolute pow er over them. 1 have told you be- 
fore of his tender love to his people, tilt they, like Lucifer, 
disobeyed his commands and rebelled against him ; and 
even then, how Jesus Christ, his only Son, came to save 
sinners. But still every man that lives in the world is un- 
der temptation and trial. The Devil has yet a power, as 
prince of the air, to suggest evil cogitations in our minds, 
and prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory m 
eur destruction. Whatever evil thoughts we have^proceed 
from him ; so that God, in this our distress, expects we 
should apply ourselves to him by fervent prayer lor speedy- 
redress. lie is not like Benuvtuckee , to let none come near 
him but Oouakakee, bui suffers the people as well as priests 
to offer themselves at his feet, thereby to be delivered from- 
the power and temptation of the devil. 

But though at first my man Friday expressed some con- 
cern at the wickedness of Lucifer, 1 found it not so easy t» 
imprint the right notions of him in his mind, as it was about 
the divine essence of God ; for there nature assisted me in 
all my arguments, to show to him plainly the necessity of a 
Great First Cause, and overruling, governing power, of a 
secret directing Providence, and . of the equity and reason- 
ableness of paying adoration to our Creator ; w hereas there 
appeared nothing of ail this in the notion of an evil spirit, 
«f his first bpginping, bis nature, and, above all, of his in- 
clination to evil actions, and his power to tempt us to the 
like. And, indeed thj$ unlearned Indian, by the mere force 
of nature, puzzled me vvith one particular' question, more 
than ever I could hayp expected. ..... 

I had, it seems, one day, been talking to him of the om- 
nipotent power of Cod’, and his infinite abhorrence of sin, 
inscinuch that the Scriptures styled him a consuming fire to 
all the workers of iniqujty ; and that it was in his power.

whenever he pllfiised, to destroy all the world" in a moment, 
the greater part of which are continually* offending him. 

When, with a serious attention, he had listened a great 
white to what 1 said; after I had been telling him how the - 
devil* was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all 
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence, 
and destroy the kingdom of Christ in the world, and so 
forth : " Very well, Master,” said: Friday, " you say God is 
" so strong, so great, is he not much strong, much mightier 
" than the naughty devil Y* To be sure, Friday, said I, God 
is more wise and stronger than the serpent : lie is above t|ie 
devil, whiclr makes us pray to him, that he would tread down 
Satan under his feet, enable us to resist' the violent tempta- 
tions, amd quench his fiery darts. “ Why then,” answered 
Friday quickly, " if God, as you say, has much strong, much 
" might as the devil, why God no kill devil, make no more 
"tempt; no more do wicked.” 

You may be certan, I was strangely surprised at this ques- 
tion of my man’s : and, though an old man, I was but a 
young doctor, and consequently very ill qualified for a cau- 
suist, or a resolver of intricate doubts in religion, and as it 
required some time for me to study for an answer, I pre- 
tended not to hear him;- nor to ^sk him what he said ; but, 
so earnest was he for an answer, as not to forget his question, 
which he repeated; in the very same broken words as above. 
When- 1 had recovered myself a little, Friday, said I, God 
will at last punish him severely, being reserved for judg- 
ment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to remain iu 
fire everlasting. But all this did not. satisfy Friday ; for, 
returning upon me, he repeated my words, “ reserve at 
“ iast, me no understand ; but, why not kill devil now, 
'"not kill devil, great, great while ago ?” Friday, said I, you 
may as* well ask me why God does not kill' you and me, 
when, by our wicked actions, we so much oftend his divine 
Majesty i He gives us time to repent of our sins, that therer 
by we may obtain pardon At these words obtain pardon , 
Friday mused a great while ; and, at last, looking me sted- 
fhstly in the face, " Well, well,” said'lle, " that’s very well ; 
-so you, J, devil, all wicked mans, all preserve, repent; 
"God pardon all. ' : I ^ > 

Indeed, here I was run down to tbe’last exTretnify^ when 
rt became very -"evident to me, how' mere natural notions

will guide reasonable creatures to the kuogdftdge of a Deity, 
and to the homage due to the Supreme Being of God ; but, 
hoWever, nothing but divine revelation can form the know- 
ledge of Jesus Christ, and of t a redemption purchased for 
us, of the mediator of the new covenant,, and of an inter- 
cessor at the footstool of God’s throne ; and, therefore, the 
Gospel of our Lord and Saviour. Jesus Christ ; that is, the 
'word and spirit of God, promised for the guide and. sancti- 
fier of his people, are the most, necessary instructors of the 
souls of men, in the saving-knowledge yt the Almighty, and 
the means to attain elefnal happiness. , . , , 

And now I found it necessary to put an end to this dis- 
course between m y man and me; for whiclppurpose I rose 
up hastily, and made .as if 1 had some occasion to go out, 
rending Friday for something that was a good way off. I 
then fell on my knees, ahd beseeched God that he w r ould 
inspire me so far as to guide this poor savage in the know- 
ledge of Christ, to answer his questions more clearly, >hat 
his conscience might be convinced, his eyes opened, and 
his soul saved. When he returned again, . I entered into a 
very long discourse with him, upon the subject of the world’s 
redemption by tlje Saviour of it, and the doctrine of repent- 
ance preached, from Heaven, together with an holy faith 
cf our blessed Redeemer Jesus Christy and then 1 proceed- 
ed to explain to him, according to my weak capacity, the 
reason why our Saviour took not on s liim the nature of angels 
but rather the seed of Abraham ; and how the fallen angek. 
had no benefit by that redemption.; and, lastly, that he came 
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like. — 
God knows 1 had more sincerity than knowledge in all the 
ways I took for the poor Indian’s instruction ; and I must 
' acknowledge what I believe, every body that acts upon the- 
same principle will find, that in laying heavenly truths open 
before him, I informed and, instructed myself in many things 
that either Fdid not know, -or had not perfectly considered 
before ; so that, however this poor creature might be im- 
proved by my instructions, certain it is, that I myself had 
great rca«pn to be thankful to Providenceibr sending him 
to me. II is company allayed my grief, and made my ha- 
bitation comfortable ; and when 1 reflected that the solitary 
life to which I had been so long confined, lmd made me to 
look further towards Heaven, by making me the instrument 
under Providence, to save the life, and, for ought I know.

the soul of this poor savage, by bringing him to the know* 
ledge of Jesus Christ, it caused a secret joy to spread through 
every part -of ray soul; and I frequently rejoiced, that ever 
I was brought to this place, which £ once thought the most 
miserable part of the world. 

In this thankful frame df mind did I afterwards continue, 
while I abode on the island, and for three years did my 
jnanand I live in the greatest enjoyment of happiness. In- 
deed, I believe the savage was as good a Christian as I ; 
and I hope we were equally penitent; and such penitents 
as were comforted ami restored by God’s Holy Spirit ; far . 
now we had the word of the Lord to instruct us in the right 
wav, as much as if we had been on the English shore. 

By the constant application I made to the Scriptures, as 
I read them to my man Friday, I earnestly endeavoured to 
make him understand every part oftL as much as lay in my 
.power. He- also, on the other hand, bv his Very, serious 
questions and inquiries, made me a much better proficient 
in Scripture knowledge, than I should have been by mv 

- own private reading and study. I must not omit another 
•thing, proceeding from the experience I had in my retire- 
ment : It was that infinite and inexpressible blessing, the 
knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, which was so plain 
and easy to be understood, as immediately to direct me to 
carry on the great work of sincere repentance for my sinsj 
and laying hold of a Saviour for eternal life, to a practical 

•" stated reformation, and obedience to all God’s institutions, 
withOutthe assistance of a reverend and orthodox divide y 

- and especially by this same instruction, so to enlighten this 
■a vage creature, as to make him so good a Christian, as very 
few could exceed him. And there was only this great thing 
wanting, that 1 had no authority to administer the Holy ba- 
cramenty that heavenly participation of Christ’s body and 
blood ; yet, however, we rested ourselves content, that God 
would accept our desires, and according to our faith, havq 
mercy Oh iis. > ,jC) r 

- * But w*hat we wanted one Way, was made tip in another,' 
and that was universal peace in our little church. We had 
no disputes and wranglings about the iiatitre and equality of 

’ the hory, -blessed, and' undivided Trinity ; no niceties irr 
dodrine, or schemes of church government; no sour or 
morose dissenters to impose more sublimated notions upon 
us ; no pcdaist soplustcrs to confound us with unintelligible

mysteries: hut instead of all this, we enjoyed! the. most cer- 
tain guide to Heaven*; that is, the word of God ; besides 
which, wp had the comfortable views of his Spirit leading 
Us to th? truth* and making, «s both willing awl obedient to 
the instruction of his word. A? the knowledge and prac- 
tice of this are the 'principal means of salvation, I cannot see 
What it avails arty Christian church, or man. in the world, 
to amuse himself with speculations and opinions, except it 
be to display their; particular vanity and affectation. 

You may well suppose, that, by the frequent discourse we 
had together, my man and I- became most intimately ac- 
quainted, and that there was but very little that Icouklsay, 
biit what Friday understood ; and, indeed, he spoke very 
J^uenlly, though, if was but broken English. I now took a 
particular pleasure in relating all my adventures, especially 
those that occurred since my being cast on this island. I 
made him understand that wonderful mystery,, as he con- 
ceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to 
shoot. I also presented to lum a knife, which pleased him 
exceedingly, making him a belt, with a frog, hanging, there- 
to, like those in which we wear hangers in England ; and; 
instead of a hanger to put in the frog, I gave him a hatchet, 
which w’as not only as good, but even abetter weapon upon 
many occasions. In a word, mv man thus accoutred, look- 
ed upon himself as- great as Don Quixote, when that cele- - 
brated champion went to combat the windmill. 

I next gave him a very particular description of the ter- 
ritories of Europe, and in a particular manner of Ohi Eng- 
land, the place of my nativity. I laid. before -him the man- 
lier of our worshipping God, our behaviour one. to another, 
and how we trade in ships to every part of the universe.— - 
I.then told him my misfortunes in being shipwrecked, show- 
ing, as near as I could, the place where the slap lay* which 
bad . been gone long before ; but I brought him to the Irwins 
of my boat, which before my whole strength, could not move, 
but now was almost rotten, and fallen to pieces. I observed 
my man Friday to view this boat with an uncommon cu- 
riosity ; which, when he had done, he stood; pondering a 
great while, and said nothing. At last, sard I, Friday, what 
makes you ponder so much ? He replied; “ O master, roe 
see like boat come to place at my nation.”' 

It vva . some time, indeed,, before I understood what ray 
man meant ; lute<\aininiog strictly into it, I plainly* found.

that such another boat resembling mine, had come upon the 
country where he dwelt; that is to say, by his farther explana- 
tion, that the boat was driven there through stress ot weather. 
It then came into my mind that some European ship having 
been cast away, the poor distressed creatures were forced 
to have recourse to the boat to save their lives ; and being 
411, as I thought, drowned, I never concerned myself to a k 
any thing concerning them, but my only enquiry was about 
the boat, and whatdescription my man could give of it. 

Indeed, Friday answered my demands very well, making 
every thing very plain to my understanding ; but beyond 
measure was I satisfied, when he told me with great warmth 
and ardour, “ O master, we save white mans from drown 
upon which I immediately asked him, if there were anv 
white mans, as he called them, in the boat* “ Yes, yes, 
said he, *' the boat full, very full of white mans.” How 
many, Friday ? said I. Hereupon he numbered his fingers, 
and counted seventeen. And when I asked him what be- 
came of them all, and whether they lived or not 'f he replied, 
r * Yes, master, they all live, they De live among my natiori.” 
This information put fresh thoughts into my head, that these - 
must be those very men wlio before I concluded had been 
swallowed up in the ocean, after they had left the ship, that - 
had struck upon die rocks of my kingdom, and after escapj 
ing the fury of the deep, landed upon the wild shore, ajid 
committed themselves to the fury of the devouring Indiahs. 

The manner ot their cruelties' to one another, which con* 1 
sequenlly, as I thoaght, must beaded with greater barbarity’ 
to strangers, created in me a great anxiety, and made roe 
srill more curious to ask Friday concerning them. He told- 
me, he was sure they still lived there, having resided among 
them above four years, and that die savages gave diem vie** 
tuals to live upon ; But pray, Friday, said 1, whence pro- 
ceeded all this good nature and generosity ? How came it 
to pass that they did not kill and eat them, to please their 
devouring appetites, and occasion so splendid an entertain- 
ment among them ? “ No, no," said Friday, “ they not kill 
'em, they make brothers with ’em by which I Understood* 
there was a truce between them. And then I had a more 
favourable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday uttering 
these words : *' My nation, t’other nation no eat manV but 
when mans make war light :’’ as though he had said, that 
neither those of his kingdom, nor any other nations that he

V new of, ever ate thpir fellow-creature^, but such as their, 
law of arms allowed to be devoured ; that is, those misera-. 
ble captives, whose misfortune it should bq tq be made pri- 
soners of war. 

Some considerable time after, upon a very pleasant day, 
in most serene weather, my man and I. stood upon the top 
of a hi!!, on the east side of the island, whence 1 had once 
before beheld the continent of America. I could not tell 
immediately what was the matter; for suddenly Friday fell; 
a jumping and dancing as if he had been mad; and upon, 
ipy demanding the reason of his behaviour, “O joy, " said, 
he, " O glad ! there sqe my country, tliere my nation, tfiqr^- 

V li,ve white mans gether.” And indeed such a rapturous, 
sense ol pleasure appealed m his countenance, that his eyo% 

v had an uncommon sparkling and brightness,, apd. such 
strange eagerness, as if be had a longing desire to be. in h& : 
country again. This made me not so well satisfied whltr 
my man Friday as before; for by thjs. appearance, I. 
no dispute, but that if he could* get back tbhlter.Pgftm, he. 
would not only be unmindful of what religion. I had taught 
him, but likewise of the great epl.igafioft he ctyvad for - 
his wonderful deliverance^ nay, that be would npt oidy in- 
form his country men of me, but accompany hundreds of the in- 
to my‘ kingdom, and make me a miserable sacrifice likei 
tl ose unhappy wretches taken in battle. 

Indeed I was very much to blame to have those cruel and 
Unjust, suspicions* and must freely own f wiongqd the poor 
crqatyrfe very much, who vya* qf,%, (piitv contrary, temper. 
And bad he had that discerning, acuteness which many Eu- 
ropeans have, he' would eerttfinly have perceived my cold- 
ntsr and indifference,, and also have been vpry much cp&- 
Cernecl upon that account: as I was novv mm'O circumspect, 
I, lrad much lessened my kindness and familiarity with him,. 
$nd while, this jealousy continued, I used that artful way 
(now too much in fashion., the occasion, of stiife and tlisseii-

yyas deceitful in his thoughts and inclinations ; but certainly 
fee had nothing in him biUyvbaf; was corisistent with. the best 
principles* but a? a religious Chri^t-ian and a grateful friend; 
and , indeed, I found e very thing he said was ingenuous and 
innocent, that I had no room for suspicion, and, in spite of 
3)1, uneasiness, he not only made me entirely his otkn again,

* As we were walking up the same hill another day, whea 
the weather was so hazy at sea, ( that I could not perceive 
the continent, Friday, said I, don’t you wish yourself to be 
in your own country, your nation, among your old friends 
ana acquaintances ? ** Yes,” said he, " me much O glad to 

be at my own nation.” And vvhat would you do there, 
Friday ? Would you turn wild again, eat man’s flesh, amt 
be as savage as you Were formerly ? "No, no,” (answered 
he, full of concern, and Shaking his head) " Friday now tell 

* them to live good, toll tliOm pray God, tell them to eat 
' 4t com bread, cattle, flesh, milk, no eat man again.” But 
surely, replied I, if you should offer to do all this, they will kill 
you ; and to manifest their contempt of such instruction eat 
you up when they have done. He then put on a grave, 
yet innocent and smooth countenance, saying, " No, they 
** no kill ine, they willing love learn:” that is, that they, 
would be vefy willing to learn: adding withal, " that they; 
** had learned much of the bearded mans that came in the 
boat.” Will you, said I, go back again, Friday ? He 
smiled at that, and told me; that h6 could not swim so far. 
But said I, I will make a canoe for you. "Yes, master,” 
said he, "me go if you go, me no go if you stay.” I go, 
Friday ! why would you have them to eat me up, and de- 
vour your kind master ? " No, no,” said he; " me make, 
■*' them noteat master, and me make them much love vou 
that is, he would tell them how I had slain his enemies, andj 
thereby saved his life, for which reason he would make theipi 
•love me: and then he related to me, as well as he was able,! 
how exceedingly kind those of his nation. were to the white, 
or bearded men, as lie called them, who, in their great cala-. 
mity, were driven into their country. 

It was from this time, indeed, 1 had strong inclinations to 
venture over, and use my utmost efforts, if possible, to join 
these white bearded men, who undoubtedly were Spaniards 
or Portuguese ; for, thought I, it must certainly be a better 
and safer way to escape when thyre is a good company, tlian 
for me alone, from an island forty miles off the shore, and 
without any assistance. Some days after, Friday and I be- 
ing at work, as usual, at the same time diverting ourselves 
with various discourses, I told him I had' a boat which I 
would bdstovV tijitfn him, whenever lie pleased to return to 
his own nation ; and to convince Jitm of the truth of vvhat I 
•sard, I look huh with me to the Other side of the island, where

mv frigate lay, and then taking it from under the \vater,(tnr 
t always kept it sunk lor fear of a discovery) we went both 
into it to see "how it would manage such an expedition. 

Aral really never could any be more dextrous in rowing 
than my faithful servant, making the boat go as ia& again as 
J'couldi Well now, Friday, said I, shall we now go to 
your so much admired nation r But instead of meeting with 
that cheerfulness I expected, he looked very dull and me* 
lancholv at my spying so; which indeed at first surprised 
hie, till he made me sensible, that his concern was aboirt 
the boat’s being t<x> small to go so far a voyage. Upon 
which I let him understand I had a much bigger ; and, ac- 
cordingly, the next day went to the place where the first 
boat lay, which 1 had made, when all the strength 1 had or 
art l could Use failed me in my attempt to get it into the 
water : but now it having lain in the sun two and twenty 
years, and no care being taken of it all that while,Jt became 
in a manner rotten. My man told me, that such a boat 
would do very well for the purpose, sufficient to carr^ 
enough rill lr, drink, braid, for that was his manner ot talking. 
In short, my mind being strongly fixed upon my design of 
going over with him to the Continent, 1 very plainly told 
him, that we would both go and make a boat full as big, and 
more proportionable than that, w herein he might .safe/v re- 
turn to his own nation. 

These words made Friday look so very pensive, that I 
thought lie would have fallen at my .feet. It was some time 
before he could speak a word, w hich marie me ask him w hat 
was the matter with him } He replied in a very soft and 
moving tone, “ W hat has poor Friday clone r why pre yog 
n angry mad with poor Servant? What me done, Q what 
“me done r” Friday, .saicKJ, you never yet have offended 
die, what makes you think 1 am angry w ith you, when l am 
not angry at all. “ You no angry, no angry,” said be, several 
times; " if you be no angry, why den send Friday oyer 
great water to my own nation ?” Wjiy, 'surely, Friday, an- 
swered 1, did not you wish to be there, when from a moun- 
tain you beheld the place where you w as born r and is it 
not to satisfy your desires that I am willing to give you 
leave to return thither ? “ Yes, yes,” said Friday, “ me wish 
“ to be there sure enough, but then me wish master the;e 
“ too: no wish Friday there, no mastef there.” In short,* 
he could r,Ot .endure the thoughts of going thqre without n^e. 


• P ROBINSON CRUSOC. 


113 

I go there ! Friday, said I, what shall I do there ? He an- 
swered very quickly, “ O master, you do great deal much 
“ good, you teach all de wild mans to be good tame mans : 
“ you learn dem to be sober, life good live, to know God, 
“ and pray God.” Alas ! poor Friday, said I, what can I 
do against their priests of Benamuckee, or indeed what 

f ood can 1 make your nation sensible of, when I myself am 
ut a poor ignorant man ? “ No, no, master” said he, “ you 
- “ be no ignorant, you teachee me good, you teachee deni 
good.” You shall go without me, Friday, said I, for I 
don’t care to accompany you thither ; 1 would rather live 
in this solitude than venture among such inhuman savages. 
Go your way, since you desire it, and leave me alone by 
myself, as I was before I, saved your life. 

Never was any creature more thunderstruck than Friday 
was at these words. " Go me away, leave master away,” 
said he, after a long silence, “ no, no, Friday die, Friday live 
“ not master gone,” as though he had said, I neither can 
nor will live, if my master sends me from him. And here I 
cannot but take notice of the strong ties of Friendship, which 
many times surpass those of consanguinity : For often we 
find a great disagreement among kindred ; and when there 
is any seeming regard for each other, it is very seldom true, 
and scarce ever lasting, if powerful interest does not bear 
the sway ; and that alone is often the occasion of the great- 
est hatred in the world, which is to desire the death of 
parents and relations, for the sake of acquiring their fortunes. 
But there was no such thing between my servant and me ; 
instead of which there was the greatest gratitude and the 
most sincere love ; he found me not only his deliverer, but 
his preserver and comforter ; not a severe and cruel tyrant, 
but a kind, loving and affable friend. He wanted for no 
manner of sustenance ; and when he was ill or out of order, 
I was his physician, not only for his body but his soul ; and 
therefore no wonder was it, that such an innocent creature, 
long since divested of his former natural cruelty, should have 
an uncommon concern at so cruel a separation from me, 
which pierced him to the very soul, and made him desire 
even to die, rather than live without me. 

After 1 had told Friday, in a very careless manner, that 
be should be at his liberty as soon as the boat was made, the 
language of his eyes expressed all imaginable confusion ; 
when, immediately running to one of his hatchets, which he 



11 FE AND ADVENTURES 


jj sed to wear as a defensive weapon, he gives it into my 

hand, with a heart sp full, that he could scarcely speak 

Friday, said I, what is it you mean: ? What must I do with 
this ? " Only kill .Friday/’ said he, “ Friday care not livft 
“long.” But what must I kill you for? replied l again, 
“ Ah ! dear master, what made you Friday save from eat a 
“ me up, so keep long Friday, make Friday love God, and 
love not Benamuckee, and now Friday send aw’ay ; never 
“ see Friday more.” As though the poor creature had said, 
Alas ! my dearest kind master, how comes it to pass, that 
after having ventured your precious life to save me from the 
yaws of devouring cannibals, like myself, after such a tender 
regard to. provide for me such a comfortable nourishment, 
and continuing so long a kind master, and a most sincere 
friend ; .and after making me forsake the false notion of an 
Indian deity, and worship the true God in spirit and in 
truth ; and after all this, how comes it now, that you are 
willing to send me away to my former course of living, by 
which means undoubtedly we shall be dead to each other ; 
but greater must be my misfortune, that I shall never behold 
my best fuend I have in the world any more. And this un- 
doubtedly, though he could not express himself so clearly, 
must be his sentiments; for the tears ran down hiffeheeks 
in such a plentiful manner, that I had much ado to refrain from 
weeping also, when I beheld the poor creature’s affection ; 
so that I was forced to comfort him in the best manner F 
could, which I did, by telling him, if he w'as content to abide 
with me, I should be ever willing to keep him, 

After Friday’s grief was somewhat abated, more fully to 
convince me of bis affection, he said, “ O master, me not 
“ care to be tn my. nation, leave you here ; roe desire nation? 
“learn g'.od, thait’s-all meaning, that is desire was for the 
conversion o£ that barbarous people. But as I had noapos-‘ 
tolic misstonpaer any concern about their salvation ; so I 
had not the least intention or desire of undertaking it ; and 
the strengeteof my inclination, in order to escape, proceed-' 
ed chiefly; foam .my late discourse with 'Friday, about these 
. se vent cenrl white bearded men, that liad been driven upon

our purpose, there being enough of wood in the island to. 
have built a fleet of large vessels, but the thing we princi- 

a wanted was to get one so near the water, that we 
t launch it 1 after it was finished; and . not commit so 
horrid a mistake as I liad done once before: 

Well, after a great search for. what was Best and most 
convenient, Friday, at last, whose judgment in such affairs 
was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kind of wood 
the most fitting for it; To this day I cannot tell the name 
of the tree, nor describe itany other way, than only by say- 
ing, that it;is very like what we call /»«**'<?, or between that 
and the Niacaragua wood, being much of the same colour 
and smell. But though my man exceeded me in -the know- 
ledge of the most proper tree, yet f. showed him a much 
belter and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he knew 
before$#for ho was for burning the hollow or cavity of the 
tree, in order to make this boat ;• but bthen told him how he 
ipight do it with to^ls, learning him at the same time how 
to use them, which indeed he did very dexterously ;■ so that 
in a month's time we finished it, making it very handsome, 
by cutting the outside in the true shape of a boat. After 
this it took us a full fortnight before we cculd get her into 
the water, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon great 
rollers ; but when sire was 1 in, she would have earned twen- 
ty men, with all the ease imaginable. 

As I was very well pleased, you may be sure, at the 
launching of this man of war of mine, I was no less amazed 
to behold with what- dexterity my man would manage her, 
turn her, and paddle her along. Well, Friday, said I, what 
do you think of it r.ow ? Do you think this will carry us 
Over ? "Yes, master,'^ said he, "me venture over well, 
" though great blow wind." But my design was yet far- 
ther, .which he was insensible of; and that was to make a' 
mad and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor and ca- 
ble. As to a mast, that was no difficult thing at all to pro- 
cure so I fixed upon at straight young cedar-tree, which I 
found near the place* great plenty of it abounding in the 
island ; and setting Friday to cut it down, I gave him parti- 
cular directions how to shape and order it ; but as to the 
sail, that I managed myself. I very well knew I had some 
old ones, or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six and 
twenty years by me ; but not being careful to preserve them, 
as thinking I should have no-eccastontousethem any more,

when I' came to overlook them, I found them almost all 
rotten, except two ; and with these I went to work, and 
after a great deal of pains and awkward tedious stitching 
for want of needles, at length 1 finished a three-cornered 
ugly thing, like that we call in England a shoulder of mut- 
ton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little small sprit 
at the top, like those which our long-boats use, and which 
I. very well knew how to manage, especially since it was 
like that which 1 had in my patron's fishing-boat, when, 
with my boy Xury, l made my escape from tire Barbarian 
shore. 

It was near two months, I think, before I completed this 
work, that is, the rigging and fitting my masts and sails ; 
and indeed they were nicely done, having made a small stay 
and a sail, or a foresail to it, to assist, if we shoukl turner 
the westward; and, what is still more, I fixed a w 

the stern of her, to steer with ; and though I was but a very 
indifferent shipwright, yet, as I was sensible of the great 
usefulness and absolute necessity of a thing like this,- ! apt 
plied myself to it with such a constant application, that I ait 
last accomplished my design ; but what with the many dtlll 
contrivances I had about it, and the failure of many thingsj 
it cost me as much pains in ordering as in making the boat 3 . 
Besides when all this was done, I had my man to teach 
what belonged to its navigation ; for though he very well 
understood how to paddle a canoe along, he was an utter 
stranger to a sail and a rudder, and was amazed when hd 
saw me w'ork the boat to and again in the sea, by them, and 
how the sail gibbed and filled this way or that way, as die 
course we sailed changed. After some time and a little 
use, I made all these, tilings very familiar to him, so that bf 
became an expert sailor, except in relation to the compass; 
and that 1 could make him understand but little of. Bnt as 
it happened, there was seldom occasion for it; there being 
but little cloudy weather, and scarce any fog in those parts ; 
the stars were always visible in the night, and the shore 
perspicuous by day, except in the rainy season, which eon* 
fined every one to his habitation. Thus entered in the 
seven and twentieth year of my reign, or captivity, which 
you please, (the last three of which, bles.ted with the com- 
pany of my man Friday, dught not to be reckoned) I kept 
the anniversary of nfy landing here, with the same thank- 
fulness to God, for hts tender mercies, a's I did before ; and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.

certainly, as I had great cause for a thankful acknowledg- 
ment for my deliverance at first, I had much greater now 
for such singular and additioual testimonies of the care of 
Providence over me, in all my distresses of both hody and 
mind, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and. 
speedily delivered; for I had a strong impression, upon my 
mind, that I should not be another year in this island. But^ 
however, I still continued on with my husbandry, digging, 
planting, and fencing) as usual ; gathering and curing my 
grapes, and doing all other things that were necessary.. 

And now the rainy season beginning to come on, obliged,, 
me to keep the longer within doors; but before this, 1 brought 
my new vessel into the creek, where I had landed my rafts 
from tho ship, and hailing her upto the shore, I ordered my, 
man Friday to dig a doek sufficient to- hold her in, and deep 
enough to give her water, wherein she might float , and 
then when, the tide was out, we made a strong dam across 
the end of if, to keep out the water ; by which means she 
lay dry, as to the tide from the sea ; and to keep the rain 
from her, we thatched her over, as it w r ere, with boughs of 
trees, like a house, so we waited for the months of Novem- 
ber and December, in which I designed to venture over the 
ocean. 

No sooner did the seasonable weather begin to drawv 
near, but so much was I elevated with this new designed . 
adventure, that I daily prepared for the voyage. The first 
thing I thought on was, to lay by a certain quantity of pro- 
visions, as a sufficient store foe such, an expedition, intend- 
ing in a week or fortnight’s time to open the dock, and to - 
launch out the boat for that purpose.- But one morning as I 
was very busy upon something necessary for this occasion, 

I called Friday to me, and bid him go to the sea shore, and 
see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which rwe 
commonly had once, a week, as much upon account of th© _ 
e gg s » as f° r the sake of the flesh. He had not been long 
gone, but he came running back, as though he was pursued 
for life, and as it were flew over my outer wall, or fence), 
like one that felt not the ground, or steps he set his feet on ; 
and before- 1 had time to enquire the reason of his precipi- 
tation, he cries out, “ O dear master, O ' sorrow, sorrow ! 

41 Bad ! O bad J” Why what’s the matter;: Friday, said li 
“ O yonder, yonder 1 said he, “there be one, two, or three 
“ canoes J two three l” Surely, thought I, there must be

six, by my man’s way of reckoning ; but on a stricter 
inquiry, I found there were but three. Well Friday, said I, 
don’t be terrified, I warrant you we will not only defend 
ourselves against them, but kill the most of these cruel sav- 
ages. But though I comforted him in the best manner I 
could, the poor creature trembled so, that I scarce knew 
what to do with him: u O master,” said he, "they come look 
"Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up.” Why, Friday, 
said I, they will eat me up as well as you, and my danger is 
as great as yours. But since it is so, we must resolve to 
tight for our lives. What say you t Can you fight, Friday? 
" Yes,”, said he, very faintly, “ me shoot, me kill what I 
“ can, but there come a great many number.” That’s no 
matter, said I again, our guns will terrify those we do not 
kill; I am very willing to stand by vou to the last drop of 
my blood. Now tell me if you will do the like by me, and 
obey my -orders in whatsoever I command? Friday then 
answered, “ O master me lose life for you, me die when 
" you bid die.” Thus concluding all questions concerning 
his fidelity, immediately I fetched him a good dram of rum, 
(of which I had been a very good husband) and gave it him 
to comfort his heart. After he had drank it, I ordered him 
to take the two fowling-pieces, which we always carried, 
and load them with large swan shot, as big as small pistol 
bullets ; then I took four muskets and loaded them with 
two slugs; and five small bullets each ; charging my two 
pistols each with a brace, I hung my great sword, as custo- 
mary, naked to my side, and gave Friday his hatchet, as a 
most excellent weapon for defence. 

Thus prepared, I thought as well of myself as any knight- 
errant that ever handled a sword and spear. I took my per- 
spective glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see 
what I could discover ; and I perceived very soon by my 
glass, that there were one and twenty savages, three priso- 
ners and three canoes, and that their chief concern seemed 
to be the triumphant banquet upon the three poor human 
bodies, a thing which by this time I had observed was very- 
common with them. I also remarked, that they did not 
land at that place from whence Friday made his escape, but 
nearer to the creek, w-here the shore was low', and where a 
thick wood came very close to the sea. My soul was then, 
filled with indignation and abhorrence at such inhuman 
wretches, which put a period to all my former thoughts in 
their vindication, neither would T give myself time to,coii-

aider their right of conquest,. as I had done before : but de- 
scending from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and 
told him, I was resolved to go speedily to them, ^nd kill 
them all ^ asking him again, in the same breath, if he would 
stand by me ; when by this time being recovered from his 
fright, and his spirits much cheered with the dram <1 had 
given him, he was very pleasant, yet seriously telling me, 
as he did before, •“ When 1 bid die, he would die.” 

And now it was, having fixed my resolution in so strong 
a manner, that notliing could divest my breast of its uncom- 
mon fury.: 1 immediately divided the loaded arms betwixt 
us, To bytman Friday I gave a pistol to stick in his gir- 
dle, with three guns upon his shoulder, a weight too great, 

: I confess, to bear; but wiiat must a poor king do, who had 
but one soldier in the world t But to shew ; l made him bear 
no more than what I would lay on myself, I stuck the other 
pistol in my girdle, and the other three guns upon iny 
shoulders ; nay, something more, but that was like ALsop’s 
burden, a small bottle of rum, which was soon lightened to 
our exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched put, under 
a ponderous load of armour, like two invincible champions, 
with a quantity of powder and bullets to stand our battle, 
and load again, when the pieces w ere discharged. And 
; now my orders being to be obeyed, 1 charged Friday to 
keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or attempt 
any thing till I commanded him ; and in the interim, not to 
speak so mueh as one word. It was in this order I fetched 
a compass to the right hand, of near a mile, as well to. get 
over the creek, as to attain the wood ; and by this I thought 
to come w r ithin shot of them before I could be discerned, as 
I found by my glass, would not be difficult to accomplish. 

But how fickle and wavering is the mind of men, even in 
our greatest fury and strongest inclinations ? For while I 
was taking this march, my resolution began to abate, not 
through fear of their numbers, who were a parcel of naked 
unarmed wretches, but those reflections occurred to my 
thoughts : what power was I commissioned with, or what 
occasion or necessity had I to go and imbrue my hands in 
human blood, and murder people that had neither done nor 
intended to do me any wrong ? They were innocent in 
particular as to me ; and their barbarous custom was not 
only their misfortune but a sign that God had left them in 
the most immense stupidity ; . but yet did not warrant me to

be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner of hi* 
righteous judgments : That on the contrary, whenever he 
thought fit, he would take vengeance on them himself, and 
punish them in a national way, according to their national 
crimes ; hut this was nothing at all to me, who had no con- 
cern with them. Indeed my man Friday might justify him- 
self, because they were his declared enemies, of that very 
same nation that went (o sacrifice him before ; and, indeed, 
it was lawful for him to attack them, which I could not say 
was-so with respect to me. So warmly did these things press 
upon my thoughts all the way I went, that l only resolved 
to place myself so as to behold their bloody entertainment 
without falling upon them, except something more' than or- 
dinary, by God’s special direction, should oblige me thereto. 

Thus fixed in my resolution, I entered into the thick wood, 
(my man Friday following me close behind) when with all 
possible wariness and silence, I marched till I came to the 
skirt of it, on that side which was the nearest to them ; for 
only one end of the wood interposed between me and them. 
Upon which I called very softly tp Friday, and showing him 
a great tree, that was just at the corner of the wood, 1 or- 
dered him to repair thither, and bring me word, if he could 
plainly perceive their actions ; accordingly he did as I com- 
manded him, and came back with tl?is melancholy story, 
that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of 
their prisoners ; and that another lay bound upon the sand, 
at a little distance from them, which they designed for the 
next sacrifice, -and this he told me was not one of their na- 
tion, but one of those very bearded men, w ho were driven 
by a storm into their country, and of whom he had so often 
talked to me about. You may be sure, that upon hearing this, . 
my soul was ready to sink within me : when ascending into 
a tree J saw plainly, by my' glass, a white man, who lay upon 
the beach of the sea, with his hands and feet tied with flags, 
or things resembling rushes, being covered with clothes, 
and seemed to be an European. From the tree where I took 
this prospect 1 perceived another tree and a thicket beyond 
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than where I was, which, 
by taking a small circle round, I might come at undiscovered, 
and then 1 should be within half a shot of these devourers. 
And this consideration alone, to be more perfectly revenged 
upon them, made me withhold my passion, though I was 
enraged to the highest degree imaginable; when, going 



OJP- ROBINSON CRUSOE. *121 

back about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which 
held all the way till I came to the other tree ; and then I 
iascended to a litile rising ground, not above eighteen, yardB 
distance, and there I had a full view of these Creatures, and 
I could perceive all their actions. 

Such a sight did then appear as obliged me not to lose 
a moment’s time. No less than nineteen of these dreadful 
wretches sat Upon the ground, close huddled together, ex- 
pressing all Hie delight imaginable at so barbarous* an en- 
tertainment ; and they had just sent the other two to murder 
this poor unhappy Christian, and bring him limb by limb 
to their ' fire ; for they were then just going to untie tlfo 
bands from his feet, in order for death, as fetters are knock- 
ed off the feet of malefactors before they go to the place of 
execution. Hereupon, immediately turning to my map, 
bow, Friday, said I, mind what I say, fail in nothing, but 
do exactly as you see me do. All which he promising hy 
would per form, ! set down one of my muskets, and fowling- 
piece upon the ground, and Friday did the same by his ; and 
wuh the other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding 
him do the like : Are you ready ? said 1 : “ Yes, Master,” 
said he j why then fire at them, said I ; and that very mo- 
ment I gave fire likewise. 

1 only killed one and wounded two; but my man Friday 
taking his aim much better than I, killed two, and wpunded 
three. You may be sure they were in a dreadful consterna- 
tion, at 'such an unexp'^ted disaster, and those who had yet 
escaped our penetrating shot, immediately jumped upon 
their feet, but were in such a confusion, that they knew not 
which way lorunor look ; not knowing from whence their 
destruction came. We threw down our pieces and took up 
others, giving a second dreadful volley ; but as they were 
loaded only with swan shot, or small pistol bullets, we per- 
ceived only two of them fall ; though many were wounded, 
who run yelling and screaming about like mad creatures. 
;Now, Friday, said I,, lay down your piece, apd take up the 
mfisket, and follow pte. He . did so, with great courage, 
when showing ourselves to the savages we gave a great 
shout, and made directly tp the poor victim, who would 
have been' sacrificed, had not our first fire obliged the butch- 
ers, with three others, to jump into R;canoe. By my order 
Friday, fired at them, at which shot thought lie had killed 
them all, by reason of their felling to the bottom of the boat ; 


/

LIFE AND ADVENTURES 


however, he killed two, and mortally wounded a third. In 
tne mean time, I cut the flags that tied the hands and feet 
of the poor creature, and lifting him up, asked him in the 
Portuguese tongue. If hat he was ? He answered me in Latin^ 
Christiunus ; but so very weak and faint, that he could scarce 
stand or speak. Immediately I gave him a dram, and a 
piece of bread to cherish him, and asked him what country- 
man he Was ? He said, Hispaniola, and then uttered all the 
thankfulness imaginable for his deliverance. Signior, said I, 
with as much Spanish as I was master of,, let us talk after- 
wards, but light now ; here take this sword and pistol, and 
do what you can. And, indeed, he did so with such cou* 
rage and intrepidity, that he cut two of them to pieces in. 
an instant, the savages not having the power to fly for their 
lives. I ordered f riday to run tor those pieces we had letl . 
at the tree, which he brought me with great swiftness, and 
then I gave him my musket, w'hile I loaded the rest. But 
now there happened a fierce encounter between the Spani- 
ard and one of the savages who had made at him with one 
of their wooden swords ; and though the former was as 
brave as could be expected, having twice wounded his ene- 
my in the head, yet being weak and faint, the Indian had 
thrown him upon the ground, and was wresting my sjyord 
out of his hand, which the Spaniard very wisely quitting, 
drew out his pistol, and shot him through the body before 
could come near him, though I, was running to his assistance. 
As to P'fiday; he pursued the flying - retches with his hatch- 
et, despatching three,, but the rest were too nimble for lnm. 
The Spaniard taking one of the fowling-pieces, wounded 
two, who running into the wood, Friday pursued and killed ; 
but the other, notwithstanding his wounds, plunged him seif 
into the sea, and swam to those who were left in the canoe, 
which, with one wounded, were all that escaped out of one 


and tvrehty. The account is as follows s ,

The savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out 
of our reach, and Friday was as eager in pursuing them ; 
and indeed I was no less anxious about their escape, lest 
after the news had been carried to their people, they should 
return in multitudes, and destroy us. So being resolved to 

J mrsue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and bid 
r riday follow me ; but no sooner was I in, than, to my sur- . 
prise, I found another poor creature bound hand and foot 
for the slaughter, ju4t as the Spaniard had been, with very 
little life in him. Immediately I unbound him, and would 
’have helped him up ; but he could neither stand nor speak, 
but groaned so piteously, as thinking he was only unbound 
in order to be slain. Hereupon I hid Fi iday speak to him, 
and tell him of his deliverance; when pulling out my. 
bottle, I made the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with 
the joyful news he had received, so revived his heart, that 
he sat up in the boat. As soon as Friday began to hear him 
speak, and look more fully in his face, it would have moved 
any one to tears to perceive his uncommon transport of 
joy ; for he kissed, embraced him, hugged him, cried, 
laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then ciied 
again, wrung his hands, beat his face and head, thea sung 
and jumped about again, like a distracted creature ; so that 
it was a great while before I could make him speak to me, 
or tell me what was the matter with him ; but when he 
came to the liberty of his speech, at last he told me it was 
his father. 

Here indeed I was infinitely moved to see that dutiful 
and tender affection this poor savage had to his aged parent. 
He would sit down by him in the boat, open his breastj.and 
hold his father’s head close to his bosom, half an hour toge- 
ther, to cherish him : then he took his arms and angles, 
■which were stiff and numbed, with binding, and chafed ^nd 
trubbed them with his hands; by which means, perccjying 
what the case was, I gave him some rum, which proved ji>f 
great benefit to him. 

While we were busy in this action, the savages had got- 
ten almost out of sight ; and happy it was we did not pur- 
sue them : For there arose from the north-west, which con- 
tinued all night long, such a violent storm, that I could not 
suppose otherwise but that they were all drowned. After 
tins I called Friday to me, and asked him if he had given 
his father any bread ? He shook his head and said, “ None, 



12 + 


life and adventures 


“not one bit, me eat a-up all so I gave him a cake of 
bread out of a little pouch I carried for this end. I like- 
wise gave him a dram for himself, and two or three bunches 
of raisins for his father. Both these he carried to him, for 
he would make him drink the diam to comfort him. 

Away then he runs out of the boat as if he was bewitched, 
with such an extraordinary swiftness, that he was out of 
sight as it were in an instant ; but at his return, I perceived 
him slacken his pace, because he had something in his hand. 
And this I found to be, as he approached nearer, an earthen 
jug with some water for his father, with two more cakes of 
bread, which he delivered into my hands. Being very 
thirsty myself, I drank some of the water, of which when 
his father had drank sufficiently, it more revived his spirits 
than all the rum I had given him. 

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the 
Spaniard one of the cakes, and some water,, who was 
reposing himself under a green place, under the shade of a 
tree, but so weak, that though he exerted himself, he could 
not stand upon his feet. Upon which I ordered Friday to 
rub and bathe his ancles with rum, as he did his father’s. — 
But every minute he was employed in this he would cast a 
wishful, eye towards the boat, where he left his father sit- 
ting ; who suddenly disappearing, he flew like lightening 
to him, and finding he had only laid himself down to ease 
his limbs, he returned back to me presently, and then I 
spcke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him 
to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where 
I would take care of him. Upon w'hich Friday took him 
upon his back, and so carried him to the canoe, setting him 
close by his father ; and presently stepping out again, 
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore taster 
than I could walk, though the wind blew very hard too, 
and having brought them safe to the creek, away he runs to 
fetch the other canoe, which he brought to the creek almost 
as soon as I got to it by land, when wafting me over, he 
took our new guests out of the boat ; but so weak were they 
that I was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow ; and 
when I came to my castle, not being willing to make an 
entrance into my wall, we made them an handsome tent 
covered with old sails, and boughs of trees, making two 
good beds of rice straw, with blankets to lie upon and cover 
them. Thus, like an absolute king over subjects who owed 


• F RtSBlNSON CRVieE, 


125 


their lives to me, I thought myself very considerable, espe- 
cially as I had now three religions in mv kingdom, my man 
Friday being a Protestant, his father a Pagan, and the Spa- 
niard a Papist : but I gave liberty of conscience to them all. 

To get provisions for ny poor weak subjects, I ordered 
Friday to kill me a yearling goat : which when he had done, 
I cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into small 
pieces, boded' and stewed it, putting barley and rice into 
the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table, dined 
with them myself, and encouraged them. Friday was ray 
interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, 
who spoke the language of the savages pretty well. After 
dinner I ordered Friday to fete!) home all our arms from the 
field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead bodies, 
which he did accordingly. 

And now I made Friday inquire of his father, whether 
he thought these savages had escaped the late storm in their 
canoe? and if so, whether they Avould not return with a 
power too great for us to resist ? He answered, that he 
thought it impossible they could outlive the storm; or, if 
they were driven southwardly, they would come to a land 
where they would as certainly be devoured, as if they were 
-drowned in the sea. And suppose they had attained their 
own country, the strangeness ot their fatal and bloody at- 
tack, wouU make them tell their people, that the rest of 
4hem were killed by thunder and lightening, not by the 
hand of man, but by two heavenly spirits, (meaning Friday 
and me) who were sent from above to destroy them.' And 
this, he said, he knew, because !»e heard them say the same 
to one another. And indeed he was in the right on’t ; for 
I have heard since* that these four men gave out that who- 
ever went to that inchanted island, would be destroyed by 
lire from the gods. 

h- No canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my ap- 
prehensions ceased 5 Instead qf yyhich my former thoughts 
of a voyage took place/ especially when Friday’s father as- 
sured me* I should foav^r^ood qsuage in his nation. As to

was bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Mavaunah ; ihat 
when the ship was lost, only five men.perished in the ocean ; 
the rest having saved themselves in the boat, were now 
landed on the main continent. And what do they intend 
to do there ? said I. He replied, they have concerted mea- 
sures to escape, by building a vessel, out that they had nei- 
ther tools nor provisions, so that all their designs came to 
nothing. Supposing, said 1, 1 should make a proposal, and 
invite them here, would they not carry me prisoner to New 
Spain ? he answered no ; for he knew them to be such ho- 
nest men, as would scorn to act such inhuman baseness to 
their deliverer : That, if I pleased, he and the old savage 
■would go over to them, talk with them about it, and bring 
me an answer: That they should all swear fidelity to me 
as their leader, upon the Holy Sacrament ; find, for his part, 
he would not only do the same, but stand- to the last drop 
of his blood, should there be occasion. 

These solemn assurances made mis resolve to grant them 
relief, and to send these two over for that purpose ; but 
when every thing was ready, the Spaniard raised an objec- 
tion, which carried a great deal of weight in it : “ You 
“ know, Sir,” said he, “that having been some time with 
“ you, I cannot but be sensible of your stock of rice and 
“ corn, sufficient, perhaps, for us at present, but not for them, 
“ should they come over presently : much less to victual a 
“ vessel for an intended voyage. Want might be as great 
“ an occasion for them to disagree and rebel, as the children 
“ of Israel did against God himself, when they wanted 
“ bread in the wilderness. And, therefore, my advice is, 
“ to wait another harvest, and in the mean time cultivate 
** and improve some more land, whereby we may have 
■*' plenty of provisions, in order to execute our design.” 
This advice of the Spaniard’s l approved extremely, and 
so satisfied was I of his fidelity, that I esteemed hkn ever 
-after. And thus vve all four WQnt to work upon some more 
land, and against seed-time we 'htui v gotten so much cured 
and trimmed up, sufficient t^itsow twenty-two bushels of 
barley on, and sixlec* not beiiwlncii was, m short, all 
the seed vve had todiphve made the* ere four in number, 
and by this time all in genet .health, we feared not an hun-

build us a large vessel, in Case the Spaniards came over; 
•which being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to out, 
them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now my 
privy counsellor, to oversee and direct the whole, I like- 
wise increased my flocks of goats, by shooting the wild 
dams, and bringing home their kids to my inctosure : Nor 
' did I negfect the grape season, but cured them as usual, 
though I had such a quantity now, as would have filled 
eighty barrels with raisins. And thus all of us being em- 
ployed, they in working, and I in providing for them, till 
harvest came; God Almighty blessed the increase of it so 
much, that from twenty-two barrels of barley. We thrashed 
out two hundred and twenty, and the like quantity, of rice, 
sufficient to victual a ship fit to carry me and all the Spani- 
ards to any, part of. A meric?. 

Thus the principal objection being answered, by- a snfS- 
eient stock of provisions, I sent my two Ambassadors over, 
to the main land, with a regal authority to administer the 
oaths of allegiance -and fidelity, and have an instalment 
signed under their hands, though I never asked whether 
they had' pen, ink, or paper;- when giving each of them a, 
musket, eight charges of powder and ball, and provisions 
enough for eight days, they sailed away with a fair -gale, 
on a day when the moon was at full. 

- Scarce a fortnight had passed over my head, but impati- 
ent for their return, I laid me down to. sleep one morning, 
when a strange accident happened, which was ushered in 
by Friday's coming running to me, and calling aloud, 

Mhster, master, they are come, they are come."' Upon 
■which, not dreaming of any danger, out I jumped from my 
bed, put on ray clothes, and harried through my little grove ; 
when looking towards the sea, I perceived a boat about a 
league and a half distant, standing in for the shore with the 
wind fair, 1 beheld they did not come from the, side where 
the land lay on,, but from the southermost end of the island : 
So these being none of the people we wanted, 1 ordered 
Friday to lie still, till such time as 1 came down from the 
mountain, which, with my ladder, I now ascended, in order 
to discover more fully whaf they were ; and now,, with the 
help of tny perspocti ve glass, 1 plainly perceived an Eng- 
lish ship, which l concluded it to be, by the fashion of its 
long boat ; and which filled me with such uncommon trans-

ports of joy, that I earmot tell how to describe ; and yet 
some secret doubts hung about roe, proceeding fiom I know 
not what cause, as though I had reason to be upon my 
guard. And, indeed,! would have no man contemn the 
secret hints and intimations of danger, which very oiten are 

f iven, when he may imagine there is no possibility of its 
eing real ; for had I not been warned by this silent admo- 
nition, I had been in a worse situation than before, and 
perhaps inevitably ruined. 

Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to approach 
the shore, as though they looked for a place where they 
might conveniently land ; and at last they ran their boat on 
shore -upon the beach, about half a mile's distance ; which 
proved so much the happier for me, since, had they come 
into the creek, they had landed just at my door, and might 
not only have forced me out of my castle, but plundered 
me of all I had in the world. Now' I was fully con- 
vinced they were all Englishmen, three of which were un- 
armed and bound ; when immediately the first four or five 
leaped on shore, and took those three out of the boat as 
prisoners ; one of whom I could perceive used the most 
passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction and despair, while 
the others, in a lesser degree, showed abundance of concern. 

Not knowing the meani|ig of this, I was very much as- 
tonished, and 1 beckoned to Friday, who was below, to as- 
cend the mountain, and likew ise to view this sight. -“O 
“ master,” said he to me, “you see English mans eat pri- 
“ soners as well as Savage mans.” And do you think they 
will eat them, Friday ? said I. “Yes,” said Friday, “they 
“ cat-a all up.” No, no, said I, 'Friday, 1 am much more 
concerned lest they murder them, but as for eating them up, 
that 1 am sure they will never do. 

And now I not only lamented my misfortune in not haw- 
ing the Spaniard and the Savage with me, but also that I 
could not come w ithin shot ol them unperceived, (they hav- 
ing no fire arms among them) and save these three men, 
whom I thought they were going to kill with their swords. 
But some comfort it was to me, that 1 perceived they were 
set at liberty to go where they^pleascd, the rascally seamen 
scattering about as though they had a mind to see the place ; 
and so long did they negligently ramble, that the tide had 
ebbed so low, as to leave, the boat aground. Nor w'ere the 
two men who were in her more circumspect ; for having

drunk a little too muejj liquor, they fell fast asleep ; but ono 
of them waking before the other, and perceiving the bout 
too fast aground for bis strength to move it, he hallooed out 
to the Test, who made all possible expedition to come to ' 
him ; but as Providence ordered it,, all their force was in- 
' effectual to launch her, when I could hear thorn speak tp 
' one another, "Why Idt her alone, Jack, car.’t ye ; she’ll 
float next tide by which words I was fully convinced they 
* were my own countrymen. I all this while lay very quiet, 
as being fully sensible it could be no less than ten hours be- 
fore the boat would be afloat, and then ft would be so dark,- 
that they could not easily perceive me, by which means I 
should be at more liberty to hear their talx, and observe all 
their motion's : not but that I prepared for my defence : yet, 
as I had another sort of enemy to combat with, I acted 
with more caution. I took two fusees on my shoulder, and 
gave Friday three muskets; besides my formidable goat- 
’ skin coat and monstrous cap made me look as fierce and 
terrible as Hercules of old, especially when two pistols were 
stuck in my belt, and my naked sword hanging by my side. 

It was my design at first not to make any attempt till it 
was dark ; and it being now two o’clock, in the very heat 
of the cjj/y. the sailors were all straggling in the woods, and 
undoubtedly were lain do^ n to sleep. The three poor dis- 
tressed creatures, too anxious to get any repose, were how- 
ever seated under the shade of a great tree, about a quarter 
ot a mile from me. Upon which, without any more ado, I 
approached towards them, with my man following behind 
me, and, before I was perceived, I called aloud to them in 
Spanish, " What arc ye. Gentlemen r” 

At these words, they started up in great confusion, when * 
they beheld the strange figure l made ; they returned no ' 
answer, but seemed as if they would ffy from me : " Gen • 
“ llemen,” said I, in English, "don’t be afraid, perhaps you 
" have a friend nearer than you expect.” " He must b» 
" from Heaven,” said one of them gravely, pulling oft’ his 
hat, " for we are past all help in this world.” " All help 
" is from Heaven,” said I : " But Sir, as I have perceived 
" every action between you and these brutes since your 
" landing, only inform me how to assist you, and I will do 
" it to the utmost of my power.” 

"Am l talking with God or man,” said he, ip melting 
tears, " Are you of human kind or an angel ?” " Sir,”

said I, " my poor habit will tell you I am a man, and an 
“ Englishman, willing to assist you, having but this servant 
" only : here are arms and ammunition : tell freely your 
“ condition : Can we save you r” ,v The story/* said he, 
" is too long to relate, since our butchers are so near : but, 
" Sir, I was master pf that ship, my men have mutinied, 
** and it is a favour they have pul my mate, this passenger, 
"and me, on shore without murdering us, though we eje- 
“ pcct nothing but perishing here.” “ Are your enemies 
gone r” said I. " No/’ replied he, pointing to a thicket, 
" there they lie, while my heart trembles, lest, having seen 
" and heard us, they should murder us all.” " Have they 
*' fire arms?” said I. "They have but two pieces,” said 
he, "one of which is left in the boat.” He also told me 
there were two enormous villains among them, that were 
the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed 'or seiz- 
ed, might induce the rest to return to their obedience. — 
" Well, well,” said I, "let us retire farther under the cov- 
" ering of the woods /’ and there it was I made these eon* 
ditions with him : 

I. That, while they staid in the island, they should not 

pretend to any authority ; but should entirely conform to< 
my orders, and return me the arms which I should put in 
their hands,. ' ' 

II. That, if the ship was recovered, they should afford 
Friday and myself a passage gratis to England. 

When he had given me all the satisfaction I could desire, 
J gave him and his two companions each of them a gun, 
with powder and ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon 
them as they lay sleeping. The Captain modestly said, that 
he was sorry to kill them ; though, on the other hand, ta 
let these villains escape, who were the authors of his misery, 
might be the ruin ot us all. “ Well,” said he, " do as you 
" think fit;” and so accordingly I fired, killed one of the 
Captain’s chief enemies and wounded the other, who eager- 
ly called for assistance ; but the Captain, who had reserved 
his piece, coming up to him, " Sirrah,” said Ire, “ ’tis too 
" late to call for assistance, you should rather cry to God to 
" pardon your villany and so knocked him down with 
the stock of bis gun ; three others were also slightly wound- 
ed, who at my approach cried out for help. This the Cap- 
tain granted, upon condition that they would swear to be 
true to Hfm in recovering the ship, which they solemnly did ;

however I obliged the Captain to keep them bound, i After 
which I sent Friday and the Captain’s mate to secure the 
boat and bring away the oars and sails ; when, at their re- 
turn, three men coming back, and seeing their late distressed 
Captain, now their conqueror, submitted to be bound also. 

And then it was, that having more liberty, I related the ad- 
ventures of my vvhpte life, which he heard with a serious 
and wonderful attention. After this, I carried him and his 
two companions into my little fortified castle,, showed them 
all my conveniences, and refreshed them with such provi- 
sions as I could afford. When this was over* we began to 
consider about regaining the ship: he said, that there were 
twenty-six hands on board, who- knowing their lives were i 
forfeited by the law, for conspiracy and mutiny, 'were so very 
hardened,, that it would be dangerous for oar small company 
to attack them. This was a reasonable inference indeed ; 
but something we must resolve on, and immediately put in 
execution: we, therefore, heaved the boat upon the beach 
‘so 'high that he could not shoot off at high water mark, and 
broke a hole in her not easily to be slopped ; so that all the 
signals they gave for the boat to come on board were in 
vain. This obliged them to send another boat ashore, with 
ten men armed, whose faces the Captain plainly descried, 
the boatswain being the chief officer ; but he said there 
were three honest lads among them, who were forced 
into the conspiracy. Hereupon I gave him fresh courage 
(for I had perceived he was in concern) : in the mean while 
securing our prisoners, except two, whom' we took to our / 

' assistance, we thought ourselves able enough to adventure 
a battle. When the sailors landed, and beheld their boat 
in that condition, they not only hallooed, but fired for their 
companions to hear, yet they received no answer. This 
struck., them with horror and amazement, thinking their 
companions were murdered, they made as it they would re- 
turn to the ship. 1 could perceive the Captain’s counte- 
nance change at this, till of a sudden, three men were or»- 
dered to look after the boat, while the other seven leapt on 
shore in order to search for their companions ; and, indeed, 
they came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient castle, 
fiom whence they could see to a great distance in the woods, 
and there shouting and hallooing till tired and weary, they 
at length seated themselves under a spreading tree. My 
opinion was, that nothing could be done till night, when 1

might use some artifice to get them al! out of the boat ; but 
of a sudden they started up, and made to the sea-side ; 
hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain’s mate to go 
over the creek, and halloo as loud as they could, and so de- 
coying them into the woods, come round to me again. And 
this, indeed, had good effect; for they followed the noise,, 
till coming westward to the creek, they called tor their boat 
to carry them over, and taking one of the men out of her, 
left tsvo to look after her, having fastened her to the stump 
of a little tree on shore. Hereupon immediately the Cap- 
tain and our party passing the creek, out of their sight, we 
surprised them both* by the Captain’s knocking down one, 
and ordering the other to surrender upon pain of death, 
and who being the honcstest of them all, sincerely joined 
with us. By this time it was pretty late ; when the rest re- 
turning to their boat, whicli they found aground in the 
creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they ran about wring- 
ing their hands, crying it was an ir.chanted island, and that 
they should be all murdered by spirits or devils. My men 
would willingly have fallen upon them, but I would not 
agree to hazard any of our party. But, to be more certain, 
Friday and the Captain crawled upon their hands and feet, 
as near as possible ; and when the boatswain approached 
in sight, so eager was the Captain, that he fired and killed 
him on the spot ; Friday wounded the next man, and a third 
ran away. Hereupon I advanced with my whole army ; 
and, it being dark, I ordered the man we bad surprised in 
the boat, to call them by their names, and to parley with 
them. Accordingly he called out aloud, "Tom Smith, 
Tom Smith !” He answered, "Who’s thalr” " Robinson!” 
answered the other. “ For God’s sake Tom, surrender 
“ immediately, or you’re all dead men.” "Who ruu?t we 
surrender to r” says Smith. "To our Captain and fifty men • 
** here, w ho have taken me prisoner, w ounded Will Frye, 

*' and killed the boatswain.” " Shall we have quarters 
then r” said he. Hereupon the Captain calls oat, "You 
" Smith, you know my voice, surrender immediately, and 
" you shall Have all your lives granted, exeemt W r ill Atkins.” 
Hereupon Atkins cries out, "What have I done Captain, 
" more than the rest, w'ho have been as bad as me ?” But 
that was a lie, for he w as the person that laid hold of hipi, . 
and bound him. How'ever, he was ordered to submit to the

•town their arms, we bound them all, and seized on theirboat. 

After this, the Captain expostulated with them, telling 
them that the governor was an Englishman, who might ex- 
ecute them there ; but he thought they would be sent t« 
England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered to prepare 
for death next morning. Hereupon Atkins implored the 
Captain to intercede for his life, and the rest begged they 
might not be sent to England. This answered our project 
for seizing the ship. For after sending Atkins and two of 
the worst fast bound to the cave, and the rest being com- 
mitted to my bower, I sent the Captain to treat with them 
in the governor's name, offering fhem pardon if they would 
assist in recovering the ship. Upon which they all promis- 
ed to stand by him to the last drop of their blood ; and who- 
ever acted treacherously, should be hanged in chains upon 
the beach. They were all released on these Assurances ; 
and then the Captain repaired to the other boat, making his 
passenger Captain of her, and gave him four men well arm- 
ed ; while himself, his mate, and five more, went in the 
olher boat. By midnight they came within call of the ship, 
when the Captain ordered Robinson to hale her, and tell 
them that with great difficulty they had found the men at 
last. But while they were discoursing, the Captain, his 
mate, and the rest entered, and knocked down the second 
mate and carpenter, secured those that were upon the deck, 
by putting them under hatches, w hile the other boat’s crew 
entered and secured the forecastle ; they then broke into 
the round-house, where the mate, after some resistance, shot 
the pirate captain through the head, upon which all the rest 
yielded themselves prisoners. And thus the ship being re- 
covered, the joyful signal was fired, whicli I heard with 
the greatest joy imaginable : nor was it long before he 
brought the ship to an anchor at the creek’s mouth, where 
coming to me unawares, “There,” says he, “my dearest 
“ friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and we are. your 
“ servants a comfort so unspeakable, as made me swoon 
in bis arms, while, with gratitude to heaven, we were ten- 
derly embracing each olher. 

Nothing now remaining, but to consult what we should 
do with the prisoners, whom he thought it was not safe t*. 
take on board. Hereupon concerting with the Captain, I 
dressed myself in one of his suits, and sending tor them, lold 
them, that i was going to leave the island with all my peo-

pie, if they would tarry there, their lives should be spare#., 
if not, they should be hanged -at the first port the)" came at. 
They agreed to stay. Hereupon 1 told him my whole story* 
charging them to be kind to the Spaniards that were expect- 
ed, giving them all my arms, and informing them of every- 
thing necessary for their subsistence, 1 and my man Friday 
went on board. But the next morning two of the men 
came swimming to the ship’s side, desiring the Captain to , 
take them on board* though be hanged them afterwards, 
complaining mightily bow barbarously the others used them. 
Upon which I provided with the Captain to take them in 
and being severely whipt and pick&d, they proved more 
honest for the future, And so I bid fa rowel I to this island, 
carrying along with me ruy money, my parrot, umbrella, 
and goat-skin cap ; setting sail December 12, 1886 , after 
twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days resi- 
dence, that same dav and month that 1 escaped from Salee*. 
landing in England June 11, 1687, after five and thirty 
years absence from my own country, which rendered me 
altogether a stranger there. 

Here 1 found my first Captain’s widow alive, who had. 
buried a second husband, but in very mean circumstances, 
and whom I made easy upon bis account. Soon after I 
went down to Yorkshire, where all my family was expired, 
except two sisters, and as many of one of my brother’s 
children. I found no provision had been made for me,, 
they concluded 1 had been long since dead ; so that I was 
but in a very slender station. Indeed the Captain di'd me 
a great kindness, by his report to the owners, how I had 
delivered their ship on the Desolate Island, upon which they 
made me a present of 2001. sterling. I next went to Lis- 
bon, taking my man Friday With me, and there arriving in 
April, I met the Portuguese Captain, who had taken me oft 
board on, the Ahie.ln coast ; but, being ancient, he had left 
off the sea, and resigned all his business to his son, who 
followed the Brazil trade. So altered both of us were, that 
we did not know each other »i first, till 1 discovered my- 
self more fully to him. After a few embraces, 1 began to 
inquire of my concerns ; and then the old gentleman told 
me, that it was nine years since he had been at Brazil, 
where my pnrlner was then living, but my trustees were 
both dead ; that he believed I should have, a good account 
•t the product *f my plantation; that tire imagination of 



robj kson onuses.

■my being .'Jost, had obliged my trustees to give an estimate 
of my share to the procurator fiscal, who, in case of my not 
returning, had given one third to the king and the rest to 
the monastry of St. Augustine : but if I put in my claim, 
or any one for me, it would be returned, except the yearly 
product which was given to the poor. I then desired them 
to tell me what improvement he thought had been made of 
. any plantation, and whether he imagined it was worth my 
•while to look after it f he answered he did not know how 
ranch it was improved ; but this he was certain of, that my 
fsartner was grown vastly rich upon his halfof it ; and, that 
be liad been informed, that the king had 200 moidores per 
annum for his third part. He added, that the- survivors of 
my trustees were persons of an ingenuous character ; that 
ray partner could witness my title, my name being register 
eel in the country, by >which means I should indispensably 
recover considerable sums of money. But, answered I, 
bow could my trustees dispose of my effects, when I made 
•you only my heir ? This, said he, was true ; but, there be- 
ing no affidavit made of my death, he could not act as my 
executor. However, he had ordered his son, (then at Bra- 
zil) to act by procuration upon my account, and he had 
taken possession of my sugar-house, having accounted him- 
self for eight years with my partner and trustees for the pro- 
fits, of which he would give me a very good account. 

And, indeed, this he performed very faithfully in a few 
days, making himself indebted to me 4-70 moidores of gold, 
over and above what liad been lost at sea, after I had left 
the place. And then he recounted to me what misfortunes 
he had gone through, which forced my money out of his 
hands, to buy part in a new ship : “ but,” says he, “ you 
e< shall not want, take this ; and, when my son returns, 
“ every farthing shall be paid you.” Upon which he put 
into my hand a purse of 150 -moidores in gold, as likewise 
the instrument, containing the title to the ship which his 
son was in, and which he offered as security for the remain- 
der. But really when I saw so much goodness, generosity, 
■tenderness, and real honesty, I had not the heart to accept 
it, for fear he should straiten himself upon my account.-^— 
*' It is true,” said be, “ it may be so; but-then the money

hundred when I got my effects into my hands, and that 1 
designed to go myself for that purpose. But he told ine 
he could save me that trouble, and so caused me to enter 
my name with a public notary; as likewise my affidavit, with 
a procuration affixed to it; and this he ordered me to send 
in a letter to one of his acquaintance, a merchant in Brazil; 
and, indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and honoura- 
bly observed ; tor, in seven months time, 1 had avfefy faith- 
ful account of all my effects, w hat sums of money were 
raised, what expended, and what remained for my tise : In 
a word, I found myself to be worth 50001. stciTmg,and 1000k 
per annum. Nor was this all; for my partner congratulated 
me upon my being alive, telling me how much my planta- 
tion was improved, what Negroes were at work, and how 
many Are Marina he had said to the Virgin Mary for my 
preservation, desiring me to accept kindly some presents he 
had sent me, which 1 found showed the greatest generosity. 

No sooner did the ship arrive, but 1 rewarded my faitii- 
ful Captain, bv returning him the hundred moidores, and 
not only forgiving him all he owed me, l allowed him yearly 
a hundred more, and fifty to his son, during their lives. And 
now being resolved to go to England, I returned letters of 
thanks to the Prior of St. Augustine, and in particular to my 
old partner, with very suitable presents. 'By the Captain’s 
advice, I was persuaded to go by land to Calais, and there 
take passage for England ; when, as it happened, I got a 
young English gentleman, a merchant’s son at Lisbon, to ac- 
company me, together with two English, and two Portu- 
guese gentlemen ; so that with a Portuguese servant, an 
English sailor, and my man Friday, there were nine of us in 
number. 

Thus armed and equipped, we set out, and came to Ma- 
drid, when the summer decaying, we hasted to Navarre, 
where we were iniormed, that there was scarcely any pas- 
sing, by reason of the prodigious quantity of snow ; so that 
we* were obliged to abide near twenty days at Pampeluua, 
and at last to take a guide to conduct us safe towards Tho- 
louse. And now twelve other gentlemen joining with us, • 
together with their servants, we had a very jolly company. 
Away our guide led us by frightful mountains, and through 
so many intricate mazes and windings, that we insensibly 
passed them, which, as we travelled along, ushered us into 
the prospect of the fruitful and charming provinces of Lan- 
guedoc and Gascoigne, 


OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 137 

But now came on two adventures, both tragical and co- 
mical. Fiist, our guide was encountered by three wolves 
and a bear, who set upon him and his horse, aud wounded 
him in three places ; upon which my man, riding up to his 
assistance, shot one of them dead upon the spot, which 
made the others retire into the woods. But the pleasantest 
adventure was, to behold my man attack the bear. ’Tis 
such a creature, that if you let him alone, he will never 
meddle with you; and this my man very well knew, and 
so begging leave of me in broken English, he told us, “ he 
“ would make good laugh." 44 Why, you silly fool," said 
I, “he’ll eat you up at a mouthful." *■ Eatee me up,” re- 
plied he by way pf scorn, 44 me not only eatee him, but 

make much good laugh." Upon which, pulling off his 
"boots, he claps onbis pumps, and running after the monstrous 
beast, he called out, that he wanted to discourse with hii“n, 
and then throwing stones on purpose to incense him, the 
beast turns about in fury, atid, with prodigious strides 
shuffles after him. But though he was not swift enough to 
beep up pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were 
for help; yet being angry, “ You dog,” said I, “iramedi- 
“ ately take horse, and let us shoot the creature.” But he 
cried, “ Dear master, no shoot, me make you laugh much.” 
.And so he turned about, making signs to follow, while the 
bear ran after, till coming to a great oak, he ascended ih a 
minute, leaving his gun at the bottom of it. Nor did the 
bear make any difficulty of it, but ascended like a cat, though 
bis weight was very great. You must consider I was not 
a little amazed at the tolly of my man, as not perceiving any- 
thing to occasion our laughter, till such time as we rode up 
nearer, and beheld the beast mounted upon the oak, on the 
beginning of the same branch, to which Friday . clung at the 
farther end, where the bear durst not come. Hereupon 
1'riday cried out, “ Now, master, me make much laugh, me 
make bear dance.” Upon which he fell a shaking the 
bough, which made the creature look behind him, to sfee 
how he could retreat. Then as if the bear had understood 
his stammering English ; v “ Why you no come farther, Mr. 
“ Bear r” said he, “ pray, Mr. Bear, come far hefe ;” and 
then indeed we all burst into a laughter, especially when 
we perceived Friday drop like a squirrel upon the ground, 
leaving the beast to make the best of his way down the tree.

And npvv Uniting it, the most convenient time to shoot the 
c.ieal/ure, Friday cried out, “O dear master, no shoot, me 
, “ shopt by and by when taking up the. gun, “ me .no 
“ shqot yet," said he, “me make orje more much laugh.” 
And accordingly he was as good as iris word ; for the crea- 
ture descending backwards from the tree very leisurely, be- 
fore he could lay one foot on the ground, Friday shot him 
through ^the ear A stone. dead ; and looking to see whether 
We were pleased, he burst out into a hearty laughter, say- 
ing, “ So we kdl de bear in my country, not with the gun, 
i “ but with much lopg arrows.” Thus ended our diversion 
to our great satisfaction ; especially in a place where the 
terrible. howliugs struck us \vhh a continual terror. But 
the snows now growing Very deep, particularly on the 
mountains, tbe ravenous, creatures were then obliged to seek 
for sustenance in; the villages, w here coming by surprise on 
the country people, killed several of them, besides a great

Our guide told us, we had y et one more dangerous place

try, there we should find them^-This was a small plain

four of them were shot dead, and several others being 
wounded, went bleeding. a way, as we could very plainly 
discover by the snow. And now remembering what bad 
been Often told me, that such was the majesty of a man’s 
voice, as to strike terror even in the fiercest creatures, I or- 
dered, all our companions to halloo as loud as possible ; and 
in this notion I was not altogether mistaken ; for they im- 
mediately turned about upon the first halloo, and began to 
retire; upon which, ordering a second volley in their- 
rear, they galloped into the woods with great precipitatioa. 

, Thus'we had some small-time to load our pieces again, 
and then mpde all the haste we could on o&r way ; r but we 
had net rode for, before we were obliged to pat ourselves 
in a posture of defence as before, being; alarmed with a very 
dreadf ul noise in the same wood, on our left hand, the same 
way as \Ve wefe to pass, only that it was some distance 
from us. By this time the darksome clouds began to spread 
over the elements, and the night growing very dusky, made 
it so mu<rh the more to our disadvantage ; bdt still the noise 
increasing,! we were, fully assured that it was the howling' 
end yelling of those ravenous creatures ; when presently 
three troops ofwdlv'es on -our front, appeared in sight, as 
though a great number of them bad a designto surround us, 
and devour us, in spite of fate. , But as they did not fall , 
upon us immediately^ weprbceeded on pur journey in as swift 
a manner as the roads would permit our horses, which was 
only a large trot. It was in this minner wc travelled, till 
such a time as we discovered another wood, and had the 
prospect of its entrance through which We were to pass, at 
the farthest side of the plain. But surely none can express 
the terror we were in, when: approaching the lane, w.e per- 
ceived a confuses! number of the fiercest wolves, standing, 
3|S it were, guarding its entrance. Nor were we long in 
this amazement, before another occasion of horror present 4 -' 
ed itself; for suddenly we heard the report of a gun at ano- 
ther opening in the wood ; and looking that way, ou: ran a 
horse bridled and saddled, flying with the greatest swiftness, 
and no less than sixteen or seventeen wolves pursuing aftei) 
him, in order to devour the poor creature p and unquestionav 
biy they did so, after they had run him down, not being able 
to held out that swiftness with which he at first escaped 
them. • , t--o ,iun«0

LIFE AND ADVENTURES' 


, When we rode up to that entrance from whence the horse 
came forth, there lay the carcases of another horse and two 
men, mangled and torn by these devouring wolves : and un- 
doubtedly one of these men was the person who fired the 
gun which we had heard, for the piece lay by him ; but, 
alas! most of the upper part of his body and his head, were 
entombed in the bowels of these ravenous creatures. 

What course to take, whether to proceed or retreat, we 
could not tell ; but it was not long before the wolves them- 
selves made us to come to a resolution ; for such numbers 
surrounded us, every one of whom expected their prey, 
that were our bodies to be divided among them, there would 
not be half a mouthful a-piece. But happy, very happy it 
was for us, that but a little way from the entrance, there hay 
some very large timber trees, which 1 supposed had been 
tut down and laid their for sale ; amongst which I drew iay 
little troop, placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, 
which served us for a breast-work, when desiring them t* 
alight, we stood in a triangle, or three fronts, dosing our 
bodies in the centre, the only place where we could pre- 
serve them. 

Never certainly was there a more furious charge than 
what the \volyes made upon us in ibis place : and the sight 
of the horses which was the principal prey they aimed at* 
provoked their hunger and added to their natural fierceness. 
They came on us with a most dreadful noise, that made the 
woods ring again ; and beginning to mount the pieces of 
timber, I ordered every man to fire, as before directed : 
and, indeed, so well did they take their aim, that they killed 
several of the wolves at the first volley ; but still we were 
obliged to keep a continual firing, by reason they came on 
like devils, pushing one another with the greatest fury — ’ 
But our second volley something abated their courage, when 
stopping a little, we hoped they would have made the best 
of their way ; however, it did not prove so, for others made 
a new attempt upon us ; and though in four firings we killed 
seventeen or eighteen of them, laming twice as many, yet 
they several times successively came on, as though they 
valued not their lives for the sake of their prey. 

Unwilling was I to spend our last shot too suddenly, and 
therefore calling my other servant, and giving him a horn 
ef powder, bid him lay a large train quite along the limber, 
which he did, while Friday was cl»arging my iusee and his 



'OF ROBINSON'. CRUSOE. ‘141 

♦wii, with the greatest dexterity. By this time the wolves 
coming up the timber, I set fire to the train,. by snapping a 
discharged pistol close to the powder. This so scorched 
and terrified them, that some fell down, and others jumped 
in among us ; but these were immediately despatched, 
when ail the rest, frightened with the light, which the dark- 
some night caused to appear more dreadful, began at length 
fto retire; upon which, ordering our last pistols th be fired 
at once, giving at the same time a great shouti the wolves 
were obliged to have recourse 'to their swiftness and turn 
tail ; and then we sallied out upon twenty iame'ones, cut- 
-ting them in pieces with our swords, which obliged them 
to howl lamentably, to the terror of their fellows, Who re- 
signed to us the fields as victorious conquerors. And, in- 
deed, 1 question whether Alexander, king of Macedonia, 
in any of Bis conquests, had more occasion for triumph than 
we had ; for he was but attacked with numerous armies of 
«oldiei*s ; whereas our little army was obliged to combat a 
legion of devils, as it were, worse than the Cannibals, who, 
the same moment they had slain us, would have sacrificed 
ms, to satisfy their voracious appetites, I > ■ r *» » • * t.i * 

- ■ Thus ended our bloody battle withi the beasts# having 
kitted threescore of them, and saved our lives from their 
fury. We*' still had a league farther to go," when, ’ as we 
went, otir ears vvere saluted with their, most unwelcome 
howlings, and we expected every moment another attack. 
But, in an hour’s time, we arrived at the town where we 
were to lodge ; 'and here we found the place strictly guard- 
ed, afid all in terrible confusion, ks well they might, tor 
-fear the bears and wolves breaking into the village, >in order

when we told onr story there, they much blamed our guide, 
for conducting us throngh the forest at the foot of the moun- 
'•imiti; ih sUCh a severe Season, when the snow obliged the 
wolves to seek for shelter in the woods. When weinform- 
*ed them ih what manner 'vye placed ourselves, and the 
'horses ih ithe'centre, they exceedingly reprehended us, and

told ns, it was an hundred to one, but we had been aH de- 
stroyed ; for that it was the very sight df the horses, their 
so much desired prey, that made the wolves more ragingly 
furious than they would have been, which was evident, by 
tiieir being at other times really afraid of a gun ; but then 
being exceedingly hungry and furious upon that account, 
their eagerness to come at the horses made them insensible 
of their danger ; and that, if we had not, by a continual 
fire, and at last by the cunning stratagem of the train of 
powder, got the better of them, it had been great odds if 
their number had not overpowered us; besides, it was a 
great mercy we alighted from our horses, and fought them 
with that courage and conduct, which, had we tailed to do, 
-every man of us, with our beasts, had been devoured ; and, 
indeed, this was nothing but truth : tor never, in my life, 
was I so sensible of danger, as when three hundred devils 
came roaring upon as, to shun whose unwelcome company, 
if I was: sure to meet a storm every week, I would rather 
go a thousand leagues by sea. . * 

I think I have nothing uncommon in my passage through 
France to take notice of, since other travellers of greater 
learning and ingenuity, have given a more ample account 
than my pen is able to set forth. From Thoulouse I tra- 
velled to Paris* from thence to Calais, where I took ship- 
ping, and landed at Dover the 1 4th of January, in a very 
cold season* . * . ' . . 

Thus come to the end of my travels, I soon discovered 

• my new found estate, and all the bills of exchange I had 
.were currently paid. The good ancient widow, my only 
privy counsellor, thought no pains or cares too great to pro- 
cure my advantage ; nor had I ever occasion to blame her 

• fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I was for 
leaving my effects in her hands, intending to set out for 
Lisbon, and so the Brazils ; but as in the Desolate Island l 

• had some doubts about the Romish religion, so I knew 
i there was little encouragement settle there, unless I 

would apostatize from the orthodox faith, or live in conti- 
nual fear of the Inquisition. Upon this account I resolved 
to sell my plantation ; and, for that intent, I wrote to my 
old friend at Lisbon, who returned me an answer to my great 
satisfaction ; which was, that he would sell it to good aq- 
count ; however, if 1 thought it convenient to give him li- 
berty to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the sue- 


* or ROBi«so?f cjttjsoe. ■> H3 

■vivors of my trustees, residing at Brazils, who consequently 
knew .its intrinsic value, having lived just upon the spot, 
and who I was sensible were very rich, and therefore might 
be the more willing to purchase it : he did not in the least 
doubt, but that l shoulamake four or five thousand pieces 
of eight more of it, than I could, if I disposed of it in any 
other manner whatsoever. •' ■ ; : „ ■ V' 

You may be sure I could not. but agree with this kind and 
ingenuous proposal ; and immediately I sent him an order 
to offer it to them, which he accordingly did.; so that about 
.eight months after, the ship being in that time returned, he 
gave me a satisfactory account, that they not only willingly 
accepted the offer, but that they bad also remitted 33,000 
pieces of eight to a correspondent of their own at Lisbon, 
sn order to pay for thfe purchase. 

Hereupon, in return, I signed the instrument of sale, a o 
cording to form, which they had sent from Lisbon, and re- 
turned it again to n>y old friend, he having sent me, for my 
estate, bills of three hundred and twenty eight thousand 
pieces of eight, reserving the payment of one hundred moi- 
dores per annum, which I had allowed him during life, 
likewise fifty to his son during life also, according to my 
faithful promise, which the plantation was to make good as 
' a rent charge. 

- And thus having led my reader to the knowledge of the 
first parts of my life, so remarkable for the many peculiar 
providences that attended it, floating in the ocean of uncer- 
} dainty and disappointment, of adversity and prosperity, 
\ beginning foolishly, and yet ending happily ; methinks, now 
•that I am come to a sale and pleasant haven, it is time to 
cast out my Anchor, and, laying up nay vessel, bid, for a 
while, adieu to foreign adventures. I had nootber concerns 
to look after, but the cate of my brother's two^ons, which, 
.with the good widow’s persuasions, obliged me to continue 
at home seven years. One of these children I bred up a 
gentleman, and the other an experienced sailor, remarkable 
for bis courage and bravery. Besides this I married a vir- 
tuous young gentlewoman, of a very good family, .by whom 
I had two sods and one daughter. . v But my dear and tender 
wife leaving this earthly stage (as in the second part of my 
life you will hear) which rent roy soul as it were asunder, 
my native country became weary and tiresome to me ; and 
ju y nephew happening to come from sea, tempted me to

venture another voyage to the East-Indies, 'Which I did in 
the year 1694 , at’ which time I visited my island, and in- 
formed myself of every thing that happened since my de- 
parture. •' : , 

One might reasonably imagine, that what I had suffered* 
together with advanced age, and the tear of losing, not only 
what I had gotten, but mv life also, might have choaked 
hp all the seeds of ytiuthfui ambition ahd curiosity, and put 
a lasting period to mv wandering inclinations. But as no- 
thing but death can folly allay the active part of my lire, no 
lefcs remarkable for the many various contingencies of it^ 
you will' next perceive how I visited my little kingdom, 
Saw my -successors the Spaniards, . had an account of the 
usage- they met With from the Englishmen, agreeing and 
disagreeing, uniting and separating, till at last they were 
subjected to the Spaniards, who yet used them very ho- 
nourably; together with the wonderful and successful battles 
over the Indians who invaded, and thought to have con- 
quered the island, bat were repelled by their invincible 
courage and bravery, having taken eleven men and five 
women prisoners* by which, at my return, I found about 
twenty young children on my little kingdom. Here I staid 
•twenty days, left them supplies of all necessary things, as 
also a carpenter and smith, and shared the island into parts, 
reserving the whole property to myself. Nor will you be 
insensible, by the account of these things, of several new 
adventures E have been engaged in, the battles I have fought, 
•the ’deliverances l have met with : and while, in the sur- 
prising relation of such remarkable occurrences, I shall de- 
scribe many of God’s kindest providences to me in particu- 
lar, no less conspicuous in the same goodness, power, and 
majesty of ©nr great Creator, shewn one way or other, over 
the late of the earth, if duly adverted to.

THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF 

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Wherein are contained several strange and surprising accounts 
of his Travels, and his most remarkable Transactions both by 
Sea and Land ; with his wonderful vision of the Angelic World. 

W HEN we consider the puissant force of Nature, and 
what mighty influence it has many times over the 
temper of the mind, it will be no such great wonder to think, 
that my powerful reason should be overcome by a much 
stronger inclination. My late acquired kingdom ran con- 
tinually in my thoughts all the day, and I dreamed of it in 
the night : nay, I made it the continual subject of my talk, 
even to inpertinence, when I was awake. I had such va- 
pours in my head, that I actually supposed myself at my 
castle ; that I not only perceived Friday's father, the old 
Spaniard, and the wicked sailors, but that I talked and dis- 
coursed with them about th«* manner of living ; that I heard 
the things related to me, which I found afterwards to be 
too true ; and that I executed my judgments with the greatest 
severity upon the offenders. And, indeed, this anticipating 
all the pleasing joys of my life, scarcely afforded me one 
pleasant hour : my dear and tender wife could not bnt take 
notice of it, w'hich drew those affectionate speeches from 
her: “My dear,'* said? she, “ I am really persuaded that 
" some secret impulse from Heaven occasions in you a de- 
'* termination to see the island again ; nor am 1 less sensible, 
" but your being engaged to me and these dear*children, is 
“ the only hinderance of your departure. I know, my dear, 
** if I were in the grave, y6u would not long continue at 
" home ; prevent not your happiness on my account, whose 
"only comfort centres in you. All that I can object is, that 
" such an hazardous undertaking is no way consistent with 
“ a person of your years ; but if you are resolved to go,” 
added she, weeping, “ only permit me to bear you com- 
" pany, and that is all that I desire." 

Such endearing tenderness, graced w'itli the most inno- 
cent, and yet most powerful charms, brought me insensibly 
into my right understanding ; and when I considered all the

transactions of my life, and particularly my new engage- 
ment ; that I had now one child already born, and my wife 
big of anot ff£r ( and that l had 'no occasion to seek for more 
riches, who already was blessecf with sufficiency, with much 
struggling I altered my resolutions at last, resolving to apply 
myself to some business or other, which might put a period 
to such wandering inclinations. Hereupon I bought a little 
farm in the county of Bedford, with a resolution to move 
thither ; upon this there was a pretty convenient house, 
surrounded with land, very capable of improvement, which 
suited toy ternfier;‘aS tb planting, managing, and cultivating, 
Nor was T long before l entered upon my new settlement, 
having bought ploughs, harrows, cartk, , waggons, horses, 
cows, artd sheep* so that! I now led the life of a country 
gentleman, and as happy in my 1 retirement as the greatest 
nibnarch in the world.. And \v4iat made me think my 
happ?ne«< the greater was, that I- was in the middle state of 
life, Vwhich my father had so often recommended, much re- 
sembling the felicity of a rural retirement, which is elegantly;, 
dbsdrtbed by the poet in these lines :

But in the midst of this my happiness, 1 .was suddenly* 
plunged in the greatest sorrow that 1 could possibly endure j 
fpr when 1 least expected it, my dear and tehder wife war 
forced to submit to the irresistible power of Death, leaving 
this transitory life for.a better.. It is impossible for me to 
express the. beauties of her mind, or the loveltnfess of her 

{ i.eCson ; neither can I too much lament her loss, wbxcfi my. 
atest breath shall record ; her influence was greater over 
ipe than the powers of my own reason, the importunities of 
friends, the instructions of a father, or the melting tears of a 
tender and disconsolate mother; in a word, she was the 
spirit of all toy affairs, and the centre of my entefprizes — 
But now, since lire cruel hand of Death had closed my dear-, 
est’seyes, 1 seemed in my thoughts a stranger to the world { 
my privy x'ouocellor being gone, 1 was like a ship without a 
pilot, that could only run before the wind. And when I 
looked around me in this busy world, one part labouring 
folr bread, and the other squandering away their esfates ; 
this put me in mind how I had lived in my little kingdom. 



OF ROBIN JON CRUSOE 


^i4t 

-where both reason and religion dictated to me, that there 
• was something that certainly was the reason and end of life, 
which was far superior to what coiild be hoped' for on this 
side the grave. My country delights were ijow as insipid 
and dull, as music and science to those who have neitner 
tastU n«r ingenuity. In short, resolving to leave off house- 
keeping, I felt ftiy farm, and in a few months returned to 
- London. ' 

: But neither could that great city, so famous for its variety 
o of infotainment,- afford me any agreeable delight ; a st^te 
of idleness I found to be the very dregs of life, and most 
hurtful to body and soul'. It was now the beginning of the 
year 1684, at which time my nephew (who/as I before ob- 
: served had been brought up t o the sea, and advanced to be 
captain of a ship) was returned from a short voyage to Bil- 
boa, the first he had made in that station. He comes to me 
one morning, telling me, that some merchants of his ac- 
quaintance had proposed to him to go a voyage for them to 
the East-Indies and China, in the manner of private traders ; 
•*« and now uncle," said he, “ if you'11 accompany me thither 
, " I’ll engage to land you upon your own island, to visit the 
" state of ) our little kingdom." 
d Just before he came in, my thoughts- were fixed to get a 
patent for its possession, and then to filf it ’with inhabitants. 
After I had paused a while, and fooked stedfastly on him, 
«. What devil or spirit,” said I) “sent you with this iin- 
lucky errand f” He started at first; but recovering him-. 
. self, when he perceived IwaS not offended ; “ Gir," replied 
he, '.“what I have proposed cannot, I hope, be styled un- 
lucky, since certainly you must be desirous to see yOur'Ifttle 
. territory, where you reigned with more content than any of 
your brother kings in the universe." — Nephew," 1 said I, 
“ if you will leave me there, and call for me as you come 
back, I care not if I give mv consent :’’ but he answered, 
that the merchants would' not alloiv their vessel, loarie 1 
with an infinite value, to return there again, which was a 
month’s sail out of the svay ; “ besides. Sir," said lie, " if I 
should miscarry, was your request granted, why then you 
would be locked up as before." This, indeed, carried a 
great deal of reason in it; but w'e found out a remedy, and 
that wa^s to carry a franied fdoop on board, ready to be set 
up in the island, by the assistance bf some carpenters, which 
W© should carry with us, that mightbe fitted in a tew days

to go to sea. I was not long in forming my resolution 
winch overswayed my good friend the widow's persuasions, 
and the natural affection I bore to my young children; I 
made my will, and settled my estate in such manner, that I 

* Was perf ectly sure my poor infants would have justice done 
them. The good widow not only undertook to make pro- 
vision for my voyage, but also took the charge of my-»do- 

.« meslic affairs, and to provide for my childrens' education; 

* and indeed no mother could lake more care, or understood 
the office better ; for which l lived to reward and return 
her my hearty thanks. 

The beginning of January, 1694-5, my nephew being 
ready to sail, 1 and Friday went on board in the Downs on 
the 8 lb, having, besides that sloop already mentioned, a 
very considerable cargo for my new colony. First, 1 had 
some servants, whom 1 proposed to leave there, as they 
should appear willing ; there were two carpenters, a smith, 
and a very ingenious fellow who was Jack-of-all-lradesJ for 
he w as not only a cooper by trade, but also was dextrous at 
making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, likewise a 
good turner, and a good pot-maker. 1 also carried a tailor, 
w ho consented to stay in my plantation, and proved a most 
necessary fellow in the island. As to my cargo it consisted 
of a sufficient quantity of linen, and English sluiis for cloth- 
ing the Spaniards that 1 expected to find there ; as likewise 
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings ; together with beds, bedding, 
and household stuffi especially kilching utensils, with pots, 
kettles, pew ter, brass, &c. also nails, tools of all sorts, 
staples, hooks, hinges, and all other things necessary ; all 
which, 1 think cost me about three hundred pounds. Nor 
was this all ; for 1 carried an hundred spare arms, muskets, 
and fusees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of 
several sorts of shot, two brass cannon, besides swords, 
cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and halberts. 1 
l made my nephew take with us two small quarter-deck 
guns, more than he had occasion for in his ship, to leave be- 
hind, if there was a necessity ; so that we might build a 
fort there, and man it against all opposers whatsoever. 

Well, we put out to sea ; and though 1 can’t say this 
voyage was so unprosperous as my others had been, yet 
contrary winds drove us so tar nothward, that we were 
obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay j 
wind-bound two and twenty days. Here, indeed, our pro-

Visions wore very cheap, and we added to oar ship’s stores 
by taking several live hogs, two cows and calves, which I 
then resolvod to put on shore in my island, if our necessities 
did not call for them. On the 5th of February we sailed 
from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lasted for "some 
days ; and l think it was about the 20th of the same month, 
late in the evening, when the mate informed us, that ho 
saw a flash of Are, and heard a gun fired : and when lie was 
speaking, a boy came in and told us, that the boatswain had 
heard another. Upon which we all ran to the quarter-deck, 
from whence, in a few moments, we perceived a terrible 
fire at a distance. We had immediately recourse to our 
reckonings, in which we were all of opinion, that there 
could be no land that way, it appearing to be at N. N. W. 
Hereupon we concluded that some ship had taken fire at 
$ea, and that it could not be far off, by the report of the 
guns which we had heard. We made up directly to it, and 
in half an hour’s time, the wind being fair, we could plainly 
perceive a great ship on fire, in the middle of the sea. — 
Touched with this unhappy disaster, and considering my 
former circumstances, when the Poituguese Captain took 
me up, I immediately ordered five guns to be fired, that the 
poor creatures, not seeing us, it being dark, (though we 
could perceive their flame) might be sensible there was de- 
liverance. at hand, and consequently might endeavour t# 
save themselves in their boat. Nor was it long before the 
ship blew up in the air, and the fire was extinguished in 
the ocean.- But supposing them all to be in their boats, we 
liung out our lanterns, and kept firing till eight o’clock in 
the morning ; .when, with our perspectives, we beheld two 
boats full ot people, making towards us, tho’ the tide was 
against them ; then spreading out our ancient, and hanging 
out a waft, as a signal for them to come on board, in half 
an hour’s time we came up with them, and took them all in, 
there being no less than sixty-four men, women, and chil- 
dren. It was a French merchant ship of three hundred tons, 
homeward-bound from Quebec in the river of Canada. — 
The master informed me how, by the negligence of the 
steersman, the steerage was set on fire : that, at his outcry 
for help, the fire was, as he thought totally extinguished ; 
but, that some sparks getting between the timber, and within 
the ceiling, it proceeded into the hold, where there was ne

resisting it ; and then they got into their boats, as creatures 
in the last extremity, with what provision they had, together 
with oars, satis, and a compass, intending to go back to 
Newfoundland, the wind blowing at S. E. and by E. though 
there were several chances against them, as storms to over- 
set and founder . them, rains and colds to benumb and perish 
their limbs, and contrary winds to beep them back and 
starve them ; but, said he, in this our great distress, we 
heard the welcome report of your guns, when with unspeak- 
able joy, taking down our masts and sails, we were resolved 
to lie by till morning ; bat perceiving your light, we set 
•our oars at work, to keep our boat a head, the sooner to 
Attain your ship, the happy instrument of our deliverance. 

Indeed no one can express the joy of these poor crea- 
tures on this occasion ; fear and grief are easily set forth ; 
•ighs and tears, with a few motions of the hands and head, 
are all the demonstrations ot these passions ; but an excess 
of joy, carries in it a thousand extravagancies ; especially, 
I think, among the French, whose temper is allowed to be 
more volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay, than that of 
other nations. Some were weeping, tearing themselves in 
the greatest agonies of sorrow, and running stark mad about 
the ship, while the rest were stamping with their feet, 
wringing their hands, singing, laughing, swooning away, 
vomiting, fainting, with a few returning hearty thanks to 
the Almighty, and crossing themselves. I think, if I am 
not mistaken, our surgeon was obliged to let thirty of them 
blood. But among the passengers, there were two priests, 
the one an old, and the other a young man ; but what amazed 
me more was, that the oldest was in the worst plight ; for 
no sooner did he perceive himself freed from danger, but he 
dropt down as it were without life, and to every one’s ap- 
pearance quite dead ; but the surgeon chafing and rubbing 
nis arm, opened a vein, which at first dropped, and then 
flowing more freely, the old man began to open, his eyes, 
and in a quarter ot an hour was well again. But soon re- 
membering this happy change, the joy of which whirled his 
blood about faster than the vessels could convey it, he be- 
came so feverish, as made him more fit for bedlam than any 
other place ; but the surgeon giving him a sleepy dose, 
be was perfectly composed the next morning. 

Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour, of the young 
priest. At his entrance on board the ship, he fell on his face 



mr RoiwseK cEvs«t. 151 

in the most humble prostration to the Almighty. 1 thought, 
indeed, he had fallen into a swoon, and so ran to help him 
up ; but he modestly told me, he was returning thanks to 
the Almighty, desiring me to leave him a few moments,- 
and that, next to his creator he wbuld return me thanks 
also. And indeed, he did so about three minutes after, with 
great seriousness and affection, While the tears stood in hi« 
eyes, which convinced roe of the gratitude of his soul. Nor 
did he less shew his piety and wisdom, in applying himself 
to his country people, and labouring to compose them, by 
the most powerful reasons, arguments; and persuasions. — 
And when, indeed, these people had taken their night’s re- 
pose, in such lodgings as our ship would allow, we found 
nothing but the best ot manners, and the most civil acknow- 
ledgements, for which the French are eminently remarkable. 
*The next day the Captain and one of the priests desired to * 
speak with roe and my nephew the- commander* They 
told us, that they had saved some money and valuable things 
•at of the ruined vessel, v. hich was at our service; only 
that they desired to be set on shore some where in our way. 
At the first my nephew was for accepting the money; but 
J (who knew how hard my case would kive been, had the 
Portugaese Captain served me so) persuaded Him to the con- 
trary ; and therefore told them, that as we had done nothing ' 
but what we were obliged to do,- by nature and humanity, 
v and what we ourselves might expect from others in such 
calamity ; so we took them up to save them, not to plunder 
.them, or leave them naked upon tlie land, to perish for 
want of subsistence, and therefore would not accept their 
money : but as tp landing them that was a great difficulty ; 
Tor being bound to the Fast-Indies, it was impossible wil- 
fully to change our voyage upon their particular account, 
nor could my nephew (who was under charter party to 
pursue it by way of Brazil) answer it to the freighters. — 
.All that we' could do, was to put ourselves in the way of 
.meeting some ships homeward-bound from the West- Indies, 
that, if possible, they might get a passage to France or 
.England. Indeed, they were very thankful for our first 
.kindness ; but were under great concern, especially -the 
passengers, at their being carried to the East-Indies. They 
begged, therefore, I would keep on the banks ©f Newfound- 
land, where probably they might meet with some ship or

stoop, fo carry them to Canada, whence they came. -As 
this wap but a reasonable request, I was inclined to grant it, 
since it was no breach of charter party, and the laws of God 
and nature obliged us to do what good we could to our 
fellow-creatures ; and besides the danger we ourselves 
should be in for want of provisions : so we consented te 
carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would 
permit; if not, that we should carry them to Martinico in 
the West-Indies. But, as it happened, in a week’s time 
we made the banks of Newfoundland, where the French 
people hired a bark to carry them to France. But the young 
priest being desirous to go to the East-Indies, l readily agreed 
to it, because I liked his conversation, and two or three of 
the French sailors also entered themselves on board our ship. 

Now, directing our course for the West-Indies, fleering 
S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with little wind, ano- 
ther adventure happened to exercise our humanity. In the 
lalitude of 27 degrees, 5 minutes north, the 19th of March, 
1694-5, we perceived a sail, (our course S. E. and by S.} 
which bore upon us, and then she appeared to be a large 
vessel, having lost her main top-mast and boltsprit; when 
firing a gun as a #gnal of distress, wind N. N. W. we soon 
came to speak with her. She was a ship from Bristol, bound 
home from Barbadoes, out of which road she had been forced 
in a hurricane tothe westward, in which they lost their masts. > 

The told us, their expectations were to see the Bahama 
islands,, but were driven away by a strong wind at N. N.W. 
and having no sails to work the ship with, but the main- 
course, and a kind of a square sail upon a jury fore-mast, 
because they could not come near the land, were endeavour- 
ing to stand for the Canaries : nay, what was worse, besides 
all their fatigue, they were almost starved for want of pro- 
vision, having ate nothing for eleven days ; all that they had 
aboard was sugar, a barrel of fresh water, and seven casks 
of rum. In this ship were passengers, a youth, his mother,, 
and a maid-servant, who were in a most deplorable condition 
for want of food. If I had not gone on board their ship, 
the knowledge of their misery had been concealed from me, 
and they would have inevitably perished ; though, indeed, 
their second mate who was Captain, by reason the true 
Captain was not on board when the hurricane happened, 
had before informed me that there were such persons on 
board, whom he supposed to be dead, being afraid to inquire

otter them, fefceaasi be had nothing to give them fer relief. 
Mereupon we 1 resolved to let them have what we could * 
epai e, -ordering the mite to bring some of his men on board * 
us, which he did accordingly : as he and they looked like ' 
•skeletons. When meat was set before them, I ordered them, * 
•to eat sparingly. But, however, they soon fell sick ; which 
-obliged the surgeon to mix something in them -broth, which * 
was to be to them both food and physic. When they were 
fed, we ordered our mate to carry them a sack of bread, - 
and four or five 'pieces Of beef ; but the surgeon charged 
them to see it boded, and keep a guard on the cook-hoom, - 
to prevent the men from eating it raw, and consequently 
killing themselves with what Was designed for their relief. - 
But, particularly, I desired the mate to see what condition. • « 
the poor passengers were in, and the surgeon gave him O 1 
•pitener oHhe Same 'broth which he had prepared for the ’ 
.•men. And befog Curious so soe this scene of misefy myself, ». 

I took the Captain (as we edited the mate of the ship) hi ••* 
Ornrown boat, and sailed after them. ■■■ ' 

Ifere was a sad sight indeed ! scarce were the victuals ’ 
half boiled in the pot, bnt they were ready to break Open 
the eook-room door. To stay their stomachs the mate gave 
-them biscuits, which were dipped and softened with the - 
liquor of the meat, which they call bruise ; telling them, it 
Was for their own safety, that he was obliged to give them • 
but a little at a tinfoi ; and so feeding them gradually, their 
‘bellies were comfortably filled, and the men did very well 
again. Bat when they came to the poor gentlewoman in 
the cabin, who for several days had continued without food, -> 
giving what she had to her son, they found her as it were 
in the arms of death. She was sitting upon the floor of the ‘ 
deck, with her back up against the .sides, between two * 
chairs, which were lashed fast, and- her head shrernkbC- - 
tween her shoulders, like a "senseless corpse. Nothing wtus •

hi s mruth was a piece of an old glove, the rest of which he 
had ate up. At lirst he vomited what the mate had given 
him ; but at length began sensibly to revive, though in th* 
greatest concern for the death of his tender mother. t 
As to the poor maid, she lay by her mistress, like one is 
the last pangs of death : her limbs were distorted, one of her 
, hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, .which she 
, grasped so hard, that it was with some difficulty we sepa- 
rated her from it ; her other arm lay over her head, and her 
feet lay both together, set fast against the .frame of the cabin 
table ; not only being starved with hunger, but overcome 
w ith grief at the loss of her mistress, whom she loved most 
tenderly. It was a great while before the surgeon could 
bring her to life, and a much longer time before she came 
to her senses. • 

After we had sailed with them some days, we sent them 
five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, 
with peas, flour, and other things ; taking three casks of 
sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight as payment, we 
lett them, but took the youth and maid with us, with all 
their goods. The lad was about seventeen years old, very 
handsome, modest, sensible, and well-bred, but mightily 
concerned for the loss of his honoured mother, having lost 
his father at Barbadoes but a few months before. He bc- 
seeched the surgeon to intercede with me to take him out 
of the ship ; for that the sailors, not sparing a small suste- 
nance, had starved his mother. But hunger has no bounds, 
no right, and consequently is incapable of any compassion. 
"When the surgeon told him, our voyage might put him in 
bad circumstances, and farther from Isis friends, he said he 
did not care, if he was delivered from that terrible crew ; 
that as the Captain (meaning me) had saved him from death, 
.so he was sure he would do him no harm ; and, as for the 
,-|uaId,when she was restored to het senses, she would be 
no less thankful, let us carry them where we would. And 
indeed the surgeon so represented their case to me, that I 
consented, and took them on board with all their goods, 
j except eleven hogsheads of sugar ; but the youth liaving a 
Will of lading, 1 made the commander oblige himself, to de- 
liver a letter and the deceased widow’s goods to Mr. Rogers,

tolerable good voyage. But, passing by several little incidents 
relating to wind and weather, I shall relate what is most re- 
markable concerning my little kingdo n, to which I was 
then drawing-near I had great difficulty in finding it, for 
as I came -to, -dnd went from it before, on the south and east 
aide of the island* as coming from the Brazils, so now ap- 
proaching between the lnain and the island, not having any 
chart lor the coast, nor land mark, it obliged us to go on 
j shore on several islands in Use mouth of the river Oroonuko, 

: but to. no purpose. Thus ! perceived, that >vhat i thought 
was a continent before, was no such tiling, but a long island, 
or rather a ridge of sands. On one of these i 'lands 1 found 
1 some Spaniards, but they belonged to the isle de Trinidad, 
who came hither in a sloop to make salt, and try to find 
some pearl muscles. . But at length I came fair on the 
rsouih-side of my island, and then 1 presently knew the 
countenance ol my little kingdom : so we brought the ship 
safe to an anchor, broadside within the creek, where stood 
^ my ancient and venerable castle. ' ' 

x No sooner did I see the place, but calling for Friday, I 
\ asked him where he was r But when he looked a little, he 
clapped his .hands, crying, “ O joy, O there, O yes, O 
there !” pointing to our old abode, and then fell a danciilg 
and capering as if he was mad, and 1 had much ado to keep 
him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore. "Friday;” 
said 1, “ what do you think, shall we go to see your fathers” 
At the mentioning Ins father’s name, the poor affectionate 
creature fell a weeping : “ No> no,” says he, " hie see hija 
no more, never see poor father more ! he long ago die, die 
long ago; he much old man.” “You don’t know that;” 
said 1, " but shall we see any body else t He looks abotft,

■ After wo had rowed directly into the creek, the ’first man 
f fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard, whose life I had 
Saved, and whose face i ' perfectly well knew. I ordered 
them ah to stay in the boat for a while; but Friday, per-i 
cerviiig hi slather at a distance, would have jumped -into the 
sea, had they not let the boat go. No sooner was he on< 
Shore, but he flew like a swift arrow out of a bow to em- 
brace his- aged father. Certainly it would melt a man of 
the firmest resolution into the softest tears, to see with what 
uncommon transports of joy he saluted him-; l>e first kissed 
him, then stroked his face, took him in his arms, lard hint > 
under a shady tree, sat down by him, then looked as ear- 
nestly at him, as one would do at a piettrre, for a quarter of 
an hour together. After this he wouM lie upon the ground, 
Stroke his legs and kiss them, then get op and stare at him, 
as though he was bewitched ; but the next day one cetfki 
not forbear laughter to see his behaviour, for he would w alk 
several hours with his father along the shore, leading him 
by the hand, as tho’ he was a lady ; while, every now and 
then, he would run to the boat to get something for hitn, as 
a lump of sugar, dram, biscuit, or something or other that 
that was good. His 'frolic's ran in another channel in the 
afternoon ; when l>e set old Friday on the ground, he would 
dance round him, making comical postuies and gestures; 
and all this while would be telling him one story oranother 
of his travels and adventures. 

It was on the lOth of April, umo 1695, that I set my 
foot upon (be island a second time. When my faftltful 
Spaniard, accompanied by one more, approached the ‘boat, 
he little knew who I was, till I discovered myself to him. 

** Seignior,” said I, m Portuguese, “ don’t you know me ?” 
He spoke never a word, but giving his musket to his attend- 
ant, extended his arms, and saying something in Spanish 
that I did not then understand he came forward and em- 
braced me, saying, he was inexcusable not toknow hrede- 
fiverer; who, like an angel sent from heaven," had^ved hi* 
fife. He then beckoned to the man to call our his cons-* 
panions, asking me if 1 would walk to my own habitation; 
and take possession, where I should find some mean im- 
provements ; but indeed they were extraordinary ones; for 
they had planted so many trees so close together, that the 
place was like a labyrinth, which none coufd find out ex- 
cept themselves, who knew its intricate windings. 1 asked 



Or ROBINSON CRUISE, * ".|i7 

r Kim the meaning of all these fortifications ? he told me he 
would give a large account of what had passed since my 
, departure till this time, and how he had subdued some Eng- 
lish, who thought to be their murderers, hoping I would 
»ot be displeased, since necessity compelled them to it.— 
As I knew they were wicked villains, so I told him, that I 
was not Only far from finding fault with it, but was rather 
heartily glad that they had subdued them. While we were 
thus talking, the man whom he sent, returned, accompanied 
by eleven more, but in such habits, that it was impossible te 
tell what nations they were of. He first turned to me, 
and pointing to them, ** These, Sir,” said he, ” are some of 
the gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodness the* 
turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them st nsi- 
ble who l was ; and then indeed they saluted me one by 
•ne, not as ordinary men, but as though they had been am- 
bassadors or noblemen, and l a triumphant conqueror ; for 
their behaviour not only agreed with a manlike, majestic 
gravity, but at the same time was so obliging and courteous, 
as made them agreeable to the last degree. 

Before I relate the history of the transactions of m y king- 
dom, as I had it from the Spaniard’s own mouth, I must 
here insert what I omitted in my former relation. The 
matter is this : Just before we weighed anchor and set sail, 
there happened a quarrel onboard the ship, which had like t* 
have occasioned a second mutiny, till such time as the cou- 
rageousCaptain, taking two of the most refractory prisoners, 
laid them in irons, threatening, as they were concerned i* 
the former disorders, to have them hanged in England for 
running away with the ship. This frightened some of the 
rest, as thinking the Captain would serve them in the 
same manner, though he seemed to give them good words 
for the present. But the mate having intelligence of this, 
made me acquainted with their fears; so that, to make 
them more easy, and ourselves more safe from their conspi- 
racies, l was obliged to go down, and pass my honour’s 
word for it, that upon their good behaviour, all that was 
past should be forgiven ; in testimony of which, I ordered 
the two men’s irons to be taken off, and themselves for- 
given. But as this had brought us to an anchor at night, 
m which there was a calm ; the two me* that had been in 
irons stole each of them a musket, and some other weapons,

to their brother rogues. The next morning we sent tfee 
long-boat with men to pursue them, but all in vain ; tire 
mate, in revenge, would have demolished my little castle, 
burnt its furniture, and destroyed their plantations, but 
having no orders ibr it, he did not put it iu execution.— 
And thus there were live Englishmen in the island, which 
caused great differences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a 
perfect account of, in the following manner : 

“ You cannot. Sir, but remember tire embassy you sent 
me about, and wjiat a disappointment we met with, by your 
absence, at our return. There is but little variety in the 
relation of all our voyage, being blessed with calm weather, 
and a smooth sea. Great indeed was the joy of my coun- 
trymen to see me alive, having acted as the principal man 
©n board, the captain of tlie shipwrecked vessel dying before; 
nor was their surprise less, as knowing I was taken prisoner 
by the savages of another nation, they had thought me long 
since entombed -in their monstrous bowels. But when I 
showed them the arms, ^atmnmnt ion, and provisions I had 
brought for them, they looked upon me as a second Joseph 
advanced in Pharaoh’s court, and immediately prepared to 
come along with me. Indeed the v were obliged to trespass 
upon their friendly savages, Jay borrowing two of their 
canoes, under a pretext tor fishing ; and they *came away 
the next morning, but without any. provisions of their own, 
except a tew roots, which served them instead of bread. — 
After three weeks absence we arrived at our habitation. 
Here we met with three English sailors, who, I confess, 
gave us provisions, and that letter of direction you had left 
for us, which informed us how to bring up tame goats, plant 
corn, cure grapes, make pots, and, in short, every thing 
that was necessary tor our use. As, in particular, I knew 
youir method best, so taking Friday’s father to assist me, we 
managed all the affairs ; nor were the rest of the Spaniards 
wanting in their Itirvd offices, dressing food for the English- 
t men, wlro did nothing but ramble and divert themselves in 
the woods, either shooting parrots, or catching tortoise*. 
'But we had not been long ashore, before we were informed 
of two more Englishmen, naturally turned outof their com- 
mon place of residence, by the three others above mention- 
ed ; this made any Spaniards and me (whom they now 
looked upon as their governor in your absence) endeavour to 
persuade them to take them in, that we might beasonefamily ;

but all mrr entreaties were in vain, so that the poor fellows 
finding nothing to be done without industry, pitched their 
tents on the north side of th e island, a li ttle i ncl i n ing to t he west, 
for fear of savages. Here they built two huts, one to lodge, 
and the other to lay their stores in ; for my good natured 
Spaniards giving them some seeds, they dug and planted as 
I had done, and began to live prettily. But while they 
•were thus comfortably going on, the three unnatural brutes, 
their countrymen, in a mere bullying humour, insulted them, 
by saying, the governor, (meaning you) had given them a 
possession of the' island, and d-mn ’em they should build no 
houses upon their ground, without paying rent. The two 
.honest men (for so let me now distinguish them) thought their 
-.three countrymen only jested, and one of them invited them 
in, to see their fine habitations ; while the other facetiously 
-told them, that since they built tenements with great im- 
provements, they should, according to the custom of lords, 
give him a longer lease ; at the same time desiring them to 
fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One. of these 
wretches swearing he should pay for the jest, snatches up a 
fire-brand, and clapping it to the outside of their hut, very 
fairly set it on fire, which would soon have consumed it, 
had not the honest man thrust him away, and trod it out 
with his feet. Hereupon the fellow returns with his pole, 
with which he would have ended Ids days, had not the 
.poor man avoided the blow, when fetching his musket, he 
knocked down the villain that began the quarrel. The 
other two coming to assist their fellow, obliged the honest 
man to take his musket also, and both of them presenting 
their pieces, bid the villains stand off; and if they did not 
lay down their arms, death should decide the dispute one 
way or other. This brought them to a parley, in which 
they agreed to take their wounded man and be gone ; but 
they were in the wrong that they did not disarm ihem when 
they had the power, and then make their complaint to me 
and my Spaniards for justice, which might have prevented 
their farther designs against them. And indeed so many 
trespasses did they afterwards commit, by treading down 
their corn, siiooling their young kids and goats, and plagu- 
ing them night and day, that they resolved to come to my 
castle, challenge all the three, and decide their right by one 
plain battle, w hile the Spaniard* stood by to see fair play. 
One day it happened, that tyvo of my Spaniards (one of

whom understood English) being in die woods, -were met 
by one of the honest men, who complained how barbarous 
their countrymen had been in destroying their corn, killing 
their milk-goat and three kids, which deprived them of their 
subsistence ; ana that if we did not grant them relief, they 
must be inevitably starved, and so they parted ; but when 
*iy Spaniards came home at night, and supper being on the 
table, one of them began to reprehend the Englishmen, but 
in a very mannerly way ; which they resenting, replied, 
" What business had their countrymen in that place without 
leave, when it was none of their ground i” “ Why,” said 
my Spaniard, calmly, “ Jnglise, they must not starve but 
they replied, “ Let them starve and be damn’d, they should 
neither plant nor build ; and damn them, they should be 
their servants, and work for them, for the island was theirs, 
and they would burn all the huts they should find in the 
island.” “ By this rule” said my Spaniard, smiling, “ We 
shall be your servants too.” “Aye, by G-d, and so you 
shall,” replied the impudent rascal. Upon which, startmg 
up, Will Atkins cries, “ Come, Jack, let’s have t’other 
brush with them ; who dare to build in our dominions r” — 
Thus leaving us something heated with just passion, away 
they trooped, every man having a gun, pistol, and sword, 
muttering some threatning words, that we could then but 
imperfectly understand. That night they designed to mur- 
der their two companions, and slept till midnight in the 
bower, thinking to fall upon them in their sleep ; nor were 
the honest men less thoughtful concerning them ; for at this 
juncture they were coming to find them out, but in a much 
fairer way. As soon as the villains came to the huts, and 
found no body there, they concluded that I and my Spaniard 
had given them notice, and therefore swore to be revenged 
on us. Then they demolished the poor men’s habitations ; 
not by fire, as they attempted before, but pulled down their 
houses, limb from limb, not leaving stick or stone on the 
ground where they stood, broke their household stuff in 
pieces, tore up their trees, spoiled their inclosure, and, in 
short, quite ruined them of every thing they had. Had 
these people met together, no doubt but there would have 
been a bloody battle ; but Providence ordered it for the 
better ; for just as the three were got together the two 
were at our castle ; and when they left us, the three came 
back again, but in great rage, scoffingly telling us what

jthey had done ; when one taking hold of a Spaniards hat, 
twirls it round, saying, “And you Seignior Jack Spaniard, 
shall have the same sauce, if you don’t mend your manners ’* 
My Spaniard, a grave but courageous man, knocked him 
flown with one blow of his fist ; at which another villain 
fired his pistol, and narrowly missed his body, but wounded 
him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged, the Spaniard lakes 
up tlie fellow’s musket whom he had knocked down, and 
would have shot him, if I and the rest had not come out, 
and taken their arms from every one of them. 

“ These Englishmen perceiving they had made all of us 
their enemies, began to cool ; but notwithstanding their 
bitter words, the Spaniards would not return them their 
arms again, telling them, they would do them no manner of 
harm, if they would live peaceably ; but if they offered any 
injury to the plantation or castle, they would shoot them as 
jthey would do ravenous beasts. This made them so inad, 
that they went away raging like furies of hell. They were 
no sooner gone, but in came the two honest men, fired with 
the justest rage, if such can be, having been ruined as afore- 
said. And indeed it was very hard, that nineteen of us 
should be bullied by three villains, continually offending 
with impunity. 

.. “ It was a great while. Sir, before we could persuade the 
two Englishmen from pursuing, and undoubtedly killing 
them with their fire-arms; but we promised them justice 
should be done them, and, in the mean time, they should 
reside with us in our habitation. In about five days after, 
these three vagrants, almost starved with hunger, drew near 
our grove, and perceiving me, the governor, and two others 
walking by the side of the creek, they very submissively 
desired to be received into the family again. We told 
them of their great incivility to us, and of their unnatural 
barbarity to their countrymen ; but yet we would see what 
the rest agreed to, and in half an hour’s time would bring 
them Word. After some debate, we called them in where 
their two countrymen laid a beatfy charge against them, 
for not only ruining, but designing to murder them, which 
they could not deny. But here 1 was' forced to interpose 
»s a mediator, by obliging the two Englishmen not to hurt 
them, being- naked and unarmed, and that the other three 
should make them restitution, by building their two huts,

and fencing their ground in the same manner as it was be- 
fore. Well, being in a miserable condition, they submitted 
to this at present, and lived some tune regularly enough, 
except as to the working part, which they did.not care tor, 
but the Spaniards would have dispensed w ith that, had they 
continued easy and quiet. Their arms being given them 
again, they scarce had them a week when they became as 
troublesome as ever ; but an accident happening soon after, 
obliged us to lay aside private resentments, and look to our 
common preservation. 

“ One night. Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well in health, 
and yet by no means could 1 compose myself to sleep ; upon 
w'hich, being very uneasy, I got up and looked out, but it 
being dark, I could perceive nothing but the trees around 
the castle. I went to bed again, but it was all one, I could 
not sleep ; when one of my Spaniards, hearing me walk 
about, asked who it was up r 1 answered, “ It is I.” When 
I told him the occasion, “ Sir,” said he, “ such things are 
not to be slighted ; for certainly there is some mischief plot- 
ting against us.” “Where are the Englishmen r” said I. 
He answered, “In their huts; for they lay separate from 
us. Sir, since the last mutiny. “ Well,”, said I, “ some 
kind spirit gives this information for advantage.- Come let 
us go abroad, and see if any thing offers to justify our fears.” 
Upon which I and some of my Spaniards went up the moun- 
tain, not by the ladder, but through the grove, ahd then we 
were struck w ith a panic fear on seeing a light, as though 
it were a fire, at a very little distance, and hearing the 
voices of several men. Hereupon we retreated immediate- 
ly, and raised the rest of our forces, and made them sensible 
of the impending danger ; but with all my authority, I could 
not make them stay w here they were, so earnest were they 
to see how things went. Indeed the darkness of themight 
gave them opportunity enough to view them by the light of 
the fire undiscovered. As they were in different parties, 
and straggling over the shore, we were much afraid that 
they should find out our habitations, and destroy our flocks 
of goats ; to prevent which, we sent immediately an Eng- 
lishman and two Spaniards to drive the goats into the val-- 
ley where the cave lay ; or, if there was occasion, into the 
cave itself: As to ourselves, resuming our native courage 
and prudent conduct, had we not been divided, we durst 
venture to attack an hundred of them ; but before it was

very light, we resolved to send out Friday’s father as a spy, 
who, immediately stripping himself naked, gets among them 
undiscovered, and in two hours time brings word, that they 
were two parties of two different nations, who lately having 
a bloody battle with one another, happened to land by mere 
chance in the same island, to devour their miserable pri- 
soners ; that they were entirely ignorant of any person’s 
inhabiting here ; but rather being tilled with rage and fury 
against one another, he believed, that as soon as day-light 
appeared, there would be a terrible engagement. Old Fri- 
day had scarce ended his relation, when we heard an un- 
common noise, and perceived that there was a horrid en- 
gagement between the two armies. 

“Such was the curiosity of our parly, especially the En- 
glishmen, that they would not lie close, tho’ Old Friday told 
them their safety depended upon it ; and that if we had 
patience, we should behold the savages kill one another. 
However, they used some caution, by going farther into 
the woods, and placing themselves in a convenient place 
to behold the battle. 

“ Never could there be a more bloody engagement, or 
men of more invincible spirits and prudent conduct, ac- 
cording lo their manner and way of fighting. It lasted near 
two hours, till the party which was nearest our castle began 
to decline, and at last to fly from their conquerors. We 
were undoubtedly ^mt into a great consternation on this 
account, lest they should run -into our grove, and conse- 
quently bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we re- 
solved to kill the first that came, to prevent discovery, and 
that too with our swords, and the butt end of our muskets, 
for fear the report of our guns should be heard. 

“ And so indeed, as we thought, it happened ; for three 
of tl *2 vanquished army crossing the creek, ran directly to 
4be place, as to a thick wood for shelter ; nor was it long 
before our scout gave us notice of it ; as also, that the vic- 
tors did not think fit to pursue them. Upon this I would 
not suffer them to be slain, but had them surprised and taken 
by our party ; afterwards they proved very good servants 
to us, being.stout young creatures, and able to do a great 
deal of work. The remainder of the conquered savages 
fled to their canoes, and put out into the ocean, while the 
conquerors, joining together, shouted by' way of triumph,

and about three in the afternoon they also embarked for 
their own nation. Thus we were freed at once from these 
savages and our fears, not perceiving any of these creatures 
for some considerable time after. We found two and thirty 
men dead in the field of battle ; some were slain with long 
arrows, which we found sticking in their bodies ; and the 
rest were killed with great unweildy wooden swords, which 
denoted their vast strength, and of which we found seven- 
teen, besides bows and arrows j but we could not find one 
wounded creature among them alive ; for they either kill 
their enemies quite, or carry those wounded away with them. 

“ This terrible sight tamed the Englishmen for some time, 
considering how unfortunate they might have been had they 
fallen into their hands, who would not only kill them as 
enemies, but also for food, as we do cattle : and indeed so 
much did this nauseate their stomachs, that it not oaly made 
them very sick, but more tractable to the common necessary 
business of the whole society, planting,- sowing, and reap- 
ing, w ith the greatest signs of amity and friendship ; so, 
that being now all good friends, we began to consider of 
circumstances in general ; and the first thing we thought 
of was, whether, as we perceived the savages haunted that 
side of the island, and there beingmore retired parts of it, and 
yet as well suited to our manner of living, and equally to our 
advantage, we ought not rather to move our place of resi- 
dence, and plant it in a much safer place, both for the se- 
curity of our, corn and cattle. 

“ After a long debate on this head, it was resolved, or 
rather voted, ntminc contradiccnle, not to remove our ancient 
castle, and that for this very good reason, that some time or 
otherweexpected to hear fromour supreme governor, (mean- 
ing you. Sir) whose messengers not finding us, there, might 
think the place demolished, and all his subjects destroyed by 
the savages. 

As to the next concern relating to our corn and cattle, 
we consented to have them removed to the valley where 
the cave was, that being mos't proper and sufficient for both. 
Hut yet, when we considered farther, we altered one part 
of our resolution, which was to remove part of our cattle 
thither and plant only part of our corn there ; so that in 
case one part was destroyed, the other might be preserved. 
Another resolution we took, which really had a great deal 
of prudence in it j and that was, in not trusting the three

savages whom we had taken prisoners, with any knowledge 
of the plantations we had made in the valley, of what num- 
ber Of cattle we had there, much less of the cave, wherein 
we kept severall arms, and two barrels of powder you left 
for us at your departure from this island. But though we 
could not change our habitation, we resolved to make it 
more fortified and more secure. To this end. Sir, as you 
planted trees at sortie distance before the entrance of your 
palace ; so we, imitating your example, planted and filled' 
up the whole space of ground:, even to the banks of the 
creek, nay, into the very ooze where the tide flowed, net 
leaving a place for landing ; and among those I had planted, 
they had intermingled so many short ones, all of which 
growing wonderfully fast and thick, a little dog could 
scarcely find a passage through them. Nor was this suffi- 
cient, as we thought, for we did the same to all the ground, 
on the right and left hand of us, even to the top of the hill, 
without so much as leaving a passage for ourselves, except 
by the ladder ; which being taken down, nothing but what 
had wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us. 
And indeed this Was exceedingly well contrived, especially 
to serve that occasion, for which we afterwards found it 
necessary. 

“ Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, hav- 
ing, all this time, not one visit from the savages. Indeed 
one morning we had an alarm, which put us in some amaze- 
ment 5 for a few of my Spaniards being out very early, 
perceived no iess than twenty canoes, as it were coming 
on shore : upon which returning home, with great precipi- 
tation, they gave us the alarm, which obliged us to keep 
at home' all that day and thcf next, going out only in the 
night-time to make our observations; but, as good luck, 
would have it, they were upon another design, and did not 
land that time upon the island. 

But now there happened another quarrel between the 
three wicked Englishmen, and some of my Spaniards. — 
The occasion was this : One of them being enraged at one 
of the savages, whom he had taken prisoner, for not being 
able to comprehend something which he was showing him, 
snatched up a hatchet in a great fury not to correct, nut lo 
kill him ; yet missing his head, gave him such a barbarous 
cut in the shoulder, that lie had like to have struck, off his

arm ; at which one of my good natured Spaniards inter- 
posing between the Englishman and the savage, beseeched 
the foimer not to murder the poor creature ; but this kind- 
ness had like to have cost the Spaniard his life, for the 
Englishman struck at him in the same manner ; which he 
nimbly and wisely avoiding, returned suddenly upon him 
with his shovel, (being all at work about their corn land) and 
very fairly knocked the brutish creature down. Hereupon, 
another Englishman coming to his fellow’s assistance, laid the 
good Spaniard on the earth ; when immediately two others 
coming to his relief, were attacked by the third Englishman, 
armed with an old cutlass, who wounded them both. This 
uproar soon reached our ears, when we rushing out upon 
them, took the three Englishmen prisoners,and then our next 
question was, what should be done to such mutinous and 
impudent fellows, so furious, desperate, and idle, that they 
were mischievous to the highest degree, and consequently 
not safe for the society to let them live among them. 

“ Now, Sir, as I was governor in your absence, so I also 
took the authority of a judge ; and, having them brought 
before me, I told them, that if they had been of my country, 
I would have hanged every mother’s son of them"; but, 
since it was an Englishman, (meaning you, kind Sir,) to 
whom w'e were indebted dor our preservation and deliver- 
ance, I would, in gratitude, use them with all possible mild- 
ness ; but, at the same time, leave them to the judgment of 
the other two Englishmen, who, I Imped, forgetting their 
resentments, would deal impartially by them. 

“ Hereupon one of his countrymen stood up, : “ Sir,” 
said he, “ leave it not for us, for you may be sensible we 
haye reason to ^senfiHvtfe them to live gallows : besides. Sir, 
this fello\v. Will Atkins', and the two others, proposed tp u*, 
that we might murder you all in your sleep, which we couid 
not consent to : but knowing their inability, and your vigi- 
lance, we did not think fit to discover it before now.” 

“ How, Seignior,” said I, “ do you hear what is alleged 
against you ? What can you say to justify so horrid an action 
as to murder us in cotd blood r” So far. Sir, w as the w retch 
from denying it, that lie swore, d-mn him but he would do 
it still. “ But what have we done to you. Seignior Atkins,” 
said I, “ or what will jou gain by killing us r What shall 
we do to prevent you r Most we kill you, or you kill us ?

such an unhappy dilemma, such a fatal necessity But so 
great a rage did my scoffing and yet severe jest, put him 
into, that he was going to fly at me, and undoubtedly had 
attempted to kill me it he had been possessed of weapons, 
and had not been prevented by three Spaniards. This un- 
paralleled and villainous carriage, made us seriously consider 
what was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spa- 
niard, who had saved the poor Indian’s life, mightily peti- 
tioned me to hang one of them for an example to the otliers, 
which should be him that had twice attempted to commit 
murder with his hatchet, it being at that time thought im- 
possible the poor slave should recover. But they could 
never gain nay consent to put him to death, for the reasons 
above-mentioned, since it was an Englishman (even your- 
self) who was my deliverer ; and as rAerciful counsels are 
jnost prevailing when earnestly pressed, so I got them to be 
of the same opinion as to clemency. But to prevent them 
doing us any farther mischief, >ve all agreed, that they should 
have no weapons, as sword, gun, powder, or shot, but be 
expelled from the society, to live as they pleased by them-" 
selves ; that neither the two Englishmen, nor the rest of the 
Spaniards, should have conversation with them upon any ac- 
count whatsoever ; that they should be kept from coming 
within a certain distance of our castle ^ and if they dared 
to offer us any violence, either by spoiling, burning, killing, 
or destroying any of the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, 
or cattle, belonging to the society, we would shoot them as 
fredy as we would do beasts of prey, in whatsoever places 
we should find them. 

“This sentence seemed very just to all but themselves ; 
when, like a merciful judge, I called out lo the two honest 
Englishmen, saying, “ You must consider tlvey ought liot to 
be starved neither ; and since it w ill be some time before they 
can raise corn and cattle of their own, let us give them some 
corn to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by which 
time they’ll raise some for themselves ; let us also bestow 
upon them six milch goats, four he ones, and six kids, as 
well for their present support, as for a further increase : 
with tools necessary for their work, as hatchets, an ax, saw, 
and other tilings convenient to build them huts: all which 
were agreed : but beiore they took them into possession, I 
o!>liged them solemnly to swear, never to attempt any thing 
a £ ain st us, or their countrymen, for the future. Thus dis-

missing them from our society, they went away, sullen and 
refractory, as though neither willing to go nor stay ; how- 
ever, seeing no remedy, they took what provision was given 
them proposing to choose a convenient place where they 
might live by themselves. 

“ About five days after, they came to those limits appoint- 
ed, in order for more victuals, and sent me word by one of 
niy Spaniards, whom they called to, where they had pitched 
their tents, and marked themselves out an habitation and 
plantation, at. the N. E and most remote part of the island. 
And, indeed, there they built themselves two-very handsome 
cottages, resembling our little castle, being under the side of 
a mountain, with some trees already growing on three sides 
of it ; so that planting a few more, "it w'ould be obscured from 
sight, unless particularly sought for. When these huts were 
finished, we gave them some dry goat-skins lor bedding and 
covering ; and upon their giving us fuller assurances ol their 
good behaviour for the future, jve gave them some peas, bar- 
ley, and rice for sowing, and whatever tools we cohid spare. 

'« Six months did they live in this separate condition, in 
which they got their first harvest in, the quantity of which 
was but small, because they had planted but little land; for, 
indeed, all their plantations being to fornr, made it more 
difficult, especially as it was a thing out of their element; 
and when they were obliged to make their boards and pots, 
&c. they could make little or nothing of it. But the rainy 
season coming on, put them into a greater perplexity for 
want of a cave to keep their corn dry, and prevent it from 
spoiling : and so much did this humble them, that they beg- 
ged of my Spaniards to help them, to which the good-natured 
men readily consented, and in four day’s space, worked a 
great hole in the side of the hill for them, large enough for 
their purpose, to secure their corn and other things from the 
rain, though not comparable to ours, which had several ad- 
ditional apartments. 

“ But a new whinrt possessed these rogues about three 
quarters of a )ear after, which had like to have ruined us, 
and themselves too ; for it seems, being tired and weary of 
this sort of living, which made them work for themselves, 
without hopes of changing their condition, nothing would 
serve them, but that they would make a voyage to the con- 
tinent, and try if they could seize, upon some of the savages, 
and bring them over as slaves, to do their drudgery, while 
they lived at ease and pleasure. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. „ 169 

Indeed the project was not so preposterous, it they had 
not gone farther; but they neither did, nor proposed any 
thing, but what had mischief in the design, or the event. — 
One morning, these three fellows came down to the limited 
station, and humbly desired to be admitted to talk with us, 
which we readily granted ; they told us, in short, that be- 
ing tired of their manner of living, and the labour of their 
hands in such employments, not being sufficient to procure 
the necessaries of life, they only desired one of the canoes 
we came over in, with some arms and ammunition for thfeir 
defence, and they would seek their fortunes abroad, and 
never trouble* us any more. To be sure, we were glad 
enough to get rid of such wretched plagues ; but yet 
honesty made us ingenuously represent to them, by what 
we ourselves had suffered, the certain destruction they were 
running into, either of being staived to death or murdered 
by the savages. To this they very audaciously replied, 
that they neither could nor would work ; and consequently 
that they might as well be starved abroad as at home ; 
and as to their falling into the hands of the savages, why, if 
they were murdered, that was nothing to us, there was an 
end of them ; neither had they any wives or children to cry 
after them : nay, so intent were they upon their voyage, that 
if the Spaniards had not given them arms, so they bid but 
the canoe they would have gone without them. 

“ Though we could not well spare our fire-arms, rather 
than they should go like naked men, we let them have two 
muskets, a pistol, a cutlass, and three hatchets, which were 
thought very sufficient ; we gave them also goats’-flesh, a 
great basket full of dried grapes, a pot of fresh butter, a 
young live kid, and a large canoe sufficient to carry twenty 
men. And thus, with a mast made of a long pole, and a 
sail of six large goat- skins dried, having a fair breeze, and 
fiood-lide with them, they merrily sailed away, the Spani- 
ards calling after them. Bon veyajo, no man ever expecting 
to see them more. 

“ When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englishmen 
would often say to one another, “ O how peaceably do we 
“ now live, since those turbulent fellows have left us - 
Nothing could be farther from their thoughts than to behold 
their faces any more ; and yet scarce two and twenty days 
bad passed over their heads, but one of the Englishmen, be- 
ing abroad a planting, perceived, at a distance, three mep.

well armed, approaching towards him. Away he flies with 
speed to our castle, and tells me and the rest, that we were 
all undone, lor that strangers were landed upon the island, 
and who they were he could not tell ; but added that they 
were not savages bat men habited, bearing arms. Why 
then, said 1, we have the less occasion to be concerned, 
since, it they were not Indians, they must be friends ; tor L 
am sure there is no Christian people upon earth, but what 
will do us good rather than harm. But while we were 
considering of the event, up came the three Englishmen, 
whose voices we quickly knew, and so all our admiral ioa 
of- that nature ceased at once. . And out wonder was suc- 
ceeded by another sort of enquiry, which was, what could 
be the occasion of their returning so quickly to the island, 
when we little expected, and much less desired their com- 
pany ? But as this was better to be related by themselves, 
I ordered them to be brought in, when they gave me the 
1 following relation of their voyage. 

“ After two days sail, or something less, they reached 
land, where they found the people coming to give them 
another sort of reception than what they expected or desir- 
ed : for, as the savages were armed with bows and arrows, 
they durst not venLure on shore, but steered northward, six 
or seven hours, till they gained an opening, by which they 
plainly perceived, that the land that appeared from this 
place, was not the main land, but an island. At their en- 
trance into the opening of the sea, they discovered another 
island on the right hand northward, and several more lying 
to the westward ; but being resolved to go^on shore some 
where or other, they put over to one of the western islands. 
Here they found the natives very courteous to them, giving 
them several roots and dried fish ; nay, even their women 
too were as willing to supply them with what they 
could procure them to eat, bringing it a great way to 
them upon their heads. Among those hospitable Indians 
they continued some days, inquiring by signs and tokens, 
what nations lay around them ; and were informed, that 
there were several fierce and terrible people lived every 
wav, accustomed to eat mankind ; but for themselves they 
never used such diet, except those that were taken in battle, 
and of them they made a solemn feast.

ago; pointing to the moon ; and then two fingers ; that, 
at this time, their king had two hundred prisoners, which 
were fattening up for the slaughter. The Englishmen 
were mighty desirous of seeing the prisoners, which the 
others mistaking, thought that they wanted some of them 
for their own rood : upon which they beckoned to them, 
pointing to the rising, and then to the setting of the sun ; 
meaning, that by the time it appeared in the cast next 
morning, they would bring them some ; and indeed they 
were as good as their word ; for by that time they brought 
eleven men and five women, just as so many cows and 
oxen are brought to sea-port towns, to victual a ship. But 
as brutish as th.ese Englishmen were, their stomachs turned 
at the sight. What to do in this case, they could not tell : 
to refuse the prisoners, would have been the highest atfroni 
offered to the savage gentry ; and to dispose of them, they 
knew not in what manner ; however, they resolved to ac- 
cept them, and so gave them, in return, one of their 
batchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their 
bullets ; things which, tho’ they were wholly ignorant of, 
yet they seemed entirely contented with ; and dragging the 
poor wretches into the boat, with their hands bound behind 
them, delivered them to the Englishmen. But this obliged 
them to put off as soon as they had these presents, lest the 
donors should have expected two or three of them to be 
killed, and to be invited to dinner the next day ; and so 
taking leave with all possible respect and thanks, though 
neither of them undersU)od what the others said, they sailed 
away back to the first island, and there set eight of the 
prisoners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured to 
comfort, and have some conversation with the poor cap- 
fives ; but it was impossible to make them sensible of any 
thing ; and nothing they could say or give, or do for them, 
could make them otherwise persuaded, but that they were 
unbound only to be devoured : if they gave them any 
food, they thoitght it was only to fatten them for the 
slaughter; or looked at any one more particularly, the 
poor creature supposed itself to be the first sacrifice ; and 
even when we brought them to our island, and began to 
use them with the greatest humanity and kindness, yet they 
expected every day that their new masters would devour 
them. 

“ And thus. Sir, did these three strange wanderers con- 
clude their unaccountable relation of their voyage, which

was both amazing and entertaining. Hereupon, I asked 
them, where their new family was ? They told me, they had 
put them into one of their huts, and they came to beg some 
victuals for them. This, indeed, made us all long to see 
them ; and taking Friday’s father with us, leaving only two 
at our castle, we came down to behold these poor creatures. 

“ When we arrived at the hut, (they being bound again 
by the Englishmen, for tear of escaping) we found them 
btark naked, expecting their fatal tragedy : there were 
three lusty men, well shaped, w ith straight and good limbs, 
between thirty and five and thirty years'old ; and five wo- 
men, two of them might be from thirty to forty, tw r o more 
not above four and twenty ; and the last, a comely tall 
maiden of about seventeen. Indeed, all the women were 
very agreeable, both in proportion and features, except 
that they were taw’ny, which their modest behaviour, and 
other graces, made amends for, when they afterwards 
came to be clothed, 

“ This naked appearance, together with their miserable 
circumstances, w as no very comfortable sight to my Spa- 
niards, who, for their parts, I may venture. Sir, without 
flattery, to say, are men of the best behaviour, calmest 
tempers, and sweetest nature, that can possibly be ; for 
they immediately ordered Friday’s father to see if he knew 
any of them, or if be understood what they could say. 
No sooner did the old Indian appear, but he looked at 
them with great seriousness ; yet, as they w’ere not of his 
nation, they were utter strangers to him, and none could 
understand his speech or signs, but one woman. This was 
enough to answer his design, which was to assure them 
they would not be killed, being fallen into the hands of 
Christians, who abhorred such barbarity. When they 
were fully satisfied of this, they expressed their joy by such 
strange gestures, and uncommon tones, as it is not possible 
for me to describe. But the woman, their interpreter, was 
ordered next to inquire, w hether they were content to be 
servants, and would work for the men who had brought 
them hither to save their lives? Hereupon, (being at this 
time unbound) they fell a capering and dancing, one taking 
this thing upon her shoulders, and the other that, intimat- 
ing, that they were willing to do any thing for them. But 
now. Sir, having women among us, and dreading that 
it might occasion some strife, if not blood, J asked the three

men what they would do, and how they intended to use 
these creatures, whether as servants or women ? One of them 
very pertly and readily answered, they would use them as 
boiii. Gentlemen, said I, as you are your own masters, I 
am ne t going to restrain you -from that ; but methinks, for 
avoiding dissentions among you, 1 would only desire you to 
engage, that none of you will take more than one for a wo- 
man or wife, and that having taken this one, ijoneelse should 
presume to touch her ; for though we have not a priestly 
authority to marry you, yet it is but reasonable, that who- 
ever thus lakes a woman, should be obliged to maintain her, 
since nobody has any thing to do with her ; and this, in- 
deed, appeared sojust to all present, that it was unanimously 
agreed to. The Englishmen then asked my Spaniards, whe- 
ther they designed to take any of them r but they all an- 
swered, No ; some declaring they had already wives in 
Spain ; and others that they cared not to join with infidels. 
On the reverse, the Englishmen took each of them a tem- 
porary wife, and so set up a new method of living. As to 
Friday’s father, the Spaniards, and the three savage servants 
we had taken in the late battle, they all lived with me ih 
.our ancient castle ; and indeed we supplied the main part 
*%f the island with food, as necessity required. But the most 
remarkable part of the story is, how these Englishmen, who 
had been so much at variance, should agree about the choice 
«f those women ; yet they took a way good enough to pre- 
vent quarrelling among themselves. They set the five wo- 
men in one of their huts, and going themselves to the other, 
drew lots which should have the first choice. Now, he 
that had the first lot went to the hut, and fetched out her 
he chose ; and it is remarkable, that lie took her tiiat was 
the most homely and eldest of the number, which made the 
rest of the Englishmen exceedingly merry ; the Spaniards 
-themselves could not but smile at it ; but, as it happened, 
the fellow had the best thought, in choosing one fit for ap- 
plication and business ; Rnd indeed she proved the best 
wife of all the parcel. 

But when the poor creatures perceived themselves placed 
in a row, and separated one by one, they were again seized 
with an unspeakable terror, as now thinking they were going 
to be slain in earnest ; and when the Englishmen came to 
‘take the first, the rest set up a lamentable cry, clasped their

arms round her neck, and hanging about her, took their 
last farewell, as they thought, in such* trembling agonies, 
and affectionate embraces, as would have softened the hard- 
est heart in the world, and made the driest eyes melt into 
tears ; nor could they be persuaded but that they were going 
to die, till such time as Friday’s father made them sensible 
that the Englishmen had chosen them for their wives, which 
•ended all their terror and concern upon this occasion. 

, “ Well, after this, the Englishmen went to work, and be- 
ing assisted by my good-natured Spaniards, in a few hours 
ihey erected every one of them a new hut or tent for their 
separate lodging, since those they had already were filled 
with tools, household stuff, and provision. They allcon- 
tinued on the north shore of the island, but -separate as be; 
fore ; the three wicked ones pitched farther oft, and the t\vo 
honest men -nearer our castle; so that the island Seemed to 
he peopled in three places, three towns beginning to be built 
for that purpose. And here I cannot but remark, what is 
very common, that the two honest men had the worst wieei, 

(I mean as to industry, cleanliness, and ingenuity) while the 
.three reprobates enjoyed women of contrary qualities'. 

"But another observation I made was, in favour of the 
"two honest men, to show what disparity there is between a 
diligent application to business, on the one hand, and a sloth- 
ful, negligent, and idle temper, on the other. Both of 
them had die same parcel of ground laid out, and corn to 
sow, sufficient for them ; but both did not make the same 
improvements, either in their cultivation or their planting. 
The two-honest men had a multitude of young trees planted 
about their habitations, so that when you approached near 
them, nothing appeared but a wood, very pleasing and de- 
lightful. Every thing they did prospered and flourished ; 
their grapes planted in order, seemed as though managed in 
a vineyard,and wereinfinitely preferable to any ofthe others. 
Nor wore they wanting to find out a place of retreat, but 
dug a cave in the most retired part of a thick wood, to se- 
cure their wives and children, with their provision and chief- 
est goods, surrounded with Innumerable stakes, and having 
a most subtle entrance, in case any mischief should happen, 
either from their fellow country men, or the devouring savages. ' 
“ As to the reprobates, (though I must own they were 
much more civilized than before) instead of a delightful wood 
surrounding their dwellings, we found the w ords -of King

Solomon too truly verified ; “ I went by the vineyard of the 
“ slothful, and ii was all overgrown with thorns." In many 
places their crop was obscured by weeds; the hedges having 
several gaps in them, the wild goals had got in, and eaten 
up the corn, and here and there was a dead bush to stop 
these gaps for the present, which was no more than shutting 
the staolo door after the steed was stolen away. But as to 
their wives, they (as I observed before) were more diligent, 
and cleanly enough,, especially in their victuals, being in- 
structed by one ot the honest men, who had been a cook’s 
mate on board a ship ; and very well it was so ; for as he 
cooked himself, his companion and their families lived as 
well as the idle husbands, who did nothing but loiter about, 
fetch turtle’s eggs, patch fish and birds, and do any thing but 
work, aud lived accordingly ; while the diligent lived very 
handsomely and plentifully, in the most comfortable manner. 

“ And now. Sir, 1 come to lay before your eyes a scene 
quite different .from any thing that ever happened to us be- 
tore, and perhaps ever hefel you in all the time ot yonf 
residence on this island. I shall inform you of its original 
in the following manner s 

“ One morning. Sir, very early, there came five or six 
•anoes of Indians on shore, indisputably upon their old cus- 
tom of devouring their prisoners. Alt that we had to do 
upon suefi an occasion, was to lie concealed, that they, riot 
having any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly, after 
performing their bloody execution : whoever first discovered 
the savages, was to- give notice to ail the three plantations 
to keep within doors, and then a proper scout was to be 
placed to give intelligence of -their departure. But, not- 
withstanding these wise measures, an unhappy disaster dis- 
covered as to. the savages, which was like to have-paused 
the desolation of the whole island-; ior, after the savages 
were gone off in their canoes, some of my Spaniards and I 
looking abroad, and being inflamed with a curiosity d 0 she 
what they had been doing, to our great amazement beheld 
three savages, fast asleep on the ground, who, either being 
gorged, pould not awake when the others vyent off, or havirig 
wandered too far into the woods, did not come back in time. 

“ What to do with them at first, we could not tell ; as for 
slaves we had enough of them already; and as to killing 
them, neither Christianity or humanity would suffur us to

shed the blood of persons who never did us wrong'. We 
perceived they Imd no boat left them to transport them to 
their own nation ; and that, by letting tliein wander about, 
they might discover us, and inform the first savages that 
should happen to land upon the same bloody; occasion, which 
information might entirely ruin- os ; and therefore I coun- 
selled my Spaniards to secure them,, and set them- about 
some work or other, till we could better dispose of them. 

" Hereupon we ad went back., and making them awake* 
took them prisoners. It is impossible to express, the horror 
they were in, especially when bound, as thinking they were 
going to be murdered and eaten, but we soon eased them of 
t heir fear asto that point. We first took, them to the bowei^ 
•where the chief of eur country work lay, as keeping goats* 
planting corn, &c. and then carried them, to the two, Eng- 
lishmen’s habitation, to help them in their business ; but 
happy it was for us all we did not carry them to oar castle, 
&s by the sequel will appear. The Englishmen, indeed* 
found them work to do ; but whether they did. not guard 
them strictly, or that they thought they could not better them- 
selves, I cannot tell ; but certainly one of them ran away into 
the woods, and they could nothearof him for along time after; 

Undoubtedly there was reason enough to suppose he gat 
borne in some of the canoes, the savages returning m about 
four weeks time* and going oft in the space of two day$.-*t 
You may be certain. Sir, this thought could not bat terrify 
us exceedingly, and make us justly conclude, that the savage 
\yould inform bis countrymen of our abode in the island, 
hew few and weak we were in comparison to their numbers} 
and we expected it would not be long before the English- 
men would be attacked in tlicvr habitations but the savages 
had pet scentheir places of safety in the woods, nor oar 
castle, which, it was a great happiness they did net know. 

P UjUjot were w« mistaken in oar thoughts upon this »c- 
easiou ; fosabout eight months after this,- six, canoes, with 
about tejv.roen hr each canoe, came sailing by the north-side

good fortune to. discover them about a league off: so that it 
was an hour before they could attain the shore, and some 
time longer before they could come at them. And now be- 
ing confirmed in this opinion that they were certainly be-

♦rayed, they immediately bound the two slaves which were 
Ielt, causing two of the three men, whom they brought with 
the women, and who proved very faithful, to lead them with 
their wives, and other conveniencies, into their retired cave 
in the wood, and there to bind the two fellows hand and 
foot, till they had further orders. They then opened their 
fences, where they kept their milch goats, and drove them 
• all out, giving the goats liberty to ramble in the woods, to 
make the savages believe that they were wild ones ; but the 
slave had given a truer information, which made them come 
to the very inclosures. The two frightened men sent the. 
other slave of the three, who had been with them, by acci- 
dent, to alarm the Spaniards, and desire their assistance ; in. 
the mean time they took their arms and ammunition, and 
made to the cave where they had sent their wives, and se- 
curing their slaves, seated themselves in a private place, 
from whence they might behold all the actions of the savages,- 
Nor had they gone far; when ascending. a rising ground, 
they could see a little army of Indians approach to their 
beautiful dwelling, and in a few moments more, perceive 
the same, and their furniture^ to their unspeakable grief, . 
burning in a consuming flume and when this was done, 
they spread here and thore, searching every bush and place 
for the people, of whom it was evident they had information. 
Upon , which the two Englishmen, not thinking themselves 
secure where they stood, retreated about half a mile higher 
in the country, rightly concluding, that tbfc farther the sa- 
vages strolled, there would be less numbers together : upon 
•which they next took their stand by the trunk of an old tree, 
very hollow and large, .wlienco they, resolved to see what 
would offer ; . but they had not stood long there, before two 
savages came running, directly towards them, as though 
having knowledge of their being there, who seemed resolved 
to attack them ; a little farther were three more, and five 
more behind them again, all running, the same way. It 
cannot be imagined the perplexity the poor men were in at 
this sight, thinking that if assistance did not speedily come, 
their cave in the wood w r ould be discovered, ana conse- 
quently all therein lost; so they resolved to resist them there, 
and, when overpowered, to ascend to the top of the trees, 
where they might defend themselves as long as their am mu- 
nition lasted, and sell their lives as dear as possible to those

devouring savages. Thus fixed in their resolution, they 
next considered, whether they should fire at the first two, or 
wait ior the three, and so take the middle party, by which 
the two first and the five last would be separated. In this 
regulation the two savagcsralso confirmed them, by turning 
a little to another part of the wood ; but the three, and the 
five after them, came directly towards the tree. Hereupon 
they resolved to take them in a direct line, as they approach- 
ed nearer, because perhaps, the first shot might hit them all 
three; and upon this occasion, the man who was to fire, 
charged his piece with three or four bullets. And thus 
while they were waiting, the savages came on, one of them 
was the runaway, who had caused all the mischief : so they 
resolved he should not escape, if they both fired at once — 
But, however, though they did not fire together, they were 
ready charged ; when the first that let fly, was too good a 
marksman to miss bis aim ; for be killed the foremost out- 
right, the second (who w*as the runaway Indian) fell to the 
ground, being shot through the body, but not dead, and the 
third was a little wounded in the shoulder, who, sitting 
down on the ground, fell a screaming- in a most fearful man- 
ner. The noise of the guns, which not only made the most 
resounding echoes, from one side to the other, but raised 
the birds of all sorts, fluttering w'ith the most confused noise, 
so much terrified the five sac-ages behind, that they stood 
still at first, like so many inanimate images. But when ail 
things were in profound silence, they came tothe place where 
their companions lay ; and here, not being sensible that 
they were liable to the same fate, stood over the wounded 
man, undoubtedly inquiring the occasion of this calamity ; 
and ’tis as reasonable to suppose, he told them, that it came 
by thunder anti lightning from the gods, having never seen 
•r beard of a gun beiore, in the whole course of their lives. 
By this time the Englishmen, having loaded their pieces, 
.fired both together a second time, when seeing them all fall 
immediately on the ground, they thought they had killed 
every creature of them. This made them come up boldly 
before they had charged their guns, which, indeed, wa> a 
wrong step ; tor, when they came to the place, they found 
four alive, two of them very little wounded, and one not at 
ail, which obliged them to fall upon them with their muskets; 
they first knocked the runaway savage on the head, and 
another that -was but little wounded in the arm, and then

put the other languishing wretches out of their pain ; while 
he that was not hurt, with bended knees and uplift hands; 
made piteous n>oans, and signs to them to spare his life \ 
nor, indeed, were they unmerciful to the poor wretch, but 
pointing to him tosit down at the root of a tree hard by ; and 
then, one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope twine he 
had in his pocket, by mere chance, tying his feet fast to- 
gether, and his two hands behind him, they left him there, 
making all the haste they could after the other two, fearing 
they should find out their cave ; but though they could not 
overtake them, they had the satisfaction to perceive them 
at a distance, cross a valley towards the sea, a quite con- 
trary way to their retreat ; upon which they returned to the 
tree, to look after their prisoner ; but when they came there 
he was gone, leaving the piece of rope-yarn, wherewith he 
was bound, behind him. 

“ Well, now they were as much concerned as ever, as 
not knowing how near their enemies might be, or in what 
numbers. Immediately they repaired to the cave, to see if 
all was well there, and found every thing safe, except the 
women, who Were frightened upon their husbands account, 
whom they now loved entirely. They had not been long 
here, before seven of my Spaniards, came to assist them ; 
while the other ten, their servants, and Friday’s father, were 
gone to defend their bower, corn, and catllo, in case the 
savages should have rambled so far. There accompanied 
the seven Spaniards, one of the three savages that had for- 
merly been taken prisoner ; and with them also that very 
Indian whom the Englishmen had, a little before, left under 
the tree ; for it seems, they passed by that way where the 
slaughter was made, and so carried along with them that 
poor wretch that was left bound. But so many prisoners '' 
how becoming a burthen to u$, and fearing the dreadful 
consequence of their escaping, most of the Spaniards and • 
English urged the absolute necessity there was of killing • 
them for our comm'On preservation ; but. Sir, the authority 
I bore, as governor, over-ruled that piece of cruelty ; and 
then I ordered them to be sent prisoners to the old cave in 
the valley, bound hands and feet, with two Spaniards to 
guard them. - ' 

u So much 'encouraged were the Englishmen at the ap- 
proach of the Spaniards, and so great was their fury against 
the savages for destroying their habitations, that they bad

pot patience to stay any longer ; but, taking five Spaniards 
along with them, armed with lour muskets, a pistol, and a 
quarter staff, away they went in pursuit of their enemies- 
As they passed by the place where the savages were slain, 
it was very easy to be perceived that more of them ha<i 
been there, having attempted to carry off their dead bodies, 
but found it impracticable. From a rising ground, our party 
had the mortification to see the smoke that proceeded from 
the ruins ; when coming farther in sight of tire shore, they 
plainly perceived that the savages had embarked in their 
canoes, and were putting out to sea. This they wore very 
sorry for, there being r.o coming at them to give them a 
parting sahite ; but, however, they were glad enough to- 
get clear of such unwelcome guests- 

“ Thus the two honest, but Unfortunate Englishmen, be- 
ing ruined a second' time, and their improvements quite de- 
stroyed, most of my good-natured Spaniards helped them to 
rebuild, and we all assisted them w ith needful supplies; nay> 
what is niore remarkable, their three mischievous country- 
men, when they heard of it, (which as after all these disaster* 
were over, they living more remote eastward) veiy friendly 
sympathized with them, and worked for them several days ^ 
so that, inalittle,theirhabitationsyveEe rebuilt, their necessities 
supplied, and themselves restored to their former tranqniHity t 
“ Though the savages bad nothing to boast of in this ad- 
venture, (seveial canoes being driven ashore, followed by 
two drowned creatures, having undoubtedly met with a 
storm at sea that very night they departed) yet it was natural* 
to be supposed, tliat those whose better fortune it was to 
attain their native shore, would inflame their nation to. 
another ruinous attempt/ with a greater force to carry all 
before them. And, indeed, so it happened : for about seven 
months after, our island was invaded with a most formidable 
navy, no less than eight and twenty canoes full of savages, 
armed with wooden swords, monstrous clubs, bows- and 
arrows, and such like instruments of war, landing at the 
cast-end of the island. . 

" You may well, Sir, imagine, what consternation, oup 
men were in upon this account,,and how speedy they were 
to execute their resolution, having only that night’s time 
allowed them. They knew, that since they could not with- 
stand their enemies, concealment was the only way to pro- 
cure their safety ; and, therefore, they took down the. huts

that were built for the two Englishmen, and drove. their 
fbck of goats, together with their own at the bower, to the 
old cave in the valley, leaving as litilo appearance of in- 
habitants as possible ; and then posted Liieiuselves, with all 
their force, at the plantation of the two men. As they ex- 
pected,. so it happened ; for early die next morning, tha 
Indians* leaving their canoes at the east-end of die. island, 
came running along the shore, about two hundred andfitiy 
in number, as near as could be guessed. Our army was bu$ 
little indeed; and. what was our greatest misfortune, we had 
not arms sufficient for them. The account, as to the men, 
Sir, is as follows; viz. 17 Spaniards, 5 Englishmen* Okl Fri- 
day, the three savages, taken with the five women, wh# 
proved faithful servants, and three other slaves, living with 
the Spaniards. To arm these, they bad i 1 muskets, 5 pisr 
tois, i fowling-pieces, 2 swords, 3 old halberts, 5 muskets, 
or fowling-pieces, taken from the sailors whom you reduced. 
As to the slaves, we gave three of them halberts, and the 
Other three long staves* with great iron sjfikes at the end 
of them, with hatchets by their sides ; we also, had hatchets 
sticking in our girdles, besides the fire-arms : nay, two of 
the women, inspired with Amazonian fortitude, could not 
be dissuaded from fighting along with their dear husbands, 
and if they died, to die with them. Seeing their resolution* 
wagawe them hatchets likewise;, but w bat pleased then* 
hest, were the bows, and arrows (which they! dexterously 
knew how. to use) that the Indians had left behind them, 
after their memorable battle one against another. 

“ Over this army, which though little* was of great in- 
trepidity*! was constituted chief general and commander; 
and knowing Will Atkins* though exceedingly wicked, yet 
a, man of invincible courage* ! gave him the power of coav 
Branding under me; he bad six men with their muskets

three* of his men to give fire, so great was their eenstern*- 
tiorvto see so many men killed and wounded, and hear such 
a dreadful noise, and jet knew not whence it came, that 
they were frightened to the highest degree ; and when the 
second volley was given, they concluded no less but that 
their companions were slain by thunder and lightning from 
Heaven. In this notion they would have continued, had 
Will Atkins and his men retired, as soon as they had fired,, 
according to order ; or had the rest been neat them to pour 
in their shot continually, there might have been a complete 
victory obtained ; but slaying to load their pieces again, 
discovered the whole matter. They were perceived by 
some of the sc attering savages at a distance, who let fly their 
arrow s among them, wounded Atkins himself, and killed his 
fellow Englishman, and one of the Indians taken with the 
women. Our party did not failto answer them, and in their 
retreat killed about twenty savages. Here I cannot but 
take notice of our poor dying slave, who, tho’ stopt from 
his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his staff and hatchet* 
desperately and gallantly assailed his pursuers, and killed 
five of the savages, before his life submitted to a multiplicity 
•f wounds. jNor is the cruelty, or malice of the Indians to 
be less remarked, in breaking the arms, legs, and heads of 
the two dead bodies, with their clubs and wooden swords, 
after a most wretched manner. As Atkins retreated out 
party advanced, to interpose between him and the savages ; 
but, after three vollies, we were obliged to retreat also; 
for they were so numerous and desperate, that they came 
up to our very teeth, shot their arrows like a cloud, and 
their wounded men, enraged with cruel pain, fought likfc 
madmen. They did not, however, think fit to fallow us, but 
drawing themselves up in a circle, they gave two triumphant 
shouts in token of victory, though they had the grief to see 
several of their wounded men bleed to dea-tli before them. 

After 1 had. Sir, drawn up our little army together, upon 
a rising ground, Atkins, wounded us he was, would have 
had us attack the whole body of the savages at once. I 
was extremely well pleased, with the gallantry of the man:* 
but, upon consideration, 1 replied, “You perceive, Seig- 
“nior Atkins, how their wounded men fight; let them 
“ alone till morning, when they will be faint, stiffs and sore, 
"and then we shall have fewer to combat, with.” To 
which Atkius, smiling replied, “ That’s very true, Seig*

nior, so shall I too ; and that’s the reason I would fight 
them now I am warm.” We all answered, Seignior 
Atkins for your part, you have behaved very gallantly ; and, 
it you are not able to approach the enemy in the morning, 
we wiil fight for you, till then we think it convenient to 
wait, and so we tarried. 

" By the brightness of the moon that night, we perceived 
the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded 
men. This made us change our resolution, and resolve to 
fall upon them in the night, if we could give them one vol- 
ley undiscovered. This we had a fair opportunity to do' 
by one of the two Englishmen leading us round, between 
the woods and the sea-side westward, and turning short 
South, came privately to a place where the thickest of fhcin 
were. Unheard and unperceivcd, eight of us fired among 
them, and did dreadful execution ; and in half a minute 
aftci% eight more of us let fly, killing and wounding abund- 
ance of them ; and then dividing ourselves into three bodies, 
eight persons in each body, we inarched from among the 
trees, to the very teeth of the enemy, sending forth the 

S reatest shouts and acclamations. The savages hearing a 
iflerent noise from three quarters at once, stood in the 
utmost confusion ; but coming in sight of us, let fly a volley 
of arrows, which w ounded poor old Friday, yet happily it 
jfid not prove mortal. We did not, however, give them a 
second opportunity ; but rushing in among them, w e fired 
three several ways, and then fell to work with our swords, 
staves, hatchets, and the butt-end of our muskets, vvjtli. a 
fury not to be resisted; so that, with the most dismal scream- 
ing and howling thev had recourse to their feet, to save their 
lives by a speedy flight. Nor must we forget ttie valour 
of the two women ; for they exposed themselves to the 
greatest dangers killed many with their arrows, and valiant- 
ly destroyed several more with their hatchets. 

“In fighting these two battles, we were so much tired, 
that we did not then trouble ourselves to pursue tjiem to 
their canoes, in which we thought they would presently 
put to the ocean ; but their happening a dreadful storm at 
sea, which continuing all that night, it not only prevented their 
voyage, but dashed several of their boats to pieces against 
the beach, and drove the rest so high upon the shore, that it 
• required infinite labour to get them ofT. After our men had 
taken some refreshment and a little repose, they resolved

•early in the morning to go towards the place tjf their land- 
ing, and see whether they were gone oft, or in what posture 
they remained. This necessarily led them to the place of 
battle, where several ol the savages were expiring, a sight 
no way pleasing to generous minds, to delight in misery, 
though obliged to conquer them by the law of arms ; but 
our own Indian slaves put them out of their pain, by de- 
spatching them with their hatchets. At length coming in 
Tiew of the remainder of the army, we found them leaning 
upon their knees, which were bended towards their mouth, 
and the head between the two hands. Hereupon, coming 
within musket-shot of them, l ordered two pieces to be fired 
without ball, in order to alarm them, that we might plainly 
know, whether they had the courage to venture another 
battle, or were utterly dispirited from such an attempt, that 
so we might accordingly manage them. And, indeed, the 
project took very well ; for, no sooner did the savages hear 
the first gun, and perceive the Hash of the second, but they 
Suddenly started upon their feet, in the greatest consterna- 
tion ; and when we approached towards them, they ran 
howling and screaming away up the hill into the country. 

“ t\ e could rather, at first, have wished, that the weather 
had permitted them to have gone off to the sea ; but when 
we consider, that their escape might occasion the approach 
of multitudes, to our utter ruin and desolation, we were 
very well pleased the contrary happened : Will Atkhis 
(who, though wounded, would not part from us all this while) 
advised us not to let slip this advantage, but clapping be- 
tween them and their boats, deprive them of the capacity 
of ever returning to plague the island : “ 1 know,” said he, 
'** there is but one objection you can make, which is, that 
<f these creatures living like beasts in the wood, may make 
“ excursions, rifle the plantations, and destroy the tame 
" goats ; but then, consider, we had better to do with an 
“hundred men, whom we can kill, or make slaves of at 
** leisure, than with an hundred nations, whom it is im- 
" possible we should save ourselves from, much less sub- 
*" due.” This advice, and these arguments being approved 
of, we set fire to their boats ; and though they were so wet 
that we could not bum them entirely, yet we made them 
incapable for swimming in the seas. As soon as the Indians 
: perceived what we were doing, many of them ran out of tire 
woods, in sight of us and kneeling down, piteously cried out.

0«, 0«, Waramakoa. Intimating, I suppose, that, if we would 
but spare their canoes, they would never trouble us again. 

“But all their complaints, submissions, and entreaties, 
were in vain ; for selt-preservation obliging us to the con- 
trary, we destroyed every one of them that had escaped the 
fury of the ocean. When the Indians perceived this, they 
raised a lamentable cry, and ran into the woods, where they 
continued ranging about,' making the woods ring with their 
lamentation. Here we should have considered, that making 
these creatures thus desperate, we ought, at the same time 
to have set a sufficient guard upon the plantations : for the 
savages, in their ranging about, found out the bower, de- 
stroyed the fences, trod the corn down under their feet* and 
tore up the vines and grapes. It is true, we were always 
able to tight these creatures ; but as they were too swift for 
us, and very numerous, we durst not go out single, for fear 
of them ; though that too was needless, they having no 
weapons, nor any materials to make them : and indeed, 
their extremity appeared in a little time after. 

“Though the savages, as already mentioned, had de- 
stroyed our bower, and all our qorn, grapes, &c. yet we 
had still left our stock of cattle in the valley, by the cave, 
with some little corn that grew there, and the plantation of 
Will Atkins and his companions, one of whom being killed 
by an arrow, they were now, reduced to two : it is remark- 
able that this was the fellow who -cut the poor Indian with 
his hatchet, and had a design to murder me and my coun- 
trymen the Spaniards. As our condition was so low, we 
came to the resolution to drive the savages up to the farther 
part of the island, where no Indians lauded ; to kill as many 
of them as we could, till we had reduced their number ; and 
then to give the remainder some corn to plant, and to teach 
them how to live by their daily labour. Accordingly we 
pursued them with our guns, at lire hearing of which they 
were so terrified, that they would fall to the ground.— 
Every day we killed and wounded some of them, and many 
were found starved to death, so that our hearts began to re- 
lent at the sight of such miserable objects. At last, with 
great difficulty, taking one of them alive, and using him 
with kindness, and tenderness, we brought him to old Fri- 
day, who talked to him, and told him how good we would 
be to them all, giving them corn and land to plant and live 
in, and present nourishment, provided they should keep

■w ithin such bounds as should be allotted thorn, and not de 
prejudice to others : “ Co then," said he, “ and inform 
“ your countrymen of this ; which, if they w ill not agree to, 
“ every one of them shall be slain." 

“ The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being reduced 
to about thirty seven, joyfully accepted the offer, and earn- 
estly begged tor food ; hereupon we sent twelve Spaniards 
and two Englishmen, well armed, together with old Friday, 
and three Indian slaves were loaded with a large quantity 
of bread and Tice cakes, with three live goats: and the 
poor Indians being ordered to sit down on the side of the 
hill, they ate the victuals very thankfully, and have proved 
faithful to the last, never trespassing beyond their bounds, 
where at this day they quietly and happily remain, and 
where we now and then visit them. They are confined to 
a neck of land about a mile and a half broad, and three or 
four in length, on the south-east corner of the island, the 
sea being before, and lofty mountains behind them, free 
from the appearance of canoes ; and indeed their country- 
men never made any inquiry after them. We gave them 
twelve hatchpts, and three or four knives ; have taught 
, them to build huts, make wooden spades, plant corn, make 
bread, breed tame goats and milk them, as likewise to make 
wicker-work, in which I must ingenuously confess, they 
infinitely outdo us, having made themselves several pretty 
necessaries and fancies, as baskets, sieves, birdcages, and 
cupboards, as also stools, beds, and couches, no less useful 
than delightful ; and now they live the most innocent and 
inoffensive creatures that ever were subdued in the world, 
wantirg nothing but wives to make them a nation. 

“Thus, kind Sir, have . I given you, according to my 
ability an impartial account of the various- transactions that 
have happened in the island •since your departure, to this 
day; and we have great reason to acknowledge the kind 
.providence of Heaven in our merciful deliverance. When 
you inspect your little kingdom, -you will find in it some 
little improvement, your docks increased, and your subjects 
augmented, -so that from a desolate island, as this was before 
your wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a visible pros- 

E ect of its becoming a populous and well governed little 
ingdom, to your immortal lamesnd glory!"

less surprising to me, to the young priest, and to all who 
heard it : nor were these people less pleased with those 
necessary utensils that I brought them, such as the knives, 
scissars, spades, shovels, and pick-axes, with which Urey 
now adorn their habitations. 

So much had they addicted themselves to wicker-work, 
prompted by the ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted them, 
that when I viewed the Englishmen’s colonies, they seemed 
at a distance as though they had lived like bees in a hive : 
for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious 
and sober man, had made himself a tent of basket-work 
round the outside ; the walls were worked in as a basket, 
in pannels or strong squares of thirty-two in number, stand- 
ing about seven feet high: in the middle was another, not 
above twenty-two paces round, but much stronger built, 
being of an octagonal form, and in the eight corners stood 
eight strong posts, rotind the top of which he laid strong 
pieces, pinned with wooden pins, from which he raised a 
pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, I assure yon, and joined 
very well together, with iron spikes, which he made him- 
self ; for he 1 ad made him a forge, with a pair of wooden 
bellows and charcoal for his work, forming an anvil out of 
one of the iron crows, to work upon, and in this manner 
would he. make himself hook?, staples,. spikes, bolts, and 
hinges. After he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, 
he made it so firm between the rafters with basket-work, 
thatching that over again with rice-straw, and over that a 
huge leaf of a tree, that his house was as dry as if it had 
'been tiled or slated. The outer circuit was covered as a 
lean to, quite round this inner apartment, laying long rafters, 
from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner 
house, about twenty feet distant -o that there was a space 
like a wall between the outer and inner wall, near twenty 
feet in breadth. The inner place he partitioned od’ with 
the same wicker-work, dividing it into six neat apartments 
every one of which had a dooi*, first into, the entry of the 
main tent, and another into the space and walk that was 
round it, not only convenient for retreat, but for family ne-‘ 
cessaries. Within the door of the outer circle, there was » 
passage directly to the door of the inner-house; on either 
side was a wicker partition, and a door, by which }ou got 
into a room twenty-two feet wide, and about thirty long.

and through that into another of a smaller length ; so that in 
the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which 
were only to be come at through the apartments ot the in- 
ner tent, serving as retiring rooms to the respective cham- 
bers of the inner circle, and tour large warehotWts, which 
went in through one anotiier, two on either hand ot the 
passage that led through the outer door to the inner tent. — 
In short nothing could be built more ingeniously, kept more 
neat, or have better conveniences; and here lived the 
three families. Will Atkins, his companion, their wives and 
children, and the widow of the deceased. As to religion, 
the men seldom taught their syives the knowledge of God, 
any more than the sailors* custom of swearing by his name. 
The greatest improvement their wives had, was, they 
taught them to speak English, so as to be understood* 

None of their children were then above six years old ; 
they were all fruitful enough ; and I think the cook's male's 
wife was big of her sixth child. 

When I inquired of the Spaniards about their circum- 
stances while among the savages, they told me, that they 
abandoned themselves to despair, reckoning themselves a 
poor and miserable people, that had no means put into their 
hands, and consequently must soon be starved to death. — 
They owned, however, that they were in the wrong to think 
so, and for refusing the assistance that reason offered for 
their support, as well as future deliverance, confessing that 
grief was a most insignificant passion, as it looked upon 
things as without remedy, and having no hope of tilings to 
come ; all which verified this noted proverb. 

In trouble to be troubled, 

Is to lure your trouble doubled. 

Nor did these remarks end here; For, making observa- 
tions upon my improvement, and on my condition at first, 
infinitely worse than theirs, he told me, that Englishmen 
had, in their distress, greater presence of mind than those 
of any other country that he had met with ; and that they 
and (he Portuguese were the worst men in the world to 
struggle under misfortunes. When they landed among the 
savages, they found but little provision except they would 
turn cannibals, there being but a few roots and herbs, with 
litttle substance in them, and of which the natives gave them

Bat very sparingly. Many were the ways they took to 
civilize and teacii the savages, but in vain ; for they would 
not own them to be their instructors, whose lives were ow- 
ing to their bounty. Their extremities were very great, 
and many days being entirely without food, the savages 
there being more indolent and less devouring than those who 
had better supplies. When they went out to battle they^ 
were obliged to assist these people, in one of which. my- 
faithful Spaniard being taken, had like to have been de- 
voured. They had' lost their ammunition, which rendered 
their fire-arms useless ; nor could they use the bows and 
arrow's that w ere given them, so that while the armies were 
at a distance, they had no chance, but when close, then they 
could be ef service with halberts, and sharpened sticks put 
into the muzzles of their muskets. They made themselves 
, targeis of w ood, covered with the skins of wild-beasts ; and 
when one happened to be knocked down, the rest of the~~ 
company fought over him till he recovered : and then stand- 
ing close in a line, they would make their way through a 
thousand savages. At the return of their friend, who they 
thought had been entombed in the bowels of their enemies,^, 
their joy was inconceivable. Nor were they less surprised 
at the sight of the loaves of bread I had sent them, things-, 
that they had not seen for several years, at the same time ... 
crossing and blessing it, as though it was manna sent from 
Heaven : but when they knew the errand, and- perceived 
the boat which wa3 to carry them to the person and place 
from whence such relief came, this struck them with such . 
a surprise of joy as made some of them faint away, aud 
others burst out into tears. 

This was the summary account that I had from them.— 

I shall now inform the reader what I next did for them, and 
in what condition I left them. As we were all of opinion .. 
that the savages would scarce trouble them any more, so 
we had no apprehensions on that score. I told them I was- . 
come purely to establish, and not to remove them ; and 
upon that occasion, had not only brought them necessaries 
for convenience and defence, but also artificers, and other, 
persons, both for, their necessary employments, and to add 
to their number. They were all together when I thus talked 
to them ; and before I delivered to them the stores I brought,,

fitst animosities, would engage in the strictest friendship, 
and shake hands with one another ? On this Will Atkins, 
with abundance of good humour, said, they had afflictions 
enough to make them all sober, and enemie senough to 
make them all friends : as for himself, he would live and 
die among them, owning that what the Spaniards had done 
to him, his own mad humour had made necessary for, them 
to do. Nor had the Spaniards occasion to justify, their pro- 
ceedings to me ; but they told me, that since Will Atkins 
had behaved himself so valiantly in fight, and at other times 
showed such a regard to the common interest of them all, 
they had not only forgotten all that was past, but thought 
be ought as much to he trusted with arms and necessaries 
as any of them, which they testified by making him next in 
command to the governor : and they most heartily embraced 
the occasion of giving me this solemn assurance, that they 
would never separate their interest again as long as they lived. 

After these kind declarations of friendship, we appointed 
all of us to dine together the next day ; upon this I caused 
the ship’s cook and his mate' to come on shore for that pur- 
pose, to assist in dressing our dinner. We brought from 
the ship six pieces of beef, and four of pork, together with 
our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it ; and in particular I 

f ave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten of English 
eer, which was very acceptable to them. The Spaniards 
added, to our feast, five whole kids, which being roasted, 
three of them were sent as fresh meat to the sailors on board 
and the other two we ate ourselves. After our merry and 
innocent feast was over, I began to distribute my cargo 
among them. First, I gave them linen sufficient to make 
every one of them four shirts, and at the Spaniard’s request 
made them up six. The thin English stuffs I allotted to 
make every one a light coat like a frock, agreeable to the 
climate, and left them such a quantity as to make more upon 
their decay ; as also pumps, shoes, hats, and stockings. It 
is not to be expressed the pleasing satisfaction which sat 
upon the countenances of these poor men, when they per- 
ceived what care 1 took of them, as if I ha l d been a con^mon 
father to them all ; and they all engaged never to leave the 
island, till I gave my consent for their departure. I then 
presented to them the people I brought, viz. the tailor, 
smith, and the two carpenters j but my Jack-of-all-trades 
was the most acceptable present I could make them. M j

tailor fell immediately to work, and made every one of them 
a shirt ; after which, he learned the women how to sew and 
stitch, thereby to become the more helpful to their- husbands. 
Neither werfc the carpenters less useful, taking in pieces their 
clumsy things; instead of which they made convenient and 
handsome tables, stools, bed>teads, cupboards, lockers, and 
shelves. But when I carried them to see Will Atkins’s 
basket-house, they owned they never saw such a piece ot 
natural ingenuity before : “ I am sure,” said one of the car- 
penters, “ the man that built this has no need of us ; you 
“ need. Sir, do nothing but give him ‘tools.” 

I divided the tools among them in this manner : to every 
man I gave a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, as having 
no harrows or ploughs; and to every separate place a pick- 
ax, a crow, a broad ax, and a saw, with a store for a general 
supply, should any be broken or worn out. I left them also 
nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives, scissars, and 
all sorts of tools and iron work ; and for the use of the 
smith, gave them three tons of un wrought iron, tor a sup- 
ply ; and as to arms and ammunition, I stored them even t* 
profusion ; or, at least, to equip a sufficient little army 
against all opposers whatsover. 

The young man (whose mother was unfortunately starved 
to death) together with the maid, a pious and well educated 
, young woman, seeing things so well ordered on shore (for 
1 made them accompany toe) and considering they had no 
occasion to go so far a voyage as to the East-Indies, they 
both desired of me, that 1 would leave them there, and 
enter them among iny subjects. This I readily agreed to, 
ordering them a plat of ground, on which were three little 
houses erected, environed with basket-work, paliisadoed 
like Atkins’s, and adjoining to his plantation. So contrived 
were their tents, that each ot them had a room apart to 
lodge in, while their middle fent was not only their store- 
house, but their place for eating and drinking. At this 
time the two Englishmen removed their habitation to their 
former place ; so that now the island was divided into three 
colonies : first. Those I have just now ment ioned ; secondly. 
That of Will Atkins, where there were four families of 
Englishmen, with their wives and children, the widow and 
her children ; the young man and the maid, who, by the 
Vvay, we made a wife of before our departure ; three sa- 
vages, who were slaves ; the tailor, smith, (who served also

<vs a gunsmith) and my other celebrated person called Jack - 
of-all-trades ; thirdly, My chief colony, which consisted of 
the Spaniards, with Old Friday, who still remained at my 
old habitation, which was my capital city ; and surely never 
was there such a metropolis, it being now hid in so obscure 
a grove, that a thousand men might have ranged the island 
a month, and looked purposely for it, without being able to 
find it, though the Spaniards had enlarged its boundaries, 
both without and vviinin, in a most surprising manner. 

Hut now 1 think it high lime to speak of the ) oung French 
priest of the order of St. Benedict, whose judicious and pious 
discourses, upon sundry occasions, merit an extraordinary 
observ ation ; nor can his being a French Papist priest, I pre- 
sume, give offence to any of my readers, when they have 
this assurance from me,' that he was a person of a most 
courteous disposition, extensive charitv, and exalted piety, 
tl is arguments were alway s agreeable to reason, and his 
conversation the most acceptable of any person that I had 
ever yet met with in my life. 

“ Sir,” said he, to me, one day, “since, under God,” 
at the same time crossing his breast, “ you have not only 
“ saved my life; but by permitting me to go this voyage, 
“ have gi anted me the happiness of free conversation, I 
“think it my duty, as my profession obliges me, to save 
“ what soul» I can, by bringing them to the knowledge of 
“ some catholic doctrine, necessary to salvation ; and since 
“ these people are under your immediate government, in 
“ gratitude, justice, and decency, for what you have done 
.** for me, 1 shall offer no farther points in religion, than 
** what merit your approbation.” Being pleased with the 
modesty of his carriage, I told him he should not be worse 
used for being of a different persuasion, if upon that very- 
account,,we did not differ in points of faith, not decent in 
a part of the country where the poor Indians ought to be 
instructed in the know ledge of the true God, and his Son. 
Jesus Christ. To this he replied, that conversation might 
easily be separated from disputes ; that he would discourse 
with me rather as a gentleman than a religious.: but that, 
if we did enter upon religious arguments, upon my desiring 
the same, I would give him liberty to defend bis own prin- 
ciples.. He farther added, that he would do-all that became 
him in his office, as a priest as well as a Christian, to pro- 
cure tlielrappiness of all that were in the ship ; that though

he coaid not pray with, he would pray for us, on all occa- 
sions ; and then lie told me several extraordinary events of 
his life, within a few years past; but particularly in this 
last,' which w as the most remarkable : that in this voyage, 
he had the misfortune to be five times shippedand unshipped : 
his first design was to have gone to Martinico ; lor which 
taking ship to St. Maloes, he was forced into Lisbon by bad 
weather, the vessel running a-ground in the mouth of the 
Tagus ; that from thence he went on board a Portuguese 
ship, bound to the Madeiras, whose master being but an in- 
different mariner, and out of his reckoning, they were drove 
toFiai, where selling their commodity, which was corn* they 
resolved to take in their loading at the isle of May, and to 
sail to Newfoundland ; at the Banks of which, meeting a 
French ship bound to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and 
from thence to Martinico, in this ship he embarked ; the 
master of which dying at Quebec, that voyage was sus- 
pended ; and lastly shipped himself for France, this last 
ship was destroyed by fire, as before lias been related. 

At this time we talked no further ; but another morning 
he comes to me, just as I was going to visit the English- 
men’s colony, and tells me, that as he knew the prosperity 
of the island was my principal desire, he had something to 
communicate agreeable to my design, by which perhaps he 
might put it, more than he yet thought it was, in the way 
of the benediction of Heaven. “ How, Sr !” said [ in a 
surprise, “ are we not yet in the way of God’s blessings, 
after all these signal providences and deliverances, of which 
you have had such an.ample relation?” He replied, “ 1 hope. 
Sir, you are in the way, and that your good design will 
prosper : but still there are some among you that are not 
equally right in their actions ; and remember, I beseech 
you. Sir, that Achan, by his crime, removed God’s blessing 
from the camp of the children of Israel; that though six 
and thirty were entirely innocent, yet they became the ob- 
jects of divine vengeance, and boro the weight of his pu- 
nishment accordingly.” ' * 

So sensibly was I touched with this discourse, and so sa- 
tisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his soul, that I 
desired him to accompany me to the Englishmen’s planta- 
tions, which he was very glad of, by reason they were the 
subject of' what he designed to discourse with me about -t 
and while wo walked on together, he began in the follow- 
ing manner : 


194 - 


1IFE AND ADVENTURES 

" Sir, said lie, I must confess it as a great unhappiness 
that we disagree in several doctrinal articles of religion ; but 
surely both of us acknowledge this, that there is a God, 
who having given us some stated rules for our service and 
obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend 
him ; either by neglecting what he has commanded, or 
by doing what he has forbidden. This truth every Christian 
owns, that when any one presumptuously sins against God’s 
command, the Almighty then withdraws his blessing from 
him ; every good man therefore ought certainly to prevent 
such neglect of, or sin against, God and his commands. I 
thanked the young priest for expressing so great a concern 
or us, and desired him to explain the particulars of what 
he had observed, that according to the parable of Achan, 1 
" might remove that accursed thing from among us.” Why 
then. Sir, said he; in the first place, you have four English- 
men, who have taken savage women to their wives, by 
whom they have several children, though none of them are 
legally married, as the law of God and man requires ; they, 
I say. Sir, are no less than adulterers, and as they still live

J ou may object the want of a priest, or clergyman of any 
ind ; as also, pen, ink, and paper, to write down a con- 
tract of marriage, and have it signed between them. But 
neither this, nor what the Spanish governor has told you, of 
their choosing by consent, can be reckoned a marriage, nor 
any more than an agreement to keep them from quarrelline 
among themselves : for. Sir, the essence or sacrament of 
matrimony (so lie railed it), not only consists in mutual con- 
sent, bufcin the legal obligation, which compels them-to 
own and acknowledge one another,, to abstain from other 
persons, the men to provide for their wjpes and children, 
and the women to the same and like conditions, mutatis mu- 
tandis, on their side : whereas. Sir, these men, upon their 
own pleasure, on any occasion, may forsake those women, 
and marry others, and by disowning their children, suffer 
them utterly to perish.” " Now, Sir,” added he, “ can 
God bt> honoured in such an unlawful liberty as this r bow 
can a blessing succeed to the best endeavours, if men are 
tllowed to Tive in so licentious a way r” I was indeed struck 
with the thing myself, and thought that they were much to 
blame, that no formal contract had been made, though it 
bad been but breaking a stick between them, to engage

them to live as man and wife, never to separate, but love, 
-Cherish, arid comfort one another all their lives “ yet. 
Sir,” said I, “ w hen they look these women, I was not here, 
and if it is adultery, it is past my reined ) , and I cannot help 
it ” “ True, Sir,” answered the young priest, “ you can- 

not be charged w ith that part of the crime which was done 
• in 'j our absence : but I beseech you, don’t flatter yourself? 
that you are under no obligation now to put a period to it : 
-which if you neglect to do, the guilt will be entirely on you 
alone, since it is certainly hr nobody’s pow-er but yours, to 
-alter their condition.” I must confess, I was so dull, that I 
•thought he meant I should part them, and know ing that 
this would put the whole island in confusion, I told him I 
could not consent tout upon any account whatsoever “Sir,” 
said he, in great surprise, “ 1 do not mean that you should * 
separate, but marry them, by a written contract, signed by 
Coth man and woman, anil by all tire witnesses present, 
which all the European laws decreee to be of sutlicient ef- 
ficacy.” Amazed with such true piety and sincerity, and 
- considering the validity ofa writtencontract,! acknowledged 
all that he said to be very just and kind, and that I would 
discourse with the men about it; neither could i spe what 
reason they could have not to let him marry 'them, whose 
authority in that affair is owned to be as authentic as il they 
-were married by any of our clergymen in England. 

The next complaint he had to make j£fUic was this, that 
•^though these English subjects of mine have lived with these 
•women seven years, and though they were of good under- 
standing, and capable of instruction, having learned not 
only to speak, but to read English, yet all this while they 
had never taught fejiem any thing of the Christian religion, 

••or the knowledge of God, much less in what manner lie 
•ought to be served. “ And is not this an unaccountable 
neglect ?” said he warmly. “Depend upon it, God Al- 
mighty will call them to account for such contempt. And 
though I am not of your religion, yet I should be glad to 
see these people released from the Devil’s power, and be 
saved by the principles of the Christian religion, the know- 
ledge or God, of a Redeemer, the resurrection, and of a 
future state. But as it is not too late, if )ou please to give 
me leave to instruct them, I douht not. but I shall supply 
this great defect, by bringing them into the great circle of 
Christianity, even while vou continue in the island.”

I could hold no longer, but embracing him, told him, 
with a thousand thanks, 1 would gi ant whatever he request- 
ed, and desired him to proceed in the third article, which 
he did in the following manner : 

“ Sir,” said he, “ it should be a maxim among all Chri- 
stians, that Christian knowledge ought to be propagated 
by aH possible means, and on all occasions. Upon this 
account our church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and 
China, men who are w illing to die for the sake of God and 
the Christian faith, in order to bring poor infidels into the 
way of salvation. Now, Sir, as here is an opportunity to 
convert seven and thirty poor savages, I wonder how you 
can pass by such an occasion of doing good, which is really 
worth the expence of a man’s whole life.” 

I must confess I was so confounded at this discourse, that 
I could not tell how tp answer him. " Sir,” said he, seeing 
me in disorder, “ 1 shall be very sorry if I have given you 
offence.” “ No, Sir,*’ said I, ** I am rather confounded ; 
and you know my circumstances, that being bound to the 
East-Indies in a merchant ship, I cannot wrong the owner* 
so much, as to detain the ship here, the men lying at vic- 
tuals and wages on their account. If I stay above twelve 
days, I must pay Si. sterling per diem demurrage, nor must 
the ship.atop above eight days more ; so that I am unable 
to engage in this work, unless I would leave the ship, and 
be reduced to my former condition.” The priest, though 
he owned this was hard upon me, yet laid it to my con- 
science, whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty 
souls was not .worth venturing ail that 1 had in the world ?** 
‘'Sir,” said l, “ it is very true : but as youare an eccle-fos- 
tic, it naturally falls into your profession ; why, therefore, 
don’t you rather offer to undertake it yourself, than press 
me to it?” upon this he turned about, making a very low 
bow, “ 1 most humbly thank God and you. Sir, (said he) 
for so blessed a call ; and most willingly undertake so glo- 
rious an ^office, which w ill sufficiently compensate all the 
hazards and difficulties I have gone through in a long and 
uncomfortable voyage.” . 

While he was thus speaking, I could discover a rapture 
in his face, by his colour going and coming; at the saine 
time his eyes sparkled like fire, and all the "signs of the 
most zealous transports. And when 1 asked whether he 
was in earnest ? <•* Sir,” said he, “ it was to preach to the

•Indians I consented to come along with you ; these infidels, 
even in this little island, are infinitely of more worth than 
my poor life : if so that I should prove the happy instrument 
of saving these poor creatures’ souls, 1 care not it I never ( 
see iny native country again. One thing I only be£of you 
more is, that you would leave Friday with me, to be my 
interpreter, without whose assistance neither of us will 
understand each other.” 

This request very sensibly troubled me : first, upon Fri- 
day’s being bred a Protestant; and, secondly, for the af- 
fection 1 bore to him for his fidelity : But immediately the 
remembrance of Friday’s lather coming into nay head, I re- 
commended him to him as having learned Spanish, which 
the priest also understood ; and so was thoroughly satisfied 
with him. 

When we came to the Englishmen, after T had told them 
•what necessary things I had done for them, I talked to them 
of the scandalous life they led, told them what notice the 
clergymen had taken of it, and asked them if they were 
married men or bachelors ? They answered, two of theiii 
were widowers, and the other three single men. But said' 
I, with what conscience can you call these your wives, by 
whom you have so many children, and yet are not lawfully 
married ? They ail said, that they took them before the 
Governor as such, having nobody else to marry them, which 
they thought as legal, as if they had had a parson. ‘No 
doubt, said I, but in the eye of God it is so : but unless T 
am assured of your honest intent, never to desert these poor 
creatures, I can do nothing more for you, neither can you 
-expect God’s blessing while you live in such an open course 
-of adultery. Hereupon Will Atkins, who spoke foi the rest, 
told me, that they believed their wives the most innocent 
and virtuous creatures in the world ; that they would never 
forsake them while they had breath ; and that, if there was 
a clergyman in the ship, they would be married to them 
with all their hearts. I told you before, said I, that I have 
a minister with me, who shall marry you to-morrow morn- 
ing, if you are willing.; so I' would have you consult to- 
night with the rest about it. I told him the clergyman was 
a Frenchman, and knew' not a word of English, but that I 
would act as clerk between them. And indeed tin’s busi- 
ness met with such speedy success, that they all told me,

in a few minutes after, that they were ready to be formally 
married, as soon as I pleased ; with which informing the 
priest, he was exceedingly rejoiced. 

Nothing now remained, but that the women should be 
made sensible of tlfe meaning of the thing ; with which be- 
ing well satisfied, they w'ith their husbands attended at my 
-apartment the next morning; there was my priest, habited 
in a biack vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round 
it, much resembling a minister, and I was his interpreter. 
But the seriousness of his behaviour, and the scruples he 
tnade of marrying the women, who were not baptized, gave 
them an exceeding reverence for his person : nor indeed 
would he marry them at all, till he obtained my liberty to 
discourse both with tlie men and w omen, and then he told 
them. That in the sight of all indifferent men, and in the 
sense of the laws of society, they had lived in open adultery, 
which nothing now, but their consent to marry, or final 
separation, could put an end to ; and even here was a diffi- 
culty with respect to the law's of Christian matrimony, in 
marrying a professed Christian to a heathen idolater, un- 
baptized ; but yet there w'as time enough to make them 
profess the name of Christ, without which nothing could be 
done j that, besides, he believed themselves very indifferent 
Christians: and consequently had not discoursed with their 
wives upon that subject ; and that unless they promised 
him to do so, he could not marry them, as being expressly 
forbidden by the laws of God. 

-All this they heard attentively, and owned readily. 

“ But, Lord, Sir,” said Will Atkins to me, “ how should 
we teach them religion, who know nothing of it ourselves? 
How' can we talk to our wives of God, Jesus Christ, hea- 
ven and hell ? why' lluty w'ould only laugh at us, who never 
yet have practised religion, but on the contrary ail manner 
of wickedness.” “ Will Atkins,” said I, -“cannot you tell 
your wife she is in the wrong, and that her gods are idols, 
which can neither speak nor understand ; but that our God, 
who has made, can destroy all things ; that he rew ards the 
good and punishes the wicked.; and at last will bring us to 
judgment ; cannot you tell iher these things ?” “ That's 
true,” said Will Atkins, "“chut then she’ll tell me it is utterly 
false, since I am not punished and sent to the devil, who 
hath been such a wicked creature.” These words I inter- 
preted to the priest. “ O!” said he, “ tell him, his repent-

ance will make him a very good minister to his spouse, and 
qualify him to preach on the mercy and long-suffering of a 
merciful Being, who desires not the death of a sinner, and 
even defers damnation to the last judgment ; this will lead 
him to the doctrine of the resurrection, and will make him 
an excellent preacher to his wife.” I repeated this to Atk ins, 
who being more than ordinary affected with it, replied, 

“ I know all this. Sir, and a great deal more ; but how can 
I have tlie impudence to talk, thus to my wife, when my 
conscience witnesses against me r" “ Alas !” said he (with, 
tears in his eyes, and giving a great sigh) “ as for repenting, 
that is for ever past me.” “ Past you ! Atkins,” said I 
“ what do you mean r" “ You know well enough,” said he, 
" what I mean ; I mean it is too late.” 

When I told the priest what he said, the poor affectionate 
man could not refrain from weeping ; but Recovering . 
himself, '** Pray, Sir,” said he, “'ask him if he is contented 
that it is 1 too late ; or is he concerned, and wishes it were 
not so?” Phis question I put fairly to Atkins, who replied 
in a passion, “ flow can I be easy in a state which I know 
must terminate in my ruin? for I really believe, some lirae- 
or other, I shall cut my throat; to put a period both U> my 
life, and to the terrors of my conscience.” 

At this the clergyman shook his head, ** Sir,” said he, 
** pray tell him it is not too late ; Christ will give him re- 
pentance, if he has recourse to the merit of his passion. — 
Does he think, he is beyond the power of Divine Mercy, ? 
'Fhere may indeed be a time when provoked mercy will no* 
longer strive, but never too late for men to repent in this 
world.” I told Atkins every word the priest had said, who 
then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we dis- 
coursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in reli- 
gious matters : yet all of them promised to do their endea- 
vours to make their wives turn Christians ; and upon which 

E romises the priest married the tliree couple. But as At- 
ins was the only sincere convert, and of more sense than 
the rest, my clergyman was earnestly inquiring after him : 
" Sir,” said he, “let us walk out of this labyrinth, and I 
dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to his wife 
already.” And indeed we found it true ; for coming to the 
edge of the wood, we perceived Atkins and his savage wife 
sitting under the shade of a bush, in very earnest discourse;

he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of the earth, to himself,, 
to her, the woods,, and the trees. Immediately we could 
perceive him start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, 
and lift up both his hands ; at which the tears ran down my 
clergyman's cheeks ; but our great misfortune was we 
could not hear one word. that passed between them. Ano- 
ther time he would embrace ber,, w iping the tears from her 
eyes kissing her with the greatest transports, and then both 
kneel down for some minutes together. Such raptures of 
joy did this occasion iu my young priest, that he could 
scarcely contain himself: And a little after this we observed 
by her motion, as frequently lifting up her hands, and laying 
them on her breast, that she was mightily affected with 
his discourse, and so they withdrew' from our sight. 

When we came back, we found them both wailing to be 
called in ; upon which he agreed taexamiue him alone, and 
to I began thus to discourse bim. “ Prithee Will Atkins,’*'

who was mightily conce rned he could not talk to her himself... 
“Sir/’ said he, “there is something more to be done to 
this woman than to marry her : I mean- that she ought to 
be baptized.” To this I presently agreed : “Pray,” said 
he, “ ask her husband, whether he has ever talked to her of 
Jesus Christ^the salvation of sinners, the nature of faith, and 
redemption in and by him, and of the Holy Spirit, the resur- 
rection, last judgment, and a future state but the poor 
fellow melted into tears at this question, saying, that he had 
said something to her of these things, but his inability to 
talk of them, made him afraid, lest her knowledge of them 
should rather make her contemn religion, than be benefitted 
by it ; but that if I would discourse with her, it would be 
very evident my labour would not be in vain.. Accord- 
ingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter be- 
tween the religious priest and the woman, I ihtreated him 
to go on ; but surely never was such a sermon preached by 
any clergyman in these latter days, with so much zeal, know- 
ledge, and sincerity : in short, he brought the woman to 
embrace the knowledge ol Christ, and of redemption by . 
him, with so surprising a degree of understanding, that she 
made it her own request to be baptized. 

He then performed his office in the sacrament of baptism, 
first, by saying some words over to himseU in Latin, and 
then asking me to give her a name, as being her godfather, 
and pouring a whole dish-full of water upon the woman’s 
head, he said, “ Mary, I baptize thee in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost so that 
none could know of what religion he was. After this he 

{ ironounced the benediction in Latin. Thus the woman 
icing made a Christian, he married her to Will Atkins; 
which being finished, he affectionately exhorted him to 
lead a holy life for the future ; and since the Almighty, for 
the convictions of his conscience, had honoured him to be 
the instrument of his wife's conversion, he should not dis- 
honour the grace of God, that while the savage was con- 
verted, the instrument should be cast away. Thus ended 
a ceremony, to me the most pleasant and agreeable 1 ever 
pa^ed in my life. 

The affairs of the island being settled, I was preparing fo 
go on board, vs hen the young man (whose mother was starv- 
ed) came to me, saying, that a$ he understood I had a cler- 
gyman widi me,, who had. married- the Englishmen, with

savages, he had a match to make between two Christians, 
which he desired might be finished before l departed* — 
Thinking that it was he himself that had courted his mother’s 
maid, I persuaded him not to do any thing rashly upon tiie 
account of his solitary circumstances ; that the maid was am 
anequal match for him, both in respect to substance and 
years ; and that it was very probable lie would live to re- 
turn to his own country, where he might have a far better 
choice. At these words, smiling, he interrupted me', thank- 
ing me for my good advice ; that as he had nothing to beg 
of me but a small settlement, with a servant Or two, or some 
new necessaries, so he hoped I would not be unmindful of 
him when I returned to England, but give his letter to his 
friends ; and that when he was redeemed, the plantation, 
and all its improvements,' however valuable, should be re- 
turned to me again. But as for the marriage, he proposed,, 
that it was not himself, but that it was between my jack-o£- 
all-trades and the maid Susan, 

, I was indeed agreeably surprised at the mentioning this 
match, which seemed - very suitable, the one being a very 
ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent, dexterous, and 
sensible housewife, fit to be governess of the whole island : 
so we married them the same day ; ami as X was her father 
and gave her away, so I gave her a handsome portion, ap- 
pointing her and her husband a convenient large spot of 
ground for their plantation. The sharing'out of the land I 
left to Will Atkins, who really divided it very justly, to 
every person’s satisfaction they only desired one general 
writing under my hand for the whole, wh'ch I caused to be 
drawn up, signed, and sealed to them,, setting out their 
bounds, and giving them a right to the whole possession of 
their respective* plantations,, with their improvements, to 
them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island as 
my own property, and a certain rent for every particular 
plantation, after eieyen years. As to their laws and go- 
vernment, I exhorted them to love one another ; and as to 
the Indians who lived in a nook by themselves, I allotted 
three or four of" them plantations, and the rest willingly 
ehose to become servants to the other families, by w hich 
means they were employed in useful labour,, and fared 
much better than they did before. Besides the savages be- 
ipg thus mixed with the Christians, the work of their con- 
version might be set on foot by the lalter, in. the clergy-

man’s absence, to our equal satisfaction. The young priest, 
however, was a little anxious lest the Christians should not 
be willing to do their parts in instructing these poor Indi- 
ans ; I therefore told him we should call them all together; 
that he should speak, to the Spaniards who were Papists, 
and I to the English who were Protestants, and make them 

f mrmise that they would never make any distinction in re- 
igion, but teach the general true know ledge of God, and 
his Son Jesus Christ, in order to convert the poor savages. 
And this, indeed, they all promised ns accordingly. 

When I came to Will Atkins’s house, I found his baptised 
wife, and the young woman newly married to my Jack-of- 
all-trades, were become great intimates, and discoursing of 
religion together. “ O, Sir,” says Will Atkins, “ when 
' God has sinners to reconcile to himself, he never wants an 
instructor ; I knew I was unworthy of so good a work, and 
therefore this young woman has been sent hither as it were 
from heaven, who is sufficient to convert a whole nation of 
savages.” The young woman blushed, and was going to 
rise; but I desired her to sit still, and hoped that God 
would bless her in so good a work ; and then pulling out 
a Bible (which I brought on purpose in my pocket for him.) 
w Here, Atkins,” said 1, “ here is an assistant that perhaps 
you had not before.” So confounded was the poor man, 
that it was some time before he could speak ; at last turning 
to his wife, “ My dear,” he said. “ did I not tell you that 
God could hear what we said t Here’s the book 1 prayed 
for, when you and l kneeled under the bush ; God then 
heard us, and now has sent it.” The woman was surprised, 
and thought really God had sent that individual book from 
heaven ; but I turned to the young woman, and desired her 
to explain to the young convert, that God may’properly he 
said to answer our petitions, when, in the course ol his pro- 
vidence, such particular things came to pass as we petition- 
ed for. This the young woman did effectually ^ but surely 
Will Atkins’s joy cannot be expressed ; no man being more 
thankful for any thing in the world, than he was for his Bi- 
ble, nor desired it from a better principle. 

After several religious discourses, [ desired the young 
woman to give me an account of the anguish she felt when 
she was starving to death with hunger ; to which. she rea- 
dily consented, and began in the following manner : 

“ Sir,” said she, “all our victuals being gone, after I had 
Fasted t>ne day, my stomach was very sickly, and, at tlieap-

proach of night, I was inclined to yawning and sleepy. — 
When l slept upon the couch three hours, I awaked a lit- 
tle refreshed ; three hours after, my stomach being more 
and more sickly, 1 lay down again, but could not sleep, be- 
ing very faint and ill. Thus I passed the second day with 
a strange variety, first hungry, then sick again, with reach- 
ings to vomit : that night I dreamed I was at Barbadoes,' 
buying plenty of provisions, and dined heartily. But when 
I awaked, my spirits were exceedingly sunk, to find myself 
in the extremity of famine. There was but one glass of 
wine, which being mixed with sugar, I drank up ; hut for 
want of substance to digest upon, the fumes of it got into 
my head, and made me senseless for some time. The third 
day I was so ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten 
a little child if it had come in my way ; during which time 
1 was as mad as any creature in Bedlam. In one of these 
fits 1 fell down, and struck my face against the corner of 
a pallet-bed, where my mistress lay ; the blood gushed out 
of my nose, but by my excessive bleeding, both the violence 
of tlye fever, and the raveuous part of the hunger abated. — 
After U'iSj l^grew s ‘ c k a g a,n > strove to vomit but could not ; 
then bleed'ng a second time, 1 swooned away as dead ; 
when 1 came to myself, I had a dreadful gnawing pain in 
my stomach, which went off’ towards night, with a longing 
desire for food. I took a draught of water and sugar, but 
it came up again ; then I drank water without sugar, and 
that staid with me. I laid me down on the bed, praying 
God would take me away : alter I had slumbered, I thought 
myself a-dying, therefore recommended my soul to God, 
and wished somebody would throw me into the sea. All 
this while mv departing mistress lay by me; the last bit of 
bread she had, she gave to her dear child, my young master. 
The morning after 1 fell into a violent passion of crying, 
and after that into hunger, i espied the blood that came 
from my nose in a bason, which I immediately swallowed 
up. At night I had the usual variations, as the pain in the 
stomach, sick, sleepy, and ravenous ; and I had no thought 
but that 1 should die before morning. In the morning came 
on terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time 1 heard my 
jouug master’s, lamentations, by w! ; cb I understood his 
mother was dead. Soon after this, the sailors cried, “ A 
sail ! a sail !” halloing as it they were distracted for joy of 
that relief, which afterwards we received from your hands.”

Surely never was a more distinct account of starving 
death than this. But to return to the disposition of things 
among my people, 1 did not take any hotice to them of the 
sloop that 1 had trained, neither would 1 leave them the 
two pieces of brass cannon,' or the two quarter deck guns 
that I had on board, lest, upon any disgust, they- should 
have separated, or turned pirates, and so make the island a 
den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober pious peo- 
ple : but leaving them in a flourishing condition, with a 
promise to send them further relief from Brazil, as sheep, 
hogs, and cows (being obliged to kill the latter at sea, having 
no nay to feed them) 1 went on board the ship again, the 
first of May, 1G95, after having been twenty da vs among 
them ; and next morning, giving them a salute of five guns 
at parting, we set sail for the Brazils. The third day, to- 
wards evening, there happening a calm, and the current 
being very strong we were drove to the N. N. £. towards 
the lar.d. Some hours after, we perceived the sea covered 
as it were with something very black, not easily at first to 
be discovered : upon which our«chief mate ascending the 
shrouds a little way, and taking a view' w ith the perspec- 
tive glass, he cries out, " .An army ! An army !” “ you fool,” 
said I, “ what do you mean ?” u Nay, Sir,” said he “ don’t 
be angry, I assure you, it is not an army, N but a fleet too, 
for 1 believe there are a thousand canoes paddling along, 
and making with great baste towards us.” 

Indeed every one of us were surprised at this relation ; 
and my nephew the captain could not tell what to think 
of it, but thought we should all be devoured. Nor was I 
free from concern, when 1 considered how' much we were 
becalmed, and w hat a strong current set towmrds the shore ; 
however, I encouraged him not to be afraid, but bring the 
ship to an anchor, as soon as we were certain that we must 
engage them Accordingly we did so, and furled all our 
sails; as to the savages w'e feared nothing, but only that 
they might set the ship on fire ; to prevent which, I ordered 
them to get their boats out, and fasten them, one close by 
the head, and the other by the stern, W'ell fnanned, witn 
skeetand bucketsto extinguish the flames, should itsohappen. 
The Shtfages soon came up with us, but there were not so 
many as the mate had said, for instead of a thousand canoes 
there were only one hundred and twenty ; too many indeed 
for us, several of their canoes containing about sixteen or 
seventeen men.

As they approached us, they seemed to be in the great - 
-est amazement, not knowing what to make of us. They 
rowed round tire ship, which occasioned us to call to the 
men in the boats, nor to suffer them to come near them. — 
Hate upon they beckoned t<>the savages tokeepback, which 
•thej?accordingly did ; but at their retreat they let fly about 
fifty' arrows among us, and very much wounded one of our 
•men in the long-boat. T called to them -not to fire upon 
any account, but handing-them down some deal boards, the 
•carpenters made them a kind of fence to shield them from 
<he arrows. In half an hour after they came so near astern 
of us, that we had a -perfect sight of them ; then they rowed : 
a little further out, till they came directly along-side of us, 
and then approached so near, that they could hear us speak : 
this made me order all our men to keep close, andget their 
.guns ready, -In the mean time 'I ordered Friday to go out 
upon deck, and ask them in his'Janguage what they meant. 
No sooner did he do so, but six ot the savages, who were 
in the foremost -canoes, stooping down, showed us their 
naked backsides, as much as to say in English, Kiss our 
: but Friday quickly knew v/hat this meant, by im- 
mediately crying out they were going to shoot ; unfortun- 
ately for him, poor creature, who fell under the cloud of 
three hundred arrows, no less than seven piercing through 
his body, killing one of the best servants* and faithfullest of 
-companions in all my solitudes and afflictions. 

So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that the 
g-uns, which 'before were charged only with powder, to 
frighten them, I ordered to he loaded with small shot ; nor 
did the gunners tail in their aim, but at this broadside split 
and overset thirteen or fourteen of their canoes, which 
killed numbers of them, and set the rest a swimming: the. 
others, frightened out of their wits, little regarding their 
fellows drowning, scoured away as fast as they could. One 
pbor wretch our people took up, swimming-fbr his life, an 
.hour after. He was very sullen at first, so that he w ould 
neither eat nor speak ; but I took a way to cure him, by 
ordering them to throw him into the sea, which they -did, 
and then he came swimming back like a cork, calling in his 
tongue, as I suppose, *o save him. So we took him on 
board, but'it was a long time before we could make him speak 
or understand English : yet when we had taught him, he 
-toll us, they were going with Ihcir kings to fight a great

battle ; and when wfe asked him, what made them come up 
to us r he said, “ to makee de great wonder look ;” where 
it is to be noted, that those natives, and those of Africa, 
always add two e*s at the end of English words, as nutkce, 
takte, and the like, from which it is a very difficult thing to 
make them- break off. * 

Being now under sail, we took our last farewell of poor 
honest Friday, and interred hiin with all possible decency 
and solemnity, putting him in a coffin, and committing 
him to the deep, at the same time causing eleven guns to 
be fired at him. Thus ended the life of one of the most 
grateful, faithful, honest, and affectionate servants, that ever 
any man was blessed with in the workL 

Having now a fair wind for Brazil, in about twelve days 
timp we made land in the latitude of five degrees south of 
the line. Four days we kept on S. by E. in sight of shore, 
when we madeCape St.Augustine, and in three days weeanie 
up to an anchor off the Bay of All Saints. I had great 
difficulty here to get leave to hold correspondence on shore} 
for neither the figure of tny partner, my two merchant trus- 
tees, nor the fame of ray wonderful preservation in tlve 
island, could procure me the favour, 1 ill such time as the 
prior of the monastery of the Augustines (to whom I had 
given 500 moidores) obtained leave from the Governor, for 
me personally with the Captain and one more, together 
with eight sailors, to come on shore ; upon this condition, 
that we should not land any goods out of the ship, nor 
carry any person away without licence : I found means, 
however, to get on shore three bales of English goods, such 
as fine broad cloths, stulfs, and some linen, which I brouglit 
as a present for my partner, who had sent me on board a 
present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth 
about thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and three 
or four fine gold medals. 

.. Here I delivered my partner in goods to the value of 
^HOl. sterling, and obliged him to fit up the sloop 1 bought 
i oi me use of my island, in order to send them refreshments; 
and so active Was he in this matter, that he had the vessel 
finished in a few days, to the master of which I gave par- 
ticular instructions to find the place. I soon loaded him 
.with a small cargo; and one Of our sailors offered to settle 
there, upon my latter to the Spanish governor, if I would 
allot him tools and a plantation. This I willingly granted. 



OF ROBINSON CROSOE. 211 

»ndf gave him the savage we had taken prisoner to be his 
slave. All things heing ready for the voyage, my old 
partner told me there was an acquaintance of his, a Brazil 
planter, who having fallen under the displeasure of the 
church, and in fcar of the Inquisition, which obliged him to 
be concealed, would be glad of such an opportunity to 
make his escape, with his wife and two daughters ; and if I 
wotild allot them a plantation in my island, he would give 
them a small stock to begin with, for that the officers had al- 
ready seized his effects and estate, and left him nothing but 
a little household stuff and two slaves. This request I pre- 
sently granted, concealing him and his family on board our 
ship, till such time as the sloop (where all the effects were) 
was gone out of the bay, and then we put them on board, 
who carried some materials, and plants for planting sugar- 
canes, along with them. By this sloop, among other things, 
I sent my subjects three milch cows and five calves, about 
22 hogs, three sows big with pig, two mares and a stone- 
horse. I also engaged three Portugal women to go for sake 
of the Spaniards, which, with the persecuted man's two 
daughters, were sufficient, since the rest had wives of their 
own, though in another country ; all which cargo arrived safe 
no doubt to their exceeding comfort, who, -with this addi- 
tion, were about sixty or seventy people, besides children. 

At this place, my truly honest and pious clergyman left 
*ne ; for a ship being ready to set sail for Lisbon, he asked 
ind leave to go thither ; but I assure you it was with the 
greatest reluctance I parted from a person, whose virtue 
anil piety merited the greatest esteem. 

From the Brazils, we made directly over the Atlantic 
Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable good 
voyage, steering for the most part S. E, We were on a 
trading voyage, and had a super-cargo ou board, who was 
to direct all the ship's motions after she arrived at the Cape, 
only being limited to a certain number of days, for stay, by 
charter party, at the several ports she was to go to. At the 
Cape we only took in fresh svater, and then sailed for the 
coast of Coromandel ; we were there informed, that a French 
man of war of 50 guns, and two large merchant ships, were 
sailed for the Indies, but we heard no more of them. 

In our passage, we touched at the island of Madagascar, 
where, though the inhabitants are naturally fierce; and trea*

cherous, and go constantly armed with bows and lance v 
yet tor some time they, treated us civily enough ; and, in 
exc hange for knives, scissars, and other trifles, they brought 
us eleven good tat bullocks, which we took, partly for pre-- 
sent victuals, and the remainder to salt for tho ship’s use. 

So curious was I to view every corner of the world where 
I came to, that I went on shore as often as I could. One 
evening when on shore,, we -observed numbers of the people 
siand gazing at us at a distance. We thought ourselves in 
no danger, as they had hitherto used us kindly. However, 
we cu.Ulhr.ee boughs cut of a tree, sticking them at a distance 
from us,. which it seems, in that country, is not only a token 
of truce and amity, but when poles or boughs are set up on 
the other side, it is a sign the truce is accepted. In 
those treaties however, there is one principal thing to be . 
regarded, that neither party come beyond one another’s 
three poles or boughs ; so that the middle space is not only 
secure,, but is also allowed as a market for waffle and com- 
merce. When the truce is thus accepted, they stick up 
their javelins and lances at the first poles, and come oar un- 
armed ;. but. if 3tiy. violence is offered, away they, run to 
their poles,, take up their weapons, and then tire truce is 
at an end.. This evening it happened. that a. greater num- 
ber of people than usual, both- men and women, traded 
among us lor such toys as we had, with such great civility, 
that wc made u$ a little tent,, of large boughs of trees, some 
of the men resolving to lie on shore all night ; but for my 
part, I and some others took, our lodging in. the boat, with 
boughs of trees spread over it, having a sail spread at the 
bottom to lie upon.. Abuut two o’clock in .the morning we- 
were awakened by the firing of muskets, and our men cry- 
ing out for help, or else they would all be murdered. . Scarce 
had we time to get the boat ashore,, when our men came 
plunging themselves into the water, with about four hun- 
dred of the islanders at their heels. We took up seven of 
the men,. three of them very much wounded,, and one left 
behind killed, while the enemy poured their arrows so 
thick among us, that we were forced to make a barricado, 
with boards lying at the side of the boat, to shield us from. 
danger ; and, having got ready our fire-arms, we returned 
them a volley, which wounded several of them, as we coutd 
bear by their cries. In this condition we lay till break of 
day,. and then making signals of distress to the ship, which

my nephew the captain heard and understood, he weighed 
anchor, and stood as near the shore as possible, and then 
sent another ■boat with ten hands in her to assist us ; but we 
called to them not to come near, informing them of our un- 
happy condition. However the y ventured ; when one of 
the men taking the end of a tow-line in onehand, and keep- 
hag our boat between him and our adversaries, swam to u«, 
and slipping our cables, they towed us out of reach of their 
arrows, and quickly after a broad-side was given them from 
the ship, which made a most dreadful havoc among them. 
When we got on board, we examined into the occasion of 
this fray. The men who fled informed us, that an old wo- 
man, who sold milk within the poles, had brought a young 
woman with her, who carried roots and herbs, the sight of 
whom so much tempted our men, that they offered rude* 
ness to the maid, at which the old woman set up a gre. t 
cry ; nor would the sailors part with the prize, but carried 
her among the trees, while the old woman wept, and 
brought a whole army down upon them. At the beginning 
bf the attack, one of our men was lulled with a lance, and 
the. fellow - who began the mischief, paid dear enough for 
|iis mistress, though as yet we did not know what had be- 
come of him; the rest luckily escaped. Ifhe third night 
^afler the action, being curious to understand how affairs 
stood, T took the supercargo and twenty stout fellows with 
me, and landed about two hours before midnight at the’saroe 
place where those Indians stood the night before, and there 
we divided oar men into two bodies, the boatswain com- 
manding one, and I another. It- was so dark, that wje 
could see nobody, neither did we Ixrar any voice near lis; 
but by and by the boatswain falling over a dead body. We 
agreed to haft lilt the moon should rise, which we knew 
would be an hour after. We .perceived here nofower than 
two and thirty bodies upon the ground, whereof two were 
not quite dead. Satisfied w ith this discovery, I was for go- 
ing onboard again ; but the boatswain and the rest tyid mo, 
they would make a visit to the Indian town, where these 
dogs, so they called them, resided, asking me at the same 
time to go along with them ; for they did not doubt, besides 
getting a good booty, but they should find Tom Jeffery 
there, for that was the unhappy man we missed. But J [ 
utterly refused to go, and commanded them back, being

unwilling to hazard their lives, as the safety of the slip 
wholly depended upon them. Notwithstanding all 1 could 
$ay to them, they all left rne but .one, and the supercargo ; 
so we three returned to the boat, .where a- boy. was left, re- 
solving to stay till they returned. At parting I told them 
l Supposed most of them would run the same fate with Tom 
Jeffery* To this they replied, " Come boys, come along, . 
w.e’H warrant we’ll come oft safe enough and so away 
they went, notmthstandingall my admonitions, either con- 
cerning their own safety or the preservation of the ship. — 
Indeed, they were gallantly armed, every man having a 
musket, bayonet, and a pistol, besides cutlasses, hangers, 
pole-axes, and hand granades. They came to a few In- 
•dian houses at.first, whicb.not being the tow n they expected, 
they went farther, and finding, a cow tied to a tree, they 
concluded that she would be sufficient guide, and so it 
proved ; for, after they untied her K she led them- directly 
to. the town, which consisted of above two hundred houses, 
several families living in some of the- huts together. At 
their arrival, all being in profound sleep, the sailors agreed 
to divide themselves into three bodies, and set three parts 
of the town on fire at once, to kill those that were escaping, 
and, plunder .the rest of the houses-, Thus desperately re- 
solved, they went to work. ; but the first patty had not 
, gone far. before they called to the rest, that they had found 
Tom Jeffery *, whereupon they all ran up. to the place, and 
found the poor,, fellow- indeed, hanging ^up^ naked by one 
arm, and his, throat almost cut from ear to ear. In a house 
, that was hard by the tree, they found sixteen or seventeen 
.Indians, who had been concerned in the fray, two or three 
of them being w'ounded, were not gone to sleep : this house •

smothered or burnt. All this-while they never fired a gun, 
lest the people should awaken faster, than they could over- 
power them. But the fire awakened them fast enough, 
which obliged our fellows to keep together in- bodies. By 
this time the whole town was in a flame, yet their fury ra- 
ther increased, calling out to one another to remember Tom 
Jeffery; The terrible light of this conflagration made me 
very uneasy, and rouzed my nephew the Captain,. and the 
rest of his men, who knew nothing;of thermatter. When 
he perceived the dreadfuh smoke, .and heard the guns go 
off, he readily concluded his men were in danger ; he there- 
fore takes another boat, .and comes- ashore himself, with 
thirteen men. well armed, He was greatly surprised to see 
me and only two men in the boat, but more so. when I told 
him the story; but though I argued with him, as I did 
with the men, about-the danger of the voyage, theintercste 
of the merchants and owners, and the safety of the ship, yet. 
my npphew, like the rest, declared, that he would rather ., 
lose the ship, his voyage, his life and all, than his men should 
be lost for want-of help-; and so- away he went. For my 
part, seeing bhn resolved to go, I had not power to stay 
behind. He ordered the pinnace back agam for twelve 
men more, and- then we- marched, directly as the flame 
guided us. But surely never was such a scene of horror 
beheld, or more dismal cries heard, except when Oliver 
Cromwell took Drogheda in Ireland, where he neither ’ 
spared man, woman, nor chikl. 

The first object, I think, we met with, was the ruins of? 
one of their habitations, before which lay four men and tbrpe 
women killed, and two more burnt to death among the fire, 
which was now decaying. . Nothing could appear more 
barbarous- than this revenge; none more cruel than the 
authors of it. As we went on, the fire increased, and the - 
cry proceeded in proportion.* We had nobgonemuch far- 
ther, when ve beheld three naked women, followed by six- 
teen or seventeen men, flying with the great est.swittfiess 
from our men, who shot one of -them- in our sight./ When 
they perceived us, whom they supposed also their murdeiers 
they set up a most dreadful shriek, and. both of them swoon- 
ed away in. fright. This was a sight which might have 
softened the hardest heart ; and in pity, we took, some ways 
to let- them know, we, would not. hurt them, while the poor 
creatares-'witbnbended-tknees,,. and. lifted up- hands, made

piteous lamentations to us to save their lives. I ordered 
our men not to hurt any of the poor creatures whatsoever; 
but being willing to understand the occasion of all this, I 
went among these unhappy wretches, who neither under- 
stood me, nor the good I meant diem. However, -being 
resolved to put an end to this barbarity, l ordered the men 
to follow me. We had not gone fifty yards before we came 
up with the boatswain, with foyr of our men at his heels, all 
ot them covered with blood and dust, and in search of more 
people to satiate their vengeance. As soon as we saw diem 
we called out, and made them understand who we were ; 
upon which they came*up to us, setting up a holloo of tri- 
umph, in token that more help was come. “ NobleCaptain,’* 
said he to my nephew, “ I’m glad you’re come ; we have 
not half done with these villainous hellhound dogs ; we’lt 
root out the very nation of them from the earth, and kill 
more than poor Tom has hairs upon Ins head :** and thus he 
went on till I interrupted him. — Blood-thirsty dog,” said 
I, " will your •cruelty never end? I charge you touch not one 
creature more ; stop your hands, and stand stilly or you’re 
a dead man this moment.” “Why, Sir,” said be, “ you 
neither know whom you are protecting, nor what they have- 
done : but pray tome hither, and behold an instance of 
•compassion, if such can merit your clemency and with 
4hat he showed me the poor fellow with his throat cut, 
banging upon the tree. 

Indeed, here was enough to fill tlieir breasts with rage, 
which, however, I thought had gone too far, agreeable to> 
•these words -of Jacob to his sons Simeon and Levir “ Cur- 
sed be their anger, tor it was fierce ; i\nd their wrath, for 
it was cruel.” But this sight made ray nephew and-tlie 
rest as bad as they: nay, my nephew declared, his con- 
cern was -only for his men ; as for the people, not a soul 
of them ought to live. Upon this, the boatswain and .eight 
more directly turned about, and went to finish the intended 
•tragedy ; which being out of my power to prevent, I re- 
turned back from the dismal sight, and the piteous cries of 
•those unfortunate creatures, who were made victims to tlieir 
•fury. Indeed, it was amegregious piece of folly in me to 
•return to the boat with but one attendant; and I had very 
near paid for it, -having narrowly- escaped forty armed In- 
dians, who had been alarmed by the conflagration; but 
having passed the place where they -stood, I got to the boat

accompanied with the Surpercargo, and so went on board, 
sending the pinnace back again, to assist the men in what 
might happen. When I liad got to the boat, the fire was 
almost extinguished, and the noise abated ; but I had'scarce 
been halt an hour on board the ship, when I heard another 
volley given by our sailors, r and a great smoke, which, as I 
afterwards found, was our men falling upon those houses 
and persons that stood between them and the sea ; but here 
they spared the wives and children* and killed only the men, 
to the number of about sixteen or seventeen. By the time 
they got to the shore, the pinnace and the ship's boat were 
ready to receive them, and they all got safe on board, not 
a man of them having received the least hurt, except two, 
•ne of them strained his foot, and the other burnt his hand 
a little; tor they metwith no resistance, the poor Indians 
being unprepared, amazed, and confounded. 

J was extremely angry whh every one of them, bat -par-^ 
ticularly with the captain^ who instead of cooling the rage 
of the men, had prompted them on to farther mischief : nor 
could he make me any other excuse, but that as be was a 
man, he could not master bis passions at the sight of one of 
his men so cruelly murdered. As for the rest, knowing, 
♦hey were not under my. command, they took no notice of 
any anger, but rather boasted of their revenge. According 
to all their accounts, they killed or destroyed about 150 
men, women, and children, besides burn in g the -town try 
ashes. They took their companion Tom Jefffery from the 
tree, covered him with some of the ruins, and so left him:. 
But however this action of our men might seem to them 
justifiable, yet I altvays openly condemned it with the ap- 
pellation of the Massacre of Madagascar. For tho’ the 
natives had slain this Jeffery, \ et-certainly he was the first 
aggressor, by attempting to violate- the chastity of a young* 
innocent woman, who ventured down to them, on the faith 
of the publiccapitulation, which was sotreaeheromly broken; . 

While we were under sail, the boatswain would ofteiV 
defend this bloody action, by saying, that the Indians had 
broke the truce tne night before, by shooting one of our 
men without just provocation : and ‘what if the poor feilovr 
liad taken a little liberty with the wench, he ought not to 
have been murdered in so villainous a manner ; and that 
they had acted nothing but what the divine laws commis- 
sioned to be done to such homicides. However I was in

the same mind as before, telling them that they were mur- 
derers, and bid them depend upon it that God would blast 
their voyage, for such an unpa l ralleled piece of barbarity. 

When we came to the Gulph of Persia, five of our men, 
who ventured on shore, were either killed or made slaves 
by the Arabians, the rest of them having scarce time to 
escape to their boat. This made me upbraid them afresh 
•with the retribution of Heaven for such actions ; upon, 
which the boatswain very warmly asked me, “ Whether 
those men on whom the tosyer of Siloam fell, were greater 
sinners than the rest of thp Galileans ? and besides. Sir,” 
said he, “ none of these five poor men that are lost, were 
with us at the massacre of Madagascar, as we call it, and 
therefore your representation is very unjust, and your ap- 
plication improper. Besides,” added be; f ‘you are con- 
tinually using the men very ill upon this account, and, bt?- 
ing but a passenger yourself, we are not obliged to bear it ; 
nor can we tell what evil designs you may have to bring us 
to judgment for it in England j and, therefore, if you do 
pot leave this discourse, as also not concern yourself with 
any of our affairs, I will leave the ship, and not sail among 
such dangerous company.” 

All this I heard very patiently ; but, it being often re* 
peated, I at length told him, the concern I had on board 
was none of his business ; that I was a considerable owner 
in the ship, and therefore had a right to speak in common, 
and that I was no w ay accountable to him, nor any body 
else. As no more passed for some time after, I thought 
all had been over. At this time vve w r ere in the road of 
Bengal, where, going on shore with the supercargo one day, 
in the evening, as I was preparing to go on board, one of 
the, men came to me, and told me, I need not trouble my- 
self to come to the boat, for that the cockswain and others 
bad ordered him not to carry me on board any mow;. This 
insolent message much surprised me ; yet 1 gave him no 
answer to it, but went direplly and acquainted the super- 
cargo, entreating him to go on board, and, by acquainting 
the Captain with it, prevent the mutiny which l perceived 
would happen. But before I had spoke this, the matter 
was effected on board ; 'tor no sooner was he gone off in 
the boat, but the boatswain, gunner, carpenter, and all the 
inferior olficers, eame to the quarterdeck, desiring to speak 
with the Captain ; and there the boatswain made a long

it I had not gone on shore peaceably, for my own diversion, 
they, by violence would have compelled me, tor their sa- 
tisfaction : that as they had shipped with the Captain, so 
they would faithfully serve him ; but jf I -did not quit the

You may be sure, that though my nephew was a man of 
.great courage, yet he could hot but.be surprized -at their 
sudden and unexpected behaviour ; and though he talked 
stoutly to them, and afterwards expostulated with them, 
.that hi common justice to me, who was a considerable ow-

-own house, which might bring their lives in danger should 
they ever be taken in England ; nay, though he invited the 
boatswain on shore to accommodate matters with me ; yet 
all this 1 say signified nothing j they would have nothing to 
do with me ; and they were resolved to go ori shore if I 
canie on board. “ Well,” said my nephew, “ if you are 
so resolved, permit me to talk with him, and then I have 
done ;” and so he came to me, giving me an account of their 
resolution, how one and all designed to forsake the ship 
when I came on board, for which he was mightily concern-

it is no worse, since they have net rebelled against you ; 
I only desire you to send my necessary things on shore, 
with a sufficient Sum Of money, and I will find my way to 
England as well as I can.” Though this grieved my ne- 
phew to the heart, yet there was no remedy but compliance; 
in short all my necessaries were sent me, and so this matter 
was over in a few hours. 

I think l was now near a thousand leagues farther off 
England by sea, Ilian at my little kingdom, except this dif- 
ference, that l might trawl by land over the Great Mogul’s 
country to Surat, from thence to Bassora, by sea up the 
Persian Gulph, then take the way of the caravans over the 
Arabian desart to Aleppo and Scanderoon, there take ship- 
ping to Italy, and so travel by land into France, and from 
. thence across the sea to England.

who engaged tobe mine. I took lodgings in an English 
woman’s hou.se, where several French, one English, and two 
Italian merchants resided. The handsome entertainment 
I met with here, occasioned me to stay nine months, con- 
sidering what coarse l should take. Some English goods 
1 had with me of great value, besides a thousand pieces of 
eight, and a letter for more, if there was such necessity. — : 
The goods 1 soon disposed of to advantage, and bought here 
several good diamonds, which I could easily carry about 
i with me. One morning the English mere' ant came to me, 
as being very intimate together, “ Countryman," said he, 
“ I have a project to communicate to you, which I hope 
will suit to both our advantage. To be short. Sir, we are 
both in a remote part of the world front our country ; but 
yet in a place where men of business may get a great deal 
of money- Now, if you will put a thousand poin ds to my 
thousand pounds, we will hire a ship to our satisfaction ; 
you shall be Cap ain, I will be merchant; and we’ll go a 
trading voyage to China, for why shouid we lie still like 
drones, while the whole world is in a continual motion.” 

This proposal soon got my consent, being very agreeable 
to my rambling genius ; ana the more so, because I looked 
upon my countryman to be a very sincere person ; it re- 
quired some time before we could get a vessel to our mind, 
and sailors to man it accordingly ; at length we bought a 
ship, and got an English mate, boatswain, and gunner, a 
Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast-men ; and, 
for want of others, made shift with Indian seamen. We first 
sailed to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and then to Siam, 
where we bartered out w ares for some arrack and 'opium, 
the last of which bore a great price among the Chinese ; in 
a word, we went up to Susk.au, making a very great voyage; 
and, after eight months time, 1 returned to Bengal, very weH 
satisfied with this adventure, having not only got a sufficient 
quantity of money, but an insight of getting a great deal more. 

The next voyage my friend proposed to me, was to go 
among the Spice Islands, and bring liome a . load of tloves 
from the Manillas, or thereabouts ; islands belonging part- 
ly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade very considerably. 
We were not long in preparing for this voyage, which we 
made no less successful than the last, touching at Borneo, 
and several other places which I do not perfectly i emem- 
ber, and returning home in about five months time. We

soon sold our spices, which were chiefly cloves and some 
nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away 
tor the gulph ; and, in short, making five to one advantage, 
we were loaded with money. 

Not long after my friend and I had made up out accounts, 
to our entire satisfaction, there came in a Dutch coaster 
from Batavia, of about two hundred tons. The crew of 
this vessel pretended themselves so sickly, that there were 
not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage ; and the Captain 
having given out that he intended to go to Europe, public 
notice was given that the ship was to be sold. No sooner 
did this come to our ears, but we bought the ship, paid the 
master, and took possession. We would also have very . 
willingly entertained some of the men ; but they having 
received their share of booty, were not to be found, being 
altogether fled to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's resi- 
dence ; and from thence w ent to travel to Surat, and so by 
the sea to the Persian Gulph. And indeed they had reason 
to fly in this manner ; for the truth of it was the pretended 
Captain was the gufflier only, and not the commander ; 
that having been on a trading voyage, they were attacked 
on the shore by the Malayans, who killed three men and 
the Captain ; after whose death the other eleven men run 
aw-ay with the ship to the Bay of Bengal, and left the mate 
and five men more on shore ; but of this affair wc shall 
have occasion to speak more at length hereafter. 

However they came by the ship, we thought we bought 
it honestly ; neither did we suspect any thing of the matter ; 
when the man showed us a bill of sale for the ship (undoubt- 
edly forgad) to one Emanuel Clostershoven, which name he 
went by. And so without any more to do, we picked up 
some Dutch and English seamen, resolving for another voy- 
age for cloves among the Phillippine and Molucca islands : 
in short, we continued thus five or six years, trading from 
port to port with extraordinary success. In the seventh 
year, we undertook a voyage to China, designing to touch 
at Si^m, and buy some rice by the way. In this voyage 
contrary winds beat us up and dow'n for a considerable time 
among the islands in the Straits of Molucca. No sooner 
were we clear of those rugged seas, but we perceived 
our ship had sprung a leak, which obliged us to put into the 
river Cambodia, which lies northward of the Gulph, and 
goes up to Slam.

One clay, as I was on shore refreshing myself, there 
came to me an Englishman, who was gunner's male on 
board an English East India ship, riding up the river near 
the city of Cambodia : “ Sir,” said he, “ you may wonder 
at my business, having never seen me in your life buttho* 

I am a.st ranger, I have something to tell you that very near- 
ly concerns you ; and indeed it is the imminent danger you 
are in has moved rue to give you this timely notice.” — 
“ Danger !” said I, “ what danger ? I know of none, ex- 
cept my ship being leaky, for wnich I design to have her 
run aground to-morrow morning.” “I hope you will be 
better employed when you shall hear what 1 have to say to 
you. You know the town of Cambodia is about fifteen 
leagues up this river ; about three leagues on this side of it, 
there lie two Dutch and three English ships. And would 
you venture here without considering what strength you 
have to engage them ?” J knew not what he meant by this 
discourse, and turning short upon him, “ Sir,” said I, “ I 
know no reason I have to be afraid cither of any Dutch or 
English ships. I am no interloper, and what business have 
they with me?” “Well, Sir,” said the man, “ it you do 
think yourself secure, all as I can say, you must take your 
chance ; however 1 am very sorry you are so deal to good 
advice ; but I assure you, if you do not put to sea immedi- 
ately, you will be attacked by five long-boats full of men, 
hanged, yourself for a pirate, if you are taken, and the par- 
ticulars examined afterwards.” “ l thought. Sir,” added 
he, “I might have met a better reception tor such a singu- 
lar piece of service.” “ Sir,” said I, “ I was never un- 
grateful to any man ; but pray explain yourself, and I’ll go 
on board this minute, whether the leak be stopped or no.” 
“Why, Sir,” said he, “ to be short, because time is precious, 
the matter is this :• You know well enough that y ou was 
with the ship at Sumatra, when your Captain w»as murdered 
by the Malayans, with three of his sailors ; and that either 
you, or some who were on board you, ran away with the 
ship, and are since turned pirates at sea. Now, Sir,, this 
is the sum of what I had to say ; and I can positively assuie 
you, that if y ou are taken, you will be executed without 
hutch ceremony, for undoubtedly you cannot but be sen- 
sible what little law merchant ships show to pirates, when- 
ever they fall into their hands.” 

“ Sir,” said I, “ 1 thank you for your kind information ; 
and though 1 am sure no man could come more honestly

or ROBINSON CRUS OK. 

by (he ship than I have done, yet knowing their cnterprize, 
and being satisfied of your honest intention, I J !1 be upon ray 
defence.” “ Pr’ylhee, Sir,” said the man, “ don’t talk of 
being upon your defence, the best that you can make is to 
be out of danger; and therefore il you have any regard for 
your life, and the lives of your men, take the advantage, 
without fail, of putting out to sea at high-water : by which 
means, as you have a whole tide before you, you wiii be gone 
too far out of their reach before they can come down.” 

“ I am mighty well satisfied,” said I, “ in this particular, 
and for your kindness, which merits my great esteem, pray. 
Sir, what amends shall I make you r” He replied, “I know 
not what amends you are willing to make, because you 
may have some doubts of its certainty: but, to convince 
you of the truth of what I say, I have one offer to make to 
you. On board one of the English ships, I have nineteen 
months pay due to me, and this Dutchman that is with me, 
has seven months pay due to him, which if you will make 
good to us, we will go along with you. If vou shall find 
that there is nothing in what we have said, then we shall 
desire nothing ; but when you are convinced that we have 
saved the ship, your life, and the lives of the men, we will 
leave the whole to your generosity.” 

So reasonable did this every way appear, that I immedi- 
ately consented, and we went directly on board. As soon 
as we came on board, my partner calls joyfully out, “That 
they hail stopped the leak ?” “ Well, thank God,” said I 
“but pray let us weigh anchor forthwith.” — “Weigh,” 
said he, “ what is the meaning of this hurry ?” “ Pray ask 

no questions,” said I, “ but all hands to work, without 
losing a moment’s time.” Upon which, in great surprise, 
theCaptain was called, who immediately ordered the anchor 
to be got up ; and though the trde was not quite down, 
yet being assisted with a little land breeze, we stood to sea. 

I then called my partner into the cabin, and related the 
story at large, whicn was confirmed and moTe amplified by 
the two men I had brought on board. Scarce had we 
finished our discourse upon this head, but a sailor came to 
the cabin door, with a message from the Captain, that we 
were chased by five sloops full of armed men. ” Very 
well,” said I, “ it is plain now there is something in it.” — 
And so, going upon deck, I told all the men there was a *

' m 

design for seizing the ship, and of executing us for pirates; 
and asked them whether they would faithfully stand by us,, 
and by one another ?” To which they unanimously replied, 
" That they would fight to their last drop of blood." I 
’ then asked the Captain, which way he thought best for us 
to manage the battle? "Sir," said he, " the only method 
is to keep them off with our great shot as long as we are 
able, and then have recourse to our small arms ; and when 
T»th these fail us, then retire to close quarters, wfien per- 
haps the enemy, wanting materials, can neither break open 
our bulk heads, nor get in upon us.” Mean. time the gun- 
ner was ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out 
of the steerage, and so load them with musket-bullets and 
smalL pieces of old iron ; and the deck being cleared, we 
prepared for the engagement, still, however, keeping out 
at sea. The boats lollowed us,, with all the sail they could 
make, and we could perceive the two foremost were Eng- 
lish, which outsailed the rest by two leagues, and which we 
found' would come up with us : hereupon, we fired a gun 
without a ball, intimating that they should bring to, and we 
put out a flag- of truce, as a signal for parley ; but finding 
them crowding after us, till they came within shot, we took 
in our white, and hanging out the red flag, immediately 
fired at them with ball : we then called to them with a 
speaking trumpet, bidding them at their peril keep off. 

But all this signified nodiing ; for depending upon the 
strength that followed them, they were resolutely bent for 
mischief: hereupon I ordered them to bring the ship to, by 
which means, they lying upon our broadside, we let fly at 
them at once, one of whom carried away the stern of the 
hindermost boat, and obliged them not only to take dowR 
their sail, but made them ail run to the head of the boat, to 
keep them from sinking, and so. she lay by, having enough 
of it.. In the mean time, we prepared to welcome the fore- 
most boat in the same manner. While we were doing this, 
one of the three hindermost boats came up to the relief of 
that which was disabled uud took the men put of her. We 
again called to parley with them but, instead of an answer, 
one of the boats came close under our stern ; whereupon 
our gunner let fly his two chase guns, but missing, the men. 
in the boat shouted, and waving their caps, came on with 
greater fury. To repair this seeming disgrace, the gunner 
soon got ready, and filing a second time, did a great deal oft

mischief among the ehemy. We waved again, and, bring- 
ing our quarter to bear upon them, fired ihree guns more, 
when we found the boat a sinking, and several men already 
in the sea ; hereupon, manning our pinnace, I gave orders 
to save as many as they could, and instantly to come on 
board, betause the rest of their boats were approaching : 
accordingly they did so, and took up three of them, one ot 
whom was almost pRst recovery ; and then crowding all the 
sail we could, after our men came on board, we stood out 
farther to sea, so that the other three boats gave over the 
chase, when they came up to the first two. Thus delivered 
from imminent danger, we changed our course to the east- 
ward, quite out of the course of all European ships. 

Being now at sea, and inquiring more parlieuiariy of the 
two seamen, the meaning of all this, the Dutchman at once 
let us into the secret. He told us, that the fellow who sold 
us the ship was an errant thief, who had run away with her ; 
"that the Captain was treacherously murdered on the coast 
of Molucca by the natives there, with three of his men ; 
that he, the Dutchman, and four more, being obliged to 
have recourse to the woods for their safety, at length escaped 
by means of a Dutch ship, in its way to China, which had 
sent their boat on shore for fresh water : That, after this, 
•'he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen belonging to 
thaship (who had deserted the rest in their travels) arrived, 
and there gave an account that the fellow who ran away 
with the ship had sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, who 
went a cruising, and had already taken one English and 
two Dutch ships richly laden. 

Now, tho’ this was absolutely false, my partner truly 
said, that our deliverance was to be esteemed so much the 
more, by reason, had we fallen into their hands, we could 
have expected nothing from them but immediate death, 
considering our accusers would have been our judges; and, 
therefore, his opinion was to return directly to Bengal, 
where, being known, we could prove how honestly we came 
4 by the ship, of whom we bought her, and the like, and 
where we were sure of some justice ; at least would not be , 
hanged first and judged afterwards. I was at first of my 
partner’s opinion, but when I held more seriously consider- 
ed of the matter, I told him, we ran a great hazard In at- 
tempting to return, being on the wrong side of the Straits

of Molucca, and that, if, upon alarm given, we should be- 
taken by the Dutch at Batavia, or English elsewhere, our 
running away would be a sufficient evidence to condemn us. 
This danger indeed startled not. only my partner, but like- 
wise all the ship’s company ; so we changed our former re- 
solution, and resolved to go to the coast of Tonquin, and so 
to that of China, where, pursuing our first design as to- 
trade,\ve might likewise have an opportunity to dispose of 
the ship some way or other, and to return to Bengal in any 
country vessel we could procure- This being agreed to,, 
we steered away N. N. E. about 50 leagues off the usual 
course to. the east, which put us to some inconveniences. 
As the wind blew steadily against us, our voyage became 
more tedious, and we began to be afraid of want of provi- 
sion ; and what was still worse, we apprehended, that as 
those ships, from whose boats we had escaped, were bound 
to China, they might get before us,. and have given fresh in- 
formation,. which might create another vigorous pursuit.— 
lndeed,.I could, not help being.grieved, when I. considered 
that I who had never wronged or defrauded any person in, 
my life, was now pursued like a common thief, and if taken , 
to run the greatest danger of being executed as such ; and, 
though innocent, I found myself under the necessity of fly- 
ing for my safety; and thereby escape being, brought to- 
shame, of which I was even more afraid than of death itself. 

It was easy to read my dejection, in my. countenance. My 
mind was oppressed, like those unhappy innocent persons, 
who being overpowered by blasphemous and perjured evi- 
dences, wickedly resolved to take away their lives, or ruin 
their reputation, have no other recourse in this world to. 
ease their sorrow, but sighs, prayers, and tears. My partner, 
seeing me so concerned, encouraged me as well as he could ; 
and after describing to me the several ports of that coast, 
he told me, he would either put me in on the coast of Co- 
chingchina, or else in the Bay of Tonquin, from whence we- 
might go to Macao, a town once possessed, by the Portu- 
guese, and where still many European families resided. 

To this place we steered, .and early next morning, came 
ih sight of the coast ; but thought it. advisable to put into-, 
a small river where we could, either over land,, or by the- 
ship's pinnace, know what vessels were in any ports there- 
abouts;. This happy step proved our deliverance ; for, next: 
eo O f iungt- there came to the Bay of Tonquin, two-Dutaiu

, ships, and a third, without any colours ; and in the evening 
two English ships steered t tie same course. The river 
where vve were was but small, and run but.a tew leagues up- 
the country northward ; thecountry was wild and barbarous 
and the people thieves, having no correspondence with any 
oilier nation ; dealing only in. fish, oil, and such gross com- 
modities : and one barbarous custom they still retained, that 
when any vessel was unhappily shipwrecked upon their 
coast, they make the men prisoners or slaves ; so that now 
we might fairly say we were surrounded by enemies both, 
by sea and land. 

As the-ship had been leaky, we took the opportunity, in 
this place, to search her, and to stop up the places which 
let in the w ater- We accordingly lightened her, and bring- 
ing our guns and other moveable tilings to one side, we es- 
sayed to bring her down,, that we might come to her bot- 
tom :-but, upon second consideration, we did not think it 
safe to let her lie on. dry. ground, neither indeed was the 
place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not used to such 
a sight as to see a ship lie down on one sideband heel in to 
wards the shore, and not perceiving the men,, who were at 
work on her bottom, with stages and boats on the off-side, 
presently imagined the ship had been cast away, and lay 
fast on the ground. Agreeable to this supposition, they 
surrounded us with ten. or twelve large boats, with a reso- 
lution,, undoubtedly, to plunder the ship, and carry, away 
those they found alive for slaves to their king. But when, 
they perceived our men hard at work on the ship’s bottom 
and side, washing, graving, and stopping her,. it filled them 
all with such surprise, that they stood gazing as though they 
were confounded. Nor could vve imagine what their de- 
sign was ; however, for fear of danger,, we handed down 
arms and ammunition, to those at work, in order to defeud 
themselves ; and,, indeed, this precaution was absolutely 
necessary ; for, in a quarter of an hour after, the natives, 
concluding it was really a. shipwreck, and that we were sa- 
ving our lives and goads, which they thought belonged to 
them, came down upon our men, as though -it had been in 
line of battle. We lay atipresent but in a very unfit posture 
to fight ; and before the stages could be got down, or the 
men in the boat come on board as they were ordered, the

as prisoner*!. The first they -seized was a stout English 
sailor, who never fired his musket, like a fool as I imagined, 
hut laid it down in the boat : but he knew what he was do- 
ing ; for by main force, he dragged the Pagan out of the 
boat into ours by the two ears, and knocked his brains oot 
against the boat’s gunnel ; a Dutchman that was next him 
snatched up the musket, and knocked down five more with 
the butt-end of it ; however, this was doing very little to 
their number ; but a strange unexpected accident, which 
rathe t^merits. laughter than any thing else, gave our men a 
complete victory over them. 

It seems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave the 
outside of the ship, as well as to pay the seams, where he 
caulked to stop the leaks, had gotten two. kettles just let 
down in the boat, one filled with boiling pitch, and the 
other with rosin, tallow, oil, and such stuff as the ship- 
wrights use ; the carpenters man had a great iron ladle 
with which he used to supply the workmen with hot stuff, 
and as two of the enemies entered the boat where the fel- 
low stood, he saluted them with a full ladle of the hot boil- 
ing liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked, made 
them roar oot, and jump into the sea. “'Well done, Jack," 
says the carpenter “give them the other dose:” and so 
stepping forward himself, takes a mop, and dipping it into 
the pitch pot, he and his man so plentifully flung it among 
then), as that none escaped being scalded ; upon which they 
all made the best of their way, crying and howling in such 
a frightful manner, that, in all my adventures, I never heard 
the like. And, indeed, never was I better pleased with 
any conquest than I was with this, there being so little 
bloodshed, and having' an aversion to killing such savage 
wretches, (more than was necessary) as knowing they came 
on errands, which their law and customs made them think 
were just'and equitable. By this time, all things being in 
order, and the ship swimming, they found their mistake, so 
they did not venture a second attack. Thus ended our 
merry fight ; and, having got rice, bread, roots, and sixteen 
good hogs on board the day before we set sail, not {Wing 
to go into the bay of Tonquin, but steered N. E. toward 
the island of Formosa, or as tho’ we would go to tiie Ma- 
nillas, or Philippine islands, for fear of meeting with any 
European ships ; when we anchored at the isle of Formosa, 
the inhabitants not only courteously supplied us with pro-

• visions and fresh water, -but dealt very fairly and honestly 
with us in their bargains and agreements. From this place 
we steered north, keeping still oft' the coast of China, till 
we were beyond all its ports where European ships usually 
come ; and, at length, being come to the latitude of thirty 
rlegrees, we resolved to put into the first trading port we 
should come at ; and standing for the shore, a boat came off 
two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board, 
who offered his service ; we very gladly accepted him, anil 
sent the boat back again. And now, haring thelold man 
s\ on board, I talked to him- of going to Nanquin, the most 
northward part of the coast ot China. “ What will you do 
there r” said he smiling. I told him we would sell our 
cargo, and purchase calicoes, raw and wrought silks, tea, 
&e. and so returv the same way bac k. “ O,” said lie, " you 
had better put in at MaCao, where you may buy China wares 
as cheap as ai Nanquin, and sell your opium at a greater 
advance.” “ But,” said I, “ we are gentlemen, as well as 
merchants, and design to see the great city of Pekin, and 
the magnificent court of the monarch of China.” “ Why, 
then,” said he, “you should go to N«rgpo, TrhtW there is 
a navdgable river that goes through the heart of that vast 
empire, two hundred and seventy leagues from the sea, 
which crosses all the rivets, passes considerable hills, by 
the help of the sluices and gates, and goes, even qp to the 
city of Pekin. You may go to Nanquin, if you please, and 
travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch ship just before bound 
that way.” At the name of a Dutch or English ship, I was 
struck with confusion; they being as great a terror to me 
in this vessel, as an Algerine man of war is to them, in the 
Mediterranean. The old man finding me troubled, “ Sir,” 
said he, “ I hope Dutch are not now at war with your na- 
tion ” “ No,” said 1, “ but God knows what liberty they 
may take when out of the reach of the law.” “ Why,” saya^ 
he, “ what occasion is there for peaceable merchants to fear ? 
For, believeme, they never meddle with any but PIRATES,” 
At the mentioning the word Pirates, my countenance 
turned to that of scarlet ; nor was it possible for me to con- 
ceal it from the old pilot; who taking notice of it, ?‘Sir,” 
said he, "take what course you please, FU-do you all the 
service T can.” "Seignior,” said, 1, “I am a little con-, 
coi ned at your mentioning pirates ; I hope there are none 
such in these seas, because you see in. what weak, condition. 



230 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

we are to defend ourselves.” “ O, Sir,” said he, " if that’s 
all, don’t be concerned, I don’t remember one in these seas 
these" fifteen years, except about a month ago one was seen 
in the bay of Siam, but he is gone to the southward ; nei- 
ther was she built for a privateer, but was run away with 
by a reprobate Captain, and some of his men, the right 
Captain having been murdered by the Malayans.” 

“ What !” said I, (as though ignorant of what had hap- 
pened) “ did they kill tho Captain ?” “ No.” said he, “ it is 
generally thought the Malayans murdered him ; but perhaps 
they might procure them to do it, and therefore they justly 
deserve hanging. Tl>e rogues were lately discovered in 
the Bay of Siam, in the river of Cambodia, by some Dutch- 
men who belonged to the ship, and had much ado to escape 
the five boats that pursued them, but thfcy have solemnly 
sworn to give no quarter to the Captain or the seamen, but 
hang them every one up at the yar<J-arm, without any formal 
business of bringing them to a court of judicature.” 

Being sensible, that, having the old man on board, he 
was incapableot doing me any mischief “ W^U, Seignior,” 
said T, “it is for ibis Very reason I would have yon carry 
us up to Nanquin, where neither English nor Dutch ships 
come ; and I must tell you, their Captains are a parcel of 
rash, proud, insolent rascals, that ne : ther know what belong* 
to justice, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of God 
or nature direct ; fellows that would prove murderers to 
punish robbers, and take upon them to adjudge innocent 
men to death, without any proof to prove them guilty ; but 
perhaps I may live to call them to account for it, in a place 
where they may be taught how justice is to be executed.” 
.And so I told him all the story of buying the ship, and how 
we were saved by the means of two men : that the murder 
of the Captain by the Malayans, as also the running away 
with the ship, 1 believed to be true ; but that we, who 
bought it, were turned pirates, was a mere fiction, to cover 
their cowardice and foolish behaviour, when they attacked 
us, and the blood of those men we killed in our own just de- 
fence lay at their door, who sent to attack us by surprise. 

“Sir,” said the old man -amazed, “you have takpft the 
right course to steer to the north, and, if. I might advise 
you, I would have you sell your ship in China, and buy or 
build another in that country ; and I’ll procure people to 
buy the one and sell the other.” “ Well, but, Seignior,”

said I, " if I sell the ship in this manner, I may bring some' 
innocent persons into the same dangers] have gone through, 
perhaps worse, even death itself; whereby I should be as 
guilty oT their murder as their villainous executioners.” — 

*‘ That need not trouble you,” says the old man, “ I’ll find 
a way to prevent that ; for these commanders you talk of 
I Lnow very well, and w'ill inform them rightly of the mat- 
ter as you have related, and 1 am persuaded they Will not 
only believe me, but act more cautiously tor the future.”— 
And will you deliver one message from me to them ?“ 
“ Yes,” said he, “ it you will give it under your hand, that 
I may prove it is not of my own production.” Hereupi n 
I wrote a large account of their attacking me in their long- 
boat, the pretended reason and unjust design of it ; that 
they had done what they might be ashamed of, and could 
not answer for at any tribunal in England. But this letter 
was writ in vain. Providence ordered things another wa\ . 
We sailed directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen da is 
sail, came to an anchor at the south-west point of the gre; t 
gulph of that place, where we learned, that two Dut; h 
ships were gone the length before us7 and that we shou'd 
certainly fall into their hands. We were all at a great h s$ 
in this exigency, and would very gladly have been on shore 
almost any where ; but our old pilot told me, that if I 
would sail to the southward about two and forty leagues, 
there was a little port called Quinchange, where, no Euro- 
pean ships ever came, and where we might consider what 
was further to be done. Accordingly w e weighed anchor 
the next day, calling only twice on shore by the wav to 
get fresh water. The country people very courteously 
sold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other provisions. After 
five days sad we came to the port, and landed with unspeak- 
able joy. We resolved to dispose of ourselves and effects 
in any other way possible, than enter on board that ill-fated 
vessel more ; for.no state can be more miserable than a 
continued fe; r, which is a life of death, a contbunder of 
our understandings, that sets the imagination at work to 
form a thousand frightful things that may never happen. 
And vve scarce slept one night, without dreaining-of halters, 
yard-art:. s, or gibbet's, of fighting, being taken, and being 
killed ; nay, so violent were our apprehensions, that we 
would bruise our hands and heads against the sides of the 
cabin, as though actually engaged. The story of the Dutch

cruelty at Amboyna, often came into our thoughts when 
awake ; and, for my part, I thought my condition my 
bard, that after so many difficulties and such signal deliver- 
ances, I should be banged in my old age, though innocent 
of any crime that deserved such punishment ; but then re- 
ligion would seem to represent to me, as though the voice 
oi it had said, consider, O man ! w hat sins you have been 
formerly guilty of; which now thou art called to an account 
for, to expiate w ith thy blood ! And as to thy innocence, 
what art thou more innocent than thy blessed Redeemer 
Jesus Chirst, who suffered for thy offences, and to wffiose 
providence you ought to submit, let what will happen? 
After liiis, natural courage would inspire me to resist to 
the last drop of blood, and sooner die than suffer myself to 
be taken by boorish, rascally Dutchmen, who had arts to 
torment beyond death itselfi 

But^now, thank kind Heaven, being ashore, our old pilot 
procured us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods ; it 
was a little but with a large warehouse joining to it, all 
built with canes, and pallisadoed round with large ones, to 
keep out pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in that 
country. The magistrates allowed us a little guard during 
the night, and we employed a centenal with a kind of hal- 
bert for three pence a day. - The fair, or mart, we found, 
bad been over tor some time ; however, there remained in 
the river four junks and two Japan ships, the merchants of 
fhe latter being on shore. In the first place, our old pilot 
brought us acquainted with the missionary Roman priests, 
who w-ere converting the people to Christianity : two of 
them were reserved, rigid, and austere, applying themselves 
to the work they came about with great earnestness ; but 
the third, wfio was a Frenchman, called Father Simeon, was 
of a freer conversation, not seemingly so serious and grave, 
yet no worse Christian than the ocher two, one of whom 
was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese. Father Simeon, 
it seems, was appointed to go to Pekin, the royal seat of 
the Emperor of the Chinese; and he only waited for ano- 
ther priest, who was ordered from Macoa to accompany 
him. We never met together, but he was prompting me 
to accompany him in that journey : “ Sir,” said he, •* I 
will show you the glorious things of this, mighty empire, 
and a city, the city of Pekin, far exceeding London and 
Paris, put them both together. One day in particular, be-

ing at dinner with htm, I showed some inclination to go ; 
which made him press the more upon me and my partner, 
to gain our perfect consent. “ But, Father Simeon,” said 
my partner, “ what satisfaction., can you have in our com- 
pany whom you esteem as heretics, and consequently objects 
not worthy your regard ?” “ O,” said he, “ you may be as 
good Catholics in time as those I hope to convert to ouc 
religion.” “ And ■so,” said I, “ we shall have you preach- 
ing to us all the way, instead of pleasing us with a descrip- 
tion of the country." “ Sir,” said he, " however our reli- 
gion may b* villified by some msople, it is very certain it 
neither divests us of good manors or Christian charity ; 
and as we are gentlemen, as such we may converse toge- 
ther, without making one another uneasy.” 

But we shall leave him awhile, to consider our ship and 
the merchandise which we had to dispose of. There was 
but very little trade in the place where we were ; and I 
was once resolved to venture to sail to the river Kilam, and 
so to the city of Nanquin ; but Providence ordered it other- 
wise, by our old pilot’s bringing a Japan merchant to us, to 
see what goods we had. He immediately bought our opium, 
for which he gave us a very good price in gold by weight, 
some wedges of which were about ten or eleven ounces. 
Jt came into my head that perhaps he might buy the ship 
too ; and I ordered his interpreter to propose it to him. — 
He said nothing then, but shrugged up his shoulders ; yet 
in a few days after he came accompanied by a missionary 
priest, who was his interpreter, with this proposal, “ That 
as he had bought a great quantity of our goods, he had not 
money enough to purchase our ship ; but if I pleased he 
would hire her, with all my men, to go to Japan, and from 
thence with another loading to the Philippine islands, the 
freight of which he would very willingly pay to us before ; 
and at their return to Japan, would buy the ship.” Upon 
this we asked the Captain and his men, if they were willing 
to go to Japan ; to which they unanimously agreed. While 
this was in agitation, the young man my nephew left to 
attend me, told me, “ That as I did not care to accept this 
prospect of advantage, he would manage it for me as I 
pleased, and render me a faithful accounf of his success, 
which would be wholly mine.” Indeed I was very unwil- 
ling to part with him ; but considering it might be for the 



' 534 ' ’S.IF-E AND ADVJENIUK.ES 

young man’s good, I discoursed with my. partner about ft, 
who, of his own generosity, gave him his share of the vessel, 
so that I could do no otherwise than give him mine : but, 
however, we let him have but the pioper halt of it, and 
preserved a power, that when we met in England, if he 
had obtained success, he should account to us for one half of 
the profits of the ship’s freight, and the other should be his 
own. Thus having. taken a -writing under his hand, away 
he sailed to Japan, where the merchant dealt very honestly 
by him, got him a licence to come on shore, sent him leaded 
to the Philippines with a Japanese supercargo, from whence 
he came baejk again loaded with European goods, cloves, and 
other spiceries. By this voyage he cleared a considerable 
sum of money, which determined him not to sell his ship, 
but to trade on his own account ; so he returned to the Ma- 
nillas, where, getting acquaintance, he made his ship free, 
■was hired by the governor privately to go to .Acapulco in 
America, on the Mexican coast, with a licence to travel to 
the great city of Mexico. This traffic turned out greatly 
to account, and my friend findijuLmeans to get to Jamaica, 
returned nine years after exceedingly rich into England. 

In parting with the ship, it comes In course to consider 
of those men who had saved our lives when in the river of 
Cambodia ; and though, by the way, they were a couple of 
rogues, who thought to turn pirates themselves, yet we 
paid them what they had before demanded, and gave each 
of them a small sum of money, making the Englishman a 
gunner, aid the Dutchman a boatswain, with which they 
were very well contented. 

We were now about 1000 leagues farther from home, 
than when at Bengal. All the coinfort we could expect 
was, tliat there being another fair to be kept in a month’s 
time, we might not only purchase all sorts of that country’s 
manufactures, but very possibly 'find some Chinese junks, 
or vessels from Tonquin, to be sold, which would carry us 
and our goods wheresoever we pleased. Upon these hopes, 
we resolved to continue ; and to divert ourselves, we took 
several little joumies in the country. About ten days after 
we parted with our ship, -we travelled to see the city of 
Nanquin. The city lies in latitude 30 degrees north of the 
line : it is regularly built, and the streets are exactly stra 'ght. 
and cross one anoiher in direct lines, which sets it out to 
the greatest advantage. At our return, we found the priest

was come from Macoa, that was to accompany father Si- 
mon to Pekin.- That fatlver earnestly solicited me to ac- 
company him, and I referred him to my partner. In short,, 
we both agreed, and prepared accordingly ; and we were 
so lucky as to have liberty to travel among the retinue of 
one of their Mandarines, who is a principal magistrate, and 
ninth reverenced by the people* 

We were five and twenty days travelling thro’ this miser- 
able country, infinitely populous,, but as indifferently cul- 
• tivated ; and yet their pride is infinitely greater ihan their 
poverty, insomuch that the priests ‘themselves derided them. 
As we passed by the house of one of their country gentle- 
men, two leagues off Nanquin; we had the honour, forsooth,, 
to ride with the Chinese squire about two miles. Never 
was Don Quixote so exactly imitated ! Never such a com- 
pound of pomp and poverty seen before I 
< His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greasy, and very 
proper for a~ Merry Andrew or Scaramouch/ with all its 
tawdry trappings, as hanging sleeves, tassels, &c. though' 
torn and rent in almost every part ; his vest underneath it 
was no less dirty, but more greasy, resembling the most ex-- 
quisite sloven or greasy butcher : his horse (worse than Ro- 
sinante, or the famous steed of doughty Hudibras) was a 
poor starved decrepid thing, that would not sell for thirty 
shillings in England ; and yet this piece of worshipful pomp 
was attended with ten or twelve slaves who guarded their 
master to his country seat. We stopped at a little village 
for refreshment ; and when we came by the country seat of 
tliis great man, we found him sitting under a tree before his 
door, eating a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of 
garlic in the middle, and a bag filled with green pepper by 
him, and another plant like ginger, together with a piece 
-ol lean mutton in it : this was his worship’s repast : but 
pray observe the state of thefood ! two women slaves brought 
him his food, which - being laid before him, two others ap- 
peared to perform their respective offices ; one fed him 
with a spoon, w hile the other scraped off what fell upon his 
beard and taffety vest, and gave it to a particular favourite 
to eat. And thus we left the wretch pleased with the con- 
ceit of our admiring his magnificence, which rather merited 
our scorn and detestaion. 

At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin, accom- 
panied by two servants, and the old Portuguese pilot, whose

charges we bore, and who served us as an interpreter bjr 
the way. We had scarce been a week at Pekin, but he 
comes laughing to us, “ Ah ! Seignior Inglise,” said he, 

*' me something tell you make your heart glad, but make 
me sor.ry ; for you bring me here twenty-five days journey, 
and know you leave me go back alone ; and which way 
shall I make my port after, without de ship, without de 
horse, w-ithout pecune ?” so he called money in his broken 
Latin. He then informed me, that tl>ere was a great ca- 
ravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city, who 
were preparing to set out for Museovy by land within six 
weeks ; and, that lie was certain we would take this oppor- 
tunity, and consequently that he must go home by himselfc 
Indeed this news infinitely surprised and pleased me. — 

“ Are you certain of this said I. “ Yes, Sir,” says he, 

" me sure its true.” And so he told me, that having met 
an old acquaintance of his, an Arnffenian, in the street, who 
was among them, and who had come from Astracan, with 
a design to go to Tonquin, but for certain reasons having 
altered his resolutions, he was now resolved to go with the 
caravan, and to return by the river Wolga to Astracan.— 
“\Vell, Seignior,” said I, “don’t be discontented about 
your returning alqne : and if, by this means, I can hud a 
passage to England, it will be your own fault if you return 
to Macao at ail.” And so consulting with ray partner what 
was best to be done, he referred it to me as 1 pleased, bar- 
ing our affairs so well settled at Bengal, that, if he could , 
Convert the good voyage he bad made in China silks, 
wrought or raw, he would be satisfied to go to England, 
and so return to Bengal in the Company’s ships. Thus re- 
solved, vve agreed that if our pilot would go with us, we 
would bear his charges either to Moscow, or England ; and 
to give him in a present the sum of one hundred and seventy 
pounds sterling. Hereupon we called him in, and told 
him the cause of his complaint should be removed, if be 
would accompany ns with the caravans ; and, therefore, w'e 
desired to know his mind. At this he shook his head, 

“ Great long journey,” said he, “ me no pecune carry me 
to Moscow, of keep me there.” But we soon put, him out 
of that concern, by making him sensible of what we would 
give him here to lay out to the best advantage ; and, as for- 
his charges, we would set him safe on shore, God willing, 
either in Moscovy, or England, as he pleased* at our own

charge, except the carriage of his goods. At this proposal,* 
he was like a man transported, telling us, he would go with 
us all the world over ; and we made preparations tor our 
journey but it was near four months before all the mer- 
chants w.ere ready.' . . . . 

In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went express 
to the port where we first pul in, to dispose- of what goods 
bad been left there, while I accompanied a Chinese mer- 
chant who was going to Nanquin, and there bought twenty- 
nine pieces of damask, w ith about three hundred more of 
other line silks •, and, by the time my partner returned to 
Pekin, I had them all carried thither ; our cargo in silks 
amounted to 4-5001. sterling, which, together with tea, fine 
calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves, loaded eighteen camels for 
our share, besides what we road upon, with two or three 
spare horses, and two more loaden with provisions ; the 
company now was very great, making about four hundred > 
horse, and above, one hundred and twenty men, w ell armed 
and provided. We were of several nations, among whom 
were five Scotch merchants, inhabiting in Moscow, and 
w ell expet ienced.in trade- 

We set out. -from Pekin the beginning of February out 
style ; and in two days more, we passed through tfie gate 
of the great China wall, which was erected as a fortifica- 
tion against the Tartars, being one hundred English miles 
long. We then entered a country not near so populous, . 
chiefly under the power of plundering Tartars, several com- 
panies of whom we perceived riding on poor starved horses, 
contemptible as themselves, without order or discipline. — 
Onetime our leader, .for the day gave us leave to go a 
hunting ; - but what do you’ think we hunted i only a parcel 
.of sheep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for wild- 
ness and swiftness ; but while we were pursuing this game, 
it was our chance to meet with about forty Tartars, who 
no sooner perceived us, but one of them blew a horn, at 
the sound of which there soon appeared a troop of ibrty or 
fifty more, at about a mile’s distance. Hereupon one oi’ 
the Scots merchants (who knew their ways) ordered us to 
advance towards them, and attack them immediately. As 
we advanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, which happily 
fell a little short of us ; this made us halt a little, to return 
the compliment with bullets j and then being -led up by

thet bold Scot, we fired our pistols in their faces, and drew 
out our sWords ; but there was no occasion ; for they tlevv 
like timorous sheep, and only three of them remained, 
beckoning to the rest to come back. But our brave com- 
mander gallops up to them by himself, shot one dead, 
knocked another off bis horse, while the third ran, away ; 
And thus ended our battle with the Tartars. 

We travelled a month more through the Emperor of 
China's dominions ; and at length coming to one of their 
towns about a day and a halt’s journey from the city of 
Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. The person J spoke to 
would have brought me one, but, like a fool, I must go 
along with hitn, about two miles from the village. My 
btd pilot and I walked on fbct, forsooth for some variety, 
when coming to the place w here the camels were kept as 
in a park guarded by Chinese soldiers, we there agreed 
and bought one, which the Chinese man that came along 
with me led along the road. But we had not gone tar, be- 
fore we were attacked byi-five Tartars, mounted on horse- 
back, two of w hom seized the man, took the camel from 
him, and rode away, while the other three approached us, 
ihe first of whom suddenly seized me as I was drawing my 
sWord, the second knocked me dowm, but my old trusty 
Portuguese, taking a pistol out of his pocket, which I knew 
nothing of, and cdming up to the fellow that struck me, he 
with one hand pulled him oft’ his horse, and then shot hitn 
dead upon the spot ; then taking his scymitar, he struck 
at the rtian that stopped us, but missing him, cut off one of 
his horse’s hears, the pain of w hich made him throw his 
rider to the ground. The poOr Chinese who had led the 
camel, seeiYig the Tartar down, runs to him, and seizing 
upon his pole ax, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked 
hrs brains out. But there was another Tartar to deal with, 
who seeming neither inclined to fight nor fly, and mV old 
man having begun to charge his postol, the sight of it struck 
such a terror into the wretch, that aw'ay he scoured, leav- 
ing my old pilot, rather my champion and defender, an 
absolute victory. 

By this time being awakened frdm my trance, I began 
to open my eyes, wondering where I was, having qaite 
fo,>t ail that passed ; but my senses returning, and feeling 
a great pain in my head, and seeing the blood was runnings 
Aver my clothes, I instantly jumped upon my feet, and

grasped my sword in my hand, with a resolution to take re- 
venge : biit no enemies now remained, except ti\e dead 
Tartar, with his horse standing by him. The old man 
seeing me recovered, whom he thought slain, ran towards 
me, and embraced me with the greatest tendefndss, at the 
same time examining into my wound, which was far from 
being mortal. When we returned to the village, the man 
demanded payment tor his camel, which 1 refusing, we 
brought the cause before a Chinese judge, who acted with 
great impartiality : Having heard both sides, he asked th^ 
Chinese man that Went with me, whose servant he was ? 
“ Sir,” said he, “ I am nobody’s, but went with the stran- 
ger at his request “ Why then,” said the judge, ” you 
are the stranger’s servant tor the time, atid the camel be- 
ing delivered to his servant, it is the same as though de- 
livered to himself, and accordingly he must pay for it.” — 
Indeed the case was so fairly stated, that I had nothing to 
object to if; so, having paid for that I was robbed of, I 
sent for another, but did not go myself to fetch it, as I had 
enough of that sport before. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese Empire, so 
fortified, as some will tell you, that millions of Tartars can- 
not batter down theirWalis ; by which certahjiy one might 
think one of our cannons would do more execution than all 
their legions. 

When we were within a day’s march of that city, we 
had information that the governor had sent messengers ’to 
every part of the road, to inform the travellers and caravans 
io halt, till a guard was sent to protect them from the nu- 
merous bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about- the 
city. This neWs put us into great consternation ; btit, 
obeying the Orders, we slopt ; and two days after, there 
cartie two hundred soldiers from a garrison of the Chinese, 
and three hundred more from Naum ; thus guarded both 
in tire front and rear, with our own men hi the flanks, we 
boldly advanced, .thinking we were able to combat with 
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they hppeared. 

Early ne'kt rooming, hi our march from a little well situ- 
ated town called Changu, after having passed a river, and 
entered upon a desalt of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, 
we soon beheld, by a cloud of dust that was raised!, that 
the enemy »vas approaching. This much dispirited the 
Chinese. My old pilot took, notice of it, and called- oft t.

“ Seignior Inglise, those fellows must be < ucourage<I,or they 
will min us all ; anti 1 am afraid if the Tartars attack us,, 
they will all run away.” “Why Seignior,” said 1, “what 
shall be done in this easer” “ Done,” says he, “ why let 
fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each wing. I 
know the fellows will tight well enough in company. Wc 
accordingly took his advice, and inarched fifty to the right 
wing, and the same number to the leit, and with the rest 
made a line of reserve, leaving the last two hundred men 
to guard the camels, or to assist us, as occasion required. 

Thus prepared, a party of the eneuiy came forward, view- 
ing our posture, and traversing the ground on tho front of 
our line. Hereupon we ordered the two wings to move 
on, and give them a salute with their shot; which accord- 
ingly was done. This put a stop to their proceedings ; 
for immediately wheeling off to their left, they ail matched 
away, and we saw no more of them. They had undoubtedly 
given an account to their companions of what reception 
they might expect, which made them so ea*.^ give over 
their enterprise. 

When we came to the city of Naum, we returned the 
governor hearty thanks, and distributed a hundred crowns 
among the soldiers that guarded us. We rested there one 
day, and then proceeded on our travels, passing several 
great rivers and deserts ; and on the 13th of April we came 
to the frontiers of Muscovy, the first town of which was- 
called Argun. 

This happy occasion, as I thought, of coming into a 
Christian country, made me congratulate the Scots mer- 
chant upon it. He smiled at that, telling me not to rejoice 
too soon; “ for,” said he, “except the Russian soldiers in 
garrison, and a few inhabitants of the cities upon the roa.d, 
all the rest of this country. For above a thousand miles, is 
inhabited by the most ignorant and batbarous Pagans.” 

We advanced from the river Arguna, by moderate jour- 
nies, ana found convenient garrisons on the road, filled with 
Christian soldiers, for the security of commerce, and for 
the convenient lodgings of travellers : but the inhabitants 
of the country were mere Pagans, worshipping the sun, moon, 
and stars. We partieulaily observed tins idolatry near the 
river Arguna, at a city inhabited by Tartars and Russians, 
called Nerisiukey. Being curious to see their way of liv- 
ing while the caravan, continued to rest themselves in that

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

city, I went to one of their villages, where there was' 
to be one of their solemn sacrifices. There I beheld, 
upon the stump of an old tree, an idol of wood, more ugly 
, than the representation of the devil himself * its head 
resembled no living creature; its ears were as big and as 
high as goats’ horns, a crooked nose, four-cornered mouth, 
and horrible teeth : it was cloathed in sheep skins, had a 
great Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing thro’ it, and 
was eight feet high, without feet, legs, or proportion. Be- 
fore this idol their lay sixteen or seventeen people, who 
brought their offerings, and were making their prayers, 
while at a distance stood three men, and one bullock, as 
victims to this ugly monster. 

Such stupendous sacrilege as this, in robbing the true 
God of his honour, filled me with the greatest astonishment 
'and reflection-; which soon turning to rage and tjiry, 1 rode 
up to the Image, and cut in pieces the bonnet that was upon 
his head with my sword, so that it hung down by one of 
the horns, while one of my men that was with me pulled at 
it by his sheep skin garment. Immediately an hideous 
howling and outcry ran through the village, and two or 
three hundred people coining about our ears. we were 
obliged to fly for it. 

But I had not done with the monster ; for the caravin 
being to rest three nights in the town, 1 told the Scots mer- 
chant what I had seen, ami that I was resolved to take four 
or five men well armed with me, in order to destroy the 
idol, and show the people how little reason they had to trust 
in a god who could not 9ave himself. At first he laughed 
at me, representing the danger of it, and when it was 
destroyed, what time had we to preach to them better 
11 ings, whose zeal and ignorance was in the greatest degree, 
and both unparalleled ? that if I should be taken by them, I 
should be served as a poor ruffian, who contemned their 
worship ; that is, to be stripped naked, and tied to the top 
of the idol, there shot at with arrows till my body was full 
of them, and then burnt as a sacrifice to the monjtfer ; “ bat 
Sir,” said he, " since your zeal carries you so far, rather 
than you should be alone I will accompany you, and bring 
a stout fellow equal to yourself, if you will, to assist you in 
'this design : and. accordingly he brought one Captain Rich- 
ardson, who, hearing the. story, readily consented; but j»y 
partner declined it, being altogether out of his way : aha 
so we three, and my servant, resolved; to execute this ex-

ploit about midnight ; but vrppn second thought* we defer- 
red it to the next night, by reason that the caravan being 
to go from hence the next morning, we should be out of 
the governor’s power. The better to effectuate my design* 

I procured a Tartar’s sheep skin robe, a bonnet-, with bow 
and arrow's, and every one of us got the like habits. The 
first night we spent in mixing combustible matter with aqua- 
vita*, gunpowder, 8ic. having a good quantity of tar in a, 
little pot : next night we came up to the idol about eleven, 
o’clock, the moon being up. We found none guarding 
■ it ; but we perceived a light in the house, where we had 
seen the priests before. One cf our men was for firing the 
hot, another for killing the people* and^ a third lor mak- 
ing them prisoners, while the idol was destroyed. Wc 
agreed to the latter; so knocking at the door, \ve seized, 
the first that opened it, and stopping his mouth and tying 
his feet, we left him. We served the other two in the like 
manner; and then the Scots merchant set fire to the com- 
position, which frightened them so much, that vve brought, 
them sll away prisoners to their wooden god. There we 
fell to work w ith him, daubing him all ove> with tar roixedT- 
with tallow and brimstone, stopping his eyes, ears, and 
mouth full of gunpowder,. with a great piece of wiki-fire in. 
his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage All this be- 
ing done, vve unloosed and ungagged the prisoners, and set 
the idol on fire, which the gunpowder blowing up, tbe- 
shape of it was deformed, rent, and split, which the forage 
utterly consumed ; for we staid to see its destruction, lest 
the ignorant idolatrous people should have thrown them- 
selves into the flames. And thus we came away undisco- 
vered, in the morning appearing as busy among our fellow- 
travellers, as nobody could have suspected any other* but 
that we had been in our beds all night. 

Next morning vve set out, and had gone but a small 
distance from the city, when there came a multitude of 
people of the country to the gates of the city, demanding 
Siit is f ackj»’c%j ot the Russian governor for insulting their priests,, 
and burning their great, Cham Chi-Thanngu, who dwelt irv 
the sun, and no mortal would violate this image but some 
Christian miscreants ; and.being already no less than thirty 
thousand strong, they announced war against him and all. 
his Christians. 

" The governor assured tliem he was ignorant of the mat- 
ter, and that none of his garrison had been abroad ; that :u-

'deed there wars a caravan that went away that morning, and 
that he would send after them to inquire into it ; and who- 
ever was the offender, should be delivered into their hands. 

• This satisfied them tor the present, but the governor sent 
4o inform us, that if any of us had done it, we should make 
all the haste away possible, while Jre kept them in play as 
long as he could. Upon this we marched two days and 
two nights, stopping but very little, till at last we arrived 
at a village called Plothus, and hasted to Jerawena, another 
-of the Czar’s colonies. On the third day, having entered 
the desert, and passed the lake called Sliaks Oser, we be- 
held a numerous body of horse on the other side of jt to the 
•north, who supposed we had passed on that side of the lake ; 
but either having found the mistake, or being certainly in- 
formed of the way we took, they came upon us towards the 
dusk of the evening, just as we had pitched our camp be- 
tween two little but very thick woods, with a little river 
running before our front and some felled 'trees with which 
we covered our rear; a precaution wc always took, and 
which vve had just finished when the enemy came up. — 
They did not fall on us immediately, but sent three messen- 
gers, demanding the men who had insulted their priests, 
and burnt their god Cham Chi-Thaungu, that they might 
be burnt with fire ; that it this was complied w ith, they 
would peaceal^iy depart ; but if not, they would de- 
stroy one and ail of us. Our men started at one another 
on receipt of this message, but Nobody was the word, as. 
indeed nobody knew it, but he who did it. Cpon which 
-the leader of the caravan returned for answer, " That they 
were peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of their 
-priests and gods ; and therefore desired them not to disturb 
us, and put us under the necessity of defending ourselves.” 
But so far was this from satisfying them, that the next morn- 
ing coming to our right, they let fly a volley of arrows among 
us, which happily did not hurt any, because we sheltered 
■ourselves behind our baggage. We expected however to 
come to a closer engagement: but were happily saved by 
a cunning fellow, a Cossack, wdio obtaining leave of the 
leader to go out, mounts his horse, rides directly from our 
■rear, and taking a circuit, comes up to the Tartars, as 
though he had been sent express, and tells them a formal 
story, that the wretches who had burnt the Cham Chi- 
Thaungu, weregonc to$hiheilka,with aresolution to burn the

f od Shal-Isar, belonging to fhe‘Tongucses. Upon which, 
felieving this cunning Tartar, who was servant to our Mus- 
covites, away they drove to SliiheiUcaj and in Jess ihanthree 
minutes were out of sight, nor did we ever hear ofthemmore. 

When we came to the city of Jarawena, we rested five 
days, and then entered into a frightful desert, which held us 
twenty three days inarch, infested ’with several small com- 
panies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars, who never had the 
courage to attack us. After we had passed over this desert, 
we found several garrisons to defend the caravans from the 
violence of the Tartars : In particular the Governor of Adin- 
skoy offered us a guard of fifty men to the next station, if 
we apprehended any danger. The people here retained 
the same paganism and barbarity, only they were not so 
dangerous, being conquered by the Muscovites. The cloath- 
ing, both of men and women, is of the skins of beasts, living 
under the ground in vaults and caves, which have a com- 
munication with one another. They have idols almost iir 
every family; besides, they adore the sun and stars, water 
and snow ; and the least uncommon thing that happens in 
the elements, alarms them as much as thunder and lightning 
does the unbelieving Jews. 

' Nothing remarkable occurred in our march through this 
eountr}*. 1 - When we had gone through the desert, after two 
days farther travel, we came to Jenezoy, a Muscovite city, 
on the great river so called, which w*e were told parted Eu- 
rope from Asia. The inhabitants here were very little bet- 
ter, though intermixed with the Muscovites, but the won- 
der will cease, when I inform my reader of what was ob- 
served to tne. Us at the Czar rather converts the Tartars 
with soldiers than clergymen, and is more proud to make 
them faithful subjects, than good Christians. 

From this city to the river Oby, vve travelled over a 
pleasant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for want 
o? good management and people, and those few are mostly 
Pagans. This is the place where the Muscovite criminals 
are banished to, if they are not put to death. The next 
city we came to, was tire capital city of Siberia, called To- 
bofski, when having been almost seven months on our jour- 
ney, and winter drawing on a pace, my partner and I con- 
sulted about our particular affairs, in what manner we should 
dispose of ourselves. We had been told of sledges and 
rein-deer to carry jus over the snow in the winter season.

flie snow being frozen so hard, that the sledges can run 
upon the surface without any danger of going down. As I 
was bound to England, I now behoved either logo with the 
caravan to Jeroslaw, from thence west to Marva, and the 
gulph of Finland, and so by land or sea to Denmark ; or 
else I must leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, 
and so to Archangel, where I was certain of shipping either 
to England, Holland, or Hamburgh. One night 1 happened 
to gel into the company of an illustrious, but banished Prince, 
whose company and virtues were such as made me to pro-, 
pose to him a method how he might obtain his liberty. — 
11 My dear friend,” said he, 4t as I am hererhappily free froru 
jfty miserable greatness, with all its attendants of pride, am- 
bition, avarice, and luxury, if l should escape from this place, 
those pernicious seeds may again revive, to my lasting dis- 
quietude ; therefore let me remain in a blessed confinement, 
tor I am but flesh, a mere man, with passions and affections 
as such ; O beuiot my friend and tempter too ?” Struck 
dumb with surprise, 1 stood silent a-while^ nor was he less 
in disorder, by which perceiving he wanted to give vent to 
his mind, I desired him to consider of it, and so withdrew. 
But about two hours after he came to my apartment : “ Dear 
friend,” said he, “ though I cannot consent to accompany 
you, I shall have this satisfaction in parting, that you leave 
•me an honest man still ; but as a testimony of my affection 
to you, be pleased to accept this present of sables.” 

In return for his compliment, I sent my servant nejft 
morning to his Lordship with a small present of tea, two 
pieces of •China 'damask, and four litlfe wedges of gold ; 
but he only accepted the tea, one piece of damask, and one 
piece of gold, for the curiosity of the Japan stamp that was 
upon it. Not long after he sent for me, and told me that 
what he had refused himself, he hoped upon his account, I 
would grant to another, whom he should name : In short it 
was his only son, who was about two hundred miles distant 
from him, on the other side of the city, whom he said he 
would send for, if I .gave my consent. This I soon com- 
plied with ; upon which he sent his servants next day for 
his son, who returned in twenty days time, bringing seven 
horses loaded with valuable furs. At night the young Lord 
was conducted incognito into our apartment, where his fa- 
ther presented him to me. We then concerted the best

ways for travelling, andafter having bought a considerable 
quantity of sables, black fox skins, fine ermines, &c. 
'(which I sold at Archangel at a good price) we set out trorti 
this city the beginning of June, making a small caravan, be- 
ing about thirty -two horses and camels, of which I repre- 
sented the head. My young Lord had with him a very 
faithful Siberian servant, well acquainted with the roads. 
’We Shunned the principal towns and cities, as Tumen, Soli 
Kamoskoi, and several others, by reason of their strictness 
^ in examining travellers, lest any of the banished persons of 
distinction should escape. Having passed the river Kama, 
we came to a city on tine European side, called Sbloy Ka- 
^rnoskoi, where >we foupd the people mostly Pagans as before. 
We then passed a desert of about t\vo hundred miles over ; 
.but in other places it is near seven hundred. In passing 
this wild place, we were beset by a troop of men On. horse- 
back, and about five and forty men armed with bows and 
arrows. At first they looked earnestly on us, and then 
^placed themselves in our way. We were above sixteen 
men, and drew up a little line before opr camels. My 
young Lord sent out his Siberian servant, to know who 
they were ; but, when he approached them, he neither 
knew a word they said, tior would they admit him to come 
near them at his peril, but prepared to shoot him. At his. 
return, he told us he believed them to be Calmuck Tar- 
tars ; and that there were more upon the desert. This was 
but a small comfort to us ; yet seeing a little grove, about 
a quarter of a mile’s distance, we moved to it, by the old 
Portuguese pilot’s advice, without meeting with any oppo- 
sition. Here we found a marshy piece of ground, and a 
spring of water running into a little brook on one side, 
which joined another like it a little farther off, and these 
two formed the head of.tlie river caljed Writska. As soon, 
as we arrived, we went to w ork, cutting great arms off the 
trees, and laying them hanging (not quite off from one tre<$ 
to amflher. In this situation we w aited the motion of the 
enemy, without perceiving any advancement they made 
towards us. About two hours before night, being joined, 
by some others, in all about fourscore horse, among whom 
We fancied were some women, they came upon us with great 
fury. We find without ball, calling to them in the Russian, 
•longue* to know their business ; but they, either not know- 
ing, or seeming not to understand us, came directly to the

wood-side, not considering that we were so fortified, as that 
they could not break in. Our old pilot, the Portuguese, 
proved both our Captain and engineer, and desired us not 
to fire, till they came within pistol shot ; and when he gave 
the word of command, then to take the surest aim ; but he 
did not bid ns give fire, till they were within two pikes length 
of us, and then we killed fourteen of them, wounded seve- 
ral, as also their horses, having every one of us loaded our 
pieces with two or three bullets at least. So much were « 
they surprised at our undafintedness/that they retired about 
'a hundred roods from us. In the mean while we loaded 
our pieces again, and sallying out, secured four or five of 
their horses, whose riders we found were killed, and per- 
ceived them to be Tartars. About an hour after, they 
made another att^npt, to sec where they might break in ; 
but finding us ready to receive them, they retired. 

All tliat night we wrought hard, in strengthening our 
situation, and barricading the entrances into the woods ; 
but when daylight came> we hud a very unwelcome dis- 
covery; for the enemy, being encouraged by their num- 
bers,’ had set up eleven or twelve tents, in form of a esunp, 
about three quarters of a mile from us. I must confess, I 
was never more concerned in my life, giving myself and 
all that I had over for lost. And my partner declared, that 
as the loss of his goods would be his ruin, before they should 
be taken f rom h’im, he would fight to the last drop of his 
blood. ■’ As we could not pretend to force our way, we had 
recourse to a stratagem ; we kindled a large fire, which 
burnt all night J and no sooner was it dark, but we pursued

town named Ozdnzoys, where. we heard that several troops

that we were past all danger. In five days after we can} a

OF SOLITUDE, 

However solitude is looked upon as a restraint to tf*e- 
pleasure of the world, in company and conversation, yet it 
is a happy state of exemption from a sea of trouble, an 
inundation of vanity and vexation, of confusion and disap- 
pointment. While we enjoy ourselves, neither the joy nor 
sorrow of other men aflect us We are then at liberty,, 
with the voice of our soul, to speak, to God. By this we 
shun such frequent trivial discourse^ as often becomes an ob- 
struction to virtue : and how often do we find that we had, 
reason to wish we had not been in company,. or said nothing 
when we were there ? for either we offend God by the im- 
piety of our discourse,, or lay. ourselves open to the violence 
©f designing people by our unguarded expressions ; and 
frequently foil the coolness and treachery of pretended, 
friends, when once involved in trouble and affliction ; of 
Such unfaithful intimates (I should say enemies) who rather 
by false inuendoes would accumulate miseries upon us, than, 
honestly assist us when under the hard hand of adversity. 
But in a state of solitude, when our tongues cannot be heard, 
except from the great Majesty of Heaven, how’ happy are 
we, in the blessed enjovment of conversing with our Mu- 
ker !• It is then we make him. onr friend, which sets us.

above the envy and contempt of wicked men. When. a 
’ man converses with hirnself, lie is' sure that he does not 
converse with an enemy. Uur retreaf should be io.goQfi 
company, and good books. I mean not by solitude, tjj§t 
a man should retire into a cell, a desert or a monastry : 
which Would be altogether an useless and unprofitable re- 
straint i for as men are formed for society, and have an 
absolute hebesiity , and dependence upon one another : so 
there is a retirement of the soul, with which it converses iji 
heaven, even hi the midst of men ; and indeed no man m 
more fit to speak freely, than he who can, without any 
violence tri" himself, refrain his tongue, or keep silence altsp- 
gether. As- to religion, it is by this the soul gets acquaint- 
ed with the hidden mysteries of die holy writings ; here 
she finds those floods ofteftrsj in which good men wash them- 
selves day and night, and only makes a visit to God, and 
his holy angers. , In this conversation the truest peace and 
most solid joy are to be found ; it is a continual least of 
contentment pn earth, and the means of attaining everlast- 
ing happiness in heaven.

Honesty is a; virtue beloved by good men, and' pretended

to pay evtfry man his own is the common law of honesty: 
but to do good to all mankind, is the chancery law qf hp-

be an honestSnan, when he does not discharge the good 
eifices that are incumbent on a friendly, kind, and generous 
person : for, saith the prophet Isaiah, chap, xsxii. ver. 7, 8‘

paid the utmost farthing, haiig every malefactor without 4 
mercy, exact the penalty of every bond, and the forfeiture- 
of every indenture, this would be downwr-ight cruelty, and 
not honesty : and it is contrary to that general-rule, " To do- 
to another, that whichyou would have done untoyou.” Some- 
times necessity makes an honest man a knave; and a rich, 
man an honest man,because he has no occasionio be a knave. 
The trial of honesty is this : Did. you ever want bread, and 
bad your neighbour’s Joat in keeping, and would starve ra- 
ther than eat it ? Were you ever arrested, having in your 
custody another man’s cash,, and would -rather. go;to gaoL„. 
than break it i if so, this indeed may. be reckoned. honesty,. .

than life, and is a. precious ointment, and which, when a-, 
man has once lost, he has nothing left worth keeping.”* *

€f the present state of RELIGION in the World* 

I doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than relf- 
gion in the world, rnore adoration than supplication,.and; 
more hypocrisy than sinaerity ; and it is very melancholy, 
to consider, what numbers of people there are furnished* 
with the powers of reason and gifts of nature, and yet aban- . 
dotied to the grossest ignorance and depravity. But it. would 
be uncharitable for us to imagine (as some Papists, abound- 
ing with too much ill- nature, the only scandal to- religion, 
do) that they will certainly be in a state of damnation after 
this life ; for. how can we think it.cousisteut with the mercy 
and goodness of an infinite Being, to damn those creatures, 
when he has not furnished them, with the light of the gos* 
pel,? o& havta can suck/ proud, conceited, aisi cruel bigots,, 
prescribe rules to the justice and mercy, of God ? * 

We are told.by some people, .that. the great image which- 
King Nebuchadnezzar set. up to bo adored by his people 
hpld the representation of tire sun in its right hand, as the - 
principal object. of adoration. But to wave, this discoursed.

When I was at Portugal, there was held at that time the 
* court of justice of the inquisition. All the criminals were 
carried in procession to the great church, where eighkof

I am sorry- ta make any. reflection upon Christians ; birf t 
indeed, in Italy the Roman religion seems -the most cruel 
"and mercenary upon earth ; and a very judic'ous person, 
who tray el led through Italy, from Turkey,, tells, " That 
14 there is only the face and outward pomp of religion there ;■ 

“ that the- churcli protects murderers aud assassins ; and. 

" tlren delivers the civil raigjstrate over to Satan for doing 
"justice ; i interdicts whole kingdoms,, and shuts up the 
“ churches for want of paying a. few.ecclcsiastical dues, and. 

“ so puts a stop to religion for want.of their money : that* 

" the court of inquisition burnt two men for speaking dis- 
honourably of the Blessed Virgin.; and the missionaries 
“ of China toleraledjthe worshipping the devil by their new 
" converts: that Italy was the theatre, .where religion was 
"the grand opera; and that the Popish clergy were no 
. " other than the stage players.” j 

As to religion in Poland, they deny Christ to be tire 
Messiah, or. that the Messiah has some-in the flesh. And. 
as to their Protestants, they, are the followers of- Ladius 
Socinus vvho-denied our Saviour.’s divinity ; and have uOj 
concern about the divine inspiration of the Holy Ghost. 

In Muscovy their churches are built Of wood, and, in- 
deed, they haw but wooden priests, though of the. Greek

do to the Virgin Alary, for protection in all their difficulties

as (o the manner of paying him obedience in the Christian 
church ? I know not what reason to assign for this, except 
it be their different capacities and faculties. 

And indeed, upon this account, we have perceived, in 
all Christian countries, what mortal feuds have been about 
religion ; what wars and bloodshed have molested Europe, 
till the general pacification of the German troubles at the 
. treaty of WestphaFia ; and since those times, what persecu- 
tion in the same country among the churches of the Luthe- 
rans ; and should 1 take a prospect at home, what unhappy 
divi sions are between Christians in this kingdom, about 
Episcopacy and Presbytery ; the church of England and 
the Dissenters opposing one another like St. Paul and St. 
Peter, even to the face ; that is, they carry on the dispute 
to the utmost extremity. 

It might be a question, why there are such differences in 
leligiqus points, and why these breaches should be more hot - 
and irreconcilable ? All the answer I can give to this, is, 
that we enquire more concerning the truth of religion, than 
any other nation in. the world ; and the anxious concern we 
have about it, makes us jealous of every opinion, and tena- 
cious of our own ; and this is not because we are more 
furious and rash than other people; but the truth is, we are 
more concerned about them, and being semi bit' that the 
sfiipture is the great rule of faith, the standard for fife and" 
doctrine, we have recourse to it ourselves, without submit- 
ting to any pretended infallible judge upoft earth. 

There is another question, pertinent to the former, and 
that is; What remedy can we apply to this malady r And to 
this I must negatively answer. Not to be less religious, that 
we may differ the less. This is striking at the very root of 
alt religious differences ; for, certainly, were they to be 
carried on with a peaceable spirit, willing to be informed, 
war variety of opinions would- not have the name of differ- 
ences ; nor should we separate in communion of charity, 
though we did not agree in several articles of religion. 

Nor is there a less usef ul question to start, namely. Where 
will our unhappy religious differences end r To which, f 
b<Vpe, I may answer, in Heaven ; there all unchristian and 
unhroiherly differences will find a period; there we. shall 
embrace many a sinner, that here we think it a dishonour 
to conv erse with ; and perceive many a hOnrt we have bro- 
ken here with censures, repro&ehings, and revHipgs, mad#*

Here we shall perceive there have been other fleck.* than 
those of our fold ; tlrat those we have excommunicated have 
been taken into that superior communion ; and, in a word, 
that those contradicting notions and principle* which, we 
thought inconsistent with true religion, we shall then find 
reconrileable to- them*efvcs, to one another, and to the 
fountain of truth, if any man ask me, Why our differences 
cannot be ended on earth ? 1 answer. Were we all thorough- 
ly convinced, that then they would be reconciled"* we would 
put an end to them before ; but this is impossible to btrdone ; 
lor as men’s certain convictions of truth are not equal to 
one another, or the weight or significaney of such veracity : 
so neither can a general effect of this affair be expected on 
this side of time. 

Before I conclude this chapter, I shall 1 beg leave to dis- 
course a little of the- wonderful excellency of negative re- 
ligion and negative virtue. The latter sets out, like the*- 
Pharisee, with — God 1 , I thank thee ; it is a piece of religi- 
ous pageantry, the hypocrite’s hope: and', in a word,, it is 
positive vice : for it js either a ma-k to deceive others, or a 
mist to deceive ourselves. A man that is cloathed with ne- 
gatives, thus argues-: I am not such a drunkard as nay land- 
lord, such a thief as my tenant, such a swearer as his neigh- 
bour; neither am I a cheat* an atheist, a rakish fellow, or 
a highwayman; no ! I live a sober,. regular, retired life : I 
am a good man, I go to church; God, I thank thee. Now, 
though a man boasts of his virtue in contradiction to the 
vices mentioned, yet a person had better have them alto- 
gether than the man himself; for he is so full of hitmelf, so 
persuaded that he is good and' religipus enough already, 
that he has no thoughts of any thing* except it he to pull off 
his hat to. God" Almighty. now and then, and thank him that 
he has no occasion for him ; and- has the vanity to-thrnk 
that his neighbours must imagine well of him too-. 

The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is yet in- 
toxicated 1 witfojhe pride of his own worth ; a good neigh- 
bour and peace-maker in other families, but a tyrant in his 
own ; appears in church for a show; but never falls upon 
bis knees in his closet ;. does all bis alms before men, to be 
seen of them ; eager in the duties of the second table, but 
regardless of the first ; appears religious, to be taken no- 
tice of by men, but without intercourse or communication 
between God and his own soul : Pray*, wiiat is-thts mam?

or what comfort is there of the life he lives ? he is inscnsiblP" 
of faith, repentance, and aChristian mortified. life : in a word 
he is perfectly a stranger to the essential part of religion. 

Let us for a while enter into the private and retired part 
of his conversation : What notions has he of his mispent 
hours, and of the progress of time to the great centre and 
gulph of life, eternity ? Does he know how to put a right 
value on time, or esteem the life-blood of bis soul, as it 
really is, and act in all the moments of it,- as one that must 
account for them ? if then you can form an equality between 
what he can do, and what he shall receive ; less can be 
founded fipon his negative virtue, or what he has forborne 
to do : And if neither his negative nor positive piciy can 
be equal to the reward, and to the eternity that reward is to 
last for, what then is to become of the Pharisee, when he is 
to be judged by the sincerity of his repentance, and reward- 
ed, according to the infinite grace of God, with a state of 
blessedness to an endless eternity ? 

When th.e negative roan converses with the invisible 
world, he is filled with as much horror and dread as Felix, 
when St. Paul reasoned to him of temperance, righteous- 
ness, aud of judgment to come ; for Felix, though a great 
philosopher, of great power and reverence, was a negative 
man, and he v\as made sensible- by die Apostle,. that, as a 
life of virtue and temperance was its own reward, hjr giving 
a, healthy body, a clear head, aud a composed life# so eter- 
nal happiness must proceed from another spring ; namely, 
<he infinite unbounded grace of a provoked God, who hav- 
ing erected a righteous tribunal, Jesus Christ would sepa- 
rate such as by faith and repentance he had brought home 
and united to himself by the grace of adoption, and on the 
fqpt of his having laid down his life as a ransom for then)* 
had appointed them to salvation, when all the philosophy, 
temperance, ami righteousness in the world besides had 
heen ineffectual. And this, I say, it was, that made Felix, 
this negative man, tremble.

shall thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the 
knowledge of God." By which undoubtedly he meant to 
inquire alter every thing he has permitted us to know', and 
IKK to search into those ways that are unsearchable, and are 
.effectually locked up from our knowledge.— Now, “ as 
listening to the voice of Providence" is my present subject, 

1 intend, in the first place, to write to those who own — 1. 
That there is a God, a first great moving cause of all things, 
and eternal power, prior, and consequently superior to all 
■created poweror being. — 2. Thattbis eternal. power which 
ds God, is the sovereign creator mid governor ot heaven and 
earth. 

Toavoid all needless distinctions, what persons in theGod* 
head exercise the creating, and what the governing power, 

I offer that glorious text, Psal. xxiii. 6, where the whole 
Trinity is entitled to the whole creating work : and therefore 
.in the next place, I shall lay down these two propositions : 

I. That the eternal God guides, by his Providence, the 
whole universe, which was created by his power. 

II. That this providence manifests a particular care over, 
.and concern in, the governing and directing man, the most 
noble creature upon earth. • ' 

It is plain, that natural religion proves the first, by inti- 
mating the necessity of a providence guiding and govern- 
ing the world, from the consequence of the wisdom, justice, 
prescience, and goodness of the Almighty Creator : for 
otherwise it would be absurd to think, that God should 
create a world, without any care or providence over it, in 
guiding the operations of nature, so as to preserve the or- 
der of his creation. ~ ■ 

Revealed religion gives us a light into the care and con- 
cern of his providence, by the climate’s being made habit- 
able, the creatures subjected and made nourishing, and all 
vegetative life made medicinal ; and all this for- the sake of 
man, who is made viceroy to the King of the earth. The 
.short description I shall give of providence is this : “ That 
it is that operation of the power, of the wisdom, justice, 
and goodness of God, by which he influences, governs, and 
directs, not only (be means, but tire events of all things, 
which concern us in this sublunary world ; the sovereignly

it, there is a secret providence intimates to us, that some 
danger threatens, if we thrive not to shun it.” 

The same day that Sir John Hotham kept out HuH 
•gainst tire royal Martyr King Charles I. tlie same day Sir 
John Hotham was put to death by the parliament for that 
very action : The same day that the King himself signed the 
warrant for the execution of the Earl of Strafford, tire same 
da) of the month was he barbarously murdered by the blood- 
thirsty Oiiverian crew : and the same day that King James 
II. came to the crown against the bill of exclusion, the same 
day he was voted abdicated by the parliament, and the 
th lone filled with King William and Queen Mary. 

The voice of signal deliverances from sudden dangers, is 
not only a just call Ip repentence, but a caution against fall- 
ing into the like danger.; but such w r ho are utterly careless 
ol themselves after, show a lethargy of the worst nature, 
which seems to me to be a kind of practical atheism, or at 
least a living in a contempt of Heaven, when he receives 
good at the hand of Iris Maker, but is unconcerned from 
w hence it comes, or to thank the bountiful liand that gave 
it ; neither, when he receives evil, does it alter his manner 
ol life, or bring him to any state of humiliation. 

We have a remarkable story of two soldiers being con- 
demned to death in Flanders. The General being prevailed 
upon to spare one of them, ordered them to cast dice upon 
the drum head for their lives ; the first having thrown two 
sixes, the second fell a w ringing his hands having so poor a 
chance to escape ; however, having throw'n, he was surpris- 
ed when he also threw' other two sixes. The officer appoint- 
ed to see tlie execution, ordered them to throw again ; they 
did so, and cacti of them threw fives ; at which the soldiers 
that stood round, shouted, and said, neither of them was to 
die. Upon this, the officer acquainted the council of war, ' 
who ordered them to threw' a third time, w'Jieu they threw 
two fours : the General being acquainted with it, sent for 
the men, and pardoned them : I love, said he, in such ex- » 

traordinary cases to listen to the voice -of Providence. 

We read in the holy writings, how God <q>eaks to men 
by appearance of angels, or by dreams and visions of tlie 
night. As God appeared to Abraham, Lot, and Jacobs 
so angels have appeared to many in other cases, as to Ma- 
noan and liis wife, Zaehariah, the Virgin Mary, and to tlie 
Apostles; others have been wa ned in a dream, as King 
Abimelech, tlie false prophet Balaam, and many others.

It is certainly a venr great and noble inquiry, What we 
shall be after this life r” for there is scarce a doubt, that 
there is a place reserved for the reception of our souls after- 
death : tor if we are to be, we must have a where, which < 
the scriptures assert by the examples of Dives and Lazarus. 
The doctrine of spirits was long believed before ottr Sa- 
viour’s -time ; for when the disciples of the blessed Jesus 
perceived our Saviour walking on the sea, they were as 
much surprised as though they had seen a spirit. Nay, in 
those ages of the world, it was believed that spirits inter- 
meddled in the affairs of mankind ; and throughout the Old 
Testament, I do not find any thing that in the least con- 
tradicts it. All the pains and labour that some learned men 
have taken, to confute the story of the witch of Endor, and 
the appearance of an old man personating Samuel, cannot 
make such apparitions inconsistent with nature or religion ; 
and it is plain,'that it. was either a good or a bad spirit, that 
prophetically told the unfortunate king what should happen 
the next day ; for, said the spirit, “ The Lord will deliver 
“ thee into the hands of the Philistines ; and to-morrow shall 
“ thou and thy sons be with me.” 

Abundance of strange notions possessed me, when I was 
in the desolate island ; especially on a moonshine night, 
when every bush seemed a man, and every tree a man on 
horseback.. When I crept into the dismal cave where the 
old goat lay expiring, whose articulate groans even resem- 
bled those of a man, how was I surprised ! my blood chil- 
led in my Veins, a cold sweaty dew sat on my forehead, 
my hair stood upright, and my joints, like Belshazzar’s 
•knees, struck against one another. And, indeed, though I 
afterwards found what it was, the remains of .this surprise 
did not wear off lor a great while ; and I had frequently 
returns of those vapours on different occasions, and some- 
times without any occasion at all. 

! One night, after having seen some appearance in the air, 
as* I bad just lain down in my bed, one of my feet pained 
me ; after that came a numbness, succeeded with a tingling 
in my blood ; when on a sudden I thought something alive 
lay upon me, from my knee to above.half my leg. Upon 
this I flung myself out of bed where I thought the creature 
lay ; but rinding nothing, “ Lord deliver me from an evil 
spirit,” said I, “ what can this be?” When I' lighted a 
candle, I could perceive no living creature in the place

with mo, but the poor parrot, who being frightened, cried 
out, “Hold your tongue,” and “What’s the matter with 
you ?” vvhich words I had taught him by saying so 10 him. 
When he had made such screaming noises as I did_not like. 
“ Lord,” said I aloud, “ surely the devil has been here.” 
" Hold your tongue,” says Poll. I was then mad at the 
bird, and putting on my -clothes, cried, “ I am terribly 
“ frightened.” “ What’sLhe matter with you r" says Poll. 
“ You toad,” said I, “ i’ll knock your brains out.” “ Hold 
"“your tongue,” cried he again, -and so fell a chattering, 
and calling Robinson Crusoe, as he did before. But, after 
.1 had composed myself, and went to bod again, I began 
plainly to see it was a distemper that affected my nerves, 
and so my terrors vanished at once. 

How intelligences are given or received,-we do not know; 
nor are we sensible how they are conveyed frorrv spirits em- 
bodied to ours that are in lile ; or, on the contrary, from us 
to them ; the latter is certainly done without the help of the 
organs, and the former is conveyed by the understanding, 
and theretired faculties of the soul. 

The spirits, without the help of voices, converse, and the 
more (particular discoveries of converse of the spirits, seem 
to me as follow : to wit, dreams, voices, noises, impulses, 
hints, apprehensions, involuntary sadness, &c. 

Dreams of old were the ways by which God himself was 
pleased to warn men what services to perform, and what to 
shun. Joseph was directed of God in a dream to go to 
Egypt ; and so were the wise men warned in a dream to 
depart into their own country another way, to avoid the 
fury of Herod. I am not like those who think dreams are 
the mere designs of a delirious head, or the relicsof a day’s 
perplexities or pleasures; but, on the contrary, I must beg 
leave to say, I never met with any capital mischie fin my 
life, but I had some notice of it by a dream ; and had I not 
been a thoughtless unbelieving creative, I might have taken 
many a warning, and avoided many of the evils I after- 
wards fell into, merely by total neglect of those dreams. 

I was once present at a dispute between a layman and a 
clergyman, upon the subject of dreams. The first thought 
no regard should be given unto 'them ; that their communi- 
cation frpm the invisible to the visible world was a mere 
.chimera ; without any solid foundation. For, first, said he, 
•if dreams were from the agency of any prescient being,' the

239 

motives would be more direct, and the discoveries mow? 
plain, and not by allegories and emblematic fancies, ex- 
pressing things imperfect and obscure. 2. Since, with the 
notice of evil, there was not a power given to avoid it, it 
is not likely to proceed from a spirit, but merely fortuitous. 

3. That the inconstancy of such notices, iir cases equally 
important, proves they did not proceed from any such agent. 

4. That as our most distinct dreams had nothing in them of 
any significancy, it would be irrational and vain to think 
that they came from heaven. And, 5. That as men were 

.not always thus warned or supplied with notice of good or 
evil, so all men are not alike supplied with them ; and what 
reason could we give, why one manor one woman should ' 
not have the same hints as another t 

To all this the ctergyman gave aoswerr.lv That as k> 
the signification of dreams, and the objections against them, 
as being dark and doubtful, they are expressed generally by 
hicrogliphical representations, sitniiies, allusions, and figura- 
tive emblematic ways, by which means, . for want of inter- 
pretation, ,the thing was not understood, and, consequently, 
the evil not shunned. 2, That we. charge God foolishly, 
to say, that. he has given the notice of evil, without the 
power to avoid it; tor, if any one had hot power to-avoid . 
the evil, it was no notice to him ; and it was want of giving 
due heed to that notice, that men lirst neglected themselves 
and then charged the Judge of all the earth with injustice. 

3- That we ought not to find fault with the inconstancy of. 
these notices ^ but rather with our weak understandings, . 
by pretending dreams were not to be regarded, and negli- 
gent when the voice really spoke to us for our good. It is 
a mistake to say, dreams have no import at all : we might, 
with more reason, have said, none that we could perceive • 
the reason of, owing to our blindness and supine negligence, 
too secure at one time, and too much alarmed at another ; 
so that the spirit, which we might be said to be conversing 
with in a dream, was constantly and equally kind and care- 
ful ; but our powers are not always in the same stale of 
action, not equally attentive to, or retentive of the hints 
that were given. And, 5. To answer the last question. 
Why people are not equally supplied ? This seems to be 
no question : for Providence, itself might have some share in 
the direction of it, and then that Providence might be li- 
mited by a superior direction ; that as to the converse of.

spirits, he could not call it a stated converse : such a thrn£ 
there was, but why there was so much of it, and no- more, 
was none of his business, and that no such discovery had 
ever yet been made to mankind. Nor were we to imagine 
less of waking dreams, trances, visibns, noises, hints, im- 
pulses, and all the waking testimonies of an invisible world*, 
and of the communication that there is between us antt 
them, which commonly entertain us with our open eyes. 

One time my fancy soared on high, to see what disco- 
veries I could make iu those clearer regions. I (bund that 
such immense bodies of the sun, stars, planets and moon*, 
in the great circle of the lower heaven, are far from being 
found in the study of nature on the surface of the earth. 
Here I saw many things that we can entertain little or no 
notion of, in a state of common life, and the emptiness of 
our notion, that the planets are habitable vorlds ; that is, 
created like ours, for the subsistence and existence of man 
and beast, and the preservation of the vegetative and sensi- 
tive life: No, no, this is, I assure you, a world of spirits;, 
for here I saw a clear demonstration of Satan being the 
prince of the power of the air, keeping his court or camp, 
with innumerable angels to attend him ; but his power is . 
not so great as we imagine, he can tempt us to the crime* 
but cannot force us to commit : Humaiutm est peccare. Nei- 
ther has the devil power to force the world into a rebellion 
against heaven, though his- legions are employed among 
savage nations,, to set up their master for a god, who make 
the heathens either worship him in person, or by his repre- 
sentatives, idols and monsters, with the cruel sacrifices of 
human blood. Now,as to the limitations of the devil’spower, 
you must understand, that, as there are numbers of evil 
spirits employed in mischief, so there are numbers of good 
angels sent from the higher and blessed abodes to discon- 
cert and oppose their measures ; and this every Christian* 

I hope, believes, when he prays to God, the father of spi- 
rits, to give his angels charge over him while he slumber- 
eth and sleepeth. For if by these preventing powers the 
devil was not restrained, the earth would be. subjected to 
dearth, droughts, and famine ; the air infected with noxious 
fumes ; and, in a word, mankind would be utterly destroyed,, 
which might oblige our Maker (if I may be allowed the 
expression) to the necessity of a new fat, or else have no 
more creatures to honour and worship him.

As the devil never wanted insinuators, I shall observe, 
that I learned a way how to mak%a man dream of what I 
pleased. For instance, let us suppose one to be sound asleep; 
let another lay his mouth close to his ear,, and wisper any 
thing so softly as not to awake him, the sleeping man shall 
dream of what has been so whispered in his ear ; nay, I can 
assure you, those insinuating dcviis can do this even when 
we are awake, which 1 call impulses of the mind r for from 
whence, but from these insinuators, come our causeless pas- 
sions, involuntary wickedness, or sinful desires ? AVho else 
form ideas in the mind of man when he is asleep, or pre- 
sent terrible or beautiful figures to his fancy? Mr. Milton 
represents the devil tempting Eve in the shape of a toad, 
lying just at her ear, when in her bovver she lay fast asleep ; 
and brings in Eve telling Adam what an uneasy night’s 
rest .die had, and relating her dream to hitn. And likewise 
1 believe that good spirits have the same, intercourse with 
us, in warning us against tliose things that are eviJ r and' 
prompting us to that which is gooch 

Were we to have the eyes of our souls opened, through 
the eyes of our bodies, we should see this very immediate 
region of air which we breathe in,, thronged with spirits' 
Bow invisible, and which otherwise would be the most ter- 
rible ; we should view the secret transactions of those mes- 
sengers who are employed when the parting soul takes its 
leave of the reluctant body, and perhaps see things nature 
would shrink back from with the utmost terror and amaae- 
ment. In a word, the curtain of Providence for the dis- 
positipn of things here, and the curtain of judgment for the 
determination of the state of souls hereafter, would be alike 
drawn back ; and what heart could support here its future 
state in life ; much less that of its future state after life, 
even good or bad. 

A gentleman of my acquaintance, being about seven mile* 
distant from London, a friend that came to dine with him, 
solicited him to go to the city. “ What,” said the gentle- 
man, “ is there any occasion for me ?” “ No, Sir,” said the 
other, “ nothing at all, except the enjoyment of your good 
company and so gave over importuning him. Just then 
a strong impulse of mind urged the gentleman, and pursued 
him like a voice, with, " Go to London, Go to London.”'

indeed. Sir,” said he, I perceived them all very heartyi; 
and l.did not_a.sk you to go to London upon any particular 
account whatsoever, except it was for the sake of your good 
company.” Again he put off his resolution: but still the 
impulse suggested to him, “ Go to London and at length 
he did so. When he came there, he found a letter and a 
messenger had been there to seek him, and to tell him of a 
particular business, which was at first and last above a thou- 
sand pounds to him, and which might inevitably have been 
lost, had he not gone to London that night. 

The obeying of several hints, or secret impulses, argues 

f reat w isdom. I knew a man that was under misfortunes, 
eing guilty of misdemeanors against the government; 
when, absconding for fear of his ruin, all his friends advi- 
sing him not to put himself in the hands of the law , one 
moriKitg as haawakt-d, he felt a strong impulse darting in- 
to his mind thus, “Write a letter to them and this was 
repealed several times. to his mind, and at la t be answered- 
to it,, as if it had been a voice, “ Whom shall 1 write to 
Immediately it replied,. “ Write to the Judge:” ami this 
impulse pursued him for several days, till at length he took 
pen, ink, and paper, and sat down to \vrite4o him : when 
immediately words flowed from his pen, like streams from, 
a fair fountain, that charmed even hunself w ith hopes of. 
success. In short, the letter w as so strenuous in argument, 
so pathetic in its eloquence, and so persuasively moving,, 
that when the judge had. read it, he sent him an answer, he 
might be easy, he would endeavour to make that mailer 
light to him ; and, indeed, never left exci ting himself ull 
he had stopt the prosecution, and restored him to his liberty 
and family. 

While I am mentioning these things, methinks it is vety 
hard that we should obey the wispers of evil spirits, and 
not much rather receive, the notices which good ones are 
pleased to give. We never perceive tho mistortune of this, 
but when in real danger ; and then we cry, “ My mind mis- 
gave me when I was going about it :” but it so, why do yon 
slight the caution r W hy not listen to it as to a voice f and 
then there had been no reason to make this complaint. 

I remember about fourteen or fifteen years ago (as to 
time 1 cannot be very positive) there was a young clergy- 
man in tire city of Dublin, in Ireland, .who dreamed a vecy

uncommon dream. That a gentleman had killed his wife, a 
relation ol his, by stabbing her in several places ; the fright 
of this awaked him, but finding it a dream, he composed 
himself agaia to sleep, when he dreamed a second time the 
same dream. This made him a little uneasy ; but thinking 
it proceeded from the impression made on his mind by the 
former, he went to sleep again, and dreamed the same 
dream a third time also. So troubled was he at this, that 
he arose, and knocked at his mother's chamber, told bis 
concern, and his apprehensions that all was not right at his 
relation’s' house. “Dear Son,” says the good old gentle- 
woman, “ do not mind those foolish dreams ; and I very 
much wonder, that you, being a person in holy orders should 
have regard to such illusions.” Upon ihis he went to bed 
again, fell asleep, and dreamed a fourth time as before. — 
And then indeed fie put on his night-gown, and went to 
Smithfield, the place where , his relation dwelt. Here ii 
was, alas ! he perceived his dream too sadly fulfilled, by 
seeing his relation the )oung lady, big with child, who was 
a protestant, stabbed in several places by her barbarous 
husband, Mr. Eustace, a violent Papist, only for some dis- 
courses of religion that happened .the day before. After 
the wretch had stabbed her in three places, he went to 
make his escape out at a window ; but she cried out, 
■“ My dear ! don't leave me, come backhand I shall be well 
again.” At which he returned in a hellish rage, and gave 
her four wounds more ; when, even in this condition, rising 
-from her bed, she wrapped herself in her night gown, and 
went to the Lord, Bishop of Rapho’s chamber door (the 
Bishop lodging at that time iij the house) “ My Lord,” said 
she, “ O my Lord, make haste unto me :” but as soon as 
his Lordship came, she expired in his arms, resigning her 
precious soul into the hands of Almighty God. The cruel 
wretch her husband was shot by the pursuers ; too good a 
■death for one who deserved the gibbet : and the lady was 
universally lamented by all tender and religious people. 
And this -tragical relation I have mentioned, upon the ac- 
count of that impulse, or dream, that the clergyman had at 
4he fatal lime of the bloody action. 

Some people make a very ill use of the general notion, 
that there are no apparitions nor spirits at all : which is 
worse than those who fancy they see them upon every oc- 
casion ; for those carry their notions farther, even to an-

nihilate the devil, and believe nothing about him, neither 
of one kind or other : the next step they come to, is te 
conclude, “ There is no God,” and so atheism lakes its 
rise in the same sink, with a carelessness about futurity. 
But there is no occasion to enter upon an argument to prove 
the being of the Almighty, or to illustrate his power by 
words, who has so many undeniable testimonies in the breasts 
of every rational being to prove his existence : and we have 
sufficient proofs enough to cbnvince us of the great super- 
intendency of Divine providence in the minutest affairs of 
this world ; the manifest existence of the invisible world $ 
the reality of spirits, and intelligence between us and them. 
What 1 have said, I hope, will not mislead any per-soivor 
be a means whereby they may delude themselves ; lor I 
have spoken of these things wuth the utmost seriousness of 
mind, and with a sincere and ardent desire for the general 
good -and benefit oi the world.
