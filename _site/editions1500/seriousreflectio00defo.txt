Execution ; fo I come no w 
to acknowledge to my Reader, That 
the prefent Work is not merely the 
Prodiid: of the two firft Volumes^ 
but the two firft Volumes may rather 
be called the Produdl' of this : The 
Fable is always made for the Moral, 
not the Moral for the Fable- 

^ I have heard, that the envious and 
ili-difpofed Part of the World have 
rais'd iome Objections againft the 
two firft Volumes, on Pretence, for 
want of a better Reajon ; That (as 
thej jay) the Stoiy is feign d, that 
fhe Names are honoviQ^ and that

it is alia Romance ; that there never 
were any fuch Man ox Place, or Cir- 

cumftances in any Mans Life ; that 

J ^ "^ 

it is all form'd and embcllifh'd by 
Invention to impofe upon the World. 

I RohiujOn Cmfoe being at this 
Time in perfedl and found Mind and 
Memory, Thanks be to God there- 
fore ; do hereby declare, their Obje^ 
diion is an Invention fcandalous in 
Defign, and falfe in Fad ; and do 
affirm, that the Story, though Alle- 
gorical, is alfo Hiftorical ; and that 
it is the beautiful Reprefentation of a 
Life of unexampled Misfortunes,and 
of a Variety not to be met with in 
the World, fincerely adapted to, and 
intended for the common Good of 
Mankind, and defigned at firft, as it 
is now farther apply d^ to the moft 
ferious Ufes poffible.

Part of theStoiy moft dircdtly alludes,

and to this I (etmy Name.^-^'^ ^^ 

The famous Hiilory o^ Don§lmxoi^ 
a Work which thoufands read with 
Pleafure, to one that knows the 
Meaning of it, was an emblematic 
Hiftory of, and a juft Satyr upon the 
Duke de Medina Sidonia ; a Perfon 
very remarkable at that TimcinSpam: 
To thofe who knew the Original, the 
Figures v/ere lively and eafily difco- 
vered themfelves, as they are alfd 
here, and the Images were juft ^ and 
therefore, when a malicious, but 
fooliQx Writer, in the abundance of 
his Gall, fpoke of the Glutxotifm of 
R^CrufoCy as he called It, helhewed 
evidently, that he knew nothing of 
what he faid ; and perhaps will be 
a little ftartled, when I fhall tell 
him, that what he meant for a Satyr^ 
was the greateft of Panegyricks.

Robinson CrusoeV 

Without letting the Reader into a 
nearer Explication of the Matter, I 
proceed to let him know, that the 
happy Deductions I have employed 
myfelf to make from all the Cir- 
cumftancesofmy Story, will abun- 
dantly make him amends for his 
not having the Emblem explained 
by the Original ; and that when in 
my Obfervations and Reflexions of 
any Kind in this Volume, I mention 
my Solitudes and Retirements, and 
allude to the Circumftances of the 
former Story, all thofe Parts of the 
Story are real Fadfs in my Hiitory, 
whatever borrow'dLights they may be 
reprefented by : Thus the Fright and 
Fancies which fucceeded the Story of 
the Print of a Man s Foot,and Surprife 
of the old Goat, and the Thing roll- 
ling on my Bed, and mv jumping 
out in a Fright, are all Hiftories and 
real Stories; as are likewife the Dream 
of being taken by Meflengers, being 

arre-

arrcfted by Officers, the Manner of 
being driven on Shore by die Surge of 
die Sea, die Ship on Fire, dieDefcrip- 
tion of rtarving ; riiei'tory of my Man 
Friday^ and many more moft material 
Paflages obferv'd here, and on which 
any religious Refle(5tions are made, 
are all hiftorical and true in Fad : 
It is moft real, that I had a Parrot^ 
and taught it to call me by myName^ 
fuch a Servant a Savage, and after- 
wards a Chriftian, and that his Name 
was called Friday^ and that he v/as 
ravifti'd from me by Force, and died 
in the Hands that took him, which I 
reprefent by being killed ; this is all 
litterally true , and fhould I enter in- 
to Difcoveries, many ahve can teftify 
them : His other Condud and Al- 
fiftancc to me alfo have juft Referen- 
ces in all their Parts to the Helps. I had 
from that faithful Savage, in roy real 
Solitudes and Difaftefs.

The Story of the Bear in the Tree^

ftory ; and in a Word^ the Adven-

eaters, by unaccountable fupprifing 
Incidents; fed by Miracles greater 
than that of Ravens , fufFered all

Story is not only illuftratedj but the

real Part I think moft juftly approved : 
For Examfle^ in the latter Part of 
this Work called the Vifion, I begin 
thus, When I zvas in my Ijland Kmg-^ 
dom^ I had abundance of firange 
Notions of my feeing apparitions^ 
&c. all thefe llefledlions are jiift Hi- 
ftory of a State of fore d Confine- 
nient, which in my real Hiftory is 
reprefented by a confin'd Retreat 
in an Illand ; and 'tis as reafonable to 
reprefent one kind of Imprifonment 
by another, as it is to reprefent any 
Thing that really exifts, by that 
which exifts not. The ^tory of my 
Pright with fomething on my Bed, 
was Word for Word a Pliftory of 
what happened, and indeed all thofe 
Things received very little Altera- 
tion, except what neceflarily attends 
removing the Scene from one Place 
to another. 

My Obfervations upon Solitude 
are the fame, and I think Pneed fay 

no 



T R EF AC E. 

iio more, than that the fame Remark 
is to be made upon all the References 
made here, to the Tranfadlions of the 
former Volumes, and the Reader is 
defired to allow for it as he goes on, 

Befides all this, here is the juftand 
only good End of all Parable or Al- 
legoiick Hiftory brought to pafs,^7'^,. 
for moral and religious Improve- 
ment. Here is invincible Patience 
recommended under the worft of 
Mifery ; indefatigable Application 
and undaunted Refolution under 
the greateft and moft difcouraging 
Circumftances ; I fay, thefe are re- 
commended, as the only Way to 
work through thofe Miferies, and 
their Succeis appears fufficient to 
fupport the nioft dead-hearted Crea- 
ture in the World. 

Had the common Way of Writ« 
ing a Mans private Hiftory been ta- 
ken, and I had given you the Con- 
dud: or Life of a Man you knew^ 

and

and whofc Misfortunes and Infirmi- 
ties, perhaps you had fometimes un- 
juftly triumphed overfall I could have 
jfaid would have yielded no Diver- 
fion, and perhaps fcarce have obtain- 
ed a Readings or at beft no Attention j 
/the Teacher, like a greater^ having 
\no Honour in his own Country. 
Fadls that are form'd to touch the 
Mind, muft be done a great Way off, 
and by fomebody never heard of : 
Even the Miracles of the BlefTed Sa- 
viour of the World fuffered iS'corn 
and Contempt, when it was reflected ^ 
that they were done by the Carpen- 
ter's Son ; one whofe Family and O- 
riginal they had a mean Opinion of^ 
and whofe Brothers and Sifters were 
ordinary People like themfelves. 

There even yet remains a Quc- 
ftion, whether the Inftrudion of 
thefe Things will take place, when 
you are fuppofing the Scene, which 
is placed (o far off; had its Original 
io near Home. But 



T REFAC E. 

But I am far from being anxious 
about that, feeing I am well alTur'd, 
that if the Obftinacy of our Age 
fhould fhut their Ears againll: the juft 
Reflexions made in this Volume, 
upon the Tranfadtions taken Notice 
of in the former, there will come an 
Age, when the Minds of Men iliall 
be more flexible, when the Prejudi- 
ces of their Fathers Ihail have no 
Place, and when the Rules of Ver- 
tue and Religion juftly recommend- 
ed, Ihall be more gratefully accep- 
ted than they may be now, that 
our Children may rife up in Judg- 
ment againft their fathers, and one 
Generation be edified by the fame 
Teaching, which another Generation 
had defpifed.

THE 

PubMier's Introduction. 

H E fuhlifJoing this extraordinary 
Volume will appear to be no Pre- 
fimption^ when it fiall be rentembred^ 
with what unexpected Good and 
Evil WdJy the former Volumes ha^ve been ac- 
cepted m the World. 

If the Foundation has been fo well laid^ the 
Structure cannot but be expected to bear a Pro- 
portion ; and while the Parable has been fo di- 
n)erting^ the Moral mufl certainly be equally 
agreeable. 

The fuccefs the two former Parts have met 
with^ has been known by the En'vy it has 
brought upon the Editor^ exprefs'd in athoufand 
hard iVords from the Men of Trade ^ the Effect 
of that Regret which they entertamd^ at their 
having 720 ^hare in it : And I muji do the Au- 
thor the Juftice to fay, that ?iot a Vog has 
wagd his Tongue at the Work i[lclf, nor has a 
Word been faid to Icffen the Value of it^ but 
which has been the njifibk Effect of that Envy 
at the ^ood Fortune of the Bookfeller.

The Kiddle is now expounded^ and the mteU

Jign of the whole Jpork; that it is calculated jor^ 
and dedicated to the Impro'vement and Inftru- 
6'tion of yiankind in the Ways of Venue and 
Fietyy by rcprefenting the various Circu?njiances^ 
to which mankind is expofed , and encouraging 
fuch as fall into ordinary or extraordinary Ca- 
fualties of Life^ how to work thro" Difficulties^ 
with unwearied Diligence and Application^ 
and look up to Providence for Succefs. 

The Obfer-vations and Reflections:^ that take 
up this Volume^ crown the Work i if the Do- 
Shine has been accepted-^ the Application rnufi of 
Neceffity pleafe ; and the Author jhews now^ 
that he has learn d fufficient 'Experience^ how 
to jnake other Men wile and himfelf happy > 

The Moral of the Fable ^ as the Author calls 
it, is 7nofi injiruciing ; andthofe who challenged 
hitn moji ?naliciouJly^ with not ?/mking his Fen 
ufefuly will have Leifure to refleCi^ that they 
pajs'd their Cenfure too foon i and like Solo-

Jiow uncapable to make i(s happy^ and 
How unqualify d to a Chrifiian Life. 

Have frequently look'd back, you may 
be fure, and that with different 
Thoughts, upon the Notions of a 
long tedious Life of Solitude, which 

^ I have reprefented to the World, 

and ot wnich you muft have formed fome Id^as 
from the Life of a Man in an Illand. Sometimes 

B I have 




f 4] , 

fi'neraent from the EDJoyments of the World, and 
Reftraint from human Society:^? aliitbof .was> 
710 Solitude; indeed no Part of it was fo, except 
that which, as in my Story, I apply'd to the 
Contemplation of fublime Things, and that was 
but a very little, as my Readers well know, com- 
pat'd to what a Length of Years my forced Retreat 
lafltd. A'.az: 

It is evident then, that as I fcenothing but 
what is far from being retir'd, in the forced Re- 
treat of an Ifland, the Thoughts being in no Comr 
/ pofure fiiitable to a retired Condition, no not for a 
^ greatVVhile ; fo I can affirm> thati enjoy much more 
Solitude in the Middle of the greatefl: Colledioii 
of Mankind in the World, I mean,, at London, 
i while I am writing this, than ever I could fay I 
^ enjoy'd in eight and twenty Years Confinnement 
toadefolare Ifland. 

I have heard of a Man, that upon fome extraor- 
dinary Difgiift which he took at the unfuitable 
Converfation of fome of his neareft Relations, 
whofe Society he could not avoid, fuddenly refolved 
never to fpea'k any more : He kept his Refolutioii 
moft rigoroudy many Years; not all the Tears or 
[ Entreaties of his Friends, no not of his Wife and 
Children, could prevail with him to break his Si- 
lence. It feems it was their ill Behaviour to him 
at firft, that was the Occafion of it ; for they 
treated him with provoking Language, which 
frequently put him into undecent Pafilons, and ur- 
ucd him torafh Replies; and he took this fevere 
Way to punifli himfelf for being provok'd,and to pu- 
nifii them for provoking him : But the Severity was 
unjiiftihable ; it ruin'd his Family, and broke up 
his Houfe : His Wife could not bear ir, and after 
endeavouring, by aM the-\^ays pofllble, to alter his 
rigid Silence"^ -went firft away from lum, and at- 

* -. ter wards 



[ 5'] 

<er\vards away from her felf, turning nielancholly/ 
and diftraiied : Hi'7 Chiidren feparared fome one 
Way, and fome another Way, and only one 
Daughter who iov'd her Father above all the reft, 
kept with him, tended him, talk'd to him by 
Signs, and liv'd almoil Dumb like her Father, 
near 2p Years with him j tiU being very lick, 
and in a high Fever, delirious as we call it, or 
light-headed, be broke his Silence, not knowing 
when he did it, and fpoke, tho^ wildly at firil:. 
He recover^ of the Illnefs afterwards, and hx- 
quently talked with his Daughter, but not much, 
and very feldom to any Body elfe. 

Yet this Man did not live a iilent Life with 
refped to himfelf^ he .read continually; and wrote 
down many excellent Things, which deferv'd to 
have appear'd in the World, and was often heard 
to pray to God in his Solitudes very audibly, and 
with great Fervency ; but the Unjuflice which his 
rafh Vow, df it was a VoWj of Silence, was to his 
Family, and the length he carry 'd it, was fo un- 
juftifiablc another way, that I cannot fay his In- 
ftrudions could have much Force in them* 

Had he been a lingle Man,had he wandred into a 
ftrange Country or Place, where the Circum- 
ftance oF it had been no Scandal, his Vow of 
Silence might ha^ been as commendable, and as 
I 'think, much more than any of the primitive 
Chriflians Vows of Solitude were ; wliofe Re- 
treat into tht Wildernefs, and giving themfelves up 
to Prayer and Contemplation, llimaning human So- 
ciety, and the like, was fo much efteemed by the 
primitive Fathers, and from whence our religious 
Houfes, and Orders of religious People were fiift 
deriv'd. 

The Jews faid, John the Baptifl had a Devil, 
becaufe he affeded Solitude and Retirement , ar,il 

B 3 they 



they took it £rom an old Proverb they had in the 
World at that time : 7'hat every folitary Perfon ?nuft 
he an Angel or a Devil, 

A Man under a Vow of perpetual Silence, if 
but rigoroufly obferv'd, would be even on the Ex- 
change of London, as perfedly retired from the 
World, as a Hermit in his Cell ; or a Solitair in 
the Defarts of Arabia y and if he is able to ob- 
ferve it rigoroufly, may reap all the Advantages 
of thofe Solitudes, without the unjuftifiable Part 
of fuch a Life, and without the Aufterities of a 
Life among Brutes. For the Soul of a Man un- 
der a due and regular Conduft, is as capable of 
refervingit felf, or Separating it felf from the refl: 
of human Society, in the midft of a Throng, as 
it is when banifh'd into a dcfolate Ifland. 

The Truth is, that all thofe religious Hermit^ 
like Solitudes, which Men value themfelves fo 
much upon, are but an Acknowledgment of the 
DeFed or Imperfedion of our Refolutions, our 
Incapacity to bind ourfelves to needful Reflraints, 
or rigoroudy to obferve the Limitations we have 
vowM our felves to obferve : Or take it thus. That 
the Man firll refolving that it would be his Feli- 
city to be entirely given up to converling only 
with Heaven, and heavenly Things, to be fepa- 
rated to Prayer and good Works ; but being fen- 
fible how ill fuch a Life will agree with Flefh and 
Blood, caufes his Soul to commit a Rape upon his 
Body, and to carry it by Force, as it were into 
a Defart, or into a religious Retirement, from 
whence it cannot return, and where it isimpollible 
for it to have any Converfe with Mankind, other 
than with fuch as are under the fame Vows, and 
the fame BaniQiment. The Fdly of this is evident 
many Ways. 

Ifliall 



Ifhall bring it home to the Cafe in Hand thus : 
Chriilians may without doubt come to enjoy all 
the defirable Advantages of Solitude, by a ftrift 
Retirement, and cx3& Government of their 
iThoughts, without any of thefe Formalities, Ri- 
gours, and apparent Mortifications, which I think 
I juftly call a Rape upon human Nature, and confe- 
quently without the Breach of Chriftian Duties, 
which they neceflarily carry with them, fuch as 
receding Chriftian Communion, Sacraments, Or- 
dinances, and the like. 

There is no need of a Wildernefs to wander 
among wild Beafts, no neceffity of a Cell on the 
top of a Mountain, or a defolate Ifland in the 
Sea ; if the Mind be confinM, if the Soul be truly 
Mafterof it fell, ail is fafe ; for it is certainly and 
effedually Mailer of the Body, and what fignify 
Retreats, efpecially a forc'd Retreat as mine was ? 
The anxiety of my Circumftances there, I can afTure 
yoUj was fuch for a Time, as were very fuitabie 
to heavenly Meditations, and even v/hen that was 
got over, the frequent Alarms from the Savages, 
put the Soul fometimes to fuch Extremities o£ 
Fear and Horrour, that all manner of Temper was 
loft, and I was no more fit for religious "Exercifes, 
than a fick Man is fit for Labour. 

Divine Contemplations require a Compofurc 
of Soul, uninterrupted by any extraordinary Mo- 
tions or Diforders of the Paflions ; and this, I 
fay, is much eafier to be obtained and enjoy 'd in 
the ordinary Courfe of Life, than in Monkifii Cells 
and forcible Retreats. 

The Bufinefs is to get a retired Soul, a Frame of 
Mind truly elevated above the World, and then 
we may be alone whenever we pleafe, in the 
greateft apparent Hurry of Bufinefs or Com- 
pany: If the Thoughts are free, and rightly un- 

B 4 engaged 



eng^y. What imports the Employment the Bo, 
dy is engag'd in ? Does not the Soul a(9: by a dif-, 
fering Agency, and is not the Body the Servant, 
nay, the Slave of the Soul ? Has the Body Hands 
to ad, or Feet to v^alk, or Tongue to fpeak, 
but by the Agency of the UnderHanding, and 
Will, vt^hich are the two Deputies of the Soul's 
Power? Are not all the AfFedions, and all the 
Pafli-ons which fo univerfaily agitate, direft, and 
pofl'efs the Body, are they not all feated in the 
Soul ? What have we to do then more or lefs, but 
to get the Soul into a fuperior Diredion and Ele- 
vation, there's no Need to prefcribe the Bo- 
dy to this or that Situation ,* the Hands, or Feet, 
or Tongue, can no more difturb the Retirement of 
the Soul, than a Man having Money in his Pocket 
can take it our, or pay it, or difpofe of it by his 
Hand, without his own Knowledge. 

It is the Soul's being entangled by outward Ob- 
jeds, that interrupts its Contemplation of divine 
Objeds, which is the Excufe for thefe Solitudes, 
and makes the removing the Body from thofe out- 
ward Objeds feemingly neceflary ; but what is 
there of Religion in all this ? For Example, a vi- 
cious Inclination remov'd from the Objed, is ftill 
a vicious Inclination, andcontrads the fame Guilt, 
as if the Object were at Hand ; for if, as our 
Saviour fays. He that looketh on a Woman to lufi 
nfter her^ that isy to deiire her unlawfully, has 
committed the Adultery already ; fo it will^be no 
inverting our Saviour's Meaning to fay, that he 
that thinketh of a Woman to defire her unlawfully, 
has committed Adultery with her already, though 
he has not looked on her, or has not feen her at 
that Time ; and how fliall this thinking of her be 
remov'd by tranfporting the Body ? It muft be 
remov'd by the Change in the Soul, by bringing 

the 



[9] 



^he Mind to be atiove the Power or Reach of the 
Allurement, and to an abfolLite Mallerlhip oveii' 
the wicked Defire ; otherwifc the vicious Defire 
remains as the Force remains in the Gunpowder, 
and will exert it felf when ever toucht with the 
iFire. 

All Motions to Good or Evil are in the Soul : 
Outward Objeds are but fecond Caufes ; and tho' 
it is true, feparating the Man from the Objecl, is 
the Way to make any Ad impoffible to be com- 
mitted; yet where the Guilt does not lye in the 
Ad only, but in the Intention or Defire to com- 
mit it, that Separation is nothing at all, and ef- 
feds nothing at all. There may be as much Adul- 
tery committed in a Monaftery, where a Woman 
never comes, as in any other Place, and perhaps 
is fo : The abftaining from Evil therefore depends 
not only and wholly upon limiting, or confining 
the Manx's Adions, but upon the Man's limiting 
and confining his Defires ; feeing to defire to fin, 
is to Sin ; and the Fad which we would commit 
if we had Opportunity, is really committed, and 
muft be anfwer'd for as fuch. What then is 
there of Religion, I fay, in forc'd Retirements 
from the World, and Vows of Silence or Soli- 
tude ? They are all nothing ,* \is a retired Soul 
that alone is fit for Contemplation ; and it is the 
Conquefl: of our Defires to Sin, that is the only 
human Prefervative againft Sin. 

It was a great while after I came into human 
Society, that I felt fome Regret at the Lofs of the 
folitary Hours and Retirements I had in the i- 
fland ; but when I came to refied upon fome ill 
fpent Time, even in my Solitudes, I found Rea- 
fon to fee what I have faid above ; that a Man 
may fin alone feveral Ways, and find fubjed of 

Rep en- 



[10] _^ 

Repentance fot his folitary Crimes, as well as he 
may in the midft of a popalous City. 

The Excellency of any State of Life confifts 
in its Freedom from Crime ; and it is evident to 
our Experience, that fome Society may be bettier 
adapted to a Re6litude of Life, than a compleat 
Solitude and Retirement : Some have laid, that 
netct to no Company y good Company is beft^ but it is my 
Opinion, that next to good Company, no Company is 
hefi i for as it is certain, that no Company is better 
than had Company, fo ^tis as certain, that good Com,* 
pany is much better than no Company. 

In Solitude a Man converfes with himfelf, and 
as a wife Man faid, he is not always fure that he 
does not converfe with his Enemy i but he that 
is in good Company, is fure to be always among 
his Friends. 

The Company of religious good Men, is a 
conftant Reftraint from Evil^and an Encouragement 
to a religious Life. You have there the Beauty of 
Religion exemplified ; you never want as well In- 
ftrudion in, as Example for, all that is good ; you 
have a Contempt of evil Things conftantly re- 
commended, and the Affedions movM to delight 
in what is good by hourly Imitation : If we are 
alone, we want all thefe, and are led right, or led 
wrong, as the Temper of the Mind, which is 
fometimes too much the Guide of our Adions, as 
well as Thoughts, happens to be conftituted at that 
Time. Here we have no Reftraint upon our 
Thoughts, but from our felves, no Reftraint upon 
our Actions, but from our own Confciences, and 
nothing to airift us in our Mortifications of our 
Defires, or in dire<5ting our Defires, but our own 
Reflexions, which after all may often err, often 
be prepolfef^'d. 

If 



C II ] 



If you woji'd retreat from the World then, be 
fure to retreat to good Company; retreat to good 
Books, and retreat to good Thoughts ,* thefe will 
always affift one another, and always join to affift 
him that flies to them in his Meditations, di- 
red him to juft Reflexions, and mutually encou- 
rage him againft whatever may attack him, from 
within him, or without him : Whereas to retreat 
from the NVorld, as it is call'd, is to retreat from 
good Men, who are our befl Friends : Befides, 
to retreat, as we call k to an entire perfed Soli- 
tude, is to retreat from the publick Worfiiip of 
God, to forfake the Aflemblies ; and, in a Word, 
is unlawful, becaufe it obliges us to abandon 
thofe Things, which we are commanded to do. 

Solitude therefore, as I underftand by ity a 
Retreat from human Society, on a religious or 
philofophical Account, Is a meer Cheat ; it nei-| 
ther can anfwer the End it propofes, or qualify' 
us for the Duties of Religion, which we are com- 
manded to perform ,* and is therefore both irreli- 
gious in it felf, and inconfiflent with a Chrifliati 
Life many Ways. Let the Man that would reap 
the Advantage of Solitude, and that underflands 
the Meaning of the Word, learn to retire into 
himfelf : Serious Meditation is the ElTence of So- 
litude ; all the Retreats into Woods and Defarts 
are ftiort of this ; and though a Man that is per- 
fectly Mafter of this Retirement, may be a little 
in Danger of Qiiietifm, that is to fay, of an Af- 
fetation of Refervednefs ; yet it may be a Slander 
upon him in the main, and he may make himfelf 
amends upon the World, by the bleffed Calm, of 
his Soul, which they perhaps who appear more 
chearful may have little of 

Retiring into Defarts, in the firfl Days of Reli- 
gion, andinto Abbeys and Monafteries (ince, 

what 



[11] 

what have they been? Or what have they been 
able to do,towarcIspurchafing the Retirement I 
Ipeak of? They have indeed been Things to be 
reckoned among Aufierities, jand Ads of Mortifi- 
cation, and fo f;ar might be commendable: But I 
miift infift upon it^ that a retired Soul is not afFe- 
ded with them, any more than with the Hurries 
of Company and Society. When the §oul of a 
Man is powerfully engag'd in any particular Sub- 
jed, 'tis like that of St. Paul, wrapt up, whether 
it be into the third Heaven, or to any Degree 
pt lower Exaltation : Such a Man may well fay 
wirh the Apoftle above, J^hether Iiuas in the Body, 
or out of the Body, I cannot telU It was m fuch a 
wTapt up State, that I conceived in what I call my 
Vifion of the Angelical World i of which I have 
here fub joined a vei:y little Part. 

Is ic rational to believe, that a Mind exalted fo 
far above the State of Things with which we ordi- 
narily converfe, fliould not be capable of a Sepa- 
ration from them, which, in a V/ord, is the ut- 
moll Extent of Solitude ? Let fuch never aiHici: 
themfelves, that they cannot retreat from the 
World : Let them learn to retreat in the World, 
and they fhall enjoy a perfed Solitude ; as com- 
pleat to all Intents and Purpofes, as if they were 
to live in the Cupola of St. PaiiVs^ or, as if they 
were to live upon the Top of Cheviot Hill m 
Novthiimherland. 

They that cannot be retir'd m this Manner, 
mud: not only retire from the World, but out of 
the World, before they can arrive to any true 
Solitude. Man is a Creature fo form'd for Socie- 
ty, that it may not only be faid, that it is not 
good for him to be alone, but 'tis really impof- 
(ible he fhould be alone : We are fo continually in 
need of one another \ nay, in fuch abfolute Ne- 

ceiTity 



[13] 

ceflity of AfTiftance from one another, that tlrofe 
who have pretended to give us the Lives and 
Manner of the Solitaires y as they call them, who 
feparated themfelves from Mankind, and wander'd 
in the Defarts oi Arabia and Lybiay are frequently 
put to the Trouble of bringing the Angels down 
from Heaven to do one Drudgery or another for 
them ; forming imaginary Miracles, to make the 
Life of a true Solitair pofTible ; fometimes they 
have no Bread, fometimes no Water, for a long 
Time together ^ and then a Miracle is brought 
upon the Stage, to make them live fo long with-^ 
out Food ; at other Times they have Angelscome 
to be their Cooks, and bring them Road-meat j to 
be their Phyficians, to bring them Phyfick, and 
the like: If Saint Hillary comes in his Wan- 
drings to the River Nile^ an humble Crocrodile 
is brought to carry him over upon his Back ; tho^ 
they do not tell us, whether the Crocodile ask'd 
him to ride, or he ask'd the Crocodile, or by what 
Means they came to be fo familiar with one ano- 
ther : And what is all this to the Retirement of 
the Soul, with which it converfes in Heaven in 
the midft of infinite Crowds of Men, and to whom 
the nearefl: of other Obje6ts is nothing at all, any 
more than the Objeds of Mountains and Defarts,. 
Lions and Leopards, and the like, were to thofe 
that banifh'd themfelves to Arabia i 

Befides, in a S:ate of Life, where Circum fian- 
ces are eafy, and Provifion for the Neceflaries of 
Life, which the befl Saint cannot fupport the 
Want of, is quietly and plentifully made ; has not 
the Mind infinitely more Room to withdraw 
from the World, than when at befl it miift wan - 
der for its daily Food, thp' it were but the Pro- 
duel of the Field. 

Let 



Ci4] 



tet no Man plead he wants Retirement, that 
he loves Solitude, but cailnot enjoy it, becaufeof 
the Embarrafsment of the Wotld; 'tis all a Delufi- 
on-, if he loves it, if he dedrcs it, he may have it 
when^ v^^here, and as often as he pleafes ; let his 
Hurries, his Labours, or his Affli&ons, be what 
they will : It is not the Want of ail Opportunity 
for Solitude, but the Want of a Capacity of being 
folitairy that is the Cafe in all the Circumflances 
of Life. 

I knew a poor, but good Man ; who tho* he was 
a Labourer, was a Man of Senfe and Religion; 
who being hard at Work with fome other Men, 
removing a great Quantity of Earth to raife a 
Bank againfl the Side of a Pond, was one Day fo 
out of himfelf, and wrapt up in a perfeft Appli- 
cation of his Mind, to a very ferious Subjed, . 
that the poor Man drove himfelf and his Wheel- 
barrow into the Pond, and could not recover him- 
felf, till Help came to him. This Man was cer- 
tainly capable of a perfed Solitude, and perhaps 
really enjoy'd it ; for as I have often heard him 
fay, he liv'd alone in the World : (i.) Had no 
Family to embarrafs his Affedions. (2.) His low 
Circumflances placed him below the Obfervation 
of the upper Degrees of Mankind. (3.) And his 
refervM Meditations plac^ him above the wicked 
Part, who were thofe in a Sphere equal to him- 
felf; among whom, as he faid, and is mofl truey 
it was very hard to find a fober Man, much lefs a 
good Mcin ; fo that he liv'd really alone in the 
World; apply 'd himfelfto labour for hisSubfi fiance, 
had no other Bafinefs with Mankind, but for Ne- 
celTaries ot Life, and conversed in Heaven, as ef- 
fedi.a y, and, I believe, every Way, as divinely 
as St. Hilary did in the Defarts of Ljl^ia, amon^ 
the Lions and Crocodiles. 

If 



[15] 

If this Retirement, which they caFl SoUtude^ eon^ 
fifted only of feparating the Perfon from the World, 
that is to fay, from human Society, it were itfelf 
a very mean Thing, and would every Way as well 
be fupplied, by removing from a Place where a 
Man is known, to a Place where he is not known, 
and there accuftom himfelf to a retired Life, ma- 
king no new Acquaintance, and only making the 
Ufe of Mankind which I have already fpoken of j 
namely for Convenience, and Supply of neceilary 
Food ; and I thinkof the Two, that fuch a Man, 
or a Man fo retir'd,, may have more Opportunity 
to be an entire Eeclufe, and may enjoy more real 
Solitude, than a Man in a Defart, For Example^ 

In the Solitude I fpeak of, a Man has no more 
to do for the Neceffaries of Life, than to receive 
them from the Hands of thofe that are to furnifli 
them, and pay them for fo doing i whereas, in 
the Solitude of Defart^ and wandring Lives, from 
whence all our Monkifh Devotion fprings, they 
had every Day their Food, fuck as it was, to 
feek, or the Load of it to carry; and except whefe 
as it is faid, they put Providence to the Opera- 
tion of a Miracle,, to furnifh it, they had frequently 
Difficulties enough to fuflain Life i and if we 
may believe Hiftory, many of them were flarv'd 
to Death for meer Hunger, or Thfrfl i and as 
often the latter as the former. 

Thofe that had Recourfe to thefe Solitudes,' 
merely as a Mortification of their Bodies, as I 
obferv'd before, and delivering themfelves from the 
Temptations] which Society expofed them to, 
had more. Room for the Pretence indeed, than 
thofe. whoailedge they did it to give up them- 
felves to Prayer and Meditation. The firlt might 
have foms Reafon in Nature for the Faj6i:, as 

Men, 



[ 1(5 3 

Mens Tempers and Conftitutfons tnlght lead I 
fome having an inordinate Appetite to Crimea 
fome addided by Nature to one ill Habir^ fome 
to another i tho' the Chriftian Religion does 
not ginde us to thofe Methods of putting 
a Force upon our Bodies to fubdue the 
Violence of inordirlate Appetite* The blefled 
Apoitle St. Paul, feems to have been in this 
Circumftance, when being affaulted with what is 
call'd in the Text, a Thorn in the Fkjh ; be it what 
it will that IS mearft there, it is not to my Pur- 
pofe ', but he pray'd to the Lord thrice ; that was 
the firllMethod the Apoftle took, and thereby fet 
a pious Example to all thofe who are aflaulted by 
any Temptation. He did nor immediately fly 
to Aufterities and bodily Mortifications, fepara- 
ting himfelf from Mankind, or flying into the 
Defart to give himfelf up to Fafiing, and a Re- 
treat from the World, y;^hich is the Objed of all 
private Snare. But he applied himfelf by ferious 
Prayer to him, who had taught us to pray. Lead 
74^ not into Temptation ; and the Anfwer likewife is 
inftruftingin th6 Cafe^ he was not driven out as 
Nehuchadnezx^ar into the Defart ,* he was not com- 
manded to retire into the Wildernefs, that he 
might be free from the Temptation; nothing I efs: 
But the Anfwer was, my Grace is fufficient for thee, 
fiilHcient without the Help of artificail Mortifica- 
tion. 

So that even in the Cafeof thefe forcible Morti- 
fications they are not; requir'd, much kfs direfted 
for Helps to Meditation i for if Meditation could 
not be pradis^d beneficially, and to all the Intents 
and Piirpofes for which it was ordain 'd a Duty, 
without flying from the Face of human Society, 
the Life of Man v/ould be very unhappy. 

But 



But doubtlefs the Contrary is evident, and all 
the Parts of a compleat Solitude are to be as ef- 
fedually enjoy'd,if we pleafe, and fufEcient Grace 
affifting, even in the moft populous Cities, among » 
the Hurries of Converfation, and Gallantry of a / 
Courtjor the Noife and Bufinefs of a Camp, as in ' 
the Defarts of Arabia and Lyhia^ or in the defolats 
Life of an uninhabited Ifland.

oAnEffajupon HONESTY. 

H E N I firfl: came home to my own 
Country, and began to fit down and 
look back upon the paft Circumftaii* 
ces of my wandring State, as you 

will in Charity fuppofe ' I could not 

^ut do very often ; the very Profperity^ enjoy'd 
led me moft naturally to refled upon the particu- 
lar Steps by which I arriv'd to it.. The Condi- 
tion I was in was very happy, fpeaking of hu- 
man Felicity; the former Captivity I had fuffer'd, 
made my Liberty fwecter to me ,* and to find my 
felf jump'd into eafy Circumftances at once, from 
a Condition below the common Rate of Life, 
made it (till fweeter. 

One Time, as I was upon my Enquiries into 
the happy Concurrence of the Caufes which 
had brought the Event of my Profperity to 
pafs, as an Effed, it occurr'd to my Thoughts, 
iiow much oi it all depended, under the 
Difpofition of Providence, upon the Principle 
of Hvyiefly^ which I met with, in almoft all the 
People whom it was my Lot to be concerned with 
in my private and particular Aftairs ; and I that 
had met with fuch extraordinary Liftances of the 
Knavery and Villainy of Mens Natures in other 
Circumftances^ could not but befomething taken 

up 



1^9 1 



lt^\)^ith the Miracles of Honefty that I had met 
with among the feveral People I had had to do 
With, I mean thofe whom I had more particularly 
to do with in the Articles of my Liberty, Eilate> 
or E&ds, which fell into their Hands. 

I began with my mofl: trufly and faithful Wi- 
dow, the Captain's Wife, with whom I jfirft went 
to the Coaft of Africa, and to whom 1 entrufled 
200 /. being the Gain I had made in my firft Ad- 
ventures to Guinea^ as in the firft Volume, Page 
330, appears. 

She was left a Widow, and in but indifferent 
Circumftances ; but when I fent to her fo f^r off as 
the Brajils, where I was in fuch a Condition as fhe 
might have reafonably believed I fhould never 
have been able to come my felf ; and if I had, 
might be in no Condition to recover it of heri 
and having my felf nothing to fhew under her 
Hand for the Truft,- yet (he was fo juft, that fhe 
fent the full Value of what I wrote for, being 
one hundred Pound ; and to fhew, as far as in her 
lay, her fincere honeft Concern for my Good, put 
in among many neceffary Things which I did not 
write for, I fay, put in two Bibles, befidcs other 
good Books, for my Reading and Iniirudion, as 
Sie faid afterwards, in Popifti and Heathen Coun- 
trieSj where I might chance to fall. Honefly not 
only leads to difcharge every Debt and every Truft 
to our Neighbour, fo far as is juflly to be deman- 
ded, but an honeft Man acknowledges himfelf 
Debtor to all Mankind, for fo much Good to be 
done for them, whether for Soul or Body, asPro^ 
videnceputs an Opportunity into his Hands to do: 
in Order to difcharge this Debt, he ftudies 
continually for Opportunity to do all the Ads of 
Kindnefs and BeneMcence, that is pofTible for him 
todoj and the' very few confider it, a Man is 
, C a BOt 



[ 10 ] 

ROt a compleatly honeft Man, that does not do 
this. 

Upon this Confideration, I queftion much,' 
whether a covetous, narrow, ftingy Man, as we 
call him, one who gives himfelf up to himfelf, 
as born for himfelf only, and who declines the 
Advantages and Opportunities of doing Good, 
imean, extreamly fo : I fay, I much queftion, 
whether fuch a Man can be an honefiMan; nay, % 
am fatisfy'd he cannot be honeft Man •, ior tho* 
he may pay every Man his own, and be jufi, as he 
thinks itj to a Farthing; yet this is Part of the 
Juftice, which in the common Phrale is the grea- 
teft Unjulh'ce. This is one Meaning of that Say- 
ing, Swninwn jns, fumma injuria. 

To pay every Man their own, is the common 
Law of Honefly ,• but to do Good to all Manidnd, 
as far as you are able, is the Chancery Law of Ho- 
nefly ; and tho' in common Law or Juftice, as I 
call it, Mankind can have no Claim upon us, if 
we do bur juft pay our Debt -, yet in Heaven's 
Chancery they will have Relief againft us y for 
they have a Demand in Equity of ail the Good to 
be done them, that it is in our Power to do, and 
this Chancery Court, or Court of Equicy, is held 
in every Man's Breafl ; 'tis a true Court of Con- 
fcience, and every Man's Confcience is a Lord 
Chancellour to him ; if he has not performed, 
if he has not paid this Debt, Confcience will de- 
cree him to pay it, on the Penalty of declaring 
him a dijhonefl Man, even in his own Opinion ; 
and if he ftiil xduks to comply, will, proceed 
by all the legal Steps of a Court of Confcience 
Procefs, tillatlaft it willifiue out a Writ of Re- 
bellion againft him, and proclaim him a Rebel to 
Manure and his own Confcience. 

But 



But this is by the Way, and is occafioned by 
the Obfervations I have made of many People, 
who think they are mighty honcft if they pay 
their Debts, and owe no Man any Thing, as they 
call it ; at the fame Time, like true Mifers, wlio 
lay up all for themfelves,they think nothing of the 
Debt of Charity and Beneficence, which they 
owe to all Mankind. 

Rich Men are their Maker's Free-holders; 
they enjoy freely the Eftate he has given them the 
Pofleflion of^ with all the Rents, Profits, and 
Emoluments, but charg'd with a free Farm Rent 
to the younger Children of the Family, namely 
the Poor ,* or if you will, you may call them, 
God's Copy-holders, paying a Quit-Rent to the 
Lord of the Manor; which Quit- Rent he has 
aiSigned for the Ufe of the refl of Mankind^j to 
be paid in aconftant Difcharge of all good Offi- 
ces, friendly, kind, and generous Adions ; and 
he that will not pay his Rent, cannot be an ho- 
nefl Man, any more than he that would not pay 
his other juft Debts. 

The Scripture concurs exadly with this No- 
tion of mine; the Mifer is call'd by the Prophet 
Jfaiah, a vile Per/on, one that works Iniquity, and 
jfraEiifes Hypocrify, and utters Error before the Lordy 
Ifaiah xxxii, 6, How does this appear? The ve- 
ry next Words explain it. He makes empty the Soul 
of the Hungry, and he will caufe the Drink of tJye 
Thirliy to fail. But left this lliould feem a ftrain'd 
Text, let us read on, both before and after, Verfe 
5. The Vile Perfon jhaU no more be caii'd Liberal^ 
nor the Churl faid to be Bountiful- Here the Op-^ 
pofite to a Liberal Man is call'd a Vile Perfon, 
and the Oppofite to a Bountiful Man is called a 
Churl; and in the Verfe following, the fame 
ViJePerfon> as oppofed to the Liberal Man; i^ 

c 5 caira 



[ " ] 

call'd a Wicked Man ; and the Liberal Man k 
fet up a Pattern for us all, in Oppofition to the 
vile,^ churlifb, covetous Wretch. VerG 7, 8. The 
Jnjh'uments alfo of the Churl are evil : He devifeth 
vjicked Devices to deflroy the Poor with lying JVords, 
even when the Needy Jpeaketh right, JBtit the Liberal 
devifeth liberal Things y and by libsral Things Jhall h^ 
(land. 

In a Word, I think my Opinion juflify*d by thi$ 
Text, that a Churl, ^ morofe, fowre Difpofition, 
^ covetous, avaricious, ftlfilli principrd Man, can- 
not be an honejl Alan; he does not pay the common 
Debt of Mankind to one another,nor theFee-Farm, 
or Quit-Rent of his Eftate to God, who is his 
Great Landlord50r Lord of the Manor, and who has 
charged the Debt upon hi^i. I know the Mifer 
will laugh at rh.'s Notion; but Ifpeakmyow^ 
Opinion, let it go ^s far as Reafon will Q^xr 

I come back to the Examples I was giving in 
my private Cafe. As the Widow was honeft to 
me, fo was my good Portuguefe Captain ; and it 
is this Manx's original Honefly, that makes mc 
fpeak of the honeft Man's Debt to Mankind. It 
was Honefly, a generous Honefty, that led the 
poor Man to take me up at Sea,* which if he had 
neglected, my Boy ^^^7 and I had perifhed toge- 
ther : It was no Debt to me in particular, but 
a Debt to Mankind, that he paid in that Adion; 
and yet he could not have been an honefi Man with- 
out it. You will fay, if he had gone away and 
left me, he had been barbarous and inhuman, and 
defervM to be left to perifh himfejf in the like 
Diftrefs : But, J fay^ this is not all the Cafe : Cu- 
I flom and the Nature of the Thing leads us to fay, 
it would have been hard-hearted and inhuman ; 
But Confcience will tell any Man, that it was a 

Debt, 



[ i? ] 

Dcbtj and he could not but be condemn'd by tlie 

Court of Confcience in his own Brea/I:, if he had 

omitted it; nay, in the Sight of Heaven he had 

taoitly kiird us, and had been as guilty of our 

Peath as a Murther^r ; for he hat refufes to fave 

a Life thrown into his Hands, takes it away ; and 

if there is a juft Retributipn in a future State, if 

Blood is at all required there, the Blood of every 

Man, Woman, or Child, whom we could have fa- 

ved, and did not, fhali be reckon'd to us at that 

Day, as fpilt by our own Hands ; for leaving Life 

in a Poilure in which it muft inevitably perift^, 

is without Queftioncauling it to perifli, and^ will 

be call'd fo then, by whatever gilded drefs'd-up 

Words we may exprefs and conceal it now. 

But I go farther, for my good Ponuguefs went 
farther with me; he not only paid the J)ebt he 
pw'd to Heaven, in faving our Lives, but h^ 
went farther : He took nothing of what I had, 
tho'in the common Right of the Sea, it was all 
his Due for Salvage, as the Sailors call it : But 
he gave me the Value of every Thing, bought 
tny Boatj which he might have turn'd adrift, my 
Boy J^wry, who was not my Slave by any Right, 
or if he had, became free from that Time y and 
the Life of Xury^ which he had fav'd, as a Ser- 
vant, was his owni yet he bought every Thing 
of me, for the full Value, and took nothing of 
me, no not for my Paflage. 

Here was the Liberal Man devifing liber all hings^ 
and the Sequel made good the promifTory Text ; 
for by thefe liberal Things, the honeft liberal 
Man might be truly faid to ftand; When I came to 
reward him at my coming to Lisbon, to fell my 
Plantation at Bra/il : Then he being poor, an4 
reduced, and notable to pay even what he ow'd 
..C4 mc^ 



me, I gave him a Reward fufficient to i^akc hii 
Circumftances eafy all his Life after. 

The Bounty of this Man tp me, when firft he 
took me up out of the Sea, was the higheft and 
moftcompleat Ad: of Honeftyj A generous Ho* 
nefly, laying hold of an Opportunity to do Good 
to an Objed offer'd by the Providence of Hea^ 
ven, and thereby acknowledging the Debt he had 
to pay to his Maker, in the Perfons of his moft 
diflrels'd Creatures. 

And here aifo let me remind my Readers of 
what perhaps they feldom much regard ; it is not 
only a Gift from Heaven to us, to be put in a 
Condition oi doing Good; but "'tis a Gift, and a Fa-* 
vour from Heaven^ to have an Opportunity of 
doing the Good WQ arc in a Condition to do; and we 
ought to clofe with the Opportunity, as a parti- 
cular Gift from above, and be as thankful for it ; 
I fay, as^ thankful for the Occafion of doing 
Good, as for the Ability. 

I might mention here the Honelly of my Fellow- 
Planter in the Brafilsy and of the two Merchants 
and their Sons, by whofe Integrity I had my 
Share in the Plantation preferved, and taken Care 
of; as alfo the Honefly of the publick Treafurec 
for the Church there, and the like: But I am car- 
ry 'd off in my Thoughts, to enlarge upon this no-' 
ble Principle, from the two Examples I have ai-* 
ready mentioned, viz,, the Guiney Captain's Wi-^ 
dow, and the Portuguefe ; and this in particular, 
becaufe, fince I came to England to rcfide, I have 
met with Abundance of Difputes about Honefty, 
efpecially in Cafes where honeft Men come to be 
unhappy Men, when they fall into fuch Circumflan- 
ces as they cannot be honefl, or rather, cannot 
fhew the Principle of Honefty, which is really 
at the Bottom of all their A6;ions, and which, 

but 



[^5 ] 



but for thofc Circumftances which entirely difa- 
ble them, would certainly (hew it felf in every 
Branch of their Lives : Such Men I have too 
often feen branded for Knaves by thofe who, 
if they come into the fame Condition, would 
perhaps do the fame Things, or worfe than they 
may have done* 

Both my Widow and my Portuguefe Captain, 
fell into low Circumftances, fo that they could 
not make good to me my Money that was 
in their Hat)ds ; and yet both of theni fhew'd 
to me, that they had not only a Principle 
of Juftice, but of generous Honefty too, when 
the Opportunity was put into their Hands to 
do fo. 

This put me upon enquiring and debating with 
my felf, what this fubtle and imperceptible Thing, 
callM Honefty, is^ and how it might be defcri- 
bed ; fetting down my Thoughts^ at feveral Times, 
as Objeds prefented J that Pofterity, if they think 
them worth while, may find them both ufeful 
and diverting. And Firfly I thought it not 
improper to lay down the Conditions upon 
which I am to enter upon that Defcription; 
that I may not be miftaken, but be allow'd to ex- 
plain what I mean by Honefty, before I undertake 
to enter upon any Difcourfes or Obfervations about 
it. 

And to come di redly to ft, for 1 would make as 
few Preambles 05 pojfthley I fhall crave the Liberty 
in all the following Difcourfe, to take the Term 
Honefty y as I think all Englijh ExprefHons ought to 
be taken, namely Hmefterly, in the common Accep- 
tation of the Word, the general vulgar Senfe of 
it, without any Circumlocutions or DoubIe»Enten- 
dres whatfoever; for I defire to fpeak plainly 
^nd fin(^ere!y. Indeed, as I have no Talent at hard 

Word S3. 



[1(5] 

Words, fol have no great Vetteratton for Etymo- 
logies, efpecially in EngUJh : But fince I am trea- 
ting of Honefljy I defire to do it, as I fay above, 
hcneflly, according to the genuine Signification of 
the Thing. 

Neither fhall I examine^ whether Honefty be 
a natural or an acquired Virtue, whether a Ha-*- 
l>ic, or a Qiiah'ty, whether inherent or accidental; 
all the philofophical Part of it I chufe to omit. : 
' Neither fhall I examine it, as it extends tQ 
Spirituals, and looks towards Religion ,* if wc en- 
quire about Honefty towards God, I readily al- 
low all Men are born Knaves, Villains, Thiqve^, 
and Murtherers, and nothing but the reftraining 
Power of Providence witholds us all frpn^ {hew- 
ing our felves fuch, on all Occafions. 

No Man can be juft to his Maker ; if he could, 
^11 our Creeds and ConfelTions, Litanies and Sup- 
plications, were ridiculous Contradictions and 
Imperrinences ; inconfiftent with themfelves, and 
with the whole Tenor of human Life, 

In all the enfuing Dlfcourfe therefore, I am to 
be underftood of Honefly, as it regards Mankind 
among themfelves, as it looks from one Man to 
another, in thofe neceflary Parts of Man's Life, 
his Converfation and Negotiation, Trulh, Friend- 
fiiips, and all the Incidents of human Affairs. 

The Plainnefs I profefs, both in Style and 
Method, feems to me to have fome fuitable Ana- 
logy to the Subjeft, Honefly ; and therefore, is ab- 
folutely neceflary to be fi:ri6:ly followed. And I 
muft own, I am the better reconciTd, on this very 
Account, to a natural Infirmity of homely plain 
Writing,- in that I think the Plainnefs of Ex- 
preflion, which I am condemn'd to, will give no 
Difadvantage to my Subjed, fince Honefty fhews 
the mod beautiful, and the more like Honefty^. 

whea 



whcti Artifice is difmifs'd, and fhe ishonellly fcen 
by her own Light only ; likewife the fame Since*" 
rity is required in the Reader ; and he that reads 
this Effay without Honefiyy will never underflan4 
it right : SJbemufl, I fay, be viewd by her own Lights 
if Prejudice, Partiality, or private Opinions ftand 
in the Way, the Mans a reading Knave, he is not 
honeft to the Subject; and upon fuch an one all 
the Labour is loft ; this Work is of no Ufe to 
"him, and by my Confent, the Bookfeller fliould 
give him his Money again. 

If any Man, from his private ill Nature, takes 
Exceptions at me, poor, wild, wicked, Robinfoii 
Crufoe, for prating of fuch Subjfeds as this is, 
and (hall call either my Sins, or Misfortunes to Re- 
membrance, in Prejudice of what he reads ; fuppp- 
fing me thereby unqualify 'd to defend fo noble a 
Subjed asfthis of Honefly, or at leaft to handle it ho* 
tiefily : I takp the Freedom to tell fuch, that thofe 
very wild wicked Doings and Mifiakes of mine, 
render me the propereft Man alive to givo. War- 
ping to others, as the Man that hoi beenjick is half 
a Phyfician, Befides, the Confelfion which I all 
^long make of my early Errors, and which Provi- 
dence, you fee, found me Leifure enough to re- 
pent of, and I hope, gave me Affiftance to do it 
effectually ; affifts to qualify me brthe prefent Un- 
dertaking, as well to recommend that Reditude 
of Soul, which I call Honefly to others, as to warn 
thofe who are fubjed to miftake it, either in 
themfelves or others : Heaven it felf receives thofe 
who fincerely repent, into the fame State of Ac- 
ceptance, as if they had not iinn'd at all, and fo 
ihould we alfo. 

They who refenty and their iU Lives amend, \ 
Stmd next to thof^ who never did offend, \ 

Nor 



tin 



Nor do I think a Man ought to be afraid or 
alham'd to own and acknowledge his Follies and 
Miftakes, bnt rather to think it a Debt which Ho- 
mfly obliges him to pay : Befides, our Infirmities 
and Errors, to which all Men are equally fubjeft, 
when recovered from, leave fuch Impreffions be- 
hind them, on thofe who fincereiy repent of them, 
that they are always the forwardeft to accufe and 
reproach theiTifclves : No Man need advife them, 
or lead them ; and this o^iv^s the greatefi; Difco- 
veryoftheHonefty otthe Man^s Heart, and Sin- 
cerity of Principles. Some People tell us, they 
think they need not make any open Acknowledg- 
ment of their Follies i and 'tis a Cruelty to cxad 
itx}f them ; that they could rather dye than fub- 
mit to it j that their Spirits are too great for it ; 
that they are more afraid to come to fuch publick 
Confeffions and Recognitions, than they would be 
to meet a Cannon Bullet, or to face an Enemy : 
But this is a poor raiflaken Piece of falfe Bravery ; 
all Shame is Cowardife, as an eminent Poet tells 
us. That all Courage is Fear, the bra veft Spirit 
is the beft qualify *d for a Penitent , "'tis a flrange 
Thing that we Ihould not be afham'd to offend, 
but fhould be afham'd to repent j not afraid^ to 
iin, but afraid to confefs. This very Thought 
extorted the following Lines from a Friend of 
mine, with whom I difcourfcd upon this Head. 

/ Among the worfl of Cowards let him he nam*d^ 
Who having Jsnnd's afraid to be afhamd ; 
And to miftakm Courage he's betray d^ 
Who halving finnd's afharnid to be afraid. 

But to leave the Point of Courage and Cowai^ 
A'\{q, in our repenting of our Offences, I bring k> 
back ro the very Point I am upon ; namely that of 

Hons- 



[^9] 

Itonefly. A Man cannot be truly an honcfl: Man, 
without acknowledging the Miftakes he has made; 
particularly, without acknowledging the Wrong 
done to his Neighbour 5 and why pray is Jaftice 
lefs required in his Acknowledgment to his Maker? 
He then that will be honefl, muft dare to con- 
fefs he has been a Knave ; for as above, fpeaking 
of our Behaviour to God, we have been all 
Knaves, and all difhoneft,; and if we come to 
fpeak ftridly, perhaps it would hold in our Be- 
haviour to one another alfo; for, Where's the 
Man that is not chargeable by fome or other of his 
Neighbours, or by himfelf, with doing Wrong, 
with fome Oppreflion or Injury, either of the 
Tongue, or of the Hands. 

I might enlarge here upon the Honefty of the. 
Tongue, a Thing .fome People, who call them- 
felves very honeft Men, keep a very (lender Guard 
upon, 1 mean, as toEvil-fpeaking; and of all 
Evil-fpeaking, that worft Kind of it, the fpea- 
king hard and unjuft Things of one another. 

This is certainly intended by the Command 
of God, which is fo exprefs and emphatick, Ihou 
fialt not hearfalfe Witnejs againfi thy Neighbour ; at 
leaft that Part which is what we call Slander, rai- 
ling an injurious and falfe Charge upon the Cha- 
rader and Condud of our Neighbour^ and fprea- 
ding it for Truth. 

But this is not all ; than Honefty I am fpeaking 
of refpeds all Detradion, all outrageous Af- 
faults of the Tongue ; Reproach is as really a Pare 
of Diflionefty, as Slander; and tho' not fo aggra- 
vated in Degree, yet 'tis the fame in Kind.i 

There is a Kind of Murther that may be com- 
mitted with the Tongue, that is in its Na- 
ture as cruel as that of. the Hand : This can 

never

hcvcr be the Praftice of an honeft Mah' ; Kay, he 
that pradifes it cannot be an honeft Man. 

But perhaps I may come to this again,but I muft 
go back to explain my felf upon the Subjed a lit- 
tle farther in the General, and then youfliall hear 
more of me, as to the ParticularSi -

hr^m 



0/ H o N E s T Y in tifneral.' ^ 

Have always obfervM , that howevet 
few the real honeft Men are, yet C- 
very Man thinks himfelf, and pro^ 
claims himfelf an honeft Man. Ho- 
neity, like Heaven, has all Mens good Word, and 
all Me%pretend to a Share of it : So general is rhe 
Claim, that like a Jeft which is fpoil'd by the Re- 
petition, ^tis grown of no value for a Man td 
fwear by his Faithy which is in its original Mean- 
ing, by his Honeftyy and ought to be underftood 
fo. 

Like Heaven too, \is little underftood by thofe 
who pretend moft to it, 'tis too often fquar^d ac- 
cording to Mens private Intereft, tho' at the fame 
Time the Latitude which feme Men give them- 
felves, isinconfiftent with its Nature. 

Honefty is a. general Probity of Mind, an Apti- 
tude to Ad juftly and honourably in all Cafes, re- 
ligious and civil, and to all Perfons fuperiour or 
inferiour ; neither is Ability or Difability to ad 
fo, any Part of the Thing it Cdi in this Senfe. 

It may be diftinguifh'd into Juftice and Equity, 
or if you will, into Debt and Honour ; for both 
make up but one Honeftv. 

E;caa 



Exaft Juftice is a Debt to all our Fdlcw-Crea- 
tures ; and honourable, generous Juftice is derived 
from that golden Rule, Quod tibl fieri mn vis al- 
ter i nefereris; and all this put together, makes up 
Honefty : Honour indeed is a higher Word for it, 
but 'tis the fame Thing, and 

— - Differs from Jufiice only in the Name, \\ 
For Honefty and Honour are the fame* 

This Honefty is of fo qualifying a Nature, 
,that "'tis the moft Denommative of all poftible 
Virtues : An Honefl Man is the beft Tide can be 
given in the World i all other Titles are empty 
and ridiculous without it, and no Title can be 
really fcandalous if this remain. 'Tis the capital 
X-etter,by which a Man's Charaderwill be known, 
when private Qualities and Accompliiliments are 
Worm-eaten by Time; without it a Man can 
peitherbe a Chriftian or a Gentleman : A Man may 
bt a poor honeft Man, an unfortuaare honeft Man ; 
but a Chriftian Knave, or a Gentleman Knave, is 
a Contradidion : A Man forfeits his Charader 
and his Family by Knavery ,• and his Efcutcheon 
ought to have a particular Blot, like that of Ba-* 
ftardy. When a Gentleman lofes his Honefty, he 
ceafes to be a Gentleman, commences Rake from 
that Minute, and ought to be us'd like one. 

Honefty has fuch a general Charader in the 
Minds of Men, that the worft of Men, who nei- 
ther pradife or pretend to any Part of it, will 
yet value it in others i no Man ever cou'd be fp 
out of Love with it, as to deftre his Pofterity 
fhould be without ir ; nay, fuch is the Veneratioii 
all Men have for it, that the general Bleffing of a 
Father to his Son, is Prayy God make thee an honeft 
Man. 

Indeed 



[Ji] 



Indeed fo general is the Value of it, and Co Well 
known, that it feems needlefs to fay any Thing in 
behalf of it. So far as it is found upon Earth, fo 
much of the firft Reditude of Nature, and of the 
Image of God, feems to be rcftor'd to Man- 
kind. 

The greateft Mifchief which to me feems to 
attend this Virtue, like the Thorn about the 
Rofe, which pricks the Finger of thofe who med* 
die with it, is Pride : 'Tis a hard Thing for a 
Man to be very honeft, and not be proud of it ; 
and tho' he who is really honeft, has, as we fay, 
fomething to be proud of, yet I take his Honefty to 
be in a great deal of Danger, who values himfelf 
too much upon it. 

True honeft Honefty, if I may be allow'd fuch 
an ExpreffioH, has the leaft Relation to Pride of 
any View in the World ; 'tis all fitnple, plain, ge- 
nuine, and (incere ; and if I hear a Man boaft of his 
Honefty, I cannot help having fome Fears for him, 
at leaft, that "'tis fickly and languiftiing. 

Honefty is a little tender Plant, not known to 
all who have Skill in Simples, Thick fow'd, as they 
fayy and Thin come up ; 'tis nice of Growth, it 
feldom thrives in a very fat Soil -, and yet a very poor 
Ground too is apt to ftarve it^ unlefs it has taken 
very good Root; when it once takes to a Piece of 
Ground, it will never be quite deftroy'd ,• it may 
be choak'd with the Weeds of Prosperity, and 
fometimes ^tis fo fcorcht up with the Droughts of 
Poverty and NecefTity, that it feems as if it were 
quite dead and gone ,* but it always revives upon 
the leaft mild Weather ; and if fome Showers of 
Plenty fall, it makes full Reparation for the Lofs the 
Gardener had in his Crop. 

There is an ugly Weed, call'd Cunnings whicli 
is very pernicious to it, and which particularly 

injure^ 



[3J] 



injures ir^ by hiding it from our Dlfcovery, and 
making it hard to find : This is fo like Honefiy^ 
that many a Man has been deceiv'd with it, and 
have taken one for t'other in the Market : Nay, 
I have heard of fome, who have planted this ^ijoiid 
Honefijiy as we may call it, in their own Ground^ 
have made Ufe of it m their Friendfiiips and Dea- 
lings, and thought it had been the true Plant, 
but they always loft Credit by it : And that was 
not the worft neither ,* for they had the Lofs who 
dealt with them, and who chafferM for a Counter^ 
feit Commodity i and we find many deceived fo 
Ml, which is the Occafion there is fuch an Out- 
cry about falfe Friends, and about Sharping and 
Tricking in Mens ordinary Dealings in the World. 
This true Honefty too has fome little Difference 
in it, according to the Soil or Climate in which 
it grows, and your Simplers have had fome Dif- 
putes about the Sorts of it : Nay, there have been 
great Heats about the feveral Kmds of this Plants 
which grows in different Countries, and fome call 
that Honefly, which others fay, is not; as parti- 
cularly they fay. There is a Sort of Honefty in 
my Country, Tork/hhe Honefty^ which differs^ very 
much from that which is found in thefe fouthern 
Parts about London: Then there is a Sort of ScoU 
Honefty, which they fay is a meaner Sort than 
that of York/hire I And in New England, I have 
heard they have a kind of Flonefty, which is 
worfe than the ^coif//^, and little better than the 
wild Honefty, callM Cunnings which I mentioned 
before. On the other hand, they tell us, that in 
fome Parts of Afidy at Smyrna^ and at Conftantino'- 
pky the Turks have a better Sort of Honefty than 
any of us. I am forry, our Turkey Company have 
not imported fome of it, that we might try whe- 
ther it would thrive here or no. 'Tisa little odd 

D to 



[ 34 1 



to me, It fhould grow to fuch a Perfedion; In 'Iuy-^ 
key, becaufe it has always been obferv'd to thrive 
bed, where it is fow'd with a Sort of Grain 
caird Religion \ Indeed they never thrive in thefe 
Parts of the World, fo well apart, as they da 
together. And for this Reafon, I muft own, I have- 
found that Scots Honefty, as above, to be of a very 
good Kind. How "'tis i\\ Turkey, I know nor ; 
for in all my Travels, I never fet my Foot in 
the Grand Seignior's Dominions. 

But to wave Allegories, Difputes about what 
isy or is not Honefly, are dangerous to Honefly 
it felfj for no Cafe can be doubtful, which does- 
not border upon the Frontiers of Difhonefty ; and 
he that refolves not to be drowned, had bcft ne- 
ver come near the Brink of the Water. 

That Man who will do nothing but what is barely 
honefi:, is in great Danger. "^Tis certainly jiiftfor me 
to do every Thing the Law juftificsi but if I fhould 
only fquare my Adions by what is literally law- 
ful, I muft throw every Debtor, tho' he be poor 3^ 
in Prifon, and never releafe him till he has paid the 
uttermoft Farthing : I muft hang every MalcFa^ 
ftor without Mercy, I muft exaft the Penalty of 
every Bond, and the Forfeiture of every Inden- 
ture : In fhort, I muft be uneafy to all Mankind, 
and make them fo to me ,* and in a Word, be a 
very Knave too, as well as a Tyrant i for Cruelty 
is not Honefty. 

Therefore, the fovereign Judge of every Man's 
Honefty has laid us down a general Rule, to 
which ail the Particulars are refolved, Quod tibh 
fieri non vis, alter i ne jeceris. This is a Part of 
that Honefty I am treating of, and which indeed 
is the more efential of the two,* this is the Tcft 
of Behaviour, and the grand Article to have Re-* 
courfc to^ when Laws are Hient. 

I have 



[35] 



I have heard iomc Men argue, that they are 
not boLiiici to any fuch Confiderations of the In- 
digence of Perfons, as lead to Conceffions of Time, 
or Compofitions with them for Debts ; that "'tis 
a\\ ex gratia, or the Effeds of Policy, becaufe Cir- 
cumftances lead them to judge it better to take 
what they can gee, than lofe the Whole. 

Speaking of the Letter of the Law, I allow that 
they may be in the right. 

On the other hand, a Man who gives a Bond 
for ia Debt, pleads, he is anfwerable for no more 
than the Law will force him to i that is, he may 
defend a Suit, ftand out to the laPt Extremity, 
and at lafl keep out of the Way, fo as not to have 
Judgment or Execution fervid on him , he may 
fecure his Eftate from the Execution, as well as 
his Perfon, and fo never pay the Debt at all ; and 
yet in the Eye of the Law be an honefl Man j and 
this Part of legal literal Honedy is fupported on- 
ly by the other, namely, the cruel Part ,• for real- 
ly fuch a Man, fpeaking in the Senfe of common 
Juftice, is a Knave ; he ought to ad according to 
the true Intent and Meaning of his Obligation, and 
in the Right of a Debtor to a Creditor, which is 
to pay him his Money when it became due, not 
(land out to the laft, becaufe he cannot be forc'd 
to it foonet. 

The Laws of the Country indeed allow fuch 
Aftions as the Laws"" of Confcience can by no 
Means allow, as in this Cafe of the Creditor 
fuing for his Debt, and the Debtor not paying it 
till he is forced by Law. The Argument made 
tJfe of to vindicate the Morality of fuch a Pra- 
iftice, (lands thus : 

If a Man trufts me with his Money or Goods, 

upon my common Credit, or upon my Word, he 

then takes me for his Money, and depends both 

D 2 upon 



[ 3^ ] 

upon my Ability and my Honefly ; but i£ he 
comes and demands my Bond, he quits his De- 
pendence upon my Honefty, and takes the Law 
for his Security ; fo that the Language of fuch an 
Adion is. He will have a Bond, that it may be 
in his Power, to make me pay him, whether I 
will or no; and as for my Flonefly^ he^il have no- 
thing to do with it : What Relief then I can have 
againft this Bond, by the fame Law, to which 
the Perfon refers himfelf, is as legal an Adion on 
my Side, as the other Man's fuing for his own> 
is on his. 

And thus the Letter of the Law will ruine the 
Honefty of both Debitor and Creditor, and yet 
both lliall be juftify'd too. 

But if 1 may give my Opinion in this Cafe, nei- 
ther of thefe are the honefl: Man I am fpeaking of; 
for Honefty docs not confift of Negatives i and 
^tis not fufficient to do my Neighbour no perfo- 
nal Lijury in the flridSenfe and Letter of the Law ; 
but I am bound, where Cafes and Circumftances 
make other Meafures reafonable, to have fuch Re- 
gard to thefe Cafes and Circumftances, as Rea- 
fon requires. Thus to begin with- the Creditoxr 
to the Debtor, Reafon requires, that where a 
Man is reducM to Extremities, he fhould not be 
deftroy'd' for Debt ; and what's unreafonabk can- 
not be honeft. 

Debt is no capital Crime, nor ever was ; and 
ftarving Men in Prifon, a Punifhment worfe than 
the Gallows, feems to be a Thing fo fevere, as 
it ought not to be in the Power of a Creditor 
to inflid it: The Laws of God never tolerated 
fuch a Method of treating Debtors, as we have 
(ince thought proper, I won't fay honeft, to put 
in Pradice : But fince the Politicks of the Nation 
have left the Debtor fo much at Mercy by the 

Letter 



[?7] 

Letter of the Law, 'tis honefl with Refpeft to 
the Law, to proceed fo ,* yet Compafiion is in 
this Cafe thought reafonable, Why Jhoudfl thou 
take his Bed from under him ? fays the Text ; whxh 
implies, -tis unnat.pral and unreafonable. 

I have heard iome Men indft upon it, that if 
a Man be fued wrongfully at Law, he ought ra- 
ther to fubmit to the Injury, than to oppofe the 
WrongV by the fame Law ; and yet I never found 
thofe Gentlemen fo pailive in Matters of Law^ 
but they would fue a Debtor at Law, if they could 
not otherwife obtain their Right. 

I confefs,^ I cannot blame them for the laft,' 
but I blame them for pretending to the firfl: : 
I am not arguing againii recovering a juft Debt 
by a juff Law, where the Perfon is able, but un- 
willing, to be honed : But I think, purfuing the 
Debtor to "all Extremities, to the turning his Wife 
and Children into the Street, exprefs'd m the 
Scripture by, 'taking his Bed fiom under him ; and 
by keeping the Debtor in Prifon, when really he 
is not able to pay it; there is fomething of Cruel- 
ty in ity and the honeft Man, I am fpeaking of, 
can never do it. 

Butfome may objeft, if I mud ferve all Man- 
kind, as I would be ferv'd in like Cafe, then I 
muif relieve every Beggar, and releafe every poor 
Debtors for if 1 was a Beggar, I would be re- 
liev'd I and if I was In Prifon, I would be released ; 
and fo I mufl: give away all I have. This is inver- 
ting the Argument ; for the Meaning is in the 
Negative ftill, Do not to another any Thing, or 
put no Hardfliip upon another, which you would 
not allov/ to be juft, i£ you were in their 
Cafe. 

Honefty is Equity, every Man is Lord Chan- 
cellor to hinifelf I and H he would confulc that

Principle within him, would find Reafon as fair 
an Advocate for his Neighbour, as for hijn^- 
felf: But I proceed. 

Of the Tryal (?/^ Honesty. 

jEceflity makes an honefl: Man a Knave ; 
and if the World was to be the Judge, 
according to the common received No- 
tion, there would not be an honeft poor 
Man left alive. 

A rich Man is an honeft Man, no I'hanks to 
htm; for he would be a double Knave to cheat 
Mankind, when he had no Need of it: He has 
no Occafion to prefs upon his Integrity, nor fo 
much as to toucli upon the Borders of Di (hone- 
fly. Tell me of a Man, that is a very honeft 
Man y for he pays every Body pundually, runs 
into no body's Debt, does no Man any Wrong i 
very well, V/hat Circumftances is he in ? Whyj 
he has a good Eftate^ a fine yearly Income, and 
no Bufinefs to do. The Devil muft have full Pof- 
felTiQn of this Man, if he ftiould be a Knave s for 
no Man commits Evil for the Sake of it,- even the 
Devil hirnfeif has fome farther Defign in Sinningj, 
than barely the wicked Part of it. No Man is 
fo hardned in Crimes, as to commit them for the 
meer Pleaftire of the Fa6t; there is always fome 
Vice gratifyM j Ambition, Pride, or Avarice, 
inak:^ rich Men Knaves, and Neceffity, the Poor: 
But to go on with this rich honefl Man ; his 
Neighbour a thriving Merchant, and whofe Ho- 
nefty had as untainted a CharaSer, as he can 

pretend 



{39] 



;prctend to, has a rich Ship caft away, or a Fa- 
dor Abroad broke in his Debt, and his Bills 
comeback proteiled, and he fails, is fain to ab- 
scond, and make a Compofition : Our rich ho- 
neft Man Rks out upon him prefently, he is .4 
Knave, a Rogue, and don't pay People what he 
owes them ; and we fhould have a Law, That 
he that runs into Debt farther than he is able to 
payi fhould be hang'd ; ^nd the like. If the poor 
Man is laid Hold on by fome Creditor, and put 
in Prifon ; ay, there let him lye, he deferves it ; 
'twill be an Example to keep others from the

You iky, you are an honeft Man, How do you 
know it? Did you ever want Bread, and had 
you Neighbour's Loaf in your Keeping, and 
would flarve rather than cat it? Was you ever ar- 
refted, and being not able by your felf or Friends^ 
to make Peace with your Plaintiff, and at the 
lame Time having another Man's Money in your 
Cafh Chefl, committed to your Keeping, fuffer'd 
your felt to be carry 'd tojayl, rather than break 
Bulk, and break in upon your Trufl. God him- 
felf has declared, That the Power of Extremity 
is irrefiftible, and that fo^ as to oar Integrity,

I am of the Opinion, that I could flate a Cir* 
cumflance, in which there is not one Man in the 
World would be honefl : Neceilicy is above the 
Power of human Nature ; and for Providence 
to fuffer a Man to fall into that Necefficy, is to 
fuffer him to fin; becaufe Nature is not furnilh'd 
with Power to defend it felf, nor is Grace itfelf 
able to fortify the Mind againft it. 

. What fhall we fay to five Men in a Boat at Sea, 
without Provi/ion, calling a Council together, 
and refolving to kill one oF themfelves for the 
others to feed on, and eat him ? With what Face 
could the four look up^ and crave a Bleillng on 
that Meat? With wiiat Heart give Thanks afcet 
h ? And yet this has been done by honell Men,* 
and I believe, the honefkfl Man in the World 
might be forc'd to it; yet here is no Manner ot 
Pretence, but Neceffity, to palliate the Crime. 
If it be argued ^twas the Lofs of one Man to 
fave the Four, 'tis anfwered. Bur what Authority 
to make him die to fave their Lives? How came 
the Man to owe them fuch a Debt ? ''Twas Rob-* 
bery and Murder ; 'twas robbing him of his Life, 
which was his, Property to preferve mine; 'tis 
Murder, by taking away the Life of an innocent 
Man; and at befl 'cwas doing Evil that Good 
may come, which is exprefsly forbidden. 

But there is a Kind of Equity pleaded in this 
Cafe ; generally when Men are brought to fuch a 
Fafs, they cafl Lots who fliall be the Man, and 
the voluntary Confent of the Party makes it law- 
ful (God himfelf being fuppos'd to determine who 
{hall be the Man) which I deny ; for it is in no 
Man's Power legally to confent to fuch a Lot; 
ho Man has a Right to give away his own Life ; 
tie may forfeit it to the Law, and loofe it ; bur 
that's a Clime againfl himfclF, as well as againft 
; V . " the 



[ 41 1 

the Law ; and the four Men might by our Law have 
bcQn. try d and hang'd fcrMurder. All that can be 
i'aidis, That Neceffity makes the highefl: Crimes 
lawful, and Things Evil in their own Nature arc 
male pradicable by it. From thefe Extremes 
cf Neceffity, we come to lighter Degrees of it; 
and fo let us bring our honeft Man to lome Exieng- / 
cies. He would not wrong any Man of a Farthing ; ' 
he could not deep if he &iould be in any body's 
Debt ; and he cannot be an honeft Man that can. 

That we may fee now, whether this Man's 
Honefty lyes any deeper than his Neighbour's, 
turn the Scale of his Fortune a little: His 
Father left him a good Eftate, but here comes._ 
{ome Relations, and they trump up a Title to his 
Lands, and ferve Ejedments upon his Tenants ; 
and fo the Man gets into Trouble, Hurry o£ 
Bufmefs, and the Law : The extravagant Charges 
of the Law fink him of all .his ready Money^ and 
his Rents being ftopp'd, the firft Breach he make^ 
upon his Honefty (that is^ by his former Rules), he 
goes to a Friend to borrow Money, tells him this 
Matter will be over he hopes quickly, and he 
fhall have his Rents to receive, and then he will 
pay him again, and really he intends to do fo: 
But here comes a Difappointment, the Tryal 
comes' on, and he is caft, and his Title to the 
Eftate proves defedive; his Father was cheated^ 
and he not only lofes the Eftate, but is call'd up- 
on for the Arrears of the Rent he has receiv'd, 
and in fhort, the Man is undone, and has not 4 
Penny to buy Bread, or help himfelf j and befides^ 
this cannot pay the Money he borrowed. 

Now, turn to his Neighbour, the Merchant, 
whom he had fo loudly call'd Knave, for Breaking 
in his Trade, he by this Time has made up with 
his Creditors^ and got Abroad again 5 and he meets 



[r40 

l-jim in the Street in his dejeded CircLimftances# 
Welly fays the Merchant, and Why don't you fajf 
my Cotifin, your old Neighbour, the Money you hrrowr 
edofhim? Truly, fays he, becauje I have lofl all my 
EftatSy and emit pay, nay I have nothing to live oji, 
IVeU, huty returns the Mt\:c\\2iniylVant you a Knave 
to boryO'(jj AJoney, and now cant fay it / Why truly^ 
fays the Gentleman, When I borrowed it, I really 
deftgn'd to be honeft, and did not queflion but I Jhould 
have my Efiate again, and then 1 had been able alfo^ 
and zc'ould have paid him to a Penny, hit it has pro^ 
rued otherwtfe ; and tjoo J would pay him, if I had 
it, yet I am not able. Well hut, fays the Merchant 
iigam, Did you not call me Knave, tho Iloft my Eflate 
Abroad, by unavoidable Difaflers, as you have loft 
yours at Hoine ? Did you not upbraid me^ hecaufe I 
could not pay ? I would have paid every Body, if / 
could, as well as pu. Why truly, fays the Gentle- 
man, / was a Fool, I did not conftder what it was 
to be brought to Necejjtty, Lask you Pardon. 

Now, let's carry on xhis Story : The-Mer- 
chant compounds with his Creditors, and paying 
every one a juft Proportion, as far as 'twill go, 
gets himfelf difcharg'd ; and being bred to Bufi- 
nefs, and indiiltrious, falls into Trade again, and 
raifes himfelf to good Circumflances ; and at lafl-, 
a lucky Voyage, or fome Hit ol: Trade, fets him 
above the VVorid again : The Man remembring 
his former Debts, and retaining his Principle 
oF Honefty, calls his old Creditors together ; and 
the' he was formerly difcharg*d from them all, vo- 
luntarily pays them the Remainder of their Debts. 
The Gentleman being bred to no Bufinefs, and 
his Fortune defpcrate, goes Abroad, and gets in- 
to the Army, and behaving himfelf well, is made 
an Officer -, and itill ridng by h;s Mcrir, becomes 
a ^reat Man, buc m his new Condition troubles 

not 



I^Qt his Head with his former Debts in his native 
Country, but fettles in the Court and Favour pf 
the Prince, under whom he has made his Fortunes, 
3.nd there fets up fpr the fame honeft Man he did 
before. 

I think I need not ask which pf thefe two ar^ 
the honeft Man, any more than which was th? 
hpneft Penitent, th^ Pharifee or the Publican. 

Honefty, like Friend£hip,is try'd in Afflidion ,• 
and he that cries out loudeft againfc thofe who in 
the Time of this Tryal areforcM to give Ground,, 
would perhaps yield as far in th^ like Shock of 
Misfortune. 

To be honeft when Peace and Plenty flows 
upon our Hands, is owing to the Bleiling of our 
Parents; but to be honeft, when Circumftances 
grow narrow. Relations turbulent and quarrel- 
fome, when Poverty ftares at us, and the World 
threatens; this Blelling is from Heaven^ and can 
pnly be fupported from thence. God Al- 
mighty is very little beholding to them, who will 
ferve him juft as long as he feeds them. ^Twas 
a ftrong Argument the Devil ufed in that Dia- 
logue between Sathan and his Maker about Jc^. 
Tes he is a mighty good Mem, and a mighty jufi 
^an, and weH he majy ijohile you give him every Thing 
he wants: I zvou'd ferve you my f elf and be as true 
to you m Job, if you woiL^d he as kind and as boun^ 
tijul to mey as you are to him : But noiu^ do but lay 
your Finger on him ; do but flop your Hand a little ^ and 
\ut him fhort ,• flrip him a little^ and make him like 
one of thofe poor Fellows that now bow to him^ and you 
ipill quickly fee your good Man be like other Men ; nay^ 
the Pajflon he will be in at his Lcffes^ will make him 
curfe you to your Face. 'Tis true, the Devil was 
miftaken in the Man, but the Argument had a 
great deal of Probability in it, and the Moral may 

be 



I 44] . 

be drawn, both from the Argument and from the 
Confcquences. 

I. That "tisan eafy Thirtg to maintain the Ch^- 
rader of Honefty and Uprightnefs, whe^ a Man 
has no Bufinefs to be in employ 'd in, and no Wane 
to prefs him. 

II. That when Exigences and DifcreiTes pinch 
a Man, then is :he Time to prove the Honefty of 
his Principle. .-oi .^y -:--:. .^ ■■ . • 

^'■^" Theprcfpero'usht)nefc I^fen c^^^ by boa- 

fting tell the World he is honefr, -but the difcrefs'd 
and rnin'd hcncft Man hears other Feople^tell 
him he is honefc. 

In this Cafe therefore, fince Allowance muft 
be made for human Infirmities, we are to di- 
inngui{h between an Accident and a Practice. I 
am not plead ng to encourage any Man to make 
BO Scruple oftrefpaffing upon his Honefty in Time 
of Neceffity : But I cannot condemn every Man 
for a Knave, who by unufua] PrelTures, Straits, 
Difficulties, or other Temptation, has been kk 
to flip, and do an ill A<5tion, as we call it, 
Vv^hich perhaps this Perfon would never have 
ftoopM to, if the Exigence had not been too 
great for his Refolution. The Scripture fays of 
David, He was a Man after God's own Heart -^ and 
yet we have feveral Things recorded of him, 
which, according the modern Way of cenfuring 
People in this Age, v^^ould have given him the 
Chara&r of a very ill Man : But I conceive, the 
Teftimony of David's Uprightnefs, given us fo 
authenticldy from the Scripture, is givitn from 
this very Rule, That the Inclination of his Heart, 
and the general Bent of his Pradice, was to ferve 
and obey his Great Sovereign Benefador, how- 
ever. 



[45 J 

ever, human Frailty, backed with Extremities oF 
Circumftances, or powerful Temptations, might 
betray him, to commit Adions which he v/ould 
not otherwife have done. The Falling into a Crime, 
will not denominate a Man difhoneft^ for huma- 
niim eft enare. The Charader of a Man ought 
to be taken from the general Tenour of his Be-- 
haviour, and from his allowed Pradice. David 
took the Shew-Bread from the Priefts, which it 
was not lawful for him to eat. David knew, that 
God, who commanded the Shew-Bread fhould not 
be eaten, had however commanded him by the Law 
of Nature, not to be ftarv'd ; and therefore, prefs'd 
by his Hi^inger,he ventures upon the Commandment. 
And the Scripture isvcryremarkableinexpreffing it, 
David 'ii^hen he ivas an hungry : And the Occafion for 
which our Blefled Lord himfelf quoted this Text, 
is very remarkable, viz.. to prove, that Things 
otherwife unlawful, may be made lawful by Ne- 
ceflity, Matth. -sXi, 4. 

Another Time, David in his PalHon refolves 
the Deflrudion of Nahal and all his Family,, 
which, without Doubt, was a great Sin; and 
the Principle which he went upon, tov:it^ Re- 
venge for his churlifli and fancy Anfwer to him, 
was ftill a greater Sin ; but the Temptation back^'d 
by the Strength of his Paffion, had the better of hini; 
at that Time : And this upright honefl: Man had 
murder'd Nahal and all his Houfe, if God had 
not prevented him. 

Many Infrances of like Nature the Scripture 
has left upon Record, giving Teflimony to the 
Charader of good Men, from the general Pradice 
and Bent or their Hearts, without leaving any 
Reproach upon them for particular Failings, tho^ 
thofe Sins have been extraordinary provoking, and 
in their Circumftaaces fcandalous enough. 



[ 4'i ] 

If any Man would be fo weak as from henefe 
to araw Encouragement to allow himfelf in eafy 
Trefpafles upon his Honefty, on the Pretence of 
Neceffities, let him go on with me to the fur- 
ther End of this Obfervation, and find room for 
it if he can. 

If ever the honeft Man I fpeak of, by what- 
foever Exigence or Weakncfs, thus flips from the 
Principle of his Integrity, he never fails to ex- 
prefs his own Diflike of it ; he acknowledges up- 
all Occalions, both to God and to Man, his 
having been overcome, and been prevailed upon 
to do, what he does not approve of,* he is too 
much afham'd of his own Infirmity, to pretend 
to vindicate the AdioUy and he certainly is re- 
ftor'd to the firft Regulation of his Principles, as 
foon as the Temptation is over. No Man is 
fonder to accufe him than he is to accufe himfelf j 
and he has always upon him the fincere Marks 
of a Penitent. 

'Tis plain from hence, that the Principle of 
the Man's Integrity is not deflroy'd, however, 
he may have fallen, tho' feven times a Day -9 
and I muft while I live reckon him for an honeft 
Man. 

Nor am I going about to fuppofe, that the Ex- 
tremities and Exigencies which have prefs'd Men 
of the beft Principles, to do what at another time* 
they would not do, make thofe Adions become 
lefs Sinful, either in their own Nature or Circum- 
ftances. The Guilt of a Crime with refped to 
its being a Crime, "viz.. an Offence againft God, is 
not removed by the Circumftances of Neceflity, 
It is without Doubt a Sin for me to fteal ano- 
ther Man's Food, rho' it was to fupply Starving 
Nature ; for how do I know whether he whofe 
Pood 1 ftc^i may not be in as much Danger of 

Starving 



[47] 

Starving for want of it, as I ; ancf if?iof, ^tis taking 
to my own Ufe what I have no Right to, and 
taking it by Force or Fraud ; and the Qaeftion 
is not as to the Right or Wrong, whether I have 
a NecelTity to eat this Man's Bread or no ; but 
whether it be his or my own ? If it be his, and 
not my own, 1 cannot do it without a manifefr 
Contempt of God's Law, and breaking the 
Eighth Article of it, "Thou ]h alt net Steal. ThiiS' 
as to God, the Crime h evident, let the Hecefllty/ 
be what it wilL 

But when we are confidenng human Nature 
fubjeded by the Confequences of Adam^ Tranf- 
greffion^ to Frailty and Infirmity ; and regarding 
things from Man to Man, the Exigencies and Ex- 
tremities of ftreightned Circumftances feem to 
me to be moft prevailing Arguments, why the 
Denomination of a Man's general Charader ought 
not, ^y his fellow Mortals (JubjeB to the fame 
Infirmities) to be gathered from his Miftakes, his 
Errors or Failings, ho not from his being guilty 
of any extraordinary Sin, but from the Mannet 
and Method of his Behaviour. Does he go on 
to commit Frauds, and make a Pradice of hh 
Sin? Is itaDiftrefs? Is it a Storm of AfHi(5tio\ 
and Poverty has driven him upon the Lee Shore 
of Temptation? Or is the Sin the Pore he fteer'd 
for ? A Ship may by Strefs of Weather be driven 
upon Sands and dangerous Places, and the Skill 
of the Pilot not be blameable , but he that runs 
againil: the Wind, and without any NeceiHty, 
Eipon a Shelve which he fees before him, muft do 
do it on purpofe to deflroy the Veflel, and ruinc- 
the Voyage. / 

In fhort, if no Man can be cali'd honeft, but / 
he who is never overcome, to fall into any Breach ' 
of this RecSitude of Life j none but he who 



[ 48: 



is fuiEciently fortified againfi all PofTibility oi 
being tempted by profpeds, or driven by Diftrefs, 
to make any Trefpafs upon his Integrity ; Woe be 
unto me that Write, and to moft that Read, where 
foall we find the honeft Man ? 

The Scripture is particularly expreflive of this 
in the T'he Righteous Man jalleth /even times 

a Day, and rifeth again. Why, this is very flrange, 
if a Man come, to commit feven Crimes in a Day, 
that isy many, for the Meaning is Indefinite, can 
this be an honefi: Man ? : What fays the World of 
him ? Hang him, he is a Knave, a Rafcal, a Dif- 
honell Fellow j this is the Judgment of Men : But 
in the Judgment of Scripture this may be a 
Righteous Man. 

The main Dcfign, of this Head and the proper 
Application of it is, to tell us we ought not be 
too hafly to Brand our Brother for his Sins, 
his Infirmities or Misfortunes, fnce he that is Dif- 
honeft in your Eyes, by a cafual or other Crime 
which he Commits, may rife from that Difafter 
by a fincere Repentance, and be to morrow an 
honefter Man than thy felf in the Eyes of his 
Maker. 

Bur here I am affaulted with another cenfo- 
rious honeft Man j here you talk cf falling to 
Day, and rifing again to Morrow i Sinn.'ng and 
Repenting; why here is a Fellow has cheated ms 
ot 500 /. and he comes canting to me of his Re- 
pentance, tells me he hopes God has forgiven 
him; and it would be hard for me to call to Re- 
membrance what God has wip'd out ; he is 
heartily forry for the Fault, and the like, and 
begs my Pardon, that is, begs my Eflate indeed : 
For what's all this to my Money, let him pay mc 
and I'll forgive him too ; God may forgive him 
rbe Sin, but rhac's nothing to my Debt. 

Why 



f49] 



why truly, in Anfwer to this in Paft, you are 
in the Right if the Man be able to make you any 
Satisfaction, and does not doit; for I queftfon 
nor, but every Trefpafs of this Nature requires 
Reflitution, as well as Repentance ; Reflirution as 
far as the polTible Power of the Party extends ; and 
i^ the lafl be not found, the firft is not likely to 
be fincere. 

But if the Man, either is not able to make you 
any Reflitution at all, or does make you Reftituti- 
on to the utmoft of his Capacity, and then comes 
and fays as before ; then the Poor Man is iii 
the Right, and you in the Wrong i for I make no 
Queflion like wife to afErm^ and could prove it by 
imanrwerable Arguments, He may be anHonefl Mati 
ivho cannot pay his Debts ^ but he cannot be an Honefi 
Man who can, and does not* 

Innumerable Accidents reduce Men from Plen- 
tiful Fortunes tb mean and low Circumftances ; 
fome procured by their own Vices and Intempe- 
rance, fome by Infirmities, Ignorance^ and meer 
tyrant of judgment to manage their Affairs": 
Some by the Frauds and Cheats of other Men^ 
fome by meef Cafualty and unavoidable Acci- 
dents, wherein the Sovereignty of Providence 
fhews us, that the Race is not to the Swift, or 
the Battle to the Strong, or Riches to Men of 
Underflandingi 

Firft, Some by Vices and Inteniperance are re- 
duced to Poverty and Diflrefs : Our Honefi Mai^ 
cannot fall in the Misfortunes of this Clafs, be-r 
caufe there the very Poverty is a Sin, being produc'a 
from a finful Caufe. As its far from being al- 
low'd, as ah Exeufe to a Muttherer, to fay he 
was in Drink, becaufe it is exeufing a Crime 
tvithaCrime: Safor a Man to ruin his For- 
tunes, as the Prodigal in the Gof|)elj .with riot- 

E ®us 



[ 50 3 

Oils Living, all the Effeds are wicked and dif- 
hoijeft, as they partake of the Difhonefly of the 
Caufe from whence they proceed : For he cannot 
be an honeft Man, who wants wherewith to pay 
his Debts, after having fpent what fliould have 
difcharg'd them, in Luxury and Debauches. 

Secondly^ Some by Ignorance and want of Judg- 
ment to manage their Affairs, are brought td 
Poverty and Diflrefs ; thefe may be honeft Men^ 
notwitiiftanding their VVeaknefs, for I won't un- 
dertake that none of our honeft Men ihall be 
Fools: 'Tis true the good Man, is the wife Many 
as to the main Part of Wifdom, which is in- 
cluded in his Piety, but many a Religious Man 
who would not do any Wrong wilfully to his 
Kei^hbour, is oblig'd at laft to injure both his 
own Family, and other People's, for want of DiP 
creti'onto guide him in his Aftairs, and to judge for 
himlelf : and therefore I dare not Tax all our 
Fools with beinc^ Knaves, nor will I fay but fuch a 
Man may be Honeft. Some will fay, but fuch 
a Man ftiould not venture into Bufinefs, which he 
is not able to manage, and therefore 'twas the 
Vice of his Un^derftanding, and like the Cafe in 
the firft Article, is excufing a Fault with a 
Fault. 

I cannot allow this for if I am askt why a 
Fool ventures into Trade, I anfwer, becaufe he 
is a Fool, not becaufe he is a Knave. 

' If Fools could their ovjn Ignorance difcerny 
they'd ht no loyiger Fools ^ becaufe they d learn. 

If you would convince a Man that he wants 
Difcretion, you muft give him Difcrcrion to be 
convinced : ""Till then he cannot know he has it 
not, becaufe he has ic not. No Man is anfwerable, 

either 



[51 ] 

either to God or Man, for that which he never 

was Mafler of: The moft proper Expreflion 

that ever I met with in this Nature, was of a 

certain Ideot or Natural, which a Gentleman 

of my Acquaintance kept in his Family, who 

being on his Death-Bed, was obferv'd to be very 

penfive, and much concerned about dying ; the 

Gentleman fent a Minifter to him, who as well 

as he could to his Underftanding, difcourfed with 

him about Death and Judgment to come ; the 

poor Creature who was hardly ever able to give 

a rational Anfwer to a Quefiion before, after 

hearing him very attentively, broke out into 

Tears with th is Expreflion ^ Ihat he hoped God would 

not require any "Thing of him^ that he had not given 

him Judgment to underfland. Whatever it may be 

as to the Soul, I am pofitive in the Cafe of human 

Affairs, no Man is anfwerable to Man for any 

more than his Difcretion ; Events are not in our 

Power, a Man may be nicely Honefl; in Life, tho' 

he may be weak enough in Judgment. 

Thirdly^ Some are ruinM, and are yet merely 
paflive, being either defrauded and cheated by 
Knaves, or plundered and rifled by Thieves, or 
by immediate Cafualties, as Fire, Enemies, Storms, 
Floods, and the like,* thefe arc Things which nei- 
ther touch the Man's Honefty, nor his Difcre- 
tion. Thus Job was by God's Permiflion and 
the Agency of the DqviI^ reduced in a Moment 
from a plentiful Eftate to be as naked as he 
came out of his Mother's Womb : I would fain 
ask thofe who fay, no Man can be an honeft 
Man i^ he does npt pay his Debts, who paid 
Job's Debts if heown'd any, and where was his 
Difiionefty, if he did not pay them ? I ftill rea- 
dily grant that he cannot be an honefl Man who 
docs not pay his Debts if he canj but ifother- 

£ 2 wife 



C 51 ] 

Wife, then the Words ought to be altered, affd 
they (hould fay, he cannot be an honeft Man 
who borrows any Money, or buys any Thing up- 
on his Credit, and this cannot be true* 

But fince I have led myfelf into the Argument, 
I cannot but make a fmaH DigreiTion concerning 
People who fail in Trade : I conceive the greateft 
Error of fuch is their Terror about Breaking, by 
which they are tempted while their Credit is 
good, tho^ their Bottom be naught, to pufh far- 
ther in i expeding, or at leaft hoping, by the Pro- 
fits of fome happy Voyage, or fome lucky Hit, 
as they call it, to retrieve their Circumftances, 
and Hand their Ground. 

I . muft confefs, I cannot vindicate the Honefiy 
of this ; for he, who knowing his Circumftances 
to be once naught, and his Bottom worn out ; 
ought not in Juflice to enter into any Man's Debt ; 
for Then he Trades on their Rifque, not on his 
own, and yet Trades for his own Profits, not 
theirs ; this is not fair, becaufe he deceives the 
Creditor, who ventures his Eftate on that Bot- 
tom which he fuppofes to be good, and the o- 
ther knov/s is not. Nay, tho' he really pays 
this Creditor, he is not honefl: ; for in Confci- 
encc, his former Creditors had a Right to all 
his Effeds, in Proportion to their Debts j and if 
he really pays one all, ahd the reft but a Share, 
''tis a Wrong to the whole. 

I would therefore advife all Tradefmen, who 
find their Circumftances declining, as foon, at 
ieaft, as they firft difcern themfclves to be unca- 
pable of paying their Debts, if not, while yet 
they can pay every one all, make a full Stop, 
and call all People together ; if there is enough 
ro pay them all, let them have it, if not, let 
them have their juft Shares of it ,* by this Means 
- - -^ you 



r 5^ ], 

you "\\'ill certainly have God's Blcflinj^, and the 
Cluracter of an honeft Man, left to begin again 
with ; and Creditors are often prevail'd with, in 
Confideration of fuch a generous Honcfty, to 
tiirow back fomething to pat fuch a Man in a 
Pofture to Jive again ^ or by hirther voluntary Cre- 
dit and Friendfhip, to uphold hirn. This is much 
better alfo with rcfpeft tolntereft, as well as Ho- 
nefty, than to run on to ^11 Extremities, till the 
Burthen falls too heavy, either for Debtor or 
Creditor to bear : This woiild prevent many of 
the Extremities, which, I fay, puts the Honefty 
of a Man to fo extraordinary a Tryal. 

An honefl Principle would certainly didate to 
the Man, if it were confulted with, that when 
he knows he is not able to pay, it is not lawful 
for him to borrow. Taking Credit is a Promife 
of Payment ; a Promife of Payment is tacitly 
underftood, and he cannot be honefl who promifes 
what he knows he cannot perform, as I fhall 
«ote more at large on another Head. But if the 
Man be paid, yet it was not an honefl Adj 
'twas deceiving the Man, and making hmi run a 
greater Rifque than he knew of, and fuch a Rifque 
as he would not have run, had he known your 
Circumflances and Bottom, as you do i fo that 
here is Deceit upon Deceit. 

This I know is a difputed Point, and a Thing 
which a great many pradife, whopafs for very ho- 
nefl Men in the World ; but I like it not the better 
for that j I am very pofitive^ that he who takes 
my Goods on the Foot of his Credit, when if 
he Ihould <^y^ the next Day, he knows his Eflate 
will not pay me five Shillings in the Pound j 
tho' he fhould not dye, but ^es pay me at the 
Time appointed, is as much guilty of a Fraud, 
as if he adually robb'd my Houfe. Credit is a 
E 3 received 



C^4] 

rcceivM Opinion of a Man's Honefty and Abili- 
ty, lus Willi ngnefs to pay, and his having where- 
with CO pay; and he who wants either of thefe, 
his Credit is lame. Men won^t fell their Goods 
to a litigious quarrelfome Man, tho' he be never 
fo rich, nor to a needy Man, tho* he be never 
fo honeft. Now, if all the World believe I 
am honefl and able, and I know I am not the 
laft, I cannot be the firft, if I take their Goods 
upon Credit ; 'tis vain to pretend, Men Trade 
upon the general Rifque of Mens Appearance, 
and the Credit of common Fame, and all Men 
have an equal Hazard. I fay no : Men may ven- 
ture their Eflates in the Hands of a flourilhing 
Bankrupt, and he by Virtue of his yet unfliaken 
Credit is trufled,* but he cannot be honefl that 
takes this Credit, becaufe he knows his Circum- 
ftances are quite otherwife than they are fup- 
posM to be, that the Man is deceived, and he is 
privy to the Deceit. 

This DigreiTion is notfo remote from the pur- 
pofe, as I expeded, when I began it ; the Honefty 
that I am fpeaking of, chiefly refpeds Matters 
of Commerce, of whch Credit and Payment of 
Debt are the moft confiderable Branches. 

There is another Article in Trade, which 
many very honefl Men have made familiar to 
themfelves, which yet I think, is in no Cafe to 
be defended ; and that is relating to Counterfeit 
Money. Cuflom, before the old Money was 
fiipprefs'd in England, had prevailed fo far upon 
Honefly, that I have feen fome Men put all their 
Brafs Money among their runing Cafh, to be told 
over in every Sum they paid, in Order to have 
fomebody or other take it; I have heard many 
People own they made no Scruple of it, but I 
could never find them give one good Reafon to 
juflify the Honefly of it. Firfl, 



C 55 ] 

Firfty They fay it comes for Money, and it 
ought to go fo: To which I Anfwer, that is 
juft as good a Reafon as this : A has cheated me, 
and therefore I may Cheat B. If I have receiv- 
ed a Sum of Money for good, and knowing not 
that any of it is otherwife, offer it in Payment to 
another : This is Juft and Honefl: ,* but, if on this 
other Man's teliingit over, he returns mc a Piece 
of Brafs or Counterfeit Money which I change 
again, ^nd afterwards knowing this to be fuch, 
otter the fame Piece to another : I know no worfe 
Fraud in its Degree in the World, and I doubt 
pot to prove it fo beyond Coiitradidion. 

If the £rfl: Perfon did not take this Piece of 
Money, it was becaufe being both watchful an4 
skilful, he could difcpver it i and if I offer it 
to another 'tis with an Expectation, that he being 
either lefs watchful or lels skillful, fhali overlook 
it, and fo I (hall make an Advantage of my 
Neighbour's Ignorance, pr w^nt of Care. 

Til put fome parallel Cafes to this, to illuflrate 
it : Suppofe a blind Man comes into a Shop to 
buy Goods of me, and giving me a Guinea to 
change, I fhall give him the Remainder in bad Mo- 
ney ; \^^uld not every Body (ay 'twas a barbarous 
Thing ? Why the other is ail one, for if the Perfoa 
be ignorant of Money, he is blind as to the Point 
in Hand; and nothing can be more unfair thaq 
to take the Advantage. 

Suppofe again a young Boy, or a Servant new- 
ly entred in Trade, is fent to buy Goods, and 
by his Mafler's Order, he asks for fuch a Com-r 
modity ; and you prefuming upon the Rawnefs 
of the Meffenger, deliver a Sort of a meaner 
Qiiality, and take the full Price of him; woul4 
you grudge to be ufed fcurvily for fuch a Tricks 
Why, no lefs or better is Offering Brafs for Silver, 

E 4 pre--' 



[ 5^ ] 

prefuming only the want of Care or Skill in the 
Receiver, (hall pafs it unobferv'd. 

Ay, but fays a learned Tradefman who would be 
thought honefter than ordinary ; I alwiays change 
it again, if it be brought back : Yes Sir, fo does a 
Pick-Pocket give you your Handkerchief again 
when you have faflen'd on him, and threaten^ hiin 
with the Mob. The Matter in ft or t is this; if 
the Man whom you have cheated, can cheat no 
Body elfe, then no Thanks to you j when he 
comes to you, and charges the Fraud upon yoir, 
you*ll make Satsfaclion, becaufe if you won'r^ 
the Law will compel you to it. • 

Bwt if the Fraud may be carried on, as you 
are manifeflly willing> confenting, and inflrumeu' 
tal in it that it fhould ; behold the Confequence, 
year firft fin againft Honefly is multiplied in all 
the Hands thro' whom this Piece of bad Money 
knowingly fo paffes, till at laft it happens to go 
fingle to a poor Man that can't put it off, and 
the Wrong and Injury may iffue where it was 
wanted to buy Bread for a ftarving Family. 

All the Excufes I could ever meet with could 
never fatisfy me, that it can conlift with Honefty, 
to put Brafs or Copper away for Gold or Silver, 
any mor€ than it v/ould, to give a blind Meflen-^ 
ger Sand inflead of Sugar, or brown Bread inftead 
of whitCo

0/ H o N E 5 T Y in Promifes. 

Man is known by his Wordy and an Ox by 
hts Horns, fays an old Engl/Jb ProvQvb. 
If I underftand the true Meaning of it^ 
'tis, that theHonefty of a Man is known 
)y his pLin(Sual obferving his Word, as naturally 
and plainly as any Creature is known by the 
moft obvious Diftin&ion. 'Tis the peculiar 
Quality of an honeft Man, the diftinguifhing 
Mark to know him by. His Word or Promife is 
as facred to him in all his Affairs in the World, 
as the ftrpngeft Obligation which can be laid oti 
him; nor is it a Thing formed by him from fet- 
tled Refolutions, or Meafures of Pohcy taken 
up of courfe to raife or fix his Reputation ; but 
^cis the native Produce of his honefl: Principle : 
''Tis the Confequence, and his Honefty is the 
Caufe; he ceafes to be Honeft, when he ceafes 
to preferve this folemn Regard to his Word. 

If he gives his Word, any Man may depend 
upon it, for the Safety of his Life or Eftate ; he 
fcorns to prevaricate or fhift himfelf off from the 
pundual Obfervance of it, tho' it be to his Lofs. 
■ I can't abate an honeft Man an Inch in the pun- 
dual Obfervance of a Promife made upon Parole, 
if it be in the Man's poflible Power to perfornl 
it, beeaufe there feems to be fomething too bafe 
to confift with Honefty in the very Nature of a 
Man that can go back from his Word. 

The Reverence our Anceftors paid to their 
Promifes^ or Word paft^ I am of the Opinion,, 
i ^^. • ^ ; .-i '. i i- ^ ■ ■' ■ - gave 



[58] 



gave th^t remarkable Brand of Infamy ^nd Scan- 
dal upon the AtFroiit of giving the Lie ; a Gentle- 
man-, which isy in fliprt, the modern Term for an 
honefi Man^ or, a M^n of Honour, p annot receive 
a greater Reproach, than to be told, he lies-, that 
is, that be forfeits his Wprd, breaj^s his Veraci- 
ty I for the Minute he does that, he ungentlemans 
himfelf, difgraces the Blood qf his Family, de- 
generates from his Anceftors, and commences 
Rake, Scoundrel, and any Thing. 

Some People, who have run their Ppints of Ho- 
nour to the Extreams, are of the Opinion, that 
this Affront of the Lie ought not to be given to 
any Thing thfy call a Gentleman, or that calls 
himfelf fo, till he has fo far expofed himfelf to 
ail other Degrees of Infamy, as to bc^r Kicking, 
or Caning, and the like y that after this, when h^ 
breaks his Word, he may be told, he liesy or any 
Thing elfe ,• but till then, the very Thing it felf 
is fo intolerable an Abufe, that the Perfon who 
ventures to trefpafs fo foully on the Rules of good 
Manners, deferves not the Honour of fair Play 
for his Life : But as fome Beafls of Prey are refu- 
fed the fair Law of the Field, and are knock'd 
down in every Hedge > fo thefe, like Bullies and 
meer Rakes, may be piftola in the Dark, an4 
ftabb'd at the Corner of an Alley ; that is to fay, 
any Meafure may be ufed with them, to difmifs 
them from the Society of Mankind, as Fellows 
not futferable in the Common-wealth of good 
Manners. 

I do not argue for thefe Extremes ; but I inr 
nance in this, to teftify the Veneration all good 
Men have for the Word or Promife of an honeft 
Manjand theEfteem which thelntegrity of theMind 
exprefs'd by a zealous Regard to the Words of 
the Mouth, have obtained in the World. The 

French, 



I 59 ] 

Frenchy when they exprefs themfelves in Vindic^-' 
tion of their Honour, always bring it about by 
this, Je fids Jdomme de Parole^ I am an honcft 
Man, or a Man of ray Word; that is, I am a 
Man that may be trufted upon my Paroje ; for I 
never break my Word. 

Such was the Value put upon the Promifes of 
Men in former Time, that a Prom ife of Payment 
of Money was recoverable in our Courts by Law, 
till the Incpnveniencies proved To many, that an 
Ad was made on Purpofe to reflrain it to a Sum 
under ten Pounds : But to this Day, if a Man 
promifes Marriage to a Woman, efpecially if fhe 
has granted him any Favours upon that Condition, 
the Laws of the Land, which therein have Re- 
gard to the Laws of Honour, will oblige him to 
jnake it good, and allow it to be a fufficient Pie^ 
to. forbid his marrying with any body elfe, 

There are innumerable Inilances of the Vene- 
ration all Nations pay to the expreilive Article of 
human Veracity. In the War, you meet with 
frequent Inftances of Prifoners difmifs'd by a ge- 
nerous Enemy, upon their Parole, either to pay 
their Ranfom, or to procure fuch or fuch Condi- 
tions or come back and Surrender themfelves Pri- 
foners; and he that fhould forfeit this Parole, 
wou'd be pofted in the Enemy's Army, and hifb'd 
out of his own* 

I know nothing a wife Man would not chufe 
to do, rather than by breaking his Word, give 
the World fuch an undeniable Teilimony of his 
being a Knave : This is that good Name which 
Solomon fays ts better than Life, and is a precious 
Ointment, and •which, when a Man h(M once lofl, he 
has nothing left ivorth keeping. A Man may even 
hang himfelf out ofthe V/ay j for no Man that 
looks like a Man, will keep his Company. 

WkQn 



[do J 

When a Man has once cc*ne to breaking his 
Wordj no Man, that has any Value for his Re^ 
putation, eares to be Teen in his Gompany ; but all 
good Menlhun him, as if he- were infeded with 
the Plague. - -- - 

There are Men indeed, whd will 'be exceeding 
pundual to their Words and Prorrlifes, xvho yet 
cannot be call'd honeft Men, becaufe -they have 
other Vices and Excurlions that render them other 
Ways wicked : Thefe give their Teftimony to 
the Beauty of Honefty, by chafing it ais the beft 
Mask to put a Glofs upon their Adions, and con- 
ceal the other Deformities of their Lives ^ and fa 
Honefly, like Religion, is made Ufe oF to dif- 
guife the Hypocrite, and raife a Reputation upon 
the Shadow, by the Advantage it takes of the 
real Efleem the World has of the Subi]:ance : I fay 
of this Counterfeit-Hoiiefty, as is faid of Religi- 
on in like Cafes. If Honefty was not the mod ex- 
cellent Attainment, 'twould not be made Ufe of 
as fhe moil fpecious Pretence ; nor is there a more 
exquiiite Way for a Man to play the Hypocrite, 
than to pretend an extraordinary Zeal to the 
performance of his Promifes ; becaufe, when the 
Opinion of any Man's Honefty that Way, has 
fpread in the Thoughts of Men, there is nothing 
fo great,' but they will truft him with, nor fo 
hard, but they will do it for him. 
' All Men reVerence'ah honeft Man ; the Knaves 
(land in Awe of hi tn. Fools adbre him, and wife 
Men love' him; and thus is Virtue its own Re- 
ward. ..,.-.' ^ ^ •' ■ 

Honeft Men are in more Danger from this one 
Hypocrite, than'from 20 open Knaves ; for thefe 
have a Mark plac'd upon them by their general 
Character, as a Buoy upon a Rock to warn Stran- 
gers from venturing upon it : But theHypocritesare 

■ -■ like 



[ ^I ] 

like a Pit cover'd over, like Shoals under Water, 
and Danger conceal'd which cannot be feen. I 
muft confefs, I have found thefe the moft dan- 
gerous, and have too deeply fuftet'd by throwing 
my felf on their Proteftations of Honefly : The 
Efleem I always enrertain'd of the moft beautiful 
Gift God has beftow^d, or Man could receive, has 
made me the eafier to be deceived with the Re- 
femblance of it. 

So much as I, or any one elfe, by the Vitiouf- 
nefs of our own Nature, or the prevailing Force of 
Accidents, Snares, and Temptations, have devia- 
ted from this fhining Principle, fo far we have been 
foolifb, as well as wicked ; fo much we have to 
repent of towards our Maker, and be afham'd of 
towards our Neighbour. 

For my Part, I am never backward to own, 
let who will be the Reader of thefe Sheets, that 
to the Difhonour of my Maker, and the juft Scan- 
dal of my own Honefty, 1 have not paid that due 
Regard to the Reditude of this Principle, which 
my own Knowledge has own'd to be its due ,* let 
thofe who have been jufter to themfelves, and 
to the Giver of it, rejoice in the Happinefs, ra- 
ther than triumph over the Infirmity. 

Bat let them be fure, they have been juilcr on 
their own Parts; let them be pofitive, that their 
own Integrity is untainted, and would abide all 
the Tryais and Racks, that a ruin'd Fortune, 
fcrong Temptations, and. deep Diftrefl'es, could 
bring it into : Let them not boaft till thefe Dan- 
gers are pad, and they put their Armour off; and 
if they can do it then, I will freely acknowledge, 
they have lefs need of Repentance than I. 

Not that I pretend, as I noted before, and 
fhaii often repeat, that thefe Circumitances ren- 
der my Failing, t)r any Man's elfe, the lefs a Sin, 

but 



but they make the Reafon,, Why we that have 
fallen, ihould rather be pity^ than reproached by 
thofe who think they ftand -, becaufe, when the 
fame AlTaults are made upon the Chaftity of 
their Honoi;r, it may be every jot as likely to be 
profHtuted as their Neighbours. 

And fuch is the Folly of Scandal, as well as 
the Blindnefs of Malice, that it feldom fixes Re- 
proach upon the right Foot : I have feen fo much 
of it, Vith refped toother People,' as well 
as my felfj that it gives me a very fcoundrel Opi- 
nion of all thofe People whom I find forward to 
load their Neighbours with Reproach. Nothing 
is more frequent in this Cafe, than to run away 
with a Piece of a Man's Charader, in which 
they err, and do him Wrong ; and leave that Part 
of him untouched which is really black, and 
would bear it ; this makes me fometimes, 
when with the humblefl and moft abafing 
Thoughts of my felf, I look up, and betwixt 
God and my own Soul, cry out. What a Wretch 
am II at the fame time fmile at the hair-brain'd 
Enemy, whofe Tongue tipt with Malice, runs a- 
head of his Underftanding, and miffing the Crimes 
for which I deferve more than he can inflid, re- 
proaches me with thofe I never committed. Me- 
thinks I am ready to call him back, like the 
Huntfman, when the Dogs run upon the Foil, and 
fay, hold, hold, your are wrongs take him here^ 
and you have him. 

I quelliion not but ^tis the fame with other Peo- 
ple *, for when Malice is in the Heart, Reproach 
generally goes a Mile before Confidcration, and 
where is the Honefty of the Man all this while ? 
Tills is trampling upon my Pride, fed majo" 
ri faftu ; but with greater Pride ; 'tis expofing my 
Difhonefty, but with the highciT: Knavery ; 'tis 



a Method no honeft Man will take, atid \V"heii 
taken, no hdneft Man regards; wherefore, let 
none of thefe Sons of Slander take Satisfa(5tion in the 
frequent Acknowledgments I am always ready to 
make of my own failing, for that Humility with 
which I always find Caufe to look into my own 
Heart^where 1 fee others worfe^ and more guilty of 
Crimes than they can lay to my Charge, yet makes 
me look back upon their Weaknefs with the laft 
Contempt, who fix their impotent Charges where 
there is not Room to take hold, and run away 
with the Air, and Shadow of Crimes never com- 
mitted. 

I have inftanc'd thiSj not at all on my own 
Account^ for 'tis not worth while ; for if I am 
injur'd, what's that to troubling the World with, 
when I am forgotten ; but while I am examin- 
ing the niceft Article in the World, Honefiy, I car^ 
hot but lay down thefe three Heads from the pre- 
ceding Obfervations. 

1. He 'who is forward to reproach the Infirnuties 
of other Mens Honefiy^ is very near a Breach of 
his own. 

2. He that hdflily reproaches another without fufz- \ 
dent Ground^ cannot be an honefl Man, 

3. Where there may he fufficient Ground of Reproach y 
yet an honeft Man is always tender of his Neigh- 
bour s CharaBer- from the Senfe of hts own 
Frailty, 

But I return to Honcfiy, as it affecls a Man's 
pledging his Word, which is the Counter-part of 
his Principle, and this becaufe as I faid, I (hould 
chiefly regard this Honefty, as it concerns human 
Af&irs Converfation^ and Negotiation. 

And 



[^4] 



And here I meet with a Tradefman com? 

juft ir\ from dunning one of his Neighbours i 

Well, I have been at a Place for Montyy fajshe^ buf 

lean get none ; there's fiich a one, he pafles for ari 

honeft Man, but I am fure he is a great Rogue to 

me, for he has promifed me my Money a long 

Time, but puts me off ftill from Time to Time ; 

he makes no more of breaking his Word, than 

of drinking a Glafs of Beer. I am fure he has 

told me forty Lies already ; this is one of yout 

honeft Men, if all fuchhoneftMen were hang a we 

fhould have a better Trade ; and thus he runs on. 

If all fuch honeft Men were hang'd, they that 

were left might have a better Trade, but how 

many of them would there be? 

Now tho' I fhall no Way vindicate Mens hafty 
Promifes abfolutely to perform what is doubtful 
in the Event, yet I cannot agree, that every Man 
who having promised a Payment, does not per- 
form it, to his Time, is a Knave ora Lyar ; if it 
were fo, the Lord have Mercy upon three Parts 
of the City. 

Wherefore, to ftate this Matter clearly, it muft 
be taken a little to Pieces^ and the Articles fpo- 
ken to apart. 

Firft, V/ithout Queftion, when a Man makes a 
Promife of Payment to another on a fee Day, know- 
ing in his own Thoughts that it is not probable he 
Ihould be capable to comply with it, or really 
defigning not to comply with it, or not endea- 
vouring to comply with it : 'Tis a Deceit put 
upon the Party, 'tis a premeditated fortnal Lye^ 
the Man that made it is a Stranger to Honefty, 
he is a Knave, and every Thing that is bafe and 
bad. But 

Secondly, Promifes ought to be underftood both 
by the Perfon to whom, and the Perfon by whom, 

they 



[<^5 3 



they are made as liable to thofe Contingencies 
that all human Affairs and Perfons are liable to,' 
as Death, Accidents, Difappointments, and Dii- 
order: Thus, if a Man, who ought to pay me 
to Day, tdlsme. Sir, I cannot comply with you 
to Day, but if you call for it next Week, you fhall 
have it. ^" 

If I may put this Anfwer into phincr Englifh ; and 
I fuppofe the Man to be an honeil Man ; I cannot 
underftand his Meaning otherwife than thus : 

" Sir, I acknowledge your Money is due ; 
** I have not Cafh enough by me to pay you to 
*' Day ; but I have feveral running Bills, and fe- 
*^ veral Perfons who have promifed me Money, 
^' which I doubt not I fhall receive againft fuch a 
** Time ; and if you call then, I make no Que- 
*' ftion, but I fhall be able to do it, and if it is 
^' pofTible for me to pay you, I will do it at that 
*^ Time, withoat Fail. 

I con^efs, it were as well to exprcfs themfelves 
thus at large, in all the Appointments People make 
for Payment ; and would the Perfons who make 
them confider it, they would do fo : But Cuftom 
has prevailed in our general Way of Speaking, 
whereby all Things that a^e fubjed to the com- 
mon known Contingents of Life, or vifible in the 
Circumftances of the Cafe, are underftood without 
being expreffed. For Example : 

I make an Appointment of meeting a Man po- 
iitively at fuch a Town, fuch a certain Day or 
Hour ; if I were talking to a Turk or a Pagan that 
knows nothing, or believes nothing, of Supreme 
Providence ; I would fay. If the Lord of Heaven 
niid Earth that governs all my ABionsy pleafe ta fre* 
je^ve and permit 777e: But when I am talking to as 
Chriftian, it fliouid feem to be fo iiniverfally fup- 
pgfcd^ th?.-t even' Appointment is fiibjefied, and 

F fubmii: 



fubmits to the Government of Providence, that the 
Repetition would be needlefs; anH that v^hen a 
Man promifes politively to meet, 'tis with a general 
Suhinteliigitur^ a Referve as natural as Nature it 
felf, to the Divine PermiiTion : All Men know, that 
unlefs I ani alive, 1 cannot come there r or, if 1 
am taken fick, both which may eafily^ happen y 
I fhall difappoint him : And therefore) if he fhouM 
urge me again to come without Fail, and I fhould 
reply, I won't fail, -if 1 am alive and well, the 
Man ought to take it for an Affront, and ask me,' 
if I take him for a Fool, to think, if I am taken 
fick, I Ihould come with my Bed ac my Back ; or 
if Death fhould interveen, he ^2A^p^(;(^2X\o\\ to 
fpeak with my Ghofr. •'.•Si .!- 

In this Senfe, a Tradefman who promires Pay- 
ment of Money at a fet Time ; firft 'tis fuppo- 
fed he has it not now in his Hands, becaufe h^ 
puts off the Perfon demanding to a further Day^ 
and promifes to comply with it then : This Pro- 
mife therefore, can be underftood ho otherwife, 
than that he expects to receive Money by that 
Tmie : Now, if this Man, by the like Difap- 
pointments from other Men, or any other invo- 
luntary Cafualty, , is really and bona fide unable 
to comply with the Time of promifed Payment ; 
I cannot fee, but this, may befal an hpneft Man,| 
and he neither defigning to fail when he promi-^ 
fed, noir.being able to prevent the Accident that 
oblig'A hini -to d0;it, nor any way voluntary in the 
IBreach, is npt in my Opinion guilty of a Lie, or 
Breach, of his Honour,, tho' he did not make 
thofc;. yet bill Referves m the Promifes he had 
given. , i, rv . 

^ If every Mali, who , cannot comply with pro- 
mifed Payments, fhould be thus branded with 
i-ying.And-Diflioneftya then let him, who is 

without 



[-571] 



without the Sin, caft the Stone, fot no body 
elfe ought to do it. 

^Tis true, tijere is a Difference between an 
Accident, and a Practice i that is in fliort, there 
is a Difference between him who meets with a 
great many Occasions thus to break his Word^ 
and he that meets with but a few : But if it be 
a Crime, he that commits it ODce^ is. no more an 
honeft Man, than he that commits it forty Times ; 
^nd if it be not a Crime, he that does it forty 
Times, is as honeflas.he that has Occalion to cjo 
it but once. " . . ' 

But let no Man take Encouragement from hence, 

to be prodigal of his Word, and (lack in Ijis Per- 

•formance ;. for this nice Path is fo near the Edge 

of the Pit of Knavery, that the leaft Slip lets you 

fall in. 

Thefe Promifes muft have Abundance of Cit'* 
cumftances to bring the honeft Man out of the 
Scandal. 

As, ifl. ThePifappointments which occafioneti^ 
this Breach of his Word, muft have been vAi^ 
forefeen, and unexpected, otherwife the Ex- 
pedation of performing his Promifej.was ill 
grounded, and then his HoneRy is anrwe-" 
table for the very making the Promife, as 
well as the breaking it. 

2d. No Endeavours muft be wanting to com^ 
ply with the Promife; otherwife 'tis wrong 
to fay, lam difappointed, and can^c make 
good my Word j the Man ought to fay, Sir, 
I have difappointed my felf by my Negli- 
gence or Wiifulnefs, and have oblig'd my

v/hiqh I mio^ht have performed, I took no 
Fa Care 



[d8] 

Care about it, not valuing the Porfeiture of 
my Word. 

If then the Cafe is (o niee^ tho' in the Stri^- 
nefs of Speaking, fuch a Difappointment may 
oblige an honed Man to break h'.s Word ; yet 
every honeft Man, who would preferve that Cha- 
ra&r to himfelfi ought to be the more wary, and 
induftrioufly avoid making fuch abfolute uncon- 
ditional Promifes, beeaufe we are to avoid the 
Circumdances of Offence. 

But as to the Nature of the Thing, 'tis plain to 
me, that a Man may in fuch Cafes be obliged to 
break his Word unwillingly ,' and nothing can be 
a Fraud or difhoneft Action in that Cafe, which is 
not either voluntary in it felf, or the Occafion 
voluntarily procured. 

Relative Honesty. 

S Honefty is fimple and plain, with- 
out Glofs and Pretence, fo *ti$ univer- 
fal : He that rtiay uphold an untainted 
Reputation in one Particular, may be 
juftly branded with Infamy in another. A Man 
may be pundual in his Dealings^ and a Knave 
in his Relations ; honefl in his Ware-houfe, and 
a Knave at his Fire-iidei He rhay be a Saint in 
his Company, a Devil in his Family,- true to his 
Word, and falfe to his Friendship : But whofoe- 
ver he be, he is no hor.efl Man. An honefl 
Man is all of a Piece, the whole Contexture of 
his Life, his general Condud is genuine, and 
fquar'd according to the Rules of Honefly ; he 
never runs into Extcemcs and Exccffes on one 
Hand or other., 

I con- 




t^9l 



/ I confefs, I find 'tjiis Thing, which they call 
' Heiative Honefly^ very little thought of in the 
World ; and that which is ilill worfc, \'\s very lit- 
tle iinderllood : Til bring it down to but a few 
Examples ; fomc of which frequently happen a- 
mong us, and wijl therefore be the more familiar- 
ly ^eceiv'd. 

There are relative ObligatiQns entaifd on us 
in pur Family Circumftances, which are juft 
pfbrs, and mufl be paid ,• and which, in a Word, 
a Man can no more be honeft, i^ he does not make 
Confciencc of Difcharging, than he can in the 
Cafe of the mofl: unqueftionable Debts between 
Man and Man. 

The Debts from Children to Parents, and from 
yivjQS to their Husbands, are in a Manner re* 
lativ^ly chang'd, and the Obligation transferr'd 
Jnto the Order of religious Duties. God the 
Guide and Commander of all Subordination, has 
as it were> taken that Part into his own Hand ; 
'tis rather call'd a Duty to him, than a relative 
Duty only : But if Men take this for a Difcharge 
to them, pf all relative O ligations to Wives and 
to Children, or that God had lefs required one 
than the other, they mufl aft upon very wrong 
Principles. 

Nature indeed diftates in general a Man's 
providing Subfiftence for his Family, and he is 
declared to be fo far from a Chriftian, that he i^ 
worfe than an Infidel that negleds it : But there 
are other Parts of our Obligations, which Ho- 
nefty calls upon us to perform. 

A Wife and Children are Creditors tp the Fa- 
ther of the Family j and he cannot be atv lickneft 
Man that does not difcharge his Debt to them, 
any more than he could, if he did not repiiy Mo- 
qey borrowed, to a Stranger i and not to lead my 
^ } ^ Readev 



Reader on to intricate and difputed Particulars,* 
I inftance principally in rhofe that no body catr 
difpute : As Firfiy E D U C A T I ON : By this 
I mean, not only putting Children to School; 
which Come Parents think, is all they havx to dd 
with or for their Children ; and indeed with fome: 
is all that they know how to do, or are fit to 4o? 
I fay,. I do not mean this only, but feveral other 
additional Cares, as (i.) Direding what School,^ 
what Parts of Learning, is proper for them, livha^ 
Improvements they are to be taught. (2.) Study- 
ing the Genius and Capacities of their Childrerjj 
in what they teach them : Some Children will vo-^ 
luntarily learn one Thing, and can never be forc'd 
to learn another'^ and for Want of wlrich obferving 
the Genius of Children, we have ^o many learned 
BiQckheads in the World, who are mere Scholars, 
Pedants, and no inore. (3.) But the main Part of 
this Debt, which Relative Honefty calls upon us 
to pay to our Children, is the Debt oflnftrudion, 
th^ Debt of Government, the Debt, of Example : 
He that negledsVo pay any of theft, to his Fami- 
ly, is a relative Knave '^ let him' X^alue himfelf 
upon his Honerty, in paying his other Debts', 
as fniVch as he wilt. '" *'^''^ .' 

'Tis a flrange Notion Men have of 'Honefty, 
and of their being honeilMen,as if it related to no- 
thing but Tradefmen, or Men who borrow and 
lend ; or that the Title was obtain^ by an ordi- 
nary Obfervance of Right and Wrong between 
Man and Man. " ^Tis a great Miftake, thejName 
of an honeft Man is neither ,fo ealily gain'd, or (b 
fbcn lofl, as thefe Men imagine. David was a 
very honeft Man, nocwithftanding his Paffion and 
Revenge in the Cafe o^Nabaly his Murther in the 
Cafc.of C7/7Vz/;, or his Adi l:ery in the Cafe oiBatb^ 
field. The Intent and main Delign of his Lite 

was 



■C-^yii] 



was uprtglit ; and whenever he fell by the Power 
of that Tennptation that overcame him, he rofe 
again by Repentance. ^*: _- 

Let no vain Men fiUttep'riiemfeJves witli tli^ 
Pride of their Honeftyj ifi mere Matters of O^hjtor 
and Creditor, tho' that's ai To abfolutejyiiecefiary 
^and effen tial to an honefl Man. 4> io ?!?:jr ; 

But trace this honeft Man home to his'Earfiily : 
Is he a Tyrant or a Churl to his Wife ? Is he a 
Stranger to the Condud and Behaviour of his 

: Children ? Is he an Eli to tlleir Vices ? Are they 
uninftruded, uncorrected, unexhorted, ungover- 
ned, or ill governed ? That Man's a Knave^ 2.:x^' | 

* lati Ve Knave ; he neither does his Duty to Go(d, j 
pr pays the Debt of a Husband, or of a Parent to ^ 

' his Witc^or his Familyl-'^ '-^-' ^^ <^^r"'- ./-;-• / 
Secondly, After the Debtof fi D U C A^T I G N, 

'there is the "Debt of INDUCTION due 
from us to our Children. ' The Debt from a Pa- 
rent is far from ending when the Children come 
from School, as the Brirteswho turn their Toung 
off from them v/hen they are jufl: able to pick for 
therafelves : It is our Bulinefs,doubtlefs,to introduce 
them into the World, and to do it in fuch a manner, 
as /uits the Circumftmices we "are in, as. to their 
Supply, and the Inclinations -and Capaciiies of 
our Children : This is 'a 'Debt, the Want, of pay- 
ing which, makes many Children too juftly re- 
proach their Parents with neglecting them in their 
Youth, and not giving them the neceiiary Intro- 
dudioninto the World, as might have qualify 'd 
them to ftruggle and fhifc for themfelves. 

^' Not to do this, istoruine our Children nega- 
tii^ely on one Hand, as doing it without Judgnient^ 

' and without Regard to our Family Circumftan- 

' ces, and our Childrens Capacities, is a pofitive 

ruiping them on the other. 1 could very ufefully 

" F 4 ruh| 



C70 

run out this Part into a long Difcourfe on the Ne- 
ceility thereis of confulting the Inclinations and 
Capacities of our Children, in our placing them 
out in the World. How many a martial Spirit do 
we find damn'd to Trade, while we fpoil many a 
good Porter, and convert the able Limbs and 
Bones of a Blockhead into the Figure of a long 
Robe, or a Gown and Calfock ? 

How many awkward dumfy Fellows do we 
breed to Surgery, or to Mufick, whofe Fingers 
and Joints, Nature dliginally deiign'd, and plain- 
ly fiiew'd it us by their Size, were better fuited 
for the Blackfmith's Sledge, or the Carpenters 
Axe, the Waterman^'s Oar, 6r the Carma(h*s 
Whip? 

Whence comes it to pafs, that we have fo many 
young Men brought to the Bar, and to the Pul- 
pit, with Hammering Tongues ; Hefitations, and 
Impediments in th^ir Speech, unmuiical Voices, 
and no common Utterance ; while on the other 
Hand, Nature's Cripples, Bow-]egg'd, Battle- 
ham'd, and half-made Creatures, are bred Tum- 
blers and Dancing-Maflers. 

I name thefe, becaufe they occur moft in our 
common Obfervation, and are all miferable Ex- 
amples, where the Children curfe the Knavery of 
their Fathers, in not paying the Debt they ow'd 
to them as Parents, in putting them to Employ- 
ments that had been fuitable to their Capacities, 
and fuitable to what Nature had cut them out for. 

I came into a publick Houfe once in LondvUy 
where there was a black Mal€tta-\Qo\Jd Man fit- 
ting, talking very warmly among fome Gentle^ 
men, who I obferv'd were liftening very attentive- 
ly to what he faid ; and I fat myfelf down, and 
i\{d the like ; 'twas with great Pleature I heard him 
difcourfe very handfomly on feveral weighty Sub- 



£7J] 



)eds; I found he was a very good Scholar, 
had been very handfomely bred, and that Lear- 
ning aud Study was his Delight i and more than 
that, Tome of the befl ot" Science was at that Time 
his Employment : At length I took the Freedom 
to ask him, If he was born in England ? 

He reply'd with a great deal of good Humour 
in the Manner, but with an Excefs of Refentment 
at his Father, and with Tears in his Eyes, Yes, 
yes. Sir, I am a true-born Englijh Man, to my 
Father's Shame be it fpoken ; who being an Englijh 
Man himfeif, could find in his Heart to join him- 
felf to a Negro Woman, tho' he mufl needs know, 
The Children he fhould beget, would curfe the Me- 
mory of fuch an A(^tion, and abhor his very Name 
for the fake of it. Yes, yes, fays he, repeating 
it again, I am an Englijh Man, and born in law- 
ful Wedlock \ happy had it been for me, tho* my 
Father had gone to the Devil for Whoredom, 
had he lain with a Cook-Maid, or produced 
me from the meaneft Beggar Woman in the Street. 
My Father might do the Duty of Nature to his 
black Wife; but^ God knows, he did nojuflic^ 
to his Children. If it had not been for this 
damn'd black Face of mine, fays he then fmiling, 
i had been bred to the Law, or brought up in the 
Study of Divinity: But my Father gave me Lear- 
ning to no manner of Purpofe ; for he knew I fbould 
never be able to rife by it to any Thing, but a 
learned Valet de Vhamher, What he put me to 
School for, I cannot imagine: He fpoifd a good 
Tarpawlin, when he flrove to make me a Gentle- 
man : When he had refolv'd to marry a Slave, and 
lye with a Slave, he fliould have begot Slaves, 
and lee us have been bred as we were born : But he 
has twice ruin 'd me j firil with getting me a fright-

Onverfation is the. bri'ght^fl,.an3 
moft beautiful Part of Life ; 'tis. 2Ln 
Emblem of the Enjoyment of a Si- 
tu ce State; jorjuitabh Society is ^a 
heavenly Life ; 'tis that Part of Life 
by which Mankind are not only 
dirdnguifn'd from the inanimate World, but by 
which they are ditlinguiih'd from one another- 
Perhaps I may be more particularly fenfible of the 
Benefit and of the Pleafure of it, having been fo 
effedually mortify'd with the Want of it: But.as 
1 take it to be one of the Peculiars of the ratio- 
nal Life, that Man is a converilhle Creature ; fo 
'tis his moft compleat Blefling in Life, robe blef- 
fed with fuitable Perfons about him to converfe 
with. Bringing it down from Generals to Par- 
ticulars, nothing can recommend a Man more, no- 
thing renders him more agreeable, nothing can be 
a better Charader to give of one Man to another^ 
next to that of his being an honeft and religious 
Man, than to fay of him t,hac he is very good Com- 
pany. ' How 



How delightful is it to fee a Man's Face al- 
ways cover'd with Smiles, and his Soul Ihining 
continually in the Goodnefs of his Temper j to fee 
an Air of Humpur and Pleafantnefs fit ever upon 
his Brow, and to hnd hinv on all Occafions the 
fame, ever agreeable to others and to himfelf j a 
fteady Calm of Mind, a clear Head, and ferene 
Thoughts always adjng the Mafterfhip upon him : 
Such a Man has Something angelick in his very 
Countenance; the Life of (uch a Man is one en- 
tire Scene of Compofure ; 'tis an Anticipation of 
the future State, which we well reprefent by an 
eternal Peace. 

To fuch a Man to be angry, is only to be juft 
to himfelf, and to ad as he ought to do ; to be 
troubled or fad, is only to aft his Reafon ; for as 
to being in a Paflion, he knows nothing of it ; Paf- 
fion is a Storm in the Mind, and this never hap* 
pens to him ; for all Excceffes, either of Grief or 
of Refentment, are Foreigners, and have no Ha- 
bitation with him : He is the only Man that can 
obferve that Scripture heavenly Didate, Be any 
gry and fin not; and if ever he is very angry, 'tis 
with himfelf, for giving Way to be angry with any 
one clfe. 

This is the tiuly agreeable Perfon, and the on- 
ly one that can be call'd fo in the World ; his Com- 
pany is a Charm, and is rather wonder'd at than 
imitated: Tis almofi: a Vertue to envy luch a 
Man •, and one is apt innocently to grieve at him, 
when we fee what is fo defirable in him, and can- 
not either find it, or make it in our felves. 

But take this with you in the Charader of this 
happy Man, namely, that he is always a good 
Man, a religious Man : "'TIS a grofs Error to ima- 
gine, that a Soul blacken 'd with Vice, loaded with 
Crime, degenerated into Immorality and Folly, 

can

cah be that Man, can have this caliti, ferene Soul> 
thofe dear Thoughts, thofe conftant Smiled upon 
his Brow, and the fteady Agrceabknefs and Plea- 
fantry in his Temper, that 1 am fpeaking of,* there 
muft be Intervals of Darknefs upon fuch a Mind ; 
Storms in the Confcience will always lodge Clouds 
upon the Countenance ; and where the Weather 
is hazey within, it ean never be Sun-fhine without ; 
the Smiles of a difturb'd Miiid are all but feigned 
and forg'di there may be a good Difpofitioni but 
it will be too ohtn and too ^vidtntly interrupted 
by the Recoils of the Mindj to leave the Tem- 
per untoueh'd, and the Humour free and uncon* 
eern'di when the Drum beats an Alarm within, 
it is impoilible but the Diilurbanee will be dif* 
covered without. 

Mark the Man of Grime -, fit clofe to hiifi in 
Company, at the End of the moft exube- 
rant Exeurfion of his. Mirth ; you will never 
fail to hear his reflecting Faeulty whifper a 
Sigh to him ; he'll (hake it off, you will fee him 
check it and go on j perhaps he fings it off, but 
at the End of every Song, nay perhaps of every 
Stanza, it returns j a kind of involuntary Sadnefs 
breaks upon all his Joy ,* he perceives it, rouzes, 
defpifes it, and goes on ; but in the Middle of a 
long Laugh, in drops a Sigh ; it will be, it can 
be no otherwife ; and I never conversed clofely 
with a Man of Levity in my Life, but I could 
jljbrceive it moft plainly ; -^tis a Kind of Refpira- 
tion, natural to a ftifl'd Convi6tion ; a Hefitation 
that is the Confeqtience of a captivated Vertue • 
a little Infurreftion in the Soul againft the Tyran- 
ny of profligate Principles. 

But in the good Man the Calm is compleat ;• 
'tis all Nature, no Counterfeit ; he is always in 
Humour, becaufe he is always composU

A ftated Compofure of Mind can really pro- 
ceed from nothing but a Fund of Vertue \ and 
tWis-is the Reafon wjiy 'cis my Opinion, thattte 
common Saying, That Content of Mind is Hap- 
pinefs, is a vulgar Miftake, iinlefs it be granted^ 
that this Content is firfl founded on fuch a Bafis, 
as the Mind ought to be contented with ; for 
ptherwife a Lunatick in Bedlam is a compleatly 
happy Man; he lings in his Hutch, and dan- 
ces in his Chain, and is as contented as any Man 
living : The PolTeffion or Power,, which that Va- 
pqtir or Delirium has upon his Brain, makes him 
fancy himfelf a Prince, a Monarch, a Statefma^, 
.or ju:fl: what he pleafes to be ; as a certain Dut- 
ehefsyis faid tohave believ'd herfelf to be an Em- 
pr efs, has her Footmen drawn up, with Javelins, 
and Qtefs'd in. antick Habits, that £he may fee 
them thro' a -Window, and believ<? .them to be 
her Guards; isferv'dupon the Knee;, call'dher 
Majefty, Imperial Majefly, and the like \ and 
with this Splendor, her diftemper'd Mind is 
deluded, forming Ideas of Things which are 
not, arid at the fame Time her Eyes are (hut to 
the eternal Captivity of her Circumftances 5 in 
which fhe is made a Property to other Perfons, her 
Eflate manag'd by Guardianihip, and flie a poor 
.4emented Creature to the lafl Degree, an Ob- 
jed of human CompafTion, and compleatly mi- 
ferable. 

The only Contentment which entitles Mankind 
to any Felicity, is that which is founded upon 
Vertue and jull: Principles; for Contentment is 
nothing more or lefs than what we call Peaqe; 
aad what P^acc, where Crime pofleffes the Mind, 

which 



[ 79 ] : 

xvhich is attended, as a natural Confequence,' with 
Torment and Difquiet ? What Peace where the 
Harmony of the Soul is broken by conftant Re- 
gret, and Self-Reproaches ? What Peace in a Mind 
under conftant Apprehenlions and Terrors of 
fomething yet attending to render them mifera- 
ble ; and all this is infeparable from a Life of Crime* 

For where there's Guilt, there always will be Fear. 

Peace of Mind makes a Haley 6n upon the Coun- 
tenance, it guilds the Face with a chearful Afped, 
fuch as nothing clfe can procure ; and which indeed 
as above, it is impolTible effedually to counter- 
feit.

[8i ] 



But 1 return to the Subjcia of Converfatlon, from 
x^hich this Digreffion is made only to fliew that 
the Fund of agreeable Converfation is, and can 
only be founded in Virtue; this alone is the Thing 
that keeps a Man always in Humour, and always 
agreeable. 

They miftake much, who think Religion, or a 
ftrid Morality, difcompofes the Temper, fowres 
the Mind, and unfits a Man for Converfation. 
'Tis irrational to think, a Man can't be bright, 
unlefs he is wicked; It may as well be faid, a 
Man cannot be merry till he is mad, not agree- 
able till he is offenfive, not in Humour till he is out 
of himfelf. "^Tis clear to me, no Man can be truly 
merry, but he that is truly virtuous : Wit is as 
confiftent with Religion, as Religion is with good 
Manners; nor is there any Thing in the Limita- 
tions of Virtue and Religion ; I mean, the juft 
Reftraints which Religion and Virtue lay upon us 
in Converfation ; that fhould abate the Pleafure of 
it, on the contrary they encreafe it : For Example : 
Reftraints from vicious and indecent Difcourfes. 
There's as little Manners in thofe Things, as 
there is Mirth in them ; nor indeed does Re- 
ligion or Virtue rob Converfation of one Grain 
ot true Mirth: On the contrary, the religious 
Man is the only Man fully qualify *d for Mirth 
and good Humour ; with this Advantage, that 
when the vitious and the virtuous Man appear gay 
and merry, but differ, as tJjey mufi do, in the Subjed 
of their Mirth, you may always obferve the virtu- 
ous Man's Mirth is fuperiour to the other s niore 
fuitable to him, as a Man, as a Gentleman, as a 
wife Man, and as a good Man ; and generally 
fpeaking, the other will acknowledge it ; at leaft, 
afterward, when his Thoughts cool, and as his 
Reflexions come in. 

G But 



[8z3 

But Wh^t fliall we do to correct the Vices cf 
Converfation ? How fhall we fhew Men the Pi- 
idtire of their own Behaviour? There is not a 
greater Undertaking in the World, or an Attempt 
of more Confequence to the Good of Mankind 
than this ; but "tis as difficult alfo, as it is ufe- 
ful ; and at beft I Ciall make but a little Progrefs 
in it in this Work , let others mend it. 

Of unfitting our Jehes for Con v e R- 

SATION. 

Efore I enter upon the Thing which t 
call the Immorality of Conxxrfation, 
let me fay a little about the many weak 
and foolilh Ways^ by which Men ftrive^ 
as it were, to unfit themfelves for Converfation* 
Human Infirmities furnifii us with feveral Things 
that help to make us unconverfible ; we need not 
ftudy to encreafe the Difadvantages we lye under 
on that Score : Vice and Intemperance, not as a 
Crime cnly^ that IJJmildfpeak of hy itfelf, but even 
as a Diflemper, unfit us for Converfation ; they 
help to make v\s cynical, morofe, furly, and rude. 
Vicious People boaR of their polite Carriage and 
their nice Behaviour, how gay, how good hu- 
mour'd, how agreeable? for a While it may befo : 
But trace them as Men of YicQ, follow them till 
they come to Years, and obferve, while you live, 
you never fee the Humour laft, but they grow fie- 
ry, mcrofe, pofitive, and petulant. An ancient 
Drunkard is a Thing indeed not often feen ; be- 
caufe the Vice has one good Faculty with it, i^/2S. 
That it feldom hands them on to old Age-, But 
an ancient and good humour d Drunkard, I think I 
never knew. It 




I HI , 

ItTeejiis ftrange, that Men fhoujd af&d unfit- 
ting themieives for Society, and fludy to make 
themfelves unconverfiblc, whereas their being 
truly Sociable, as Men, is the Thing whicti 
would mofl: recommend them, and that to the 
befl of Men, and beft anfwers to the higheft Fe- 
licity of Life. Let no Man value himfelf upori 
being morofe and cynical, four and unconverfible^ 
'tis the Reverfe of a good Man ; a truly religi- 
ous Man follows the Rule of the Apoftlc, Le Af- 
fable, be CourteoHij be Humble ; in Meeknefs, efteeming 
'every Man better than ourjehes ; whereas Converfa- 
tion now is the Reverfe of the Chriflian Rule ; 
'tis interrupted with Conceitednefs and Affedati- 
on, a Pridei efieemmg our f elves better than every 
Man; SLud that which is worfe ftiu, this happens 
generally, when indeed the Juftice of the Cafe is 
againft us ; for where is the Man who thus over- 
ruling himfelf, is not evidently inferiour in Mcric 
to all about him ? Nay, and frequently thofe 
who put mofl Value upon themfelves, have the 
ieaft Merit to fupport it. Self- Conceit is the 
Bane of human Society, and generally fpeaking 
is the Peculiar of. thofe who have the leafl to 
tecommend them ; \is the Ruin of Converfation^ 
and the Delirudion of all Improvement ; for how 
fhould any Man receive any Advantage from the 
Converfation of others, who believes himfelf qua- 
lified to teach them, and not to have Occafion to 
learn any Thing from them ? 

Nay, as the Fool is generally the Man that is 
conceited mofl of his own Wit, fo that very 
Conceit is the Ruin of him ; it confirms him a 
Fool all the Days of his Life, for he that thinks 
himfelf a wife Man, is a Fool, and knows it 
not i nay, 'tis impofTible he fhoald continue to be 

G 2 a Fool, 



[ 84 ] 

a Fool, if he was but once convine'd of his 
Folly. 

// Fools could their oivn Ignorance difcem^ 
they'd be no longer Foolsy becaufe they'd learn.' 

It will be objeded here indeed, that Folly and 
Conceit may be hurtful to Converfation, may 
rob Men of the Advantage oi it, unfit one Side 
for Converfing, and make it unprofitable, as well 
as unpleafant to the other ; But that this is no- 
thing to the Immorality of Converfation; that Ig- 
norance and Conceit may be an Infirmity, but is 
not always a Crime ; that the Mifchief of 
Mens being Fools is generally their own, but 
the Mifchiet of their being Knaves is to other 
People, and this is very true. But certainly, e- 
gregious Folly merits one Paragraph of Rebuke ; 
perhaps it may touch the Senfes of fome weak 
Brethren one time or other, and the Labour may 
»ot be loft. 

I never faw a more fimple, or yet a more fu- 
rious irreconcileable Qirarrel, than once between 
two of the moft empty conceited People that e- 
ver I knew in the World ; and it was upon one 
calling the other Foolj which on both Sides was 
unhappily very true ; they fought upon the Spot, 
but were parted by the Company ; they chal- 
lenged, and could not meet, their Friends getting 
Notice of it ; in Ihort, it ruinM them both ; they 
made new Appointments, and at laft deceived their 
Friends, and fought again j they were both woun- 
ded, and one died, the other fled the Country, 
and never returned. The firft own'd he was a 
Fool, which was indeed fome Diminution of his 
Folly. I fay, he knew himfelf to be a Fool, but 
could not bear the other (liquid tell him fo, who 

was 



[85] 

was more a Fool than himfelt. The other boldly af- 
ferted his own Capacities to be inhnitel) greater 
than they were, and derpifed the firft to the Jail 
Degree, who indeed, ii he had not more Wit, 
had more Modefty than the other ,* but both like 
Fools fought about Mothingy for fuch indeed the 
^Queftlon about their VVic might very well-have 
been callM. 

But, it is true, after all, the Want of a con- 
verfible Temper, if from a Want or Defecft of 
Senfe may be an Infirmity, not an Immorality ; 
that is to fay, the Caufe is not fo in itfelf, but 
it may be fo in its Confequences, that way alfo^ 
For the Cowverfation of Fools is Vanity in the Ah' 
ftraH. I might here indeed find Sub/eft for a 
large Traft, upon the infinite Diverfity of Fools, 
and by confequence the wondrous Beauty pf th^ir : 
Converfation : I have on this Occafion reckon'd 
up a Lifl of about Seven and Thirty feveral Sorts 
of Fools, befides Solomons Foo/,whom I take to be 
the wicked Fool only ; thefe I have diverfified by 
their Tempers and Humours, and in the infinite 
Variety of their Follies of feveral Sorts, in every 
one of which they rob themfelves, and all that 
keep them Company of the Felicity of Conver- 
fation, there being nothing in them but Empti- 
nefs, or a Fulnefs of what is Ridiculous, and on- 
ly qualified to be laught at, or found Fault 
with.. 

I have likewife defcrib'd fome of their Con^ 
verfation, their vain Repetitions, their Catch- 
Words, their Laughings and Geflures, and adap- 
ted them to make the World merry. I have 
Thoughts of running it on into foreign Chara-^ 
ders, and defcribe French, Spanijh, Portuguefe 
Fools, and Fools of Ruffia, China, and the Eafi 
Indies : But as this i^ fomething remote from the 

G 3 Defiga

Defign in Hand, which is more fcriou^, an4 
doae on a much better View, aad likewife of 
an unmearurable Length, hke the weighty Sub- 
jed it is upon (for Folly is a large Field) fo I re- 
fer it to another Opportunity. 

The Truth is, that Part of Converfation which- 
I am naw to fpeak ofi or which I mean by what 
I have faid upon this Subjed, is the weighty and 
(erious Part, and is not the meer common Talk, 
or a Converfation which Fools are ca^pable of j 
his exercifed in a folid and well temper'd Frame, 
and when regulated as it ought to be, by Virtue^ 
and good Morale, is qualJified to make Mankind 
happy in the Enjoyrnent of the beft Things, 
and of the beft Company, and therefore, the E^ 
vils that creep into, and corrupt this Part of our 
Converfation, are of the more fatal Quality, and 
worth our expofing, that People may fee and 
Ihun them, and that Converfation may be reftored 
among us to what it fiiould be. 



I. Of the Immorality of Conver- 
V sATiON in General. 

O M E may obJeA againft the Term 
the Immorality of Converfation, and 
think the Word improper to the Sub- 
jed ,*but to fave any Critick the dearly 
beloved Labour of cavilling in Favour of ill Man- 
ners and unbecoming Behaviour, I fhall explain 




myfelf before I go any farther. 



IcaU 



[87 3 

I call Converfation immoral, where the Dif- 
courfe is indecent, where 'tis irreh'gious or pro- 
fanej where "tis immodeft or fcandalous, or where 
'tis llanderoLis and abufive. In thefeand fuch Ca- 
fes, loqui efl agere, thus talking \c\^r^\y^ or talking 
profanely, is an immodeil Adion. Such is the 
Power of Words that Mankind is'able to acty as 
much Evil by their Tongues, as by their Hands ; 
the Ideas that are formed in the Mind from what 
we hear, are mofl: peircing and permanent; and 
the Force of Example in this Cafe, is not more 
powerful than the Force of Argument. 

Some of the worll Sins are not to be commit- 
ted but by the Tongue, as the Sin of Ei^pi^^inYy 
fpeaking Treafon againli the Ma/eity of God, 
Curfings and Imprecations among Men, Lies, 
Slanders^ and a vaft Variety of petty Excurfions, 
which are grown modifh by Cuftom, and feem too 
fmall to be reproved. 

We are here in England, after many Years De- 
generacy, arrived to a Time, wherein Vice is in 
feneral difcountenanc'd by Authority ; God in 
lercy to the Age has infpir'd our Government 
with a Refolution to difcourage it : The King 
now, his Wars are over, and his foreign Enemies 
allow him fome Refl, will, we hope, declare War 
againft this Domeftfck Enemy. 

The late Queen Mzry, of heavenly Memory, for 
her Piety and blefl'ed Example, appear^ in her 
Time gallantly in the Caufe of Virtue : Magi- 
ftrates were encouraged to punifh Vice, new 
Laws made to reftrain it, and Juftice feem^d to 
be at Work to reclaim it : But what can King?, or 
Qiieens, or Parliaments do? Laws and Procla- 
mations are weak and ufelefs Things, unlefs fome 
fecret Lifluence can affect the Praftices of thofe 
whom no Laws can reach. 

G 4 To 



[88] 

To make Laws againfl: Words, would be as 
fruitlefs as to make a ihelter againft the Lightning ; 
there are^fo many Inlets to the Breach, that ,the 
Informers would be as numerous as the Crimi- 
nals, and the Trefpafs as frequent as the Minutes 
we live in. 

Converfation has received a general Taint, and 
the Difeafe is become a Charm j the Way to cure 
it, is not by forcible Reftraints on Particulars, 
but by (ome general Influence on the publick Pra- 
(5tice ; when a Diftemper becomes pleafant to a 
Patient, he is the harder to be cur^d ; he has a {ort 
Oi Averfion to the Remedy becaufe he has none to 
the Difeafc. Our modern People have fuch a Paf-^ 
fion for the Mode, that if it be but the Fafliion 
to be Lewd, they will fcandalize their Honour, de- 
bauch th«ir Bodies, and damn their Souls to be 
Gentile ; if the Beaux talk Blafphemy, the reft will 
fet up for Athiefts, and deny their Maker, to be 
counted witty in the Defence of it^ when our 
Tradefraen would be thought wife, and make 
themfelvcs appear nice and learned in their Con- 
verfation, nothing will htisfy them but to criti- 
cife upon Things facred ; run up to difcufs the In- 
fcrutables of Religion ; fearch the Arcana even of 
Heaven itielf: The Divinity of the Son of God, 
the hypoftarick Union, the rational Defcription of 
the State Everlafting, nay, the Demonftrations of 
undemonftrable Things, are the common Subjed pf 
their fancied affected Capacities. 'i;:^'a,^^ 

Hence come Herefies and Delufions, Men af- 
fefting to fearch into what is impoffible th^y fhould 
clearly difcover, learn to doubt, becaufe they can- 
not defcribc, and deny the Exiftence becaufe they 
cannot explain the Manner of what they enquire 
after ; as i( a thorow impoflibility of their ading 
^y their Scnfe upon Objeds bey o;]d its Reach, w^s 



[89] 

an Evidence agalnft their Being. Thus becaufe the 
Trinity cannot appear to their Reafoning, they 
oppofe their Reafoning to its Reality ; they will 
diveft the Son of God of his Divinity, and of the 
hypoftatick Union of the Godhead in the Perfon 
of Chrift, becaufe they cannot diftinguilh between 
the A(5tions done by him in his Mediatorial Capa-' 
city, in Virtue of his Office, and thofe Adions, 
which he did in Virtue of his Omnipotence and 
Godhead, 

This is not an Immorality and Error in Conver* 
fation only, or not fo much,fo as I think it is a Judg- 
ment upon it, a Blaft from Heaven upon the Arro- 
gance of the Tongue,- when proud Men give 
themfelves a Loofe to talk Blafphemoufly to be 
thought witty, their Maker gives them up to 
fuggeft damnable Errors till they begin to believe 
them, and to broach their own wicked Hints, till 
they by Cullom learn to efpoufe and defend 
them, as Children tell feigned Stories till they be- 
lieve them to be true. If our Town Fopperies 
were vifible only in the little Excurfions of Drefs 
and Behaviour, it would be Satisfadion enough 
for a wi% Man, either to pity or laugh at them ; 
but when Wit is kt on work, and Invention rack'd 
to find out Methods, how they ipay be more than 
fuperlatively wicked, when all the Endowments 
of the Mind and Helps of Art, with the Accom- 
plifhments of Education are rang*d in Battel a- 
gainft Heaven, and joyn'd in Confederacy to make 
Mankind more wicked, than ever the Devil had 
the Impudence to defire of them ; This calls out 
^loud for the Help of all the Powers of Govern- 
ment, and all the Strength of Wit and Virtue to 
deted and expofe it. 

Indeed I had feme Thoughts to leave upon Re- 
cord a melancholly kind of Genealogy, of this

i witiiin the reach pf our own Memory, and 'tis as 
I I may fay, the adopted Child of ou;: Age, wc 
may I'udge of the Extent of its Ijifluence, and may 
take a fhort View ot it in Miniature. None indeed 
^an judge of the Extent of its Influence, but fuch 
as have converfed with all Sorts of People, froni 
the Court to the Plough-tail, where you may too 
fadly fee the EiFed of it, in the general debauch- 
ing both the Principles and Pradice of all Sorts 
/and Degrees of this Nation : But it will be an 
( ungrateful Task, 'twould lead me to the Chara- 
f ^ers of Perfqps, and tp write Satyrs upon the 
\ Times, as well thofe paft, as thefe prefent, which 
j indeed is not my Buiinefs in this Work ; and 
• therefore I throw by Tome keen Obfervations 
which I had made upon this Subjed, my Bufinefs 
here, or at leaft my Defign being rather to inftruct 
the Age, than to reproach it i and as for the Dead, 
tbey are gone to their Place. 
\ Sr. Auguflhi obferves, de Civitatje dei^ that the An- 
\ cients juftified their Liberty in all Excefles of 
Vice, v/hich they prac^ifed in thofe Times from 
the Patterns of their Gods, that the Stories of 
die Rapes and Inceft of Jupiter^ the Lewdnefs of 
Venus and Mars^ and the like, made thofe Crimes 
appear lefs heinous, fince People had them fre- 
quent in the Eliftories of the Deities they wor- 
ihipped -; and that they mufi: of Neceffity be law-» 
ful, feeing they were praftifed by thofe famous 
Pcrfons, who they had placed above the Skyes an4 
thought he to adore. -; 

If modern Times have received unhappy Im- 
preiHons from vicioiis Courts i and Princes, have 

not 



C 91 ] 

not taken the needful Caution not to guide to Evil 
by their Example ; inftead of turning this intp 
Satyr upoa thofe that are paft, I choofe to give it 
anothci: Turn, whi<ch our Kings and People too 
in Time to come may make good Ufe of, and I 
iiope will not be offended at fuppofing that they 
will do fo. 

I. To Kings or Sovereigns in future Reigns; 
for I am not in this intending the prefent 
Reign ; it may without Offence be faid, that 
they have a glorious Advantage put into theii: 
Hands, to Honour their ^aker, and advan- 
tage their People, to the immortal Glory of 
their own Memory, by prompting Virtue and 
difcouraging Vice by their happy Examples ; 
by removing the vicious Habits of Conver- 
fation from the Court-Modes, and ipaking 
Vice unfafhionable as it is unfeemly ; why 
may not the Royal Example go as far to re- 
form a Nation, as it has formerly done to 
debauch and ruin it ? But as this refpeds the

1. Of reforming the Errors of Con- 
^erfatm* 



UT I leave this Part as lefs grateful, 
and perhaps not more (ignificanc than 
what I have yet to fay upon this Sub-* 
jed; 'tis not fo abfolutely material to 
ipquire how his Converfation came firft to be cor- 
rupted, as how it fhall be reformed or recovered? 
The Queftion before us is, by what Method to re- 
trieve this miferable Defedion, and to bring back 
the Nation to fome tolerable Degree of good 
Manners, that Morality at le^ft may regain its 
Authority, and Virtue, and Sobriety be valuc4 
again as it ought to be ; this, I fay, is a di&r 
cult Thing to dirciStf

The Method might be eafier prefcrib'd than

rher^fomething may however be faid by way of Ob- 
iervation; perhaps other Well-wi{hers,may hereafter 

throw 



t9J] 

throw their Mites into this Treafury, and feme 
zealous Reformers may at laft make the Attempt 
upon thefe Foundations. 

I. A ftrid Execution of the Laws againft Vice ; 
we have already, and are every Day making very 
good Laws to reform the People : But the Benefit of 
Laws confifls in the executive Power, which if not 
vigoroufly put forth, Laws become ufelefs, and it 
were better they were not made at alL I was once 
going to have added here a Treatife, entituled, an 
Eflay upon the Infignificancy of Laws and Ads of 
Parliament in Enghnd; but uponfecond Thoughts, 
refolving to mingle no Satyr with my ferious Ob- 
fervations, I omitted this alfo. The Deficiency 
of our Laws, is chiefly in the Want of Laws 
to reform the Law-makers, that the Wheel of exe- 
cutive Juftice might be kept going; Of what 
Ufe elfe can Laws be ? 

(2) An exemplar Behaviour in our Gentry, after 
whofe Copy the poor People generally v/rite; 
not but that I acknowledge it will be harder, 
to reform a Nation, than it would to debauch 
it ; though Virtue fhould obtain upon Cu- 
ftom ; and become the Fafhion, beceufe Incli- 
nation does not ftand neuter i but it would be 
a great Step to this Reformation, i( we could 
all joyn to difcourage Immorality by Example ; 
That if a Man will be drunk or lewd, he Ihali 
as a 'Thief robs a Houfe^ do it in the Dark, and 
be afhamed of it. If thefe two Heads were 
brought to pafs, I quellion not but Reformation 
would come to fuch an heighth, that if a poor 
Man happened to be drunk, he fhould come and 
defire the Conflable to fet him in the Stocks, for 
fear of worfe PuniQiment ; and if a rich Man 
fwore an Oath in his Paflion, he fhould fend his 
Footman to the next Juftice of the Peace with his 

Fir.e, 



C94] 

Pine, and get a Difcharge for fear of being iri* 
form'd againft and exposed. 

In order to the furthering this great Work, it 
would be very neceffary, if poflible, to draw, the 
Pidure of our modern Vices, to kc Mankind fee 
by a true Light what they are doing, and how 
ugly a Phyz the Miftrefs they jcourt really appears 
withj when Inclination which paints her in dife- 
rent Colours is taken off. 

"Twill be impoflible to bring YicQ out of Fa- 
fiiion, if we cannot bring Men to an Underftand- 
ing of what it really is : But could we prevail up- 
on a Man to examine his VicQ,. to diifed its PartSj 
and view the Anatomyjof it; to fee hovv difagree- 
able it is to him as a Man, as a Gentleman, or as 
a Chridian ; how defpicable and contemptible in 
its higheft Fruition, how deftruftive to his Senfes^ 
EftatCjand Reputation; how di&onourablejand how 
beaftly, in its publick Appearances, fuch a Man 
would certainly be out of Love with it, and be 
but Mankind once out of love with Vice, the Re- 
formation is half brought to pafs. 

I fnall not pretend to invade the Province of 
the Learned, nor offer one Argument from Scrip- 
ture or Providence ; for I am fuppofed to be talk- 
ing to Men that doubt or deny them both. Divi- 
nity is not my Talent, nor ever like to be my 
JprofefTion, the Charge of Prieftcraft and School- 
men would not lie againfl me ; befides, ^tis not 
the way or talking that the World relifhes at this 
Time; in a Word, talking Scripture is out of 
Fafiiion : But 1 mufl crave leave to tell my Rea- 
der, that if there were no God or Providence, 
Devil or future State, yet they ought not to be 
Drunken and Lewd, Paffionate, Revengeful or 
Immoral ; ^tisj fo Unnatural, fo Unruly, fo Ingen- 
teel, fo Foolifli and Foppifii, that no wife Man a$ 

a Man 



£95 ] 

a M^n can juftify it fo much as to his own Rear 
fon, or the Memory oF his Anceftors. 1 fuppofe 
my felf talking t;o Men that have nothing to do 
with God, and defire he fhould have nocning to 
'do with them j and yet even to fuch, a vicioirs 
Converfation, looked on without the Guft ot Incli- 
nation, would appear too brutifh to be meddled 
with, if we will but choofe tike Men^ not to fay 
like Cbrifiians j Virtue and Morality is more 
agreeable to, human Nature, more manly than 
SficQ and Intemperance i 'tis more fuitable to all 
the Ends or Life, to the Being of Society, to the 
pubHck Peace of Families, as well as Nations. 
Mankind would rather be virtuous than vicious^ 
if they were to choofe only for their own Cafw and 
Convenience. Vice tends to Oppreffion, War 
and Confuiion ; Virtue is peaceable and honefi,* 
Vice is a Poifon to Society, no Man is fafe if 
Men have neither^^Sobrlety or Honefty ; for the 
Innocent will be robb'd by the Thief, ravifht by 
the Lewd, and murther'd by the Drunkard. 

It might not be a needlefs Digreffion if I fhould 
examine here, whether Whoring and Dninkennefs 
be not the two Mother Sins of the Times, the 
Spring and Original of all our fafliionable Vices ; 
I diflinguifli this becaufe other Sins, asMudrers, 
Thefts, Rapes and the like, are now corne fo 
much in Vogue ; we are content the Laws fhould 
be executed for them, but ihould think it very 
hard a Man fhould be hang'd for Whoring, ol^ 
tranfported for being Drunk. 

I would not have any of our Gentlemen think, 
that my laying the Charge of our Debai-chery 
on the Examples of the Gods, has taken off any 
Thing of the Blame from thofe who have indu™ 
ftrioufly propogated the fpreading Evil, among 
their Ttaancs and Neighbours, by their own \ i- 

■ cioiis 



[96 1 

clous Example ; and I could turn the whole Obfef- 
vation into a Satyr on the Manners of bur Gen- 
tlemen, and defcribe with what Eafinefs our 
Magiftrates let fall the Reins of their Authority, 
and connive at the Pradice of all manner of In- 
temperance and Excefs among the People ; with 
what Eagernefs the poor Country-men are calfd 
in to be made drunk upon every Occafion ; with 
what Contempt any Perfon is look'd upon either 
in Town or Country, that either will not be 
drunk, or cannot bear an exceflive Quantity of 
Wine : How our common Mirth is fill'd with 
Songs and Poems, recommending Drunkenncfs and 
Lewdnefs, and rampant Vice rides Riot through 
the Nation. But as above I avoid Satyr, I fhall 
endeavour to treat this foul Subject, in^ as civil 
Terms as the Cafe will bear, and only examine 
general Con verfation in particular Heads, with fome 
vulgar Errors of Behaviour which are crept in, and 
which feem authorised fey Cuftom.

that the Devils themfelvcs never had the Inapa-

Mail arriv'd to a Degree of Hardnefs fit for fome-

Way, no Man in his Wits needs any furcher De- 
monitration of ir, than what he may find within 
himfelf ; nor is it any Part of the Work I am up- 
on, I have only a few Things to ask of our mo- 
dern Atheifts. 

I. Whether their more ferious Thoughts do 
not refled upon, them in the very Ad, and give 
the Lie to their Arguments. My Lord Rochefter^ 
who was arriv'd to an extraordinary Pitch in this 
Infernal Learning, acknowledged it on his Death 
Bed J the Senfe Nature has upon her of the Cer^ 
tainty of this great Truth, will give fome Coa* 
vulfions at fo horrid an Ad. 

Nature fays Homage with a trembling Bow^ 
And Confcious Men but faintly difallow, 
Thefecret Trepidation racks the Souly 
And while he fays, no God, replies^ Thou FoqL 

. 2. I would ask the moft confident Atheift, what 
Affurance he has of the Negative, and what a 
Rifque he runs if he fhould be miftaken ? This we 
are fure of, if we want Demonftration to prove 
the Being of a God, they are much more at a 
Lofs for a Demonftration to prove the Negative. 
Now no Man can Anfwer it to his Prudence, to 
take the Rifque they run, upon an uncertain fuppo- 
ficitious Notion ; for if there be fuch a Thing as z 
firll: Caufe, which we call God, they have very 
little Reafon to tx^ed. much from him, who have 
made it their Bufinefs to affront him by denying 
his Exiflence. Nor have they acted in their De- 
nial like wife Men, for they have not ufed fo 
much as the Caution of good Manners, but as 



[ 100 ] 

if they were as fare of his Non-entity, as of the 
flrongeft Demofiftration, they have been witty 
upon the Thing, and made a jeft of the Suppoli- 
ti'on, turn'd all Matters of Faith into Ridicule, 
burlefqu'd upon Religion it felf, and niade Bal-*

upon the Wickednefs of the treating thefe Subjeds

i( the Mufe were not jfo much an Atheifl as the 
Poec, blip banks the Hint, and could not favour a 
blafphemous Flight with fb much Freedom and 
Spirit that at other Times it has Ihown ; which is 
a Notice that there is ^ tacit Senfe of the Deity, 
though they pretend to deny it lodg'd in the Un- 
derftandiiig, th^t it i^ ;iot iii^cd without fomp 
Difficulty, and ftruggles liard with the Fancy, 
when the P.arty flrives to be more than prdinary 
Infolent with his Maker. 

In the next Place as 'tis one of the worfllmrporali- 
tiesof Converfation when it is prophane,foBlarphe- 
my is the Extrcam of Prophancnefs ; you cannof 
come into Company with an Atheift, but you have 
it in his common Difcourfe ; he is always putting 
fome Banter or foolifh Pun upon Religion, affront- 
ing the invifible Power, or ridiculing his Maker; 
all his Wjt runs out into it,as all Difeafes run, into 
the Plague in a Time of Infedion, and you muft 
have Patience to hear it or quarrel with him- 

Bejow thefe we have a Sort of People who will 
acknowledge a God, but be mull: be fuch a one 
as they pleafe to jnak^ him ,* a fine well bred goo4 
natur'd Gentleman like Deity, that cannot have 
the Heart to damn any of his Creatures to an 
Eternal Punilhment, nor could not be fo weak as 
to let the jews crucify his own Son ; thefe Men ex- 
pofe Religion, and all the Dodrines of Repentance^ 
and Faith in Chrifl, with all the Means of a 
Chriilian Salvation, as matter of Banter and Ridi-^ 
cule. The Bible they fay is a good Hiflory in 
mod: PartSj but the Story of our Saviour they look 
upon as a meer Novel, and the Miracles of the 
Nevy Teflament as a Legen4 of Prieltcraft.

Further, befides thefe we have Arians and So- 
anians^ the Difciples of an ancient Heretick, who 
went out of the Chutch always at the finging 
the Gloria Patri, that he might be out of the

the Prayers, to note his difowningthe Godhead of 
JefusChrift. '

rrefs. as to perfwade them out of a B^lid of any

once ceafe to believe a God, and he has nothing 
left to limit his Appetite but meer Phiiofophy ; if 
there is no fupreme Judicature, he muft be his 
own Judge and his own Law, and will be fo ; the 
Notion of Hell, D^vil, and Infernal Spirits are 
empty Things, and have nothing of Terror in 
them, if the Belief of a Power fuperior to them 
t>e obliterated. - ' : ■ '■ 

But to bring this particular Cafe nearer to the 
Point of Converfation, the Errors of which lie 
before me j though we live in an Age where thefe 
horrid Degrees of Impiety are too much pradifed.^ 
yet we live in a Place where Religion is profefled, 
the Name of God owned and worfhipped, Reli-^ 
'ligion and the Dodrines of Chriftianity efta- 
bliflied : and as k is fo, it ought as much to be 
prefervf H by the Civil Power, from the horrid In- 
vafiofi of Atheifls, Deifts and Here ticks, as the 
Publick Peace, ought to be defended againft Free- 
booters, Thieves, and Invaders. 

'Tis very improbable any Reformation ofMan- 
Jiers fhould be brought to pafs, if the debauching 
the religious Principles of the Nation, goes on 

with 



[ 105 ] 

with an uiirellrain'd Liberty. How iiicongraoir? 
is it to the Decoration of Government, that a Maa 
fhall be puniflied for Driinkennefs, and fet in the 
Stocks for Swearing, but fhall have Liberty to de- 
py the God of Heaven, and difpute againlT: the 
very Sum and SiibHance of the Chrillian Dodrine, 
Ihall banter the Scripture, and make Ballads oF th^ 
Pentateuch, turn all the Principles of Religion, 
the Salvation of the Soul, the Death of our Savi- 
our, and the Revelation of the Gofpel, into Ridi- 
cule ? And fhall we pretend to Reformation of 
Planners, and fuppreiling Immoralities, while 
fuch as this, is the general Mixture of Converfa- 
tion ? If a Man talk againft the Government, or 
fpeak fcurriloudy of the King, he is had to the 
Old Bayly, and from thence to the Pillory, or 
Whipping-Poft, and 'tis fit it fliould be fo: But: 
he may fpeak Treafon againft the Majefty ot Hea- 
ven, deny the Godhead of his Redeemer, and make 
a Jeft of the Holy Ghoft, and thus a&ont the 
Power we all adore, and yet pafs with Impunity,'; 
perhaps fome in the Company may have Courage 
enough to blame him, and vindicate their Reli- 
gion with a PPhy do ye talkfo} But where is the 
Man, or the Magiftrate, that ever vindicated the 
Honour oi his Maker, with a Refentment beco- 
ming the Crime ? If a Man give the Lie to a 
Gentleman in Company, he takes it as an Af- 
fjront, flies into a PaiTion, quarrels, fights and 
perhaps murders him i nay, fome have done it for 
an abfent Friend, whom they have heard abufed : 
3ut where is the Gentleman that ever thought: 
himfelf fo much concerned in the Qiiarrel of his 
Maker, but that he could hear him affronted, 
his Being deny'd, the Lie given to h's divine Au- 
thority, nay, to his divine Being, and all his 
Commands ridicul'd and expos'd, without any 

H 4 Mc» 



[ I04] 

Motion of Spirit to punifh the IniToIence; of the 
Party, and withor»t drawing his Sword in the 
Quarrel, or ietting him know he does not like it. 

Methinks, I need not make an Apology for 
this, as it I meant, that Quarreling and Fighting 
were a proper Practice in the C;.ie ; the Law does 
not admit it in any Cafe ; nor is it reafonable it 
Ihould, and God Almighty is h. from defiring 
us to run any Riique in his Service : But I chufe 
to bring the Gales into a Paralle!, to lignify, that 
I think "tis a vulgar Error in our Behaviour, not 
to fhow our Refentment, when we hear the Ho- 
nour and Eflence of God flighted and denied, his 
Majefty abufed, and Religion banter'd and ridi- 
cvdd in common Difcourfes. I think it would 
be very reafonable, to tell a Gentleman he wants 
Manners, when he talks reproachfully of his Ma- 
ker, and to ufe him fcurvily if he refented it. It 
would very well become a Man of Quality to 
cane a lew'd Fop, or kick him down Stairs, when 
his Inference took a Loofe at Religion in his Com- 
pany, eife Mer. may be bullied out of their Chri- 
flianity, and lampooned into Prophanenefs, for 
Fear of being counted Fools. 

Befides, 'ds in in this as in all other like Cafes ; 
he that vvill talk atheiilically in my Company, ci- 
ther believes me to be an Atheift hke bimfelf, or 
ventures to impofe upon me ; and by -impofing 
upon me, either accounts me a Fool that can't 
tell when T am put upon, or a Coward that dare 
not refenc it. 

Upon wlich Account, even in good Manners, 
it ought to be avoided ; for it can't be intro- 
diic'd into any Part of Converfation, where the 
Company are not all alike, without liic greateft 
Affront upon the reft that can be offered them.

4, Of Lewd and Immodeft Dijcourfe^ 

Alking Bawdy, that Sodomy of the 
Tongue has the moll of ill Manners, and 
the ieafl of a Gentlenian in it, of any 
Part of common Difcourfe. Sir George 
Mackenzie has very handfomely expos'd ic in its 
proper Colours : But ic may not be an Intrench- 
ment at all upon his Province, to fay fomething 
to it in thefe Obfervations. 

This Part is the puculiar Pradice of fuch Perfon 
as arehardened to a Degree beyond other Men ; 
Proficients in Debauchery, whofe Lives are fo con- 
tinually devoted to Lewdnefs, that their Mouths 
cannot contain it; who can govern their Tongues 
no better than their Tails, and are willing to be 
thought what really they are. In thefe, it is 
neither fo flrange, nor fo much a Crime as in o- 
thers ; thefe are Perfons not to b( reclaimed. This 
Part of my Obfervation is not vicfigned for their 
Ufe ; they are noc co be talk'd out of their Vicei 
they muft go on and run their Length: Nothing 
but a Goal or an Hofpital ever brings them to a 
Reformation ; they repent fometimes in that Em- 
blem of Hell, a fluxing Houfe, and under the Sur- 
geons Hands, wifh a little they had been wifer ; 
but they follow one Sin with another, till their 
Carcafs fllnks as bad as their Difcourfe, and the 
Body becomes too nafty, for the Soul to flay any 
longer in it : From thefe no Difcourfe is to be ex- 
pefted, but what is agreeable to the Tenor of 
their Lives ; fpr them to talk otherwife, would be 
llrain'd and excencrick, and become them as lit- 
tle, 



[■ 106 ] 

jtle, as it would be tedious to them ; but for a 
Gentleman, " a Man of feeming Modefly, and 4 
Man of Behaviour, not arrived to that Clafs in 
the Devil's School, forfuch 4 one to mix his Dif- 
^ourfe with lew'd and filthy Expreffions, 'h^s 
fomething in it of a Figure, which inrends more 
than is exprefs'd. 

Either we muft believe fuch a one to be very 
lew'd in his Pradice ; or elfe, that not being 
able yet to arrive to fuch a Degree of Wickednefs 
as. he defires, he would fupply that Defed with a 
Cheat, and perfwade you to believe he is really 
worfe than he is. n 

Which of thefe two Charaders I would chufe tor 
wear, t cannot tell > for he chat defires to be worfe 
than he thinks he is, is certainly as bad as he de- 
lires to be ; and he that is (o bad as to let fly the 
Excrefcencies of it at his Mouth, is as wicked 
as the Devil can in Reafon deiireofhim. 

But 1 defcend from the Wickednefs to the Inde- 
cency of the Matter; its being a Sin againftGod, 
isnotfomuch the prefent Argument, as its being 
unmannerly, a Sin againft Breeding, and Society, 
a Breach of Behaviour, and a fancy infplent Af- 
front to all the Company. 

1 do not deny, but that Modefly, as it refpeds 
the Covering our Bodies, was at firfl: an Effect of 
Xho, Fall of our Parents into Crin^e, and is there- 
fore faid {fill to be the Confequences of criminal 
Nature, and no Virtue in itfelf, becaufe no Part 
of the Body had been unfit to be expofed, if 
Vice had not made the Diilin(5V,ion neceffary. 
• But from this very Argument, lewd Difcourfe ap- 
pears to be a Sin againft Caftom and Decency ; for 
why muft the Tongue induftriouflyexpofe Things 
and Anions at which Nature bkifhes, and which 
Cuftom^ ^et the Origiiuil be what it will, has dedi- 
cated 



[107 1 

catcd to Privacy and Retirement ? What if 
It be true, that Shame is the Confequence of Sin, 
and that Modefly is not an original Virtue ; it 
cannot but be allowed, that Sin has thereby 
brought us to a Neceflity of making Mpdefty be 
'^ Virtue, and Sin would have a double Influence 
upon us, if after it had made us afham'd, itfliould 
make us not afham'd again. 

'Tis in my Opinion a Millake, when we fay. 
Sin was the immediate Caufe of Shame ; xwas Sin 
indeed gave a Nudity to our Natures and Adi- 
bns ; the Innocence which ferv'd as a Glory and 
Covering, being gone, then Shame came in as 
the Effed: of the confcious Sinner ^ fo the Text 
fays, 7'hey knew that they were naked : Shame was 
the Efted of Nakednefs, as Nakednefs was the 
Effed of Sin. 

From hence then I argue, and this is the "Rea- 
Ton of my naming it, That to be aiham'd of our 
Nakednefs, is a Token of our Wifdom, and a 
Monument ofourjufl Senfe of the firfl Sin that 
made it fo, and as much a Duty now, as any 
pther Part of our Repentance. 

To give theTongue then a Liberty in that w^hicJi 
there is fo much Reafon to blufii at, argues no 
Senfe of the Original Degeneracy. Where is 
the Mail that partakes not of Adams Fall, has 
no vicious contracted Habit and Nature conveyed 
to him from his Grand-Predecellbr? Let him 
come forth, let him go naked, and live by himfelf, 
andjiet his Poflerity partake of his Innocence^ 
his Tongue cannot offend, nothing can be inde- 
cent for him to fay, nothing uncomely for him 
to fee. 

But if thefe Gentlemen think it proper to cover 
their Nakednefs with their Clothes, methinks 
they Ihould not be always uncovering it again 

with 



[ io8 ] 

with their Tongues ; if there are fome needful 
Things, which Nature requires to be done in fe- 
cret, and which they by Inclination chufe to aft 
in Private : What Reafon can they give for fpeak^* 
iiig of them in Publick. 

There is a ftrange Incongruity in the Behaviour 
of thefe People, that they fill their Mouths with 
the foul Repetition of Adions, and Things which 
their own Pradicing in Private condems them for, 
nay, which they would be afham'd to do in Pub- 
lick i fuch Men ought to ad: the common Require- 
ments oF Nature, inthemoft publiqkeft Places of 
the Streets, bring pheir Wives or Whores to the 
Exchange, and to the Market Places, and lye 
with them in the Street, or elfe hold their Tongues, 
and let their Mouths have no more the Stench of 
their Vic^s in Publick, than their Anions. 

And why of all the reft of the Parts of Life, 
muft the Tongue take a peculiar Licence to re- 
Vel thus upon Nature? as iffhe had a Mind tp 
reproach her with the Infirmities ftie labours un- 
<ler: The Cuftoms we are obliged to, tho' they are 
Cloggs upon Nature, and a Badge of original 
'Defedion ,* yet neither is there any thing fo odi- 
ous, or fo burdenfome, that thefe Gentlemen 
fhould triumph over the Nurle that brought them 
up. 

' Take the lewdeft and moft vicious Wretch that 
ever gave his Tongue a Loofe in this hateful Pra- 
dice, and turn him about to his Mother, you fliall 
hardly prevail upon him to talk his lewd Language 
to her; there is fomethingnaufeous and furfeiting 
in that Thought. This talking Bawdy, is like 
a Man going to debauch his own Mother ; for 
\is rakir.g into the Arcana, and expoling the Na- 
kednefs of Nature, the common Morlier of us all. 

If. 



[ 109 1 

If, as a famous Man of Wit pretended, lying 
With a Woman was the homliefl thing that Man can 
do I 'tis much more true, that talking of it is the 
homliefl thing that Man can fay. 

Nor is there to me any Jeft in thefe things, no 
Appearance of Mirth: There may be feme Plea- 
fure in wicked Adions, as the World rates Plea- 
fure, but I muft profefs \is dullj and for Want of 
other more regular Taftes, that there fhould be 
Pleafu re in the Difcourfe; *Tis a prophaning of 
Nature, and bringing forth thofe Things (he has 
hallowed to Secrefy and Retirement, to the fcan- 
dalouS Indecency of publick Banter and Jeft. 

But Men, who have always fomethiiig to fay 
for their Foily, tell us, 'tis Cuftom odly which 
has made any of thefe things [uncommon ', and 
there's no Sin in fpeaking that which there is no 
Sin in doing. 

Let us grant them, that Cuftom only has done 
this : But if Cuftom has made thefe things uncom- 
mon, and conceal'd, or at leaft, banifh'd them 
from the Voice of Converfation. ^Tis a Sin then 
againft Cuftom to expofe them again. Lawful 
Cuftoms become allowed Virtues, and ought to 
be preferved. Cuftom is a good Reafon in fuch 
Concealments ; if Cuftom has lock'd them up, let 
them remain fo ; at leaft, till you can ^ivq a bet- 
ter Reafon for calling them abroad again, than 
Cuftom has given for reftraining them. Cuftom 
has made thefe things uncommon, becaufe that 
Sin, which firft made Nature naked, left her fo 
captivated, by fome of her Parts more than others, 
that fhe could not but blufh at thofe, where Sin 
haditaken up its peculiar Refidence. Now, as I 
noted before, no Man can with any tolerable Satif- 
fadion, expofe the Parts, till he Has firft abftra- 
^ed and feparated the Sin^ which having poflefs'4 

th€m>, 



them, cover'd them at fir ft with Shame: He 
tliat can do this, may go nakedj, and talk any 
thing. 

And for th^fame Reafon, no Man can Juftify 
talking lewdly, but he that at the fame Time 
throws away his Clothes, for to cover himfelf 
with his Hands, and uncover himfelf with his 
Tongue, are Contradictons in their own Nature, 
and one condemns the other. He that fcorns the 
Decency of Words, fhould alfo fcorn the Decen- 
cy o^ Cloches, let his Body be as bald as his 
Difcourfe, and let him icorn the Shame of one, as 
well as the Shame. of the other. 

It is no Sin, they fay, to talk of, what it is no 
Sin to do ; and I may add, 'tis no Sin at all to 
ihew, what'tis no Sin to defcribe. Why is the 
Eye robe lefs offended than theEar,lince both are 
but the common Organs of the Underflanding ? 

But the VV^cather and Inconveniencies of the 
Climate, are urged for clothing our Bodies, and 
I urge. Decency and good Manners for the Go- 
vernment of our Tongues j and let any one con- 
tend it with me, that thinks he can prove, that 
the Obligation of the iirft is greater than the 
Obligation of the laft. 

Much more might be faid to this, but I make 
but an Effay, and am unwilling to run out into a 
long Difcourfe. 




Of ' 



[ III J^ 



Of Talking faljly. 




Y Talking falfly, I do not defign to enter 
upon a long Differtation upon the Sin 
of Lying in general, I fuppofe all Men 
that read me will aclaiowledge Lying ta 
be one of the mofl fcandalous Sins between Man 
and Man ,* a Crime of a deep Dye^ and of an ex- 
tenfive Nature leading into innumerable Sins ; 
That isy as Lying is pradifed to deceive, to in- 
jure, betray, rob, deftroy, and the like. Lying 
in this Senfe is the concealing of all other Crimes, 
\is the Sheeps Clothing hung upon the Wolves 
back, ^tis the Pharifee's Prayer, the Whore's Blufli, 
the Hypocrite's Paint, the Murderer'^s Smile, the 
Thief's Cioke, 'tis Joays Embrace, and Judas^s 
Kifs ; in a Word, ^tis Mankind^s Darling-Sin, 
and the Devil's diftinguifiiing Charader. 

But this is not the C^fe I am upon, this is not 
the talking falfly I am upon, but a ilrange Liberty 
which (particularly in Converfation) People take 
to talk falfly, without charging themfelves with any 
offence in it, either againfi God orJMan: This is to be 
confidered in two or there Parts, not but that it has 
many more. 

I. The Liberty of telling Stories, a common 
Vice in Difcourfe ; the main End of this extraordi- 
nary Part of Tittle Tattle, is to divert the Com-^ 
pany, and make them laugh ; but we ought to con- 
fider, whether that very empty Satisfaction either 
t^ ourfelves or Friends, is to be purchafed at fo 

great 



great an Expence as that of Confcience, and of 
a Difhonour done to Truth* 

'Tis fcarce fit to fay, how far fome People go. 
in this Folly, to call it no worfe, even till fome- 
times they bring the general Credit of their 
Converfation into decay, and People that are ufed 
to them, learn to lay no Strefs upon any Thing 
they fay. 

For once we will fuppofe a Story to be in its' 
Subftance true, yet to what monftrous a Bulk 
doth it grow, by that frequent Addition put to 
it in the Relationj till not only it comes to be im- 
probable, but even impoffible to be true ; and the 
ignorant Relator is fo tickled with having made 
a good Story of it, whatever it was when he 
found it, that he is blind to the Abfurdities and 
Inconfiflencies of Fad: in Relation, and tells ic 
with a full Face, even, to thofe that are able 
to confute it, by proving it to be impoiUble. 

I once heard a Man who would have taken it 
very ill to be thought a Lyar, tell a Story, the 
Fads of which vsrere impoffible to be true ; and yet 
aflert it with fo much Affurance, and declare fo 
poiitively, that he had been an Eye-Witnefs of ic 
himfelf, that there was nothing to do but in refped 
to the Man, let him alone and [ay nothing. A 
Gentleman who fat by, and whofe good Breeding 
reftrained his Paffion, turn'd to him, and faid, did 
you fee this Thing donetSir ? yes, I did Sir, fays 
Relator : Well Sir, replies the Gentleman, finceycu. 
affirm that you did fee it, I am hound in regard to you 
to believe it ; but upon my Word, \is fuch a Thing, 
that if I hadfeen it myfelfy J would not have believed 
it : This broke the Silence, fet all the Company a 
laughing, and expofed the Falfhood, more than 
down right telling him ft was a Lye, which might 
befides have made a Broil about it, 

^Tis 



'Ti^ a ftrange Thing, that we cannot be con* 
teiic to tell a Story as it is, but we muil take from 
it on one Side, or add to it on another ; till the 
Fad is loft among i\\q Addenda, and till inTime even 
the Man himfelf remembring it only as he told it 
laft, really forgets how it was Originally ; this 
being fo generally pradifed now, nothing is more 
common, than to have two Men tell the fame 
Story quite differing one from another, yet both 
of them Eye- VVitnefl'es to the Fad related. Thefe 
are that fort of People, who having once told a 
Story faiflj, tell it fo often in the fame or like 
manner, till they really believe it to be true. 

This fupplying a Story by Invention, is certainly 
a moft fcandalous Crime and yet very little regarded 
in that Part, it is 2l fort of Lying that makes a great 
Hole in the Heart, at which by Degrees a Habic 
of Lying enters in : Such a Man comes quick- 
ly up, to a total difregarding the Truth of what he- 
fays, looking upon it as a Trifle, a Thing of no 
import, whether any Story he tells be true or no, 
fo it but commands the Company as they call it v 
that is to fay,procures a Laugh,or a kind of Amaze- 
ment Things equally agreeable, to thefe Story^ 
Tellers ; for the Bufinefs is to affed the Com?- 
pany, either ftartle them^with fomething wonder- 
ful, never heard of before; or make them laugh 
immoderately, as at fomething prodigioufly ti.-^ 
king, witty, and diverting. 

It is hard to plac^this Pradice in a Station e- 
qual to its Folly ,'tis aMcannefs below the Digni-^ 
ty of common Senfe : They that lye to gain, to 
deceive, to delude, to betray as above, have fome 
End in theiv Wickednefs ; and chough they can- 
nbt give the Defign for an excufe of their Crime>- 
yet it may be given as the Reafon a^d Founda- 
tion of it : But to Ive for Sport, for Furi) as the 



I 114 3 

Boys expyefsk, is to play at Shuttle-cock with your 
Soul, and load your Confcience for the meer fakq 
<>f being a Fool, and the making A meer BufooRty 
of a Story, the Fleafure of what is below even 
Madnefs icfelf. 

And yet, how common fs this Folly ? How* 
is it the Chara<fl:er of fome Men's Converfation, 
that they are made up of Story ? And how mean 
a Figure is it they bear ia Company B Such Me» 
always betray thefr Emptinefs by this^ and ha- 
ving only a certain Number of Tales in thei^ 
Budget, like a Pedlar with his Pack, they caa 
only at every Houfe fhew the fame Ware over 
again, tell the fame Story over and over, \ii\ the 
Jefl is quite worn out ; and to convince us, that 
much of it, if not all^ is born of Invention, they 
feldom tell it the fame Way twiccy but vary i% 
even in the moft material Fa^s: Sothat though 
it i^ay be remembred, that it was ^he fame Story,* 
it ought never to b^ remembred, that it was told 
.by the fame Man. 

With what Temper flroiiM I fpeak of thefe 

People ? What Words can exprefs the Mcannefe 

andBafenefsof theMind, that cando thus? that fin 

wirhout Defign, and not only have no End in 

the View, but even no Reflexion in the Ad : the 

Folly is grown up to a Habit, and they not only 

mean no III, but indeed mean nothing at all in it. 

Ic is a ftrange Length that fome People 

. run m this Madnefs of Life, and it is. fo odd, fo 

unaccountable, that indeed \ii difficult to defcribe 

the Man, rho' not difficult to defcribe the Fad: 

what Idea can be form'd in the Mind, of a Man, 

who does i\i without meaning ill ? that wrong* 

himfelf, affronts- Truth, and impofes upon his 

Friends, and yet means noHarm ; or to u(q his own 

^Qxdh i^eans nothing ? That i^ he thinks any 

Thing 



[ 115 ] 

Thing, 'tis to make the Company pleafailt, and 
what is this but making the Circle a *Stage, and 
himfelt the Merry Andrew. 

The beft Step ftich Men can take is to LYE 
ON i a}2d this jhevjs the Sifigularity of the Crime ; it 
isa ftrange ExprejTionjbut I (hall make it out ; their 
Way is^ i fay, to Lye on ; 'till their Charader is 
compleatly known, and then they can lye no long- 
er j for he whom no Body believes, can deceive no 
Body, and then the Eiience of Lying is removed j for 
the Defcription of a Lye is, that 'tis fpoken to 
deceive, or 'tis a Defign to deceive. Now, he 
that no Body believes, can never iye any more> 
becaufe no Body can be deciev'd by him. Such 
a Man's Chara6ter is a Bill upon his Forehead, by 
which every Body knows, Here dwells a Lying 
tongue : When every Body knows what is to be 
had of him, they know what to exped i and fo 
no Body is deceiv'd ; if they believe him after- 
wards, 'tis their Fault as much as his. 

There are a great many Sorts of thofe People, 
who make it their Buiinefs to go about telling 
Stories ; it would be endlefs to enumerate themy 
(ome tell formal Stories forg'd in their own Brain 
withoutanyRetrofpedeitheronPerfons or Things; 
I mean, as to any particular Perfon, or Paffaga 
known, or in Being, and only with the ordinary 
Introdudion of, T'here was a Man^ or, there was 
a Woman, and the like. 

Others again, out of the fame Forge of Inven-^ 
tion, hammer out the very Perfon, Man or Wo- 
man, and begin, / knew the Man, or I knew the Wo- 
man, and rhefe ordinarily vouch their Story with 
more AiTurance than others ; and vouch alfo, that 
they knew the Perfons who were concern'd in it. 

The felling or writing a Parable, or an alkn 
£ve ailogoricTv Hiftory is quite a different Cafe, 

I 2r and 



and is always DiflinguifLt from this other Jeft- 
ing with Truth ; that it is dcdgnd and efFediually 
turn'd for inflrudive and upright Ends, and has 
its Moral juflly apply'd : Such are the hiftorical 
Parables in the holy Scripture, fuch the Pilgrims 
Progrefs, and fuch in a Word the Adventures of 
your fugitive Friend, Robinfon Crufoe. 

Others make no Scruple to relate real Stories 
with innumerable Omiffions and Additions : I 
mean, Stories which have a real Exigence in Faci:, 
but which by the barbarous Way of relating, be- 
come as romantick and falfe, as i^ they had no real 
Original. Thefe Tales, like the old Galley of 
Venice^ which had been fo often new vamped, 
doubl'd and redoubled, that there was not one 
Piece of the firil Timber in her, have been told 
wrong fo often, and fo many Ways, 'till there 
would not be one Circumftnnce of the real Story 
left in the relating. 

There are many more Kinds of thefe, fuch 
namely, as are perfonal and malicious, full of 
Slander and Abufe ; but thefe are not of the 
Kinds I am fpeaking of; the prefent Bufinefs is 
among a Kind of white Devils, who do no 
Harm or Injury to any but to themfelves; they 
are like the GraGiopper, that fpends his Time 
to divert the Traveller, and does nothing but 
ftarve himfelf The Converfation of thefe Men 
IS full oj Emptinefs, their Words are Levity itfelf, 
and according to the Text, they not only tell Un- 
truths, but the 'Truth is not in them. There is not 
a fettl'd Awe or Reverence of Truth upon their 
Minds ; 'tis a Thing of .»^o Value to them, 'tis 
not regarded in their Difcourfe, and they give 
themfelves a Liberty to be perredly unconcern'd 
about the Thing they fay, or the S^ory they tell, 
whether it be true, or no. 

This 



[ I:I7 ] 

Thi^ is a mofl abominable P.ra^lce ort another 
Account^ namely^ that thcfe lyfeii make a Jeft of 
iCheir Crime i they are a Sore of People that Sia 
laughing ; that play upon their Souls as a Man 
plays upon a Fiddle, to make other People dange 
and wear itfelf out ; they .^lay be faid to make 
•(bme Sport indeec^ but it is all at themfelves, 
they are the Heai;ers Comedy and their own Tra- 
gedy ; .and like a penitent Jack-pudding, they will 
^c laft fay, I have made others n^erry^ but }. havp 
•been the Fool. 

I would be glad to fliame Men of ,commqj5 
Senfe, out^ot this horrid Piece of Buffoonry ; and 
one Thing I would warn them of,* oamely, thac 
their learning to Lye fo currently in Story, will 
infeniibly bring them to a bold entrenching upon 
Truth, in the reft of their Converfatiqn ; the 
Scripture Command is, Lt every Man /peak Truth 
unto his Neighbour; if we muft tell Stories, tell 
•them as Stories, .add nothing willfully to illuftrate 
orfet it forth ini:he Relation^ i'i you doubt the 
Truth of it, fay fo, and then every one will be at 
iLiberty to bel eve their Share of it. 

Befidesj there is a fpreading Evil in telling a 
falfe Story as true, namely, that you put it into 
the Mouths of others, and it continues a brooding 
Forgery to the End of Time j 'tis a Chimney-corner 
iRomance, and has in it this diftinguifhing Article, 
that whereas Parables, and the Inventions of Men 
publifh'd Hiftorically, are once for ail related;^ 
,and the Moral being drawn, the Hiftory re- 
mains allufive only, as it was intended, as in feve-

are laying for handing on the Sport of Lying, for

^n Essay on the pnfent State af 
Religion m th Worlds 




N that Part of my Work, which may 
be called Hiftory, I have fre- 
quently mention'd the unconque- 
rable Impreflions which dwelt up- 
on jny Mind, and fiiiM up ail my 
'. Deiires immoveably prefTing me to a wandring 
traveilfiig Life^ and which pufli'd me continually 
on, from one Adventure to another, as you have 
heard. , ' ;^ 

There is an in^ohfiderate Temper 'which fef ghs 
in lour Minds, that hurries'us down the Stream of 
our Affedions, by a kind of involuntary Agency, 



and makes us do a thoufand things. 



in the doing 



of 



which ^ we propofe nothing to our felves, but an 
immediate Siibjedion to our WILL, that is to 
fay, our Paflion, even without .,the Concurrence 
of our Underftandings, and of which v^e can give 
very little Account, ^/^€r '^/.f Jo*i;^. 

You may nowfuppofeme to be arrived, after a 
long Courfe of infinite Variety, on the Stage of 
the World, to the Scene of Life, we call Qld^Age ; 
and that I am writing thefe Sheets in a Seafon of 
my Time, wben (if ever) a Man may befuppofed 
1 4 capable 



[ m 1 

capable of m^a^Titr^ Juft Reflexions upon things 
paft, a true Judgement of things prefent, and 
tolerable Conclufions of things to come. 

In the Beginning of this Life of Conipofure ; for 
now, and not till now, I may fay, that X begun to 
live, that is to fay, a fedate and xompos^d Life, 
1 enquired of my felf very ferioufly one Day, what 
was the proper Bufinefs of old 4ge ? The Anfwer 
was very natural, and indeed return'd quick upon 
?nc, namely, that two things were my preC^nt 
Work, as above. 

1. Refledion upon things paft. 

2. Serious Application to things future. 

Haying r^folv'd the Bufinefs of Life into thef<p 
Heads, I began imrpediatply with- the Firft; and 
as fome Times I took my Pen and Ink to disbur- 
then my Thoughts, when the Subjed crowded in 
fafl upon me ; fo I have here communicated fome 
of my Obfervations for the Benefit of thofe that 
come after me. 

About the Time that I was upon thefe Enqui^ 
ries, being at a Friend's Houfe, and talking much 
«f my long Travels, us you know Travellers are apt 
to do ; 1 obferv^'d an antient Gentlewopian in the; 
Company liiien'd with a great deal of Attention, 
and as I thought, with fome Pleafurc, to what I 
was faying : And after I had done, Pray Sir, fays 
Pn-y turning her Speech to mc, give me Leave to 
ask you a Queflion or two ? IVith aQ my Heart ^^ 
Madam^ faid U ^9 we began the follovving ihort 
Dialogue. 

Old Gent. Pray Sir, in all yoqr Travels, can yoq 
pell what is the World a-doing? What have you 
pjferv'd to be the principal Bufinefs of Mankind ? 

■ M 



[Ill ] 

Rcb.Cru, Truly Madam, 'tis very hard to an- 
fwer fuch a Queftion, the People being (o diffe- 
rently employ'd, fome oneWay, and fome another ; 
and particularly, according to the feveral Parts of 
thp World, thro' which our Obfervations are to 
run, and according to the differing Manners, Cu- 
ftoms, and Circumftances of the People in every 
Place. 

Old Qent, Alas ! vS'/r,that is no Anfwer at all to 
me, becaufe I am not a Judge of the differing 
Cpftoms and Manners of the People you may 
fpeak of : But, Is there not one common End and 
Defign in the Nature of Men, which feems to 
run thro^ all their Adions, and to be formed by 
Nature, as the main End of Life, and by Confe- 
quence is made the chief Bufinefs of Living? Pray, 
how do they fpend their Time ? 

R.C. Nay^ now Madam you have added a 
QuefUon to the refl, of a d.fterent Nature from 
what, if I take you right, you meant at firft. 
014 Gem. What Queflipn, Sir ? 
R.C. Why! how Mankind fpend their Time; 
for I cannot fay, that one half of Mankind fpend 
their Time in what they themfelves may acknow- 
Icdp'e to be the main End of Ljfp. 

Old Gent, Pray, don't di&inguifti me out of piy 
Queflion, we may talk of what is the true End of 
Life, as we underflood it here in a Chriflian Coun- 
try another Time : But take my QuelHon as I 
offer it, What is Mankind generally a doing as theig 
main Bufinefs ? 

R* C Truly, the main Bufinefs that Mankind 
feems to be doing, is to eat and drink, that's their 
Enjoyment, and to get Food to eat is their Em- 
ployment, including a littlq their eating and 
devouring one another. 

CldGeii^ 



i I 



[12X3 

Old Genu That's a Defcription of them as 

Brutes. 

R. C It is fo in the Firft Part, namely, their 
Living to eat and drink: But in the laft Part they 
;are worfe than the Brutes; for the Brutes deftroy; 
not their own Kind, but all prey upon a different 
Species ,* and befides, they prey upon one another, 
for NecelTity, to fatisfy their Hunger, and for 
Food: But Mian for bafer Ends, fuch as Ava- 
rice, Envy, Revenge, and the like; devours his 
bwr SpecieSj nay, his own Flefh and Blood, as 
my Lord Rochefter very well exprefl'es it. 

But judge your felfy I'll bring it to the Tefiy 
Which is thebafefl Creaturey Man or Beafl, 
Birds feed on Birds, Beafis en each ether Prey, 
But Savage Man alone, does Man betray. 

: Vrejsd hy Neceffity,- they kill for Food, 
Man, undoes Man, to do himfelfno Good. 
With "Teeth and Claws, hy Nature arm d they hunt. 
Nature's Allowance to Jupply their Want: 

. But Man 'with Smiles, embraces, Friendjhip, Praife, 
Inhumanly his Fellows Lifie betrays. 
With volu'nfary Pains works his Diflrefs, 
Nvtfor Neceffity^ but Wantonnefs. 

!.■ Old Gent. All this I believe is true; but this 
does not reach my Queflion yet : There is cer- 
tainly fomething among them, which is efleemed 
as more particularly the End of Life, and of Living, 
than the reft ; to which they apply in common, 
^s the main Bufincfs, and which it is alway cfteem- 
cd to be their Wifd am to be employed in : Is there 

not 



[ 1^3] 

not fomething that is apparently the, great Bufinefs 
of Living? 

R. C. Why really, Madam, I think not. Fpr 
Example : Great Part of the World, and a- 
greater Part by far than we imagine, is refolv'd in- 
to the lowefl Degeneracy of human Nature, I 
mean the Savage Life ; where the chief End of 
Life feems to be mcerly to eat and drink, that is 
to fay, to get their Food, juft as the brutal Life 
is employM, and indeed with very little Difference 
between them ; for except only Speech and Ido- 
latry, I fee nothing in the Lite of feme whole Na- 
tions of People, and for ought I know, containing 
Millions of Souls, in which the Life of a Lion or 
an Elephant in the Defarts of Arabia^ is not e- 
qual. 

Old Gent. I could mention many things, Sir, in 
which they might differ, but that is not the pre- 
fent thing I enquire about : But, pray Sir, Is not 
Religion the pruicipal Bufinefs of Mankindjn all 
the Parts of the IVoridj fori think you granted 
it when you nam'd Idolatry, which they,.i1o doubt, 
call Religion ? 

R. C Really, Madam, I cannot fayitisibecaufe, 
what with Ignorance on one hand, and Hypocri- 
fy on the other, ^tis very hard to know where to 
find Religion in the World. 

Old Gem. You avoid my Qiieftion too laboriouf- 
ly, Sir, I have nothing to do either with the Ig- 
norance or Hypoqrify of the People, whether they 
are blindly devou^f, or knavifhl}' and defignedly de- 
vout, is not the Cafe ; but whether Religion is 
not apparently the main Bufinefs of the Worlds the 
principal apparent End of Life, and the Employ- 
ment of Mankind? 

li C\ Whae do you call Religion ? 

Old Gcn\ 



Old Genu By Religion, I mean, the WorOiip- 
ping and Paying Homage to feme fupreme Being, 
tome God, knoxm or unkaowjty is not to the Cafe, 
fe it be but to fomething counted fupreme. 

R. C, It is true, Madam, there are fcarce any 
J^arions in the World fo flupid, but they give Te- 
itimony to the Being of a God^ and have fomc No- 
tion of a fupreme Power. 

Old Gent, That I knowalfo, but that is nox. the 
snain Part of my Qiieflion : But my Opinion is^ 
that paying a divine Worfhip, Ads of Homage and 
Adoration, and particularly, that of Praying to 
the Supreme Being, which they acknowledge, \% 
deriv^'d to Mankind from the Light of Nature, 
with the Notion or Belief itfelf. 

R, C. I fuppofe Madam, you mean by the Que- 
fdon then. Whether the Notion or Belief of a God 
in general, afid the Senfe of Worlliip in particu- 
lar, are not one and the fame natural Principle. 

OldGmt. I do fo, if you and I do but agree 
about what we call Worfhip, 

R, C. By Worfhip, I underftand Adoration. 

Old Gem. But there you and I differ again a li^ 
tie; for by Worfliip, I underftand Supplication. 

R.rC. Then you muft take them both in toge^ 
ther ; for fome Part .of the Indiajti Ravages only 
adore. 

Old Gent. I confefs there is much Adoration, 
where there is little Supplication. 

R, C. You diflinguifh too nicely, Madam. 

Old Gent No, -no, I 4o .not diflinguifh in whaf 
I call Worfhip ; I alledge, that all the Adora- 
tion of thofe poor Savages is mere Supplication : 
You fay they lift up their Hands to their Idols, for 
Fear rhcy fliould hurt them. 

R C. I do fay fo, and it is apparent. 

Old Gem, 



[ 125 ] 

Old Gent. Why, that is the famt tlrfr.g,' for thcii 
they lift up their Hands to him, that is to ra\ ., 
pray to him not to hurt them ; for all the Wor- 
fhip in the World, efpecially the outward Per- 
formance, may be refolv'd into Supplication. 

R. R, I agree with you in that, if you mean the 
apparent End oi Worftiip. 

Old Gent, Why ! did not yoi^r Man Friday and 
the Sa'vage Woman you tell us of, talk of their 
old Idol they called Benamtickee ? Ai^ what did 
they do? 

R. C, It is very true they did. 

Old Gent, And did not Friday tell yocj they 
went up to the Hills, and (aid O to him ? Pray, 
what was the Meaning of faying to him : But 
do not hurt us ; for thou art Omnipotent, 
and canft kill us : O heal our Diftempers ; for tliou 
art Infinite, a.nd canll do all things : O give us 
what we want; for thou art Bountiful ,- Ofpare 
as; for thou art Merciful; Aadfo of all the other 
Conceptioiis of a God ? 

R.C. Well, Madam, Igrant all th-is, pray whal 
do you infer from it? What is the Rcafon of your 
Queflion? 

Old Gem O Sir, I have many Inferences t® 
draw from it for my own Obfervation, I do^ nos 
fee up to iniiru(9: you. 

I thought this ferious old Lady \^'-ould have en- 
tertained a farther Difeourfe with me on fo fruit- 
ful a Subje<5t ; but flie declined it, and left me t(^ 
my own Meditation, which indeed fhe had raxs'd 
up to an unufual Pitch : And the firfl: thing £hat, 
occurred to me, was to put me upon enquiring 
after rhat nice things I ought lo call Religion, in 
the World i feeing really I found Reafon to thir^k^ 

that 



that there was much raore Devotion than Religion 
in the World ; in a Word, much more Adoration 
than Supplication : And I doubt, as I come nearer 
Home, it will appear, that there is much more 
Hypocrify than Sincerity : Of which I may fpeak 
IhykkM 

In my firfl Enquiries, I lookM back upon my 
own Travels, and it afforded me but a melancho- 
ly Refledion, that in all the Voyages and Tra- 
vels which I have empIoyM two Volumes in giving 
a Relation of, I never fet my Foot in a Chriftian 
Country, no not in circling three Parts of the 
Globe ; for, excepting the Brajilsy where the 
Portuguefe indeed profefs'd the Roman-Catholick 
Principles, which however, in Diftindion from 
Paganifm, I will call the Chriftian Religion; I 
lay,, except the Brajils, where alfo I made little 
Stay, I could not be faid to fet Foot in a Chrifti- 
an Cbun try, or a Country inhabited by Chriftians> 
from the Bay of Z^ V«c/?^, and the Port of Salke^ 
by the Straits Mouth,, where I efcapM from SUvo- 
xy, thro' the Atlantkk Ocean, the Coafts of 
Afrkkonono. Side, and oi Canibbea on the Ameri- 
can Shore, on the other Side ; from thence to Ma^ 
dagafcar^ Malabar^ and the Bay and City of Bon^ 
guky the Coaft of Sumatra, Malacca, Siam, Cambo-^ 
dia, Cochincbina, the Empire and Coaft of Chiuay 
the Defarts oi Karakathay, the Mongnl Tartars, the 
Siberiany the Samoiede Ba'ibarians, and till I came 
within four or five Days of Arch- Angel in the Black 
Ruffia. 

It is, I fay, a melancholy Refledion to think, 
how all thcfe Parts of the World, and with infinite 
Numbers of Mil .ions of People, furnifh'd with the 
Powers of Rcafon^ and Gifts of Nature, and ma- 
ny Ways, if nor ev<:ry Way, as capable of the 
Reception of fublime things, as we are, are yet 

aban- 



[ 1^7 1 

abandon^ to the grofleft Ignorance afid Depra- 
vity ; and that not in Religion only, but even in 
all the defirable Part$ of humane Knowledge, 
and efpecially Science and acquired Knowledge, 

What the Divine Wifdom has determined con- 
cerning the Souls of fo many Millions, it is hard 
to conclude, nor is it my prefcnt Delign to en-^ 
quire,* but this I may be allow'dhere, as a Re- 
mark : If they are received to Mercy in a Fila- 
ture State, according to the Opinion of fome, 
as having not fin^'d againft faving Light, then their 
Ignorance and Pagan Darknefs is not a Curfe,^ bur 
a Felicity ,* and there are no unhappy People in 
the World, but thofe loft among Chriflians, for 
their Sins againft reveal'd Light ; nay, then being 
born in the Regions of Chriflian Light, and un- 
der the Revelation of the Gofpel Do^rines, is nof 
fo much a Mercy to be acknowledged as fome 
teach us, and it may in a negative Manner be true, 
that the Chriftian Religion is an Efficient in the 
Condemnation of Sinners, and lofes more than it 
faves, which is impious but to imagin : On the o- 
ther Hand,, if all thofe Nations are concluded 
under the Sentence of eternal Abfence from God, 
which is Hell in the Abftrad ; then what becomes 
of all the fceptical Dodrines of its being incoa- 
fiflent with the Mercy and Goodnefs of an infi-^ 
nite and beneficent Being, to condemn fo great a 
Part of the World, for not believing in him of 
whom they never had any Knowledge orlnilru- 
^ion ? But I delire not to be the Promoter of un- 
anfwerable Doubts in Matters of Religion ^ much 
lefs wonld I promote Cavils at the Foundations 
of Religion, either as to its Profeffion or Pradice^ 
and therefore I only name Things. Ireturn to my 
Enquiry after {leligioa as we generally underftand 
the Word* > 

Andi 



[u8] 

And irl this I confine my felf in my prefent Enqui* 
ries to the particular Nations profefllng the Chri- 
flian Religion only, and I fiiall take Notice after- 
ward, what influence the want of Religion has 
upon the Manners the Genius, and the Capaci- 
ties of the People, as to all the improvable Parts of 
human Knowledge. 

The Moors of Barbary are Mahometans^ and that 
of the moft degenerate and unpolifhed Sort, efpe- 
cially of that Part of the World where they live ; 
they are cruel as Beafts, vicious,, infolent, and in-^ 
human as degenerated Nature can make them : 
Moral Vertues have To little recommended them- 
feives to any among them, that they are accounted 
no Accomplifliment, and are in no Efteem ; nor is 
a Man at all refpccted for being grave, fober, ju- 
dicious> or wife, or for being juft in his Dealings, 
ormofteafy in his Convcrfation j but Rapine and 
Injury is the Cuftom of the Place ,* and it is to re- 
commend a great Man, that he is rich, powerful 
in Slaves, mercilefs in his Government of them, 
and imperioufly haughty in his whole Houfhold. 
Every Man is a King within himfelf, and regards 
neither Juftice or Mercy, Humanity or Civility, 
cither to them above him, or them below him, 
but juft as his arbitrary Paflions guide him. 

Religion here is confin'd to the Btram and the 
Ramadan^ the Feaft and the Faft, to the Mofque 
and the Bath ; reading the Alcoran on one Hand, 
and performing rhe Wafhings and Purifications on 
the other, make up their religious Exercifes; and 
fortherefl, Converfation is eaten up with Bar- 
barifms and Brutifh Cufloms ; fo that there's nei- 
ther Society, Humanity, Confidence in one ano- 
ther, or Converfation with one another i but Men 
live like the wild Beafts, for every Man here reah 
iy would deftroy and devour the other if he could. 

This 



[ 129 ] 

This guided me to a jufl Refledlon, in Hd- 
Muv of the Chriftian Religion, which I have of- 
ten fince made Ufe of, and which on this Occa- 
fion I will make a DfgrefTiou to, uiz.. That it is to 
be faid for the Reputation of the Chriftian Religi- 
on in general, and by which it is juftly diftin- 
guifli'd from all other Religions, that where-ever 
Chriftianity has been planted or profefs'd natio- 
nally in the World, even where it has not had a 
Sa'ving Influence, it has yet had a Civilizing Influ- 
ence : It has operated upon the Manners, the Mo- 
rals, the Politics, and even the Tempers and 
Difpofitions of the People : It has reduced them to 
the Praftice of Virtue, and to the true Methods 
of Living, has weaned them from the Barharous 
Cufl:oms they had been ufed to, infufing a Kind 
of Humanity and Softnefs of Difpofition into their 
very Natures,* civilizing andgfoftning them, teach- 
ing them to love a Regularity of Life, and filling 
them with Principles of generous Kindnefs and 
Beneficence one to another,* in a Wordj it has 
taught them to live like Men, and ad upon the 
Foundations of Clemency, Humanity, Love, and 
and good Neighbourhood, fuitable to the Nature 
and Dignity of God's Image, and to the Rules of 
Juftice and Equity, which it inftrufe them in. 

Nay farther, I muft obferve alfo. That as the 
Chriftian Religion has worn out, or been remo- 
ved from any Country, and they have returned to 
Heathenifm and Idolatry, fo the Barbarifms have 
return'd, the Cuftoms o^ the Heathen Nations have 
been again reftor^d ^ the very Nature and Temper of 
the People, have been again loft ; all their generous 
Principles have forlaken themj the Softnefs and 
Goodnefs of their Difpofitions have worn out, 
and they have returned to Cruelty, Inhuinaiaity2, 
Kapin, and Blood.

C 130] ^ 

It is true, and it may be nam'd as an Obie- 
aion to this Remark of mine, that the Romans 
tho' Heathens, and the Grecians by the Study of 
Philofophyj in particular Perfbns, and by the 
Excellency of their Government in their general 
or national Capacity, were fiiTd with Notions of 
Virtue and lionour, with mofl: generous and juft 
Principles, and acted with an heroic Mind in 
many Occafions ; pradifing th€ moft fublime and 
exalted Height ot Virtue, fuch as facriiicing their 
\.i\'^s for their Countryv with the utmoftZeaU 
di;^iczmm^ to great Examples of Humanity and 
Beneficence, fcorning to do bafe or vile Actions, 
as unworthy the Roman Name, to fave thei^ 
Lives-; and a great many m*oft excellent Examples 
of Virtue and Gallantry, are found in the Hiiio- 
ries of t\\t Roman Empires. 

This does not oppole, it rather indeed illuftrate^ 
what I fay; for with all the Philofophy, all the 
Hiuitaniryand Generofity they pradis'd, they had 
yet their Remains of Barbarity, w^ere cruel and 
unmerciful in their Natures, as appear'd by the 
Barbarity of their Cufloms^, fuch as throwing Ma- 
lefactors to wild Beails, the Fightings oi their 
Gladiators, and the like^ which were not only 
appointed as Punidimtnts and Severities, by the 
Order of Public Juilice ', but to fhew it touched the 
very Article I am upon, ii was the Subjed of 
their Sport and Diveriion, thefe Things were ex- 
hibited as Shows to entertain the Ladies \ the 
Cutting in Pieces fourty or fifty Slaves, and the 
Seeing twenty or thirty miferable Creatures thrown 
to tliC Lyons and Tygers, was no lefs pleafant to 
them, than the Going to fee an Opera, a Mafque- 
rade, or a Puppet Show, is to us i So that I 
think, the Romans, were very far from a People ci- 
vijz'd and foften'd in their Natures by the Lifiu- 

ences 



[ ^l ] 



encss of Religion And this is evident, becaufe> 
that as the Chnflian Religion came amon<^ them* 
all thofe cruel Cuftoms were abhorred by them, the 
famous Theatres and Circles for their publick 
Sports, were overthrown, and the Ruines of 
them teftify the Juftice of my Obfervation at this 
very Day. 

Kor will it be deny'd, if I fhould carry this yet 
farther, and obferve. That even among Chriftians, 
thofe who are more reformed, and farther and far- 
ther chriflianiz'd, are ftiU in Proportion rendred 
more human, more foft and tender j and we do 
find, without being partial to our felves, that even 
the Proteftant Countries are much diilinguilh'd in 
the Humanity and Softnefs of their Tempers, the 
meek mercitul Difpofition extends more among 
Proteftants, than among the Papifts, as I could 
very particularly demonflrate from Hiftory and 
Experience. 

But to return back to the Moores, where I left 
off, they are an Inftance of that Cruelty of Difpo- 
fition, which was anciently in their Nature^ and 
how in a Country abandoned of the true Chriilian 
Religion, after it has been firfl planted and pro- 
fefs'd among them, the Return of Heathenifra or 
Mahometan ifm has brought back with it all the 
Barbarifms of a Nation void of Religion and good 
Nature. 

I faw enough of thefe dreadful People to think 
them at this Time the word of all the Nations of 
the World ; a Nation, where no fuch thing as a 
generous Spirit, or a Temper with any Compaf- 
iion mixt with it, is to be found ; among whom 
Nature appears ftripp*d of all the additional Glo- 
ries, which it derives from Religion, and yet where- 
on a Chrilh'an flourifhing Church had flood feve^al 
hundred Year$. • 

K 2 From 



[ I^i ] 

Fr^tn tliefe I went avnong the Negroes of Afri^ 
ca; many of them I faw without any the leaft.No- 
tion of a Deity among them, much lefs any Form 
ofVVorfhip; but I had not any Occafion to con- 
verge with them on Shore, other than I have done 
fince by Accident, but went away to the Brajils : 
Here Ifoundlrhe Natives, and thateven before the 
Porf/^^?^e/^ came among them, and fince alfo, had 
Abundance of Religion, J^u/o as it was : But it 
was all fo bloody, (o cwcl; eonfiflingof Murders, 
human Sacrifices, Witchcrafts, Sorceries^ and Con- 
jurings, that I could not io much as call them ho- 
nell Pagans^ as I do the Negroes. 

As for the Cannibals, as 1 have obferv^d in the 
Difcourfe of them, on Account of their Landing 
on my Ifland, I can fay but very little of them : 
As for their eating human Flefh, I take it to be a 
Kind of martial Rage, rather than a civil Pra- 
dice ,• for "'tis evident, they eat no human Crea- 
tures, but fuch as are taken Prifoners in their Bat- 
tles ; ^nd as I have obfervM in giving the Account 
of thofe things, they do not Efleem it Murder, no 
nor fo much as unlawful. I muft confef^, faving 
its being a Practice in itfelf unnatural, efpcciafly 
tons, I fay, faving that Part, I fee littleD'ifference 
between that and our Way, vt^hich in the War is 
frequent in Heatof Adion, 'viz,, refufing Quarter ; 
for as to the Difference between Eating and Kil- 
ling thofe that offer to yield, it matters not much.. 
And this I obferved at the fame Time, that in 
their other Condud, thofe Savages were as human, 
as mild, andgentie, as itiofl I have met with in 
the World, and as eafily civilized. 

From thefe Sorts of People, I come' to the Indi-' 
fins ; for as to the Madagafcar Men, I faw very 
little of them, but that they were a Kind of Ne-* 
groes, much like thofe on the Coail of Guinea, on- 



[ I« ] 

ly, a little more ufed and accuftomed to the Euro- 
jpeaJtSy by their often Landing among them. 

The E. Indians are generally Pagans or Mahome- 
tans, and have fuch Mixtures oi Savage Cuftoms 
with them, that even Mahometanifm is there in 
its Corruption ; neither have they there, the up- 
right juft Dealing in Matters of Right and Wrong, 
which the Turks in Europe have, with whom 'tis 
generally very fafe trading : But here they ad all 
the Parts of Thieves and Cheats, watching to de- 
ceive you, and proud of being thought able to 
do it. 

The Subjeds of the great Mogul have a feeming 
polite Government ; and the Inhabitants of Cey- 
lon are under very ftrid Difcipline ; and yet what 
Difficulty d o we find to trade with them ? Nay, 
their very Oeconomy renders them fraudulent, 
and in fome Places they cannot turn their 
Thoughts to being honeft. 

China h famous for Wifdom, that is to fay ^ thgt 
they, having fuch a boundlefs Conceit of their own 
Wifdom, we are oblig'd to allow them more tham 
they have ; the Truth is^ they are juflly faid to be 
a wife Nation among the fooliili ones, and may 
as juftly be called a Nation of Fools among th^ 
wife ones. 

As to their Religion, 'tis all fumm'd up in Con- 
Jiicius hi^ Maxims, whofe Theplogy, I take to 
be a Rhapfody of Moral Conclufions ^ a Founda- 
tion, or what we may call Elements of Polity^ 
Morality and Superilition, huddl'd together in a 
Rhapfody of Words, Vs^itliout Confiftency, and 
indeed with very little Reafoning in it : Then 'tis 
leally not lo much as a refin'd Paganifm, for 
there are in my Opinion much more regular Do- 
ings among fome of the Indians that are Pagans \^ 
America^ than there ^xcinChina : And if I may be- 

K 3 JieVe 



[.'^34 3 

lieve the Account given of the Government of 
Monte%>uma in Mexico^ and of the Uncaps of Oufco 
in Peru; their Worfiiip and Religion fuch as it 
was, was carry 'd on with more Regularity than 
thefe in China. As to the human Ingenuity ^ as they 
call it, of the Chinefesy Filial! account for it by itfelf : 
The utmoO; Difcoveries of it tome appear'd in the 
Mechanicks, and even in them infinitely fhort of 
of what is found among the European Nations. 

But let us take thefe People to Pieces a little, 
and examine into the great Penetration, they are 
fo fam'd for: Firft of all, their Knowledge has 
not led them that Length in religious Matters, 
which the common Notions of Philofophy would 
have done, and to which they did lead the wife Hea- 
thens of Old among the Grecian and Roman Em- 
pires ; iori they having not the Knowledge of the 
true God, preferv^'d notwithftanding, the Notion 
of a God to be fomething Immortal, Omnipo- 
tent, fublime ; exalted above in Place, as well as 
Authority; and therefore made Heaven to be 
the Seat of their Gods, and the Images by 
which they reprefented the Gods and Goddeiles, 
had always fome Perfedions that were really to be 
admir'd ; as the Attendants of their Gods, as 

?upiter was cali'd the Thunderer, for his Power ^ 
ather of Gods and Men, for his Seniority ; Ve- 
nus ador'd for her Beauty; Mercury ioi Swiftnefs ; 
Apollo for Wit, Poetry, Mufick ; Mars for Terror 
and Gallantry in Arms, and the like : But when 
we come to thefe polite Nations oi China, which 
yet we cry up for Senfe, and Greatnefs of Genius, 
we fee them groveling in the very Sink and Filth 
ofldolatry ; their Idols are the mofl frightful mon- 
flrous Shapes, not the Form of any real Creature, 
much lefs the Images of Virtue, of Chaftity, of Li- 
terature 3 but horrid Shapes of their Priefls Inven- 
tion j

tion ; neither heljifh or hratian Monflers composed 
jof invented Forms, with neither Face or Fi;.;ure, 
but with the utmofl: Diiiortions, formed neither to 
walk, ftand^ fly, or go; neither to hear, iee, or 
fpeak, but meerly to inilill horrible Ideas of fome- 
rhing naufeous and abcminable, into the Minds 
of Men that ador'd them. 

If I may be allowed to givp my Notions of Wor- 
ihip, I mean, as it relates to the Objeds oi natut- 
ral Homage, where the Name and Nature oi God 
is not reveal'd, as m the ChriTrian Religion. Imuft 
acknowledge, the Sun^ the Moon, the Stars, the 
Elements, as in the Pagan and Heathen Nations 
pfold; and above all rhefe, the Reprefentations of 
fuperionr Virtues and Excelleacies among 
Men, fiich as Valour^ Fortitu^ie, Chaftity, Pa- 
tience, Beauty, Strength, Love, Learning, Wif- 
dom, and the like ,• The Objeas of Worfhip in 
the Grecian and Roman Times, were far more eligi- 
ble, and more rational Objeds of divine Rites, than 
the Idols o^ China and Japan; where v/ith ail the^ 
■Oeconomy of their State Maxims and Rules ot 
Civil Government, which we innft fo much Oii, 
^s Teds of their Wifdom, their great Capacities, 
and Underftandings ; their Worfhip is the mofl 
brutifil, and the Objeas of their Worfnip, thig 
fourfcft, the mofl; unmanly, inconfiflent with Rea- 
ion or the Nature of Religion of any tlie World 
can fnew ; bowing down to a meer Hob-gobblin, 
and doing their Reverence not to the W^ork oi: 
Mens Hands only, but the uglieft, bafefl, fright- 
fullefl things that Man could' make ; Images (o 
far from being lovely and amiable, as in the Na- 
ture of Worfhip is implied, that they are the moft 
deteflable and naufeous, even to Nature. 

Hov^ is it polTible thefe People -can have m^f- 
Cjaim to the Charader of wife, ing^nic-ps^ polite,

that could fuffer themfelves to be bverwheJm'd in 
an Idolatry repugnant to common Senfe, even to 
Nature, and be brought to chufe to adore that 
which was in itfelf the mofl: odious and con- 
temptible to Nature ; not meerly terrible, that fo 
their Worfhip might proceed from Fear, but a 
Complication of Nature's Averfions. 

I cannot omit, that being in one of their Tem- 
ples, or rather in a kind of Oratory or Chapel, 
annexed to one Part of the great Palace at Pequin^ 
there appeared a Maodarin with his Attendants, 
or, as we may fay, a great Lord and his Retinue, 
proftrate before the Image, not of any one of God s 
Creatures, but a Creature of meer human Forming, 
fuch as neither was alive, nor was like any thing 
that had Life, or had ever been feen or heard of 
in the World. 

The like Image, or fomething worfe, if 
I could ^i\Q, it a true Reprefentation, may be 
found in a Garden Chapel, it nor defaced by wi- 
fer Heads, of a great fanarian Mandarin, at a 
fmall Diflance from Nanquin, and to which the 
poor abandoned Creatures, pay their mofl blinded 
Devotions. 

It had a thing inflead of a Head, bnt no Head ; 
it had a Mouth diftorted out of all Manner of 
Shape, and not to be defcribed for a Mouth, being 
only an unfhapen Chafm, neither reprefenting the 
Mouth of a Man, Bcaft, Fowl, or Fifh : The 
Thing was neither any of the four, but an incon- 
gruous Moniler : It had Feet, Hands, Fingers, 
Claws, Legs, Arms, Wings, Ears, Horns, every 
Thing mixt one among another, neither in the 
Shape or Place that Nature appointed, but blend- 
ed together, and fix'd to a Bulk, not a Body i 
form'd ofnojuft Parts, bur a ihapelefs Trunk or 
I-ogi whether of Wood or Stone, I know not ; 

a thing 



[157] 



a thing that might have flood with any Side for- 
wardj or any Side backward, any End upward, 
or any End downward, that had as much Vene- 
ration due to it on one Side, as on the other, a 
kind of celeftial Hedge-hog, that was roiled up 
Svithin itfelf, and was every thing every Way; that 
to a Chriftian could not have been worthy to have 
reprefented even the Devil,* and to Men of commorl 
Senfcj muft have been their very Souls Averlion : 
In a Word, if I have not reprefented their mon- 
ftrous Deities right, let Imagination fupply any 
thing that can make a misfhapen Image horrid, 
frightful, and furprifing ; And you may with Ju- 
flice fuppofe, thofe fagacious People, called the 
Chinefes, whom forfooth we muft admire, I fay, 
you may fuppofe them proftrate on the Ground, 
with all their Pomp and Pageanty, which is in it 
felf not a little, worftiipping fuch a mangled, pro- 
mifcuous gendred Creature. 

Shall we call thefe a wife Nation, who repre- 
fent God in fuch hideous monftrous Figures as 
thefe, and can proftrate themfelves to things tea 
thoufand Times more disfigured than the Devil? 
Had thefe Images been contrived in the Romans 
Time, and been fet up for the God of Uglinefs, 
as they had their God of Beauty, they might in- 
deed have been thought exquifite ; but the R<y- 
mans would have fpurn'd fuch an Image out of theic 
Temples. 

Nothing can render a Nation fo compleatly 
foolifti and fimple, as fuch an Extravagance in 
Matters of religious VVorfhip,- for if grofs Igno- 
rance in the Notion of a God, which is fo ex- 
tremely natural, will not demonftrate a Nation 
unpolifh'd, foolifli, and weak, even next to Ideo- 
tifm, I know nothing that will. 

But 



C ?i8 ] 



But let me trace this wife Nation that we talk 
fo much oF, and who not only think themfelves 
wife, but have drawn us in, to pay a Kind of Ho- 
mage to their low-pri^'d Wit. 

Governmenr, and the Mechanick Arts, are the 
two main tilings in which our People in England^ 
who have admir'd them fo much, pretend they 
excel i as to their Government, which confifts in 
an abfolute Tyranny, which, by the Way, is the 
eafieft Way p^ Ruling in the World> where the 
People are difpos'd to obey, as blindly ss the 
Mandarin comrnands or governs imperioufly ; 
Vv4iat Policy is required in governing a Peo- 
ple, ol: whom ^tis faid,that if you command them to 
hang themfelvesjthey will only cry a little, and fub- 
mit immediately ? Their Maxims of Government 
pay do well enough among themfelves, but with 
VIS they would be all Confufipn. In their Country 
it is not fo, only becaufe, whatever the Man- 
darin fays, is a Law, and God himfelf has no 
Power or Intereft among them to contradid it, 
unlefs he pleafes to execute it hr^'vi manu from 
Heaven. 

Moft of their Laws confifl m immediate Judg- 
ment, fwifc Executions, juft PvCtaliations, and 
fair Protedion from Injuries : Their Punifhments 
are cruel and exorbitant, fuch as Cutting the Hands 
^nd the Feet off for Theft, at the fame Time re- 
lealing Murders and other flagrant Crimes. 

Their Mandarines are their Judges in very many 
Cafes, like our Juflices of the Peace ; but then 
they judge by Cufloms, Oral Tradition, or im- 
mediate Opinion, and execute the Sentence im- 
mediately, wichout room, or Time to refled 
iipon the Juflice of ic, or to confider of Mitigations, 
as in all Chriftian Countries is pradifed, and a$ 
the Senfe of human Frailty would dircd. 

But; 



[ 139 ] 

But let mencome to their Mechanics, in which 
their Ingenuity is (b much cryM up,l aiErm there is 
little or nothing fufficient to build the mighty Opi- 
nion we have of them upon, but what is founded up-* 
on the Comparifons whichswe make between them 
and other Pagan Nations, or proceeds from the 
Wonder which we make, that they jQiould hav^ 
any Knowledge of Mechanics Arts, becaufe we 
find the remote Inhabitants of Afrk and Amerkay 
fo grofsly ignorant, and fo entirely deflitute in fuch 
things ; whereas we do not confider, that the Qhi- 
nefes inhabit the Continent of -^^/z^; and tho' they 
are feparated by Defarts and Wildernefles, yet 
they are a continuous Continent of Land, with 
the Parts of the World once inhabited by the poli- 
ter Medejy Perfians, and Grecians -, that the firil 
Ideas of: Mechanic Arts were probably receiv'd 
by them from the Verjiansy Ajjyrians, and the ba- 
nifh'd tranfplanted Jfraeiites, who are faid to be 
carry 'd into the Regions o'tPanhia, and the Bor- 
ders oi Karacathay, from whence they are alfo faid 
to have communicated Arts, and efpecially Han- 
dicraft, in which the Ifraelhes excell^'d, to the In- 
habitants of all thoie Countries, and confequently 
in Time to thofe beyond them. 

But let them be received from whom they will, 
and how long ago foever ; let us but compare the 
Improvement they have made, with what others 
have made i and except in things peculiar to them- 
felvcs by their Climate, vve fliali find the utmofl; 
of their Ingenuity amounts but to a very Trifle, and 
that they are out-dpne even in the befl of their 
Works by our ordinary Artifls, whofe Imitations 
exceed their Originals, beyond all Comparifon. 

For Example, they have Gun-powder and Gims, 
whether they have learned to make them by Dl-- 
region of Europeans^ which is moil likely, or that 

tbey 



[ HO ] 

they found it out by aieer Strength of Inventfotu 
as fome would advance, tho' without Cerraintya 
in their Favour : Be it which it will, as I fay, 
it matters not much; their Powder is of no 
Strength for the needful Operations of Sieges, 
Mines, Batteries, no nor for fhooting of Birds, as 
ours isy without great Qtiannties put together ; 
their Guns are rather an Olientation than for Exe- 
cution, clumfy, heavy, and ill made , neither have 
they arriv'd to any tolerable Degree of Know- 
ledge in the Art of Gunnery or Engineering ; they 
have TiO Bombs, CarcafTes, Hand-grenades ,* their 
artificial Fireworks are in no Degree comparable, 
or to be nam'd with ours ; nor have they ajrriv'd to 
any thing in the military Skill, in raartialling Ar- 
fnies, handling Arms, Difcipline, and the Exer- 
cife in the Field, as the Eurofeans have ,• all 
which is depending on the Improvement of Firi?- 
Arms, (^e- in which, if they have had the \J{q of 
Gun-powder fo many Ages as fome Dream, they 
muft be unaccountable Blockheads, that they havQ 
made no farther Improvement -, and if it is but 
lately, they are yet apparently dull enough in the 
managing of it, at leait, compared to what ought 
to be expeded of an ingenious People, fuch as oui- 
People cry them up to be* 

I might go from this to their Navigation, in 
which it is true theyouc-do moftof their Neigh- 
bours : But what is all their Skill in Sailing com- 
pared to ours? Whither do they go? And how 
manage the little and foolifh Barks and Jonks they 
have? What would they do with them to traverfc 
the great hdian^ American^ or ^f Atlantic Oceans ? 
What Ships, what Sailors, what poor, awkard, 
and ignorant Doings is there among them at Sea ? 
And when our Peop e hire any of them, as fome- 
rimes they arc obliged to do. How do our SaiJofs 

kklv 



[ I+I ] 

kick them about, as a Parcel of clumfy, igiiora&fi 
unhandy Fellows ? 

Then for building of Ships, What ^rfe they ? 
And what are they able to do towards the glo- 
rious Art of building a large Man of War ? 'lis 
out of Doubt with me, that all the People of 
China could not build fuch a Ship as the Royal .Sb- 
vjereign, in a hundred Years, no not tho' fli^ 
was there for thefn to look at, and take Pattern 

1 might go on to abundance inore things, fuch 
as Painting, making Glades, making Clocks and 
Watches, making Bone-lace, Frame- work Knit- 
ting ,* of all which, except the two firft, they knoW" 
little or nothing ^ and of the two firfl:, nothing 
GomparM to what is done in Etirope. 

The Height of their Ingenuity, and for which 
we admire them with more Colour of Caufe than 
in other things, is their Porcellain or Earthen- 
ware Work, which, in a Word, is more due to 
the excellent Compofition of the Earth they make 
them of, and which is their Peculiar, than to 
the Workman fliip i in which, i( we had the fame 
Clay, we fhould foon outdo thcra, as much as we 
do in otheir things. The next Art i$y their Ma-* 
>iiufacluring in hne Silks^, Cotton, Herba, Gold^ 
and Silver, in which they have nothing but what 
is in common with our ordinary poor Weavers. 

The next Mechanic Art \s^ their Lacquering^ 
*iv'hich is juft as in the China Ware, a Peculiar to 
their Country, in the Materials, not at all in the 
Workmanfhip : And as for the Cabinet Work of 
it, they are manifellly out-done by usi and abun- 
dance is every Year fent thither fram'd and made ift 
England, and only lacquer'd in China ^ to be re- 
f ufri'd to us. '

I might run the like Parallel thro' mofl: of the 
things thefe People excel in, which would all ap- 
pear to be To deficient,, as would render all their 
lam'd Wifdom and Capacity mofl fcandaloufly 
imperfect : But I am not fo much upon their Cun- 
ning in Arts, as upon their Abfurdity and ridicu- 
lous Folly in Matters religious, and in which I 
think the rudefl Barbarians out-do them. 

From this wife Nation, we have a vafl Extent 
of Ground, near 2000 Miles in Breadth -, partly 
under the Chinefe Governnxent, partly under the 
Mufco-vite, but inhabited by Tartars of Mongul Tar- 
tavy^ Karkathay, Siberian, and Samoidss Pagans ,* 
Y^^hofe Idols are almofl as hideous as the Chinefesy 
and w^iofe Religion is all Nature ; and not only fo, 
but Nature under the greatefl Degeneracy, and 
next to Brutal. Father La Comte gives^us the Pi- 
<5tures of fome of their Houfe Idols, and an Ac- 
count of their Worlliip ; and this lafts, as I have 
obferv'd, to within a few Days of Arch-Angel : 
So that, in a Word, from the Mouth of the StraitSy 
that is to fay, from Sallee over to Caribbea, from

telM, i refolv'd to travel over the reft of the 
World ill Books, for my wandring Days are pretty 
well over ; I fay, I refolv'd to travel the reft in 
Books ; and fure, faid I, there muft appear abun- 
dance of fcrious Religion in the reft of the Worlds 
or elfe I know nothing at all of where I ihall find 
it. 

But I find by my Reading, juft as I did in Tra-^ 
veiling, that all the Cuftoms of Nations, as to 
Religion, were much alike ; that one with ano- 
ther, they are more devout in their Worfhip of 
fomething, whatever it he, than inquifitive after 
what it is they worfhip ; and moft of the Alters 
of Worfhip in the World, might to this Day be 
infcrib'd to the Unknown God. 

This may feem a ftrange thing; but that Won- 
der may ceafe, when farther Enquiry is made into 
the particular Objeds of Worfhip, which the fe- 
veral Nations of the World bow down to, fome of 
which, are fo horrid, fo abfurd, as, one would 
think human Nature could not fink fo low, as to do 
her Homage in fo irrational a Manner. 

And here, being to fpeak of Religion as idola- 
trous, it occurs to me, that it feem'd ftrange, that 
except in Perfia, and fome Part oiT'artary, I found 
none of the People look Up for their Gods, but 
Down ; by which it came into my Mind, that even 
in Idolatry itfelf, the World was fomething dege- 
nerated, and their Reafon was more hoodwinked 
than their Anceftors. 

By looking up, and looking down, I mean, they 
do not as the Romans, look up among the Stars 
for their Idols, place their Gods in the Skies, and 
worfhip, as we might fay, like Men ; but look 
down among the Brutes, form Idols to thern- 
felves out of the Beafts, a^d figure things like 

Mob- 



f H4 J 

Monfters, to adore them for their tJglinefs SLtid 
horrible Deformity. 

Of the Two, the former, in my Opinion, was 
much the more rational Idolatry, as particularly, 
the Perjians worfliipping the Sun ; and when I had 
a particular Account of that at Bengale^ it prefent- 
ly occurM to my Thought, that there was fome- 
thing awful, fomething glorious^ and God-like in 
the Sun, that, in the Ignorance of the True God^ 
might rationally befpeak the Homage of the Crea- 
tures ; and to whom it feem'd reafonable, where 
Reafon was its own Judge only^ without the Helps of 
Revelation, to pay an Adoration, as the Parent of 
Light, and the Giver of Life to all the Vegetative 
World, and as in a vifible Manner, enlivening and 
influencing the rational and fenlitive Life, and 
which might, for ought they knew, at firfl: create, 
as it did (ince, fo plainly affed all things round 
us. 

This Thought gave Birth to the following Ex- 
curfion, with which I fhall clofe this Obferva- 
tion.

No other Idol ever came fo near. 

Certain it h, that the Perfans who thus paid 
their Adoration to the Sun, were at that Time 
feme of the wifeft People in the World. Some 
tell us, that the great Image that Nebuchadnez.z>ar 
let up foi\all his People to worfhip, was repre- 
fented holding the Sun in his Right-hand ; and 
rhat it was to the Representation of the Sun that 
he commanded all Nations and Kindreds to bow 
and to worfhip: If fo, then the Affyrians were Wor- 
ilnppers alfo of the Sun, as well as the Perpansy 
which \s not at all improbable i we read alfo in 
mc Scripture, of thofe Nations who worfliipped 
a;l tlie Hofl of Heaven, a Thing much more ra- 
tional, apd nearer of Kin to Worfliipping the 
Great God of Heaven, than worfliipping the 

v/hole 



[ H7 J 

whole Hoft of the Earth, and worfhipping th^ 
moft ab/ed and loathfome Creatures, or but even 
the Reprefentations of thofe Creatures, which was 
ftill worfe than the other. 

But what are all the Abfurdities of Heathen I fnij 
which at laft are refolv'd into the Degeneracy of 
Mankind,and their being fallen from the Knowledge 
of the true God, which was once, as we have 
Reafon to believe, d ifFu fed to all Mankind* 

I fay, What are thefe? And how much Ground 
for juft Refledion do they afford us, compared 
to the grofs things in Pradice, which we find 
every Day among thofe Nations, who profefs to 
have had the clear Light of Gofpel Revelation ? 

How many Self contradicting Principles do they 
hold ? How contrary to their Profeflion do they ad ? 
How do one Side burn for what another Side ab- 
hors ? And how do Chriflians, taking thatvene^ 
rable Name for a general Apfellation, doom one ano- 
ther to the Devil, for a few difagreeing Claufes^ 
of the fame Religion, while all profefs to worfhfp 
the fame Deity, and to exped the fame Salva- 
tion ? 

With what prepofterous Enthufiafms do feme 
mingle their Knowledge, and with as grofs Ab-^ 
furdities others their Devotion ? How blindly fu- 
perftitious ^ How furious and raging in theft 
Zeal ? How cruel^ inexorable, and even inhuman 
and barbarous to one another, when they diffei- ? 
as if Religion divefted us of Humanity, and that 
in our worfliipping a God of Mercy, and in 
whofe Compaflions alone it is that we have room 
to hopcj we fhould to pleafe and ferve him, ba- 
nifh Humanity from our Nature, and fhew no 
Companion to thofe that fall into our Hands. 

In my Travelling thro" Portugal^ it was my Lot to 

come to Ushn, while they held there One of their 

L 2 Courts 



[ h8 ] 

Courts of Jiiflice, cali'd Auto defe, that is to fay 
a Court of Juftiee of the Inquifition : It is a Sub- 
jed has been handled by many Writers, and indeed 
cxpos'd by feme of the befi: Catholicks^ and my 
prefent Bufin efs is not to write a Hiftory, or en- 
gage in a Difpute, but to relate a Paflage.. 

They carryM in Proceffion all their Criminals 
to the great Church ; where eight of them ap- 
peared firft, drefs'd up in Gowns and Caps of Can- 
vafsi upon which was painted all that Man could 
devife, of Hell's Torments, Devils broiling and 
roafting human Bodies, and a thoufand fuch fright- 
ful things, with Flames and Devils bcfides in eve- 
ry Part of the Drefs. 

Thofe I found were eight poor Creatures con- 
demn'd to be burnt, and for they fcarce knew what ; 
but for Crimes againft the Catholick Faith, and 
againft the BlefTed Virgin, and they were burnt. 
One of them, it was faid, rejoic'd that he was to 
be burnt; and being ask'd. Why ? AnfwerM, That 
he had much rather die, than be earry'd back to 
the Prifon of the Inquifition, where their Cruel- 
ties were worfe than Death : Of thofe eight, as I 
was told, fome were Jews, whofe greateft Crime, 
as many there did not fcruple to fay, was, that 
they were very richi and fome Chriilians were in 
the Number at the fame Time, whofe greateft 
Mifery was, that they were very poor* 

It was a Sight that almoft gave me a Shock in 
my Notion of Chriflianity itfelf, till I began to re- 
coiled, that it might be poffible, that Inquifitors 
were fcarce Chriflians, and that I knew many Ca- 
tholic Countries do notfuffer this abominable Judi- 
cature to be erected among them. 

I have feen much, and read more, of the unhap- 
py Conduct in Matters of Religion, among the 
other Nations of the World, profeffing the Chri- 

ftian 



C 149 ] 

ftian Religion ; and upon my Word, I find fome 
Pradices infinitely fcandalous, fome which are the 
common received Cufloms of Chriflians, which 
would be the Abhorrence of Heathens ; and it re- 
quires a ftrong Attachment to the Foundation, 
which is indeed the principal Part in Religion^ to 
guard our Minds againft being offended, even at 
the Chriilian Religion itfelf ^ but I got over that 
Part afterward. 

Let it not offend the Ears of any true Lover of 
the Chriftian Religion, that I obferve fome of the 
Follies of the Profefforsof the Chriftian Religion, 
alfuring you, 'tis far from being my Defign to brin§ 
the leaft Scandal upon the ProfefTion itfelf. 

And here therefore let me give the Words of 
a judicious Perfon who travella from turkey thro* 
Jtaly : His Words are thefe. 

" When I was in Jtaly^ I ranged over great Pare 
" of the Patrimony of St. Petery where one would 
" think indeed, the Face of Religion would be 
** plaineft to befeen, and without any Difguife ; 
^^ but in fliort I found there the Face of Reli- 
*' gion, and no more. 

*' At Rome there was all the Pomp and Glory 
*^ of religious Habits : The Pope and the Cardi- 
^' nals walk'd with a religious Gravity, but liv'd 
** in a religious Luxury, kept up the Pomp of Re- 
^' ligion, and the Dignity of religious Titles; 
" But like our Lord's Obfervation on the Phari^ 
*' feesy I found within they were all ravening 
'^ Wolves. 

*^ The religious Juflice they do there, is par- 
^' cularly remarkable, and very much recommends 
*' them. The Church proteds Murthers and Af- 
" fafiins, and then delivers the Civil Magiftrates 
" over to Satan, for doing Juflice. They inter- 
■* did: whole Kingdoms, andfhut up the Churches 

L 3 \' far 



C 150] 

^^ for Want of paying a few Ecdefiaftic. Dues; 
*^5iand fo put a Stop to Religion for Wantof theii: 
*' Money. I found the Courtezam were the mofl: 
^* conftant Creatures at the Church, and the moft 
*« certain Place for an Affignation with another 
5' Man's Wife, was at Prayers. 

" The Court of Inquifitxon burnt two Men for 
*^ fpeakiiig diflionourably of the Bleffed Virgin, 
*'• and the Miflionaries in C^m^ tolerated the Wor^ 
^'' fhipping the Devil by their new Convert. A 
*« Jew was likewife burnt for denying Chrifl:, while 
^* the Jefuits join'd the Paganifm of th? Heathen 
'* with the High Mafs, and fung Anthems to 
*^ th^ immortal Idols of lonquin. 

'' When I faw this, I refolv'd tp enquire no mora 
*^ after Religion in Italy, till by Accident meeting 
^' with a Quietifl, he gave me to underftand, that 
^* all Religion was internal, that the Duties of 
*^ Chriftianity were fumm'd up in Refledion 
^' and Ejaculation, He inveighM bitterly againft 
** the Game of Religion, which he faid was 
** playing over the whole World by the Clergy; 
^* and fiiid, Italy was n Theatre, where Religion 
*^ was the Grand Opera, and the Popifh Clergy 
" were the Stage Players. I lik'd him in many 
*^ of his Notions about other Peoples Religion ; 
^^ but when I came to talk with him a little clofe- 
" ly about his own, it was fo wrapp'd up in his 
^' Internals, conceai'd in the Cavities and dark 
*' Parts of the Soul, ruiz.. Meditation without 
** Worfliip, Dodrine without Pradice, Refledi- 
^' on without Reformation, andj Zeal with- 
^' out Knowledge ,• that I could come to r^o 
** Certain ly with him, but in this, that Religion 
I'' in Italy was to-dWy invijible. 

This was very agreeable to my Notions of /m- 
Han Religion, and to what I had met with from 

other 



[ 151 ] 

Other People that had travel'd the Country : But 
one Obfervation of Blindnefs and Superftition I 
muft give within ray own Knowledge, and nearec 
Homei when paffing thro* Mzi^i^rj-, I found the 
People in a certain City there, in a very 
great Commotion : The Cafe was this ; A certain I 
Scelerate^ fo they call an abandoned Wretch given 
up to all Wickednefs, had broken into a Chapel 
in the City, and hadftoln the Pix or Casket where- 
in the facred Hoft was depofited ; which Hoft, af- 
ter rightly confecrated, they believe to be the real 
Body of our Bleffed Saviour, being tranfubftantiat- 
^d, as they call it, from the Subftance of Bread. 

The Fadt being difcover'd, the City, as I faid 
above, was all up in a Tumult j the Gates were 
ihut up, no Body fufferM to go out; every Houfe 
was fearched, and the utmoft Diligence ufed i and 
at length, as it "was next to Impoflibility he fhould 
efcape, he was difcover^'d. 

His Execution was not long deferred : But firft 
he was examined, and I think by Torture, What 
he had done v/ith the facred thing which was in 
the Pix, which he had ftpln? And at length he 
confefs*d, That he had thrown it into a Houfe 
of Office; and was carry 'd with a Guard to fhew 
them the Place. 

As it was impofUble to .find a little Piece of a 
Wafer in fuch a Place, tho' no Pains was fparM in 
a moft filthy Manner to fcarch for it ; but, as I fay, 
it could not be found, immediately the Place was 
judg*d confecrated ipfo faEio^ turn'dintoan Orato- 
ry, and the devout People flcck'd to it, to expiate 
by their Prayers, the Difhonour done to the Lord 
God, by throwing hs precious Body into fo vile a 
Place. It was determined by theWifer part, that the 
Body would not fall down into the Place, but be 
fnatch'd up by its inherent Power, or by the holy 

L 4 Angels 



[ 152. ] 

Angels, and not be fufer'd to touch the Excre^ 
jnents in that Place» However, the People conti- 
fiu'd their Devotions for fome Time, juft in the 
Place where it was, and afterwards a large Cha- 
f>el was built upon it, where the hmt Prayers arc 
continued, as I fuppofe, to this Day. 

I had a particular Occafion to come at a very 
accurate Account of Poland, by a Polijh Gentle- 
man, in whofe Company I travelled, and from 
whom I learn'd all that was worth enquiring of, 
about religious Affairs in Pruffta on one Sid^j and 
Mufcovy on the other. 

As for Poland, he told me they were all Confu- 
fion, both in Church and in State; that notwith- 
ftanding their Wars, they were Perfecutors of the 
worft Kind ,' that they let the Jews live among em 
undifturbM, to fuch a Degree, that in the Coun- 
try about Lemherg and ^/oiu, there were reckoned 
above 30000 Jews: That thefe had not Tolera- 
tion only, but many Privileges granted them, tho' 
they deny*d Chrift to be the Meffiah, or that the 
MeiHah was come in the Flefli ,* and blafphemed 
his Name upon frequent Occafions ; and at the 
fame Time they perfecuted the Proteilants, and 
deftroy'd their Churches, where-ever they had 
Power to do it. 

On the other Hand, when I came to enquire of 
thofe Proteftants, and what Kind of People they 
were, v/ho fuffer'd fo feverely for their Religion, I 
found they were generally a Sort of Proteftants, 
calTd Sodnians, and that Lelius Socinus had fpread 
his Errors fo univerfally over this Country,thatour 
'Lord JefusChriii: was reduc'd here to little more 
than a good Man fent from Heaven to inflrud: the 
World, and far from capable of effecting by the In- 
fluence of his Spirit, and Grace, the glorious 
Work of redeeming the World y As for the 

Divi- 



Divinity of the Holy Ghoft, they have no Trou^ 
ble about it. \ 

Having given this Account of Knowledge? 
and Piety in the Countries inhabited by Chriflians 
of the i^ow/^/2 Church, it feems natural to fay fome 
thing of the Greek Church. 

There are in the Cz^ar o( Mufcovy's Dominions 
abundance of Wooden Churches ; and had not 
the Country been as full of Wooden Priefls, 
fomething might have been faid for the Reli- 
gion of the Mufcovites ^ for the People are won- 
derfully devout there, which would have been ve- 
ry we[], if it had not been attended with the pro- 
foundeft Ignorance that was ever heard of in any 
Country, where the Name of Chriftian was fo 
much as talk'd of. 

But when I came to enquire about their Wor- 
fhip, I found our Lord Jefus Chrifl: made fo much 
a meaner Figure among them than St. Nicholas, 
that I concluded Reh'gion was fwallow'd up of 
Superftition j and fo indeed I found it was upon all 
Occafions *, as to the Condu{5t of the People in re- 
ligious Matters, their Ignorance is fo eftablifh'd 
upon Obftinacy, v^hich is the Mufcovite^j- national 
Sin^ that it would be really to no Purpofe to look 
any longer for a Reformation among them. 

In fhort, no Man will, I believe, fay of me, 
that I do the Mufcovites any Wrong, when I fay 
they are the moft ignorant, and moft obftinate 
People in the Chriftian World, when I tell the 
following Story of them. 

It was after the Battle at Narva^ where the 
late King of Sweden Charles XII. defeated their great 
Army, and after the Vidory, extended his Troops 
pretty far into their Country, and perhaps plun- 
der'd them a little, as he advanc'd j when the 
I\/IufcQ^iteSy we may be fure, being in the utmoft

Difltefif and Confufion, fell to their Prayers. Wc 
read of nothing they had to fay to God Almigh- 
ty in that Cafe ; but to their Patron Saint they 
addrefsM this extraordinary Prayer. 

QThou our perpetual Comforter in ail our Advcrjtr 
ties ! I'hou infinitely Powerful St, 1>1 1 c h o l a s, 
^y what SiUi and how have we highly offended the? in 
cur Sacrifices, GenufleBions, Reueremes and Anions, 
of Than/giving^ that thou hafi thus forfaken us} we 
had therefore fought to appeafe thee entirely, and we had 
implord thy Prefence and thy Succour againfl the Terrir-^ 
hie, Infulenty Dreadful, Enraged, and Undaunted 
Enemies and peflroyeys; when like Lyons, Bears^ 
and other Savage Beafts, that have lofi their young 
ones, they attack' d us after an infolent and terri- 
hie Manner \ and terrify d and wounded, took and killed 
us ky thoufands^ us who are thy People : Now as it 
is impoffible that this jhould happen without Witchcraft, 
and Enchantment, feeing the great Care that we had 
taken to fortify our f elves after an impregnable Man" 
Tier, for the Defence and Security of thy Name, We 
befeech thee, St. Nicholas, to he our Champion, 
and the Bearer of our Standard, to be with us, both, 
in Peace and in War, and in our Neceffities, and at 
the Time of our Death to proteB us agaii7fi this horrible 
^nd Tyrannical Crew of Sorcerers, and to drive them 
far enough off from our Frontiers^ with the Recompence 
which they deferve. 

It may be hoped I may give a better Account 
of Religion among Proteftants than I have among, 
the Roman and Grecian Churches ; and I wil), if in 
Jullice It is pofTible. 

Tlie next to the Nations I have been mention- 
ing, I mean, in Geographical Order, are thofe 
reform'd Chriftians, call'd Lutherans; to fay 

no.. 



C 155 ] 

np worfe pf th«m, tRe Face of Religion indeed is 
alter'd much between thefe and the latter: But I 
fcarce know what Name to give it, at leaft as far 
as I have enquir'd into it, or what it is like. 

It was Popery and no Popery ; there was the Co«- 
fuL but not the Tranfub., The Service differed 
indeed from the Mafs, but the Deficiency feem'd 
to be made up very much with theTrumpets, Ket- 
tle-Drums, Fiddles, Hautboys, &c. and all the 
pterry Part of the Popifli Devotion ; upon which ic 
pccurr^'d to me prefently, that if there was no 
Danger of Popery among the Lutherans, there was 
Dd.n^'^ioi Super fiition j and as for the pious Part, I 
faw very little of it in either of them. 

By i^e//^/o« therefore, the Readetiis defired to un- 
derfland here^ not the Principles upon which the 
feveral Nations denominate themfelves fo much, 
as the Manner in which they difcoveu themfelves 
to be fincere in the Profeflion which they make. 
I had no Inclination here to enter into the Enquiry 
after the Creeds, which every Nation profefs'd to 
believe; but the Manner in which they pradifed 
that Religion which they really profefs'd ,• for. 
What is Religion to me without Pradice ? And 
altho' it may be true, that there can be no true 
Religion, where it is iiot profefs'd upon right 
Principles,* yet that which I obferve here, and 
which to me is the greatefl: Grievance among 
Chriflians, is the Want of a religious Praftice, 
even where there are right Principles at Bottom, 
and where there is a Profeflion of the Orthodox 
Faith. 

In Brief, I am not hunting after the ProfefTion 
of Religion, but the Pradice : The firfi: I find 
almoft in every Nation, Nulla gens tarn harhara — 
But the laft I am like to travel thro' the Hiflories 
of all Chriftendom u7>^ [rny Search^ and per- 
haps 



[ 156 ] 

haps may hardljf be abJe^ when I have done, t© 
tc\\ you where ic is. 

All the Satyr of this Enquiry will look this 

Way; for where God has not given a People 

the Bleifing of a true Knowledge of himfelf, ic 

would call for our Pity, not Reproach. It 

would be a very dull Satyr indeed, that a Man 

ihouid be witty upon the Negroes in Africa for 

not knowing Chrift, and not underftanding the 

|Doi3:rine ot a Saviour; But if turning to our 

i modern Ch rift fans of ^^r^^Jo^x 2Lnd Jamaica for 

j-noc teaching them, not inftruillng them, and 

5 for refuiing to baptize them; there the Satyr 

] would be pointed and jieaibnable, as we (hall hear 

: farther by and by. 

But to return to the Lutherans, for thete I am 
fuppofed to be at this Tiriie, I mean, among 
the Courts , and Cities of Mrandenburgh^ Saxo- 
ny^ &c. I had Opportunity here to view a Courti 
aSedting Gallantry, Magnificence, and gay things, 
to Inch a Height, and with fuch a Paffion, to ex- 
ceed the whole World in that empty Part of hu- 
iiian helicity, cah'd Show^ that 1 thought it was 
i^mpoffible to purfue it with fuch an impetuous 
Torrent of the Affedion?, without facrificingali 
things i;o it, which wife Men cfteem more va- 
luable,' 

N'^x was my Notion y/rong ; for the firft thing 
I found lacrific^d, as I fay, to this voluptuous 
Humour, was the Liberties of the People, who 
being by Coniiimcion orCuftom^rather under ab- 
foi'ue Government, and at the arbitrary Will 
of the Prince, are fine to pay, not all they can 
fpare, but even all they have, to gratify the un- 
bounded Appetite of a Court given up to Plea- 
sure and Exorbitance.

Syall I have read of the Manner of Livnrg

entirely given up to the former-, not by Ne-

running over or running out at its proper Venr, 
I do not enquire ; fo that as all the Blood in the 
human Body circulates in 24 Honrs thro' the 
Ventricles of the Heart, foall theMoney in the 
Kingdom is faid to p^fs once a Year thro' the 
Ring's Treafury. 

How far Poverty and Mifery may prompt 
Piety and Devotion among the poor Inhabi- 
tants, i cannot fay: But if Luxury and Gallan- 
try, together witlv Tyranny and Oppreffion to 
fupportit, can fubfift with true Religion in the 
great Men, than for ought I know, the Courts of 
Pruffea and Drefden may be the bed qualify'd in the 
World to produce this Thing call'd Religion, 
which I have hitherto feen, is hard to be found. 
It is true, that the Magnificence of the wifef! 
King In the World in ^erufakm^ was efteemed^ 
theFeh'city ofhis People: Bnt it feems to be ex- 

Erefs'd very elegantly, not as a Teftimony of 
is Glory only, but of the flourlftiing Coadiiioa 
ofhis People at the fame Time, under the prof- 
perous Circumflances which his Reign brought 
them to, 'viz,. That he made Gold to be for Plen- 
ty like the Stones in the Streets, amply expreffing 
the flopxiOiing Condition of his People ondei!

t have likewife read indeed, and heard much of 
the fame Kind of the King of Prupa^ and that 
even from his own Subjeds, who were always fall 
of the generous and truly royal Qualities of that 
Prince : He was the firft King of the Country, 
which before was a Dukedom or Electorate only : 
The Summ of their Difcourfe is^ That his Maje- 
ily was fo true a Father of his Country and of his 
People, that his whole care was the Flourifhing 
of their Trade, ellablifhing their Manufadures, 
encreafing their Numbers, planting Foreigners, 
Frenchy Swifs^ and other Nations, among them, 
to inftrud: and encourage them ; and being noway 
acceffory to any of their Oppreflions, but relieving 
and redrefling all their Grievances, as often and 
as foon as they came to his Knowledge: 
And indeed, I could not but entertain a great 
Regard to the Chara(5ler of fo juft and good a 
Prince. But ail I could infer from that was. That 
a Government may be tyrannical, and yet the 
King not be a Tyrant j but the Grievances to the 
People are oftentimes much the fame i And every 
Adminiftration, where the Conftitution is thus 
flated, as it feems to be in moft, if not all of the 
Northern Courts, Proteftant as well as others, 
feems inconfiftent with the true Ends of Govern* 
ment; the thing we call Government was certain- 
ly eftablifhed for the Profperity of the People ; 
Whereas, on the contrary, in all thofe German 
Courts, where I have made my Obfervations, the 
Magnificence of the Court, and the Profperity of 
the People, fland like the two Poles ; what Ex- 
cefs of Light you fee at one, is exactly balanced by 
fomuch Darknefsat t'other. 

And where, pray, is the Religion of all this? 
That a whole Nation of People (hould appear 
hiiferablc, that their Governours may appear gay, 

the 



1 159] 



tlie People ftarve, that the Prince maybe fed, 
or rather, the People be lean, that their Sovercigtl 
may be fat ; the Subjeds (igh, that he may laugh 5 
be empty, that he may be full ; and all this for 
ineer Luxury, not for the needful Defence of the 
Government^ refilling Enemies, preferving the 
J)ublic Peace, and the like^ but for meer Extra- 
vagance, Luxury, and Magnificence, as in jPrw^^i; ^ 
or for Ambition, and pufhing at Crowns, and the I 
Luft of Domination, as in Saxony, 

But to come back to the religious Tranfadions 
of thefe Countries, How are the Ecclefiaflics 
fealous of their Hierarchy, afraid to reform far- 
ther, leaft, as they gave a mortal Stabb to the 
Perquifites and Vails of God Almighty's Ser- 
vice in the Roman Church, modern Reformation 
might give the like to them ? For this Reafon 
they fet a Pale about their Church, and there, 
as well as in other Places, they cry to their 
Neighbours, Stand offy lam holier than thou ; and 
with v^hat Perfecution and Livafion, perfecuting 
for Religion, and invading the Principles of one 
another. If there was any Peace among them, 
it Was that only v^hichpajfes all Vnderftanding, It 
prefently oceurr'd to me, what Charity can here 
be, where there is no Peace ? And whatRcligiorr, 
where is no Charity? And I began to fear I fiiould 
find little of what I look'd for in thofe odd Cli- 
mates. 

I had travell'd perfonally thro* the Heart of 
France, where I had Occafion to look round me 
often enough in my Rout from the Foot of the 
Pyrenean Mountains to I'houloufe, from thence to 
' Paris and Calais. Here I found the People fo mer- 
ry, and yet fo miferable, that I knew not where to 
make any Judgment. The Poverty of the Poor 
was fo great, that it feem'd to leave them no 

roam

i-oom to figh for any thing, but their Barthens, or 
to pray for any thing, but Bread : But the Tem- 
per of the People was fo volatile, that I thought, 
they went always dancing to Church, and came 
finging out of it. 

I found a World of Teachers here, but no body 
taught: The Streets were every where full of 
Priefts, and the Churches full of Women , But as 
for Religion> I found moft of the Clergy were fofar 
from haviijg much of it, that few of them knew 
what it was. Never fure was a Nation fo full of 
truly ^li^^ Guides ; for nothing can be more grofs- 
ly ignorant of Religion, than many of their Cler- 
py are ; nothing more void of Morals, than many 
of thofe to whom other People go to confefs their 

I made fome Enquiry about Religion; and a- 
mong the reft, I happen'd to fall in Company with 
a good honeft Hugonot ineognito; and he told me 
veryhoneflly, that the State of Religion in France 
flood thus: Firft, That for fome Yearis ago it was 
put to the Teft by the King, and that was, when 
the Edids came out to banifli and ruin the Hugo- 
nots; at which TimQjaidhe, we thought there 
had been a great deal of Religion in it : But really 
when it came to the Pufh, /^/i /^g-, it was hard to 
tell where we Ihould find it. The Perfecution, as 
it was thought at firft, would be ingrateful to the 
more religious Roman-Catholicks, and that fome 
would be found too good to do the Drudgery of 
the Devil : But we were miftaken, the beft fell 
in with Perfecution, when it was done by other 
Hands and not their own; and thofe that would 
not do it, acknowledg'd they rejoic'd that it was 
done; which Ihew'd, faidhe, that the Catholicks 

cithet 



[ I^I ] 



either had no Principle, or aded againft Principle, 
which is much at one. And as for us Hugonocsi 
fays hey we have fhewn that we have no Religion 
loft among us : For firft, fome run away for their Re- 
ligion, and yet leftit behind them, and wc that ftay'd 
behind did It at the Price oFour Principles : Fornowj 
fays he^wc are meer Hypocrites,neither Papifts nor 
Hugonots, for we go to Ma fs w.th Proteftant 
Hearts j and while we call our felves Proteftants, 
we bow in the Houfe o'c Rimmon, Where then, /aid I, 
is the Religion, once boafted of here, to be found ? 
Indeed, faid he^ it is hard to tell you, and except a 
little that is in the Galleys, I can give you no good 
Account of it. This indeed was confining the 
Remains of a flourifhing Church to about 350 
Confclfors, who really fuffer'd Martyrdom for it, 
for it was no lefs ; fo I minuted down French Reli- 
gion, tugging at the Oar, and would, have come 
away. 

But it cim^ into riiy Thought to ask him, What 
he meant by telling me, that thofe who run away 
for their Religion out of France^ left mod of it 
behind them ? He anfwer'd, I fhould judge of ic 
better, if I obferv'd them when 1 came into my 
own Country ,• where, ii I found they liv'd better 
than other People, or fhew'd any thing of Reli- 
gion fuitable to a People tha,t fuft'er^d Perfeeution 
for their Profcffion, I fliould fend Word of it ; foe 
he had heard quite otherwife of them, which 
was the Reafon why he and Thoufands of others 
did not follow them. 

It happen'd, while I was warm in my Enqui- 
ries thus after Religion, a Proclamation came 
out in LondcUy for appointing a General Thankf- 
giving, for a great Viftory obtained by the Eug- 
lifh Forces and their Confederates, over the Fvemb 
at - — — I care not to put Names to the parti- 
€ulat Times of things* M I ftart^cJ 



[ I^i ] 

I ftarted at the Noife, when they cry'd it in th@ 
Streets : Hah, faid /, then I have found it at laft ; 
and 1 rejoyc'd in particular, that having look'd fa 
mv.ch abroad for Religion, I fhould iind it out 
at home : Then I began to call myfelf a thoufand 
Fools, that I had not favM myfelf all this Labour, 
and look'd at homefirll:,* tho' by the By, I had 
done no more in this than other Travellers often, 
or indeed generally do, 'viz., go abroad to fee the 
World, and fearch into the Curiofities of foreign 
Countries, and know nothing of their own. 

But to return to my Obfervations : I was re- 
folv'd to fee the Ceremonies of this pious Piece of 
Work j and as the Preparations for it were prodi- 
gious great, I enquir'd how it would be; but no 
body could remember that the like had ever been 
in their Time before ; Every one faid* it would 
be very fine, that the Queen would be there her 
felf, and all the Nobility j and that the like had 
never been feen fince Qtieen Eliz.abetJo's Time. 

This pleafed me exceedingly \ and I began to 
form Ideas in my Mind, of whar had been in for- 
mer Times among religious Nations; 1 could 
iindnothingof what I wasmade to expeft, unlefs 
it was Solomons Dedication of the Temple, or 5^o- 
//j/j's Great Feafl of the Reformation ; and I ex- 
pected God would have a moil: royal Tribute of 
Praife. 

But it fiicck'd me a little, that the People faid 
there had never been fuch a Thanfgiving fince 
Queen Eli7.-aheth\ Time. What thought I can be 
the Reafon of that? and mufing a little, O! fays I 
to myfelf, now I Jiave found it : Ifuppofe, no bo- 
dy gives God Thanks \w our Country, but Queens : 
But this look'd a little harfli ; and I rumag'd our 
Hiflorics a little for m.y farther Satis fai!:H on, but 
could make nothing of it : At laft, talking of it 

to 



[ 1^3 ] 

to a good old Cavalier, that had been a Soldier 
for king Charles, O, fays he^ I can tell yoa the 
Reafonot it: They have never given Thanks,//z;'Jr 
he, becanfe they have had nothing 1:0 gi^Q Thanks 
for. Pray, fays be. When have they had any Vi- 
dories in England (ince Qiieen Elizabeth's TimC) 
except two or three in Ireland in King IVilliams 
Time , and then they were To bufy, had fo many 
other Lodes v/ith them abroad, that they were 
aftiam'd to give Thanks for them. 

This I found had too much Truth in it, howe- 
ver bitter the jell of it : Bur ftill heightened my 
Expedation, and made me look for fome flrange 
Serioufnef^^ and religious Thankfuinefs in the Ap- 
pearance that was to be on theOccafionin Hand; 
and accordingly I fecur'd myfelf a Place, both 
without and within the Church, where I might be 
a VVitnefs to every Part of the Devotionandjoy 
People. 

But my Expectations were wound up to a yet grea- 
ter Pitch, when I faw the infinite Crowds of Peo- 
ple throng with fo much Zeal, a5 1, like a charitable 
Coxcomb, thought it to he, to the Place of the Worfhip 
of God y and when I confidered, that it was to ^ivQ. 
God Thanks for a great Vidory, I could think of 
nothing elfe than the Joy of the Ifraelites, when 
they landed on the Banks of the Sea, and faw l^ha- 
ro^//s Army, Horfes, and Chariots, fwaliov/'d up 
behind them ; and I doubted not I fhould hear 
fomething like the Song of Mofes and the Chil- 
dren oi Ifrael, on the Occafion, and Ihould hear it 
fung with the fame Elevation of Soul. 

But when 1 came to the Po.'nt, the firfl thing I 
obferv'd was, That nine Parts of ten of all the 
Company, came there only to fee the Qiieen, and 
the^'how, and the other tenth Pare, I think, might 
be faid to make the Show. 

* M 3 When 



[ iH 1 

When the Queen came to the Rails, and de- 
fcended from her Coach, the People, inftead of 
crying out Hofannahy bleft'ed be the Qiieen that 
Cometh in the Name of the Lord ; I fay, the Peo- 
ple cry 'd Murder, and Help^ for God's fake; 
treading upon one another, and flifling one ano- 
ther, at fuch a rate, that in the Rear ot the two 
Lines or Crowds of People, thro' which the Queen 
Pafs'd, it iook'd fomething like a Battle, where 
the wounded were retired to die, and to get Sur- 
geons to come to them, for there lay Heaps of 
Women and Children dragged from among the 
Feet of the Crowd, and gafping for Breath. I 
went among fome of them, and ask'd them. What 
made them go into fuch a Crowd ? And their An- 
fwer was ail the fame, O Sir, I had a Mind to fee 
the Queen, as the reft did. 

Well, I had my Anfwer here indeed ; for in 
fhort, the whole Bufinefs of the Thankfgiving 
without Doors, was to fee the Queen, that was 
plain ; fo I went away to my Scand, which, for 
no lefs than three Guineas, I had fecurM in the 
Church. 

When I came there, it wsls my Fate to be pla- 
ced between the Seats, where the Men of God 
performed the Service ofhisPraife, and fung out 
the Anthems and the Te Deum, which cel^rated 
the religious Triumph of the Day. 

As to the Men themfelves, I lik'd their Office, 
their Veflmcnts, and their Appearance ; all looked 
awful and grave enough, (uitable in fome Refpeds 
to the Solemnity of a religious Triumph ; and I 
expected they would be as folemn in their Perfor- 
mances, as the Levites that blow'd the Trumpets 
at Svlonions Feafl, when all the People Ihouted and 
praifcd God. 

But 



[ 1^5] 

But I pbferved thefe grave People, in the In- 
tervals of their worfiiipping God, when it was 
not their Turn to fing, or read, or pray, beftow'd 
feme of the reft of their Time in taking Snuff, ad- 
jufting their Perukes, looking about at the fair La- 
dies, whifpering, and that not very fofcly neither 
to one another, about this fine Lady, that pretty 
Wonaan, this fine Dutchefs, and that great For* 
tune, and not without fome Indecencies, as well 
of Words, as of Geftures. Well, fays /, you are 
none of the People I look for, where are they that 
give God Thanks ? 

Immediately the Organ ftruckup fortheTi-D^- 
nm; up ftarts all my Gentlemen, asifinfpir'dfrom 
above, and from their talking together, hot over 
modeftly,fall to praifing God with the utmoft Pre- 
cipitation, finging the heavenly Anthems, with all 
the Grace and Mufic imaginable. 

In' the Middle of all this Mufick and thefe exalted 
things/ when I thought my Soul elevated with di- 
vine Meipdyj and began to be reconcil'd to all the 
reft, I faw a little ruftling Motion among the Peo- 
ple^ as if they had been difturbM or frighted : 
Some faid it thunder 'd, fome faid the Church fliook. 
The true Bufinefs was, the Te Deum within was; 
anfwerM without by the Thunder of loo Pieces 
of Cannon, and the Noife of Drums, with the 
Huzza's and Shouts of great Crowds of People in 
the Streets. This I did not underftand, fo it did 
neither difturb or concern me ; I found indeed no 
great Harmony in it i it bore no Confort in the 
Mufic, at leaii, as I underftood it ; but it w^as 
over pretty foon, and fo we went on. 

When rhe Anthem was fung, and the other Ser- 
vices fucceeded them, I that had been a little dl- 
ftnrb'd with rhe lucid Intervals of the Chorifrers, 
and the Gentlemen that fat crowded in with 

M I tUcm 



[ 1(5(5 ] 

them, turned my Eyes to other Plaoes, in Hopes 
I fiioiiid find fome Saints among the Crowd, whofe 
JSouls were taken up with the exalted Raptures of 
the Day. 

But alas, it was all one, the Ladies were bufy 
fingling out the Men, and the Men the Ladies, 
The Star and Garter of a fine young Nobleman, 
beautiful in Perfon, rich in Habit, and fparkling 
inJevv^el-S his blew Ribbond intimating his Cha- 
rattcr, drew the Eyes of fo many Women off of 
their Prayer Books, that 1 think his Grace ought 
to have been fpoken to by the Vergers, to have 
withdrawn out of the Church, that he might 
not injure the Service, and rob God Almighty of 
the Homage of the Day. 

As for the Queen, her Maj'efty was the Star of 
the Day, and infinitely more Eyes were direded 
to her than were lifted up to Heaven, tho' the 
lafl was che Biiiinefs of the whole Proceflion. 

' Well, Jajd /, this is mighty fine, that'^s true : 
But where ''s the Religion of all this ? Heavens 
blefsme, faid ly out of this Crowd, and Til ne- 
v^rmock God any more here, when th^ QLieen 
comes again. Cannot thefe People go and fee the 
Qiieen, where the Qtieen is to be feen, but muff 
they come hither to prophane the Church with 
her, and m^ake the Qj-ieen an Idol ? And in a great 
PalTion I was both at the People and at the Man- 
ner of the. Day, as you may eafily fee by what 
follows. 

N' B. I had madefome'other fatyrical Refleclions 
upon the Conduct of the Day; but as it looks 
too near home, I am not willing, that poor Ro- 
hinfon Qrujoe fliould difoblige any body. 

I confefs, the Clofe of the Day was flill more 
c\travag:int ; for there the Thankfgiving was ad- 
journed from the Churcl^ to the Tavern, and to 

the 



C 1^7] 

the Street; and Inftcad of the Decency of a reli- 
gions Triumph, there was indeed a Trinmph ot' 
religious indecency, and tlie Anthems 1e Denm 
and Thankfgivmg of the Day ended in the Drun- 
lienner<?, theBonehres, and the Squibs and Crac- 
Ivers ot the Street. 

How far Rch'gion is concerned in all this, or 
whether God Almighty will accept of this noify 
Doings for Thankfcivings, that I have nochiiig 
to do with ; let thofe People conird^r of it, that are 
concerned in it. 




Of Dijfcrences in Religion. 

lis known alone to the Divine Wifdcm, 
i why he has beenpleafed to fufFer any 
Part of Religion, and the Adoration 
paid to h"s ^vlajefly, the Supplications 
made to him, and the Homage which his Crea- 
tures owe to his glorious Being, to be fo doubt- 
fully direded, or Yo dift'erently underdood by his 
Creatures, as that there fnould be any Miflakes or 
Difagreements about them. 

How comes it to pafs, that the paying a Re- 
verence to the Name and Being of God, fnould 
not be as un^sapable of being difputed in the Man- 
ner of it, as in tlie thing irfelf ? That all the Rules 
ofW"orfliipping,Believing in, and Serving the Great 
God of Heaven and Earth, fhould be capable of 
being underflood any more than oneWay? And that 
the Infallible Spirit of God, who is our Guide 

M 4 to 



[ 168] 



to Heaven, (hoiild leave any one of its Didates 
in a State of being mifuncicritood ? 

Why have not the Rules of Religion, as well 
thcfe ofDodrine as o[ Lile, been laid down in 
Terms fo plain, and fo impoffible to be miftaken, 
that all Men in the World in every Age, fnoiild 
have the fame Notions of chem,and underlland them 
in every Title'ofthemexa(i:cly alike ? Then as Hea^ 
ven js but one bleiled great Portjat which all Hope 
to arrive, there would have been but one Road 
to travel tht: Journey in ; all Men would have gone 
the fame Vvay, lleer'd the fame Courfe ; and 
Brethren would no more have fallen out by the 
Way. 

God alone, who for wife and righteous Rea- 
fons, becaufe he can do nothing but what is wife 
and righteous, has otherwife order'd it, and that 
is all we can fay of ft : As to the "Realon and Ju- 
flice oF it, that is a thing, ot which, like as of 
the Tiroes and of the Seafons, we may {2l)\ Know- 
€th no Man. 

In the State of Uncertainty we are now in, fo 
it is ; two Men believing in the fame God, holding 
the fame Faith, the fame Saviour, the fame Do^ 
drnie, and aiming at the fame Heaven i yet can- 
not agree to go to that Heaven, or worfhip 
that God, or believe in tliat Saviour the fame Way, 
or after the fame Manner : Nay, they cannot 
know, or conceive of Go6^ or of Heaven, or of the 
Redeemer, or indeed of any one Principle; oi the 
Chriflian Religion, \n the fame Manner, or form 
the fame Ideas pf thcfe things in their Minds. 

It is trup, the different Capacities and Faculties 
of Men, are in Part a Reafon for this ; by which 
it is occafioned, that fcarce two Men together 
have the fame Notions and Apprehenfions even of 
pne and the fame thing, becaufe their Underflan- 

ding5 



[ 1(59 1 

dings are led by diftcrtnt Guides, and they fee by 
different Lights. 

But this is not all; they are not ah'ke honefl to 
the Light tney have : Thr^e Men read the famedp- 
drinal Article, (ay it be of the Trinity, or of any 
other, and they all examine the Foundation of it in 
the Scripture. One thinks verily he has found out 
theMyliery eftedually, goes on v^ath his Enquiries, 
and brings every Scripture and every Paflage to 
correfpond exadly with his firft Notion i and thus 
be confirms himfelf immoveably in his Opinion; 
and it is fo clear to him, that he can not only ne- 
ver be argued out of it, but can entertain no good 
Opinion of any Man, that conceives of it in any 
other Way, but takes him for an Enemy to the 
Orthodox Dodrine, and that he merits to be ex- 
pelled out of Chnft's Church, deny'd theChriftian 
Communion ; and in fhort, treats him with no Re- / 
fped, no nor thinks of him with Charity. 

Another comes to the fame Scripture, and in 
queft of the fame Doctrine, and he reads over the 
fame Texts, and reci eves Notions from them di^ 
redly oppofire to the other, or at leaft, very re- 
rnote from them : He follows in his Search thro* 
all the corroborating Texts, and is confirmed in. 
his firft Opinion from them all : He grows as 
immoveable in his received Conftru(5iion of the 
Scripture, as the other ^ and all is fo clear to him, 
that he not only can never be argued out of his 
Opinion, but can entertain no good Opinion of 
any Man that conceives of it any other Way, 
but takes him for an Enemy to the Orthodox 
Dodrine. 

The third Man, he reads over all the fame 
Texts of Scripture, but doing it with an Indiffe- 
rency as to the Subftance, and whether he re- 
ceives right information or no, truly he comes 

away 



[ 170 ] 

wa y with a Calmnefsof Mind as to theSubftance ; 
iind as he went with no great Concern about being 
certain, fo he comes back as uncertain as he went. 

Thefe three Men are enough to fill the whole 
World full of -Difputes about Religion. The firfi 
two meet, and being equally pofitiveof their being 
infallibly guided, equally warni in defending their 
Opinions, and equally tenacious ofthem,and above 
all equally void of Charity to the others truly they 
fall out, Parr, condemn, cenfure, revile, and as Op- 
portunity and Power offers, at laft, perfecute 
one another, and all one anothers Adherents. 

The third, half informed indifferent Man, he 
£omes in between thefe two, laughs at them both, 
fays they are a Parcel of furious Chriflians, tha^ 
the thing is notabfolutely neceflary to be known, 
that it is no Article of Faith, fo as that with- 
out deciding it, a Man cannot be fav'd ; fays, 
they are a Parcel of Fools to fall out thus about 
what they cannnot be certain of, and which they 
may go to Heaven tho'they ihould not underftand 
it till they come there : And thus the World comes 
to be divided. 

Could they differ with Humility, they w^ould 
difter with Charity ; but it is not to be, in Religi- 
on, whatever it may be in civil or politick Affairs; 
for there is a thing callM Z^aly w^hich Men call 
a Grace in Religion, and eif eem a Duty ; and this 
makes Men fall cut in religious Matters, with ^ 
more fatal Warmth, and more Animofity, than in 
other Cafes, according to Hudibrajs. 

" Zeal makes men fight like mad or drunk, 
*' For Dame Religion as for Punk. 

Nor is this the Fate only of theChriftian Relici- 
pUj tlio' 'cis more lb rhcrethan in any other ; but 'tis 

the 



[ lyi ] 

the fame in other Cafes, as between tlie Perfians 
and the T'tirksy about the Succeflbrs of their Pro- 
phet Mahomet. It was fo of Old between the 
Jleathen and the Jews : And the AJfyrian Monarch 
prepar'd a fiery i^ urnace for thofe that would not fall 
down and worfhip the great Image that he had fee 
up. 

In the Primitive Times of God's Church, the 
Heathen did the like by theChriftians, and Chriftia- 
msadLeones was the common Cry : But when the 
Church came to its Halcyon- Days, Ccnflantine the 
Great gave Peace to tlie Chri{]:ians5and it was but a 
little While that they enjoy 'd that Peace, before 
they fell out by the Way, the Arian Herefies rofe 
up, and differing Opinions rent the State into Fa- 
dions, the Church into Schifms, and in the Space 
of two Reigns, the Arians perfecuted the Ortho- 
dox, and the Orthodox the Arians, almoft with 
the fame Fury as the Heathen had perfecutech era 
both with before. 

From thence to our Time, Perfecution has been 
the Practice even of all Parties, as they have been 
clothed with Power, and as their Ditferences have 
mov'd them: For Example, in all the Chriflian 
Countries, there is a mortal Feud between Popiib 
and Proteffant; and tho' indeed the former jbave 
carry 'd their Zeal fartheft, yet the latter have not 
been able to fay they have not perfecuted in their 
Turn, tho' not with Fire and Faggot. 

What Wars and Bloodfbed molefled Europe on 
the Account of Religion in Germany ? efpecially 
till the general PaciHcation of thofe Troubles at 
the Treaty of Weftphalia^ when the Proteflants 
having had the apparent Advantage of the War, 
pbtain'd the everlafting Settlement of their Religi- 
on, as well as Liberties thro' the whole Empire.

[ 17^ ] 

Since thofe times^ what Perfecution in the fame 
Country, between the Lutheran and Calviniii 
Churches ? And how little Charity is among them } 
infomuch, that the Lutherans to this Day will noc 
allow the reformed Evangelick Churches, fo the 
CalviniftsarecairdjLib^rty toafl'erable for Worfhip 
within the Gates of their Cities, or give thepi 
Chriftian Burial. 

I avoid looking too near Home, or fearchingin 
Scotland and England 2Lmon^ the unhappy Divifi- 
ons of Epifcopal and Presbyterian, Church o^ Eng- 
land and Diilenter; and this 1 do^ becaufe it is at 
Home : But it is too evident, that all thefe come 
either from Men^ being neghgent of right Informa- 
tions, or too tenacious when they have it; for 'tis 
evidentj ii all Men would be honeft to the Lighi" 
they have, and favourable to their Neighbours,we 
might hope, that how many feveral Ways foever, 
we chofe to walk towards Heaven^ we fhould all 
meet there at laft. 

I look upon air the Seeds of religious DifTen-' 
tion, fis Tares fow*d by the Devil among the 
Wheat : And it may be obferved, that tho', as 1 
have ah'eady faid^ the AJfjr tans perfecuted the Jews, 
and the Romans the Chrifl.'ans; yet where the 
Devil is immediately and perfonally worfhipped, 
there we meet with little or no Perfecution ; for 
Satan having a kind of peaceable Dominion there, 
offers them no Diflurbance : He defires no Inno- 
vation for ever; he finds the Sweetnefs of it, and 
lets it all alone. 

But if once they talk of ether Gods bejore him^ 
he is far lefs e'^^y ; there he is continually fowing 
Strife, and hatching Divifions among them ; for 
like all other Monarch^, the Devil loves to reign 

alone. 

It 



[•7J] 

It would be too long a Task here, to reckon up 
^he feveral Sorts of Diflerences in Religion, even 
among us in England; where, if two happen to 
differ, prefently like St. Paul to St. Peter^ they 
withfland one ancther to the Pace i that is to fay, car- 
ry on the Difpute to theutmofl Extremity. 

But there is anorher Queflion before me, and 
that is not only. Why there are fuch Differences 
in the Points of Re'.igon? And, why are religi- 
ous Differences hotter and more irreconcilable 
than other Breaches? But, why are there more 
Differences of this Kind among us, than among 
any other Nation in the World? 

Certainly this pulhing on our religious Broils to 
the Extremity, is the Peculiar of this Country of 
England, and is not the fame thing in other Places; 
and the Variety is fuchhere, that 'tis faid, there 
are more feveral Communions or Communities of 
religious Kinds in England, than in all the other 
Proteftant Countries in the V/orld. 

The bed and mofl charitable Anfwer that I 
can think of to give for this, is to compliment 
our felves, and fay, 'tis becaufe we are the moft 
religious Nation in the World ,• that is to fay, 
that we in general fer more ferioufly to work, to 
enquire into the Subflance and Nature of Religion; 
to examine Principles, and weigh the Reafons of 
things, than^other People,- being more concerned 
for, and anxious about, the Affairs of God, of 
Heaven, and our Souls,* that thinking, as we 
ought to do, that Religion is of the utmoft Con- 
cern to us, and that it is of the laft Moment to us 
to be certain about k^ and well grounded in the 
Points before us,particuiarly whether we are rightly 
informed or not j this anxious Concern makes us jea- 
lous of every Opinion and Tenacious of our own» 
breaks much in upon the Cuftom of (ubmftting 

our 



[ 174 I 

our Judgments to the Clergy, as is the Cafe in 
Countries, where People are more indifferent in 
their Search after theie things, and more uncon- 
cerned in the Certainty or Uncertainty of them. 

I mud acknowledge, that I think the true 
and the only juflReafon that can be given for this 
Matter, is not, that ] we are more furious 
than other People, more cenforious and ralliinour 
Judgment, that we have h[s Charity, or lefs Pa- 
tience, in debating religious Points, than other 
People ; Buc the Truth is, that we have lefs In- 
difterence about them; and we cannot fit down 
contented with a Sh'ght and overly Enquiry, or a 
Curfory or School Anfwer to the Doubts in Qtie- 
ftion : But we make it a Thing of abfolute neceili- 
ty, to be fully informed of, and therefore are ear- 
neft in the Enquiry, and knowing the Scripture 
to be the great Rule of Faith, the Standard for 
Life and Doftrine, we f!ie thither and fearch for 
our felves, not having Popery enough to exped an 
infallible Judge, not Indifference enough to acqui- 
efce in the Judgment of the Clergy ; and perhaps a 
little too tenacious of our own Interpretation, 
even in things we are uninflruded about. 

This indeed I take to be the true Reafon why 
religious Difputes encreafe fo much here, and why 
there are fuch Separations and Schifms among us, 
more than they are in any other Nation in the 
World. 

I know much of it is laid to the Door of the 
Confufions they were all in here, during the bloody 
intedine Wars in the Years 1(^40 to 16^6, and the 
Liberty given to all Opinions to fetuplhemfelves 
at that Time : But I wave that as a Qiieftion that 
tends to more Divifion. I believe, the Reafon I 
have given for it. Hands as well grounded, and as 

likely 



[175] 

likely to be approved as any I can give, or as any 
that has been given in this Cafe. 

There is another difficult Qiieflion, which flii.1 
remains before us ; and that is, What Remedy 
can ^ve apply to this Malady ? Ard firft, I muft 
anfwer negatively ; not to have us be lefs religious^ 
that we might differ lefs about it : But to have 
us exercife more Charity in our Difputes, that we 
might differ more like Men of Temper, and more 
like Chrillians, than we do: This is flriking at 
the Root of religious Differences , for if they were 
carry'd on mildly with a peaceable Spirit, w illing 
to be inform^, a Difpofition to Love as Brethren, 
tho in every thing not like minded : Our Variety 
of Opinions would not then have the Name of 
Differences, we (hould not feparate in Communion 
and in Charity, tho' we did not agree in every 
thing we were to believe or not believe, about 
Religion. 

It is hard that we fhould fay thefe Differences 
are the Confequences of a Nation, havuig more 
Religion than their Neighbours, fince we have 
fliil this one Part too little j and as I fuppofe us 
to have more Religion, 1 mufl be obligM to grant 
we have not enough more ; for if, as we have jufl fo 
much more Religion, as is fufficient to make us 
quarrelfome in religious Difputesj we had yet 
as much more, as were fufficient to make us 
peaceable again after it, then we fl:ould lt)e reli- 
gious to Purpofe. 

So that, in a Word, our being fo religious, as 
above, is only an unhappy middle Compolirioii 
between the enquiring and fully informed Chrifti- 
an on one Hand, and the carelefs, indifferent, un- 
concerned Temper, that takes up with any thing, 
on the other Hand : And this i take to be a juff tho'

fiiort Account of our Differences in England akut 
Religion* 

It might be a very ufeful Queflion to flart here, 
namely where all our unhappy rehgious Differences 
will end. 1 that am not wiiJing to give the v/or£l 
iiatur'd Anfwer, where the befi: and kindefl: will 
hold Water, am for the prcfenr difpos'd.to anfwer 
in genera^rather than defcend to ^2LXt\ci\\zxs^viz,. in 
Heaven: There all our unkind,unchnllian, unneigh- 
bourly, unbrotherly Differences will end : We fhall 
freely fhake Hands there with many a pardon'd 
Sinner5that here xve hid fland cff ; embrace many a 
Publican,that here we think it a Difhonour to con- 
verfe with , fee many a Heart that we have broken 
herewith Cenfures, Reproachings, and Revilings, 
made whole again by the Balm of the fame Re^ 
deemer^'s Blood. 

There we fliall fee, that there have been other 
Flocks' than thofe of our Fold, other Path^ to 
Heaven than thofe we fhut Men out from j that 
thofe we have excommunicated have bten taken 
into that fuperiour Communion ; and thofe we 
have plac'dat'our Left-hands, have been there fum- 
mon'd to the Right-hand j all Separations will 
be there taken away, and the Mind of every Chri- 
ftian be entirely reconcild to one another ; no t)i- 
vifions, no Differences, no charging (incere Minds 
with Hypocrify, or embracing painted Hypocrites 
for Saints i every thing to be feen, and to be 
known, as it really is, and by a clear Light \ none 
will deiire to deceive, none be fubjed to be de- 
ceived. 

There we fliall look upon all we have done and 
faid in Prejudice of the Charader of our Brethren 
with a juft Change, and fufficiently repair to one 
another all the injurious things we have faid, or 
indeed but thought of one another, by rejoicing 

itt 



[ 177 ] 

ill the common Felicity, and praifing the fove- 
reign Glory, that had received thofe we had foo- 
lifhiy rejected, and let thofe into the fame Heaven, 
whom we had in the Abundance of our Pride, and 
the Penury of our Charity, fhut out. 

How many Adions of Men, which we, feeing 
only their Out-lide, have now ccnfur'd, fliall wc 
find there, by tliat Penetration that cannot err, be 
accepted for their in-fide Sincerity? How many 
an Opinion, that we condemn here, fliall we fee 
then to be Orthodox ? In a Word, How many 
contradiding Notions and Principles, which wc 
thought inconfiftent with true Religion, fliall w^c 
find then to be reconcilable to themfelves, to one 
another, and to the Fountain of Truth ? 

All the Difficulties in our Conceptions of things 
invifible, will then be explain'd ; all the Dodrines 
of the Immutability of the divine Councils will 
then be reconcilable to the changeable Events of 
things, and to the Varieties often happening in 
the World : The Unchangeablenefs of the eternal 
Decrees will then appear; and yet the Efficacy of 
praying to God to do this, or not do that, to 
pardon, forgive, fpare, and forbear, which we 
now fay is inconfiflent with thofe unchangeable 
Decrees, Ihall be reconcilable to that Unchange- 
ablenefs, in a Manner to us now inconceiveable. 

And this is the Foundation of what I now ad- 
vance, viz.. That in Heaven all our Differences in 
Religion will be reconciled, and will be at an Esd. 
If any Man ask me, whether they cannot be ended 
before? I anfwer, If vjc were all thoroughly con- 
vinced, that they would be reconcil'd then, wc 
fhould certainly put an End to them before ,* but 
'tis impoflible to be done. Mens Convidions of 
t,he greateft and mod certain Truths, arc 
not equal to one another, or equal to the 

N Weight 



[iVS] 



Weight and'Significancy of thofe Truths ; and 
therefore, fuch a general Effed: of this Affair can- 
not be expeded on this Side of Time. 

There is one very great Reconciler of religious 
Difterences in this World, which has fometimes 
been made ufe of by Providence to heal the Breaches 
in Chriftian Charity among religious People^ and 
it is, generally fpeaking, very eftedual : But it is 
a bitter Draughty a Potion that goes down with 
great R.eiu6:ance, and that is Persecution. This 
generally reconciles the Differences of Chriftians, 
about the leiTer Matters in Religion : The Primi- 
tive Churches, while under the Roman Perfecutions, 
had a much greater Harmony among themfelves, 
and very few Schifms and Divifions broke out a- 
mong them. When they did differ in any Parti- 
cular Points, they wrote healing Epiflles to one 
another, contended with Modefly and with Cha- 
rity, and referred willingly their Notions to be de- 
cided by one another. They did not feparate Com- 
munion, and excommunicate whole Churches and 
Nations, for a Difpute about the Celebration of 
Eaftevy or unchurch one another for the Queflion 
of receiving and re-baptizing of Penitents, as was 
afterwards the Cafe. The Furnace of AfHi(5tion 
burnt up all that Drofs, the Fury of their Perfe- 
cutors kept their Minds humble, their Zeal for 
Religion hot, and their AfFe(flion for, and Charity 
to one another encreafedas their Liberty, and their 
Number was leffened. 

Thus Bifliop PJdIey,and Bi(hop Hooper ; the firfl, 
a rigid Church oi England EiHiop, the other, almofl 
a Presbyterian, or at leaff a Calvinifl, like PeUr 
2.nd Pauly d fFer'd hotly, and withflood one ano- 
ther to the Face.^ in the very Beginning of the Re- 
formation : But when they came to burn for their 
Religion, Fire and Faggot Ihew'd them the Re- 

concilablenefs 



C 179 ] 

concileablenefs of all their Difpntes ; convinced 
Ehem, that it was poiTible for both to hold faA 
the Truth in Sincerity^ and yet entertain differing 
Notions of the Rites and Oatfides of the divine 
OEconomy, and at the Stake they ended all their 
Difputes, wrote healing Letters to one another;, 
and became Fellow-Martyrs and Confeffors for 
that very ProfefTion which was fo intermix'd with 
Cenfure and Diflike before. 

And let all that think of this Remedy remem- 
ber, that whenever thefe quarrelfome Chriftians 
come, by Perfecution, or any other Incident, to 
be thus reconcird in their Charity, they find al- 
ways a great deal to ask Pardon of one another 
for, with refped to what is pafl: j all their Violence, 
Heat of Zeal, and much more Heat of Paffion, 
all their Breach of Charity, their Reproaches and 
Cenfures, and hard Words, which have pafs'd be^ 
tween them, will only then ferve to bring them 
together with more Affedion, and to Embrace 
more warmly j for, depend upon it, all the Diffe- 
rences in Religion among good Men, (for I do 
not mean Ejjential, DoBrinal^ and Fundamental 
Differerences) ferve only to make them all alham'd 
of themfeives at lafl:.

O/" the zvonderful Exalicncy of

Virtue. 



Egative Virtue fets out like the Phari-

of religious Pageantry; a jointed Baby 

drefs'd up g^^y, but ftript of its Gew-

Hypocrite, \[s a Cheat upon the Neighbourhood, 
a Drefs fo?* without Doors, for 'tis of no Ufe 
within; 'tis a Mask put on for a Charader, and 
as generally 'tis ufed to cheat others, 'tis fo igno- 
rantly eifibrac'd, that we cheat even ourfelves 
with it. 

In a Word, Negative Virtue is Pojitivs YiCQ^ at 
leaft when it is made ufe of in any of the two laft 
Cafes ; namely. Either as a Mask to deceive others, 
or as a Mifi to deceive ourfelves. If a Man were 
to look back tipon it, to fee in what Part he 
could take up his Neft, or lay a Foundation of 
Hope for the Satisfadion of his Mind, as to fu- 
ture things, he would find it the mofl: uncom- 
fortable Condition to go ou?: of tlie World with, 
that any Man in the World can think. 

The Reafon [s plain, compare it With the Pub- 
lican, whom (uch a Man defpifes : Here is my 
Landlord is a Drunkard, one of my Tenants is a 
Thief, fiich a poor Man is a Swearer, fuch a rich 
' .^ * Maa 



[ i8i ] 

Man a Blafphemer, fnch a Tradefman is a Cheat. 
fuch a Juftice ot the Peace is an Atheifl, fuch a 
rakifh Fellow is turn'd Highv/ayman, fuch a 
Beau is debauch'd ,* Biitli I that am cloath'd 
in Negatives, and walk in the Light of my own 
Vanity, Iliveafober, regular, retired Life, lam 
an honefl Man : Vide Page . I defraud no bocy, 
no Man ever heard me fwear, or an ill Vv'ord' 
come out of my Mouth ; I never talk irrelgictiiy 
or prophanely, and I am never mifs'd out of my 
Seat at Church. God I thank ihct ! I an not 
debauch'd, I am no Highwayman, no Mu.cicrer, 
&C' Now, what's the Difference or all thcfe ? 1 
mufl confefs, fpeaking of all thefe together, and 
of what is ufually the End of them, I think a 
Man had better be any of them, nay, almofl all 
of them together, than the Man himfelf i and my 
Reafon is, in a few Words as follows : 

All thefe know themfeives to be wicked Per- 
fons ; Cor;fcience, tho' for a Time opprefs'd and 
kept under, yet upon all Occaiions tells them 
plainly what their Condicion is, and oftentimes 
they repent. 'Tis true, fome times they do not, 
God is pieas'd fome times to treat them in the 
vindictive Attribute, and they are cut off in their 
Crimes, infenfible and flupid, without a Space or 
a Heart to repent ; and therefore, let none take 
Hope in their profligate Living, from what 1 am 
going to fay. 

Again ; others, tho' they do repent, and God 
is pleas'd to give them the Grace to return to 
him as Penitents, come to it very late, and fome- 
times under a fevere Hand, as perhaps on a 
Death-Bed, or under fome Difaller, and often- 
times at the Gallows. 

But (Hil I Hiy, thofe Men tho' they (in, they do 

it as a Crime^ and v/hen they come to be told 

N3 • ■• of 



[ l82 ] 

of it often, they are brought to repent: Bat thQ 
Negative Chriflian I fpeak of, is To full of him- 
felf, fo perfwaded. that he is good enough, and 
religious cno..gli already, that he has no Thoughts 
of anv thing, unlefs ir be to pull off his Hat to iSod 
Almighty now and then, and thank him, that he 
has no Need of him; this is the Opiat that 
dofes nis Soul even to the laft Gafp ; and it 
is ten thoufand to one, but the Lethargic Dream 
llioots him thro' the Gulphatonce, and he never 
opens his Eyes till he arrives in that Light, where 
all things are naked and open ; where he fees 
too late, that he has bepnaCheatto himfelf, and 
has been hurryM by his own Pride in a Cloud of 
Negatives^ into a Statue ofpoiitive Deftrudion, 
■without Remedy. 

I am reading no particular Man's Fate ; God 
forbid! I reRrain it to no Circumflances, I point 
put no Perfons ; 'tis too folemn a thing to make 
it. a Satyr -, 'tis the State, nqt the Man, I fpeak 
of; let the guilty apply it to themfelves, and the 
proud good Man humble himfelf, and avoid in. 

I have obferv'd, that many fall into this Cafe 
by the exceilive Vaniry of being thought well of 
by their Neighbours, obtaining a Ch a racter,Grc/t is 
a Deluiion very fatal to many ; a good Name, is 
indeed a precious Ointment, and in fome Cafes 
is better than Life : But with your Pardon, Mr. 
Negative, it mufl be a good Name for good Deeds, 
or other wife, a good Name upon a bad Life is a 
-fainted IVhore, that has a gay Countenance upon a 
rotten, difeaRd, corrupted Carcafs. 

Much to be preferr'd is the general Slander of a 
prejudiced Age, and a State of univcrfal Calumny, 
where (helVlind ;S free from tfieGuilt tney ciiarge : 
Such ^ Man, tho^ tlie Woda ipits upon and defpi-

with Hope.

General Contempt, univerfal Repro^ich, is a 
Life that requires a world of Courage and 
Steadinefs of Mind to fupport : But, be this 
my Portion in this World, with a Heart chat docs 
not reproach me with the Guilt;, muph rather 
than to be a Man of Negatives only, and who ai^ 
the World carefles with their good Wifhes, and 
good Opinion, but is himfelf empty of real Vir- 
tue, a Hypocrite at Bottom, a Cheat, and under 
the Delufion of it ; whofe Portion is with Hypo- 
crites, and who can neither look in, or look up 
with Pleafure, but muft look without himfelf, for 
all that can be calfd Good, cither by ethers, or 
by himfelf. 

As at the Great and Lafl Day, the Secrets o£ 
all Hearts fhall be difclofed, fo I am perfwaded, 
the Opinion we have of one another here, will be 
one of the Things which will be there, and per- 
haps not till then fully rectify 'd ; and as we foall 
be there thorowly enlightened, we fhall find Room 
to fee, that we' have been much miflaken in our No- 
tions of Virtue and Vice, Religion and Irreligion, 
in the Charaders of our Neighbours. And I am 
perfwaded, we fhall fee many pf our Acquaintan- 
ces placed at the Right-hand of a righteous Judge, 
whofe Characters we have opprefled with Slanders, 
and who we have cenforioufly placed at his Left- 
hand here : And many a painted Hypocrite, w'ho 
has infulted his Neighbour with, Stand off, I am 
holier than tku, or whom he has turned from

with Difdaln, and with a I'his Puhlkan ! placM at 
the Lefc-hand, who we made no Doubt we fhould 
have Teen at the R'ght-hand in Triumph. 

This IS a Support to the Mind of a good Man, 
even when his Enemies, as David fays, gnajh upon 
him 'With their "feethy and have him in JDerijiony 
that is to fay, when he is run down by univerfal 
Clamour, and damn'd by the Tongues of Men, 
even for this V/orld and another. 

Happy the Man, who with exalted Soul, 
Knows how to rate the great the pr off rem Fooly 
Who can the Infults of the Street contemn. 
And values not the Rage or Tongues of Men ? 
He like the Sun exi/is on his own Flame, 
And when he dies, is to himfelj 2l Fame. 

But take this with you ^s you go, that as nega- 
tive Praife will build no Man Comfort, fo nega- 
tive Virtue will not fiipport the Mind under uni- 
verfal Contempt. Scandal is much worfe than 
Slander j for the firft is founded upon real Guilt, 
the other attacks Innocence. Nothing is a Scan- 
dal, but what is true : Nothing is a Slander, but 
what is falfe. 

He that fortifies himfelf againft Reproach, muft 
do ix with a certain Referve of Real, andfolid Vir- 
tue, and Piety ; it muft be Uprightnefs and Inte- 
grity that muft prcferve hira ; nothing but a Fund 
of what is good can fupport the Mind under the 
Rcprotich of being all that is bad ; I do not mean 
neither, that the Man muft be perfed, have no 
Follies or Failings, have made no Excurfions, have 
nothing to be laid to the Charge of his Charac^ler ,* 
for where then fliallxhe Man be found I am fpea- 
kingof? And I n^ay be faid to be defcribing the 

Bl4ck-

Black-fwan, erfon that is nor, and never was 
to be found : But the right Way of judging Men, 
and the Way which alone can be juii, is to judge 
oFthem by their general CondiK^; i and (o a Man 
may in his own Mind juftly denominate himfeif: 
As every^ good Ad:ion does not denominate me 
to be a good Man, fo neither does every Failing, 
every Folly, no nor every fcandalous Adion, de^ 
nominate me a Hypocrite, or a wicked Man ; 
otherwife, fome of the moil eminent Saints in Scrip- 
ture, and of every Age fince the Scripture was 
written, are gone to the Devil ; and 'twill be 
hard to fay, there wa$ ever a good Man in the 
World. 

But I return to ray Subjed, the negative good 
Man ; and let me examine him a little in his juft 
Character, in his Condud, publick and private : 
He is no Drunkard, but is intoxicated with the 
Pride of his own Worth : He is a good Neigh- 
bour, a common Arbitrator and Peace-maker in 
other Families, but a ciirfed Tyrant in his own : 
He appears in a publick Place of Worfiiip for a 
Show, but never enters into his Clofet and fhuts 
the Door about him, to pray to him that fees in 
Secret : He is covered with the vain-glorious, 
and oftentatious Part of Charjity, but does all h;s 
Alms before Men, to he feen of them: He is migh- 
ty eager in the Duties of the fecond Table> but re- 
gardlefs of the firft ; appearingly religious to be 
feen and taken Notice ot by Menj but between 
God and his own Soul, no Entercourfe, no Com- 
munication : What is this Man ? And what Com- 
fort is there of the Life he liv^es ? He knows lit- 
tle, or perhaps nothing of Faith, Repentance, and 
^ Chriftian mortified Life : In a Word, he is a / 
Man perfed in the Circumilances of Religion, ^ 
■'■'■■ -- ' • and 



[ I8d] 



5.nd perfe<51:ly a Stranger to tlie effential Part of 
Religion. 

Take this Man's Converfation apart, enter into 
the private and retired Part of it. What Notions 
has he of mifpent Hours, and of the natural Re- 
liux of all our Minutes, on to the great Center and 
Gulph of Life, Eternity} Does he know how to 
put a right Value upon Tjme ? Does he efleem ic 
the Life- Blood of bis Soul, as it really is^ and aft 
in all the Moments of it, as one that muft ac- 
count for them ? Alas! this is of no V/eight with 
fuch a Man ; he is too full of himfelf to enter in- 
to any Notions about an Account, either for mi- 
fpent Time, or any thing t\{^ mifdone,- but petr 
iwading himfelf, that he never did any thing amifs, 
entertains no Notion of Judgment to come^ Eter^ 
nity, or any thing in it. 

What Room has a Man to expatiate in 
bis Thoughts upon fo immenfe and inconceivable 
a Subjed, as that of eternal Duration, whofe 
Thoughts are all taken up, and fwell'd Top-full 
v/ith his own extraordinary felf. It would be im- 
poiTible for any Man in the World to entertain one 
proud Thought of himfelf, if he had but one 
right Idea of a future State. Could fuch a Man 
think, that any thing in him^ or any thing he coul4 
do, could purchafe for him, a Felicity that was 
to laft to Eternity ? What ! that a Man Ihould be ca- 
pable in one Moment (for Life is not that in Length 
compared to Eternity) to do any thing for which he 
Ihould de.ferve to be made happy to Eternity? 

If then you can form no Equality between what 
lic can do, and what he fiiall receive jlefs can it be 
founded upon his negative Virtue, or what he has 
forbcrn to doi and if neither his negative nor his 
pofitive Piety can be equal to the Reward, and tp 
the Eternity that Reward is to lafl for ; What 

then 



[ i87 ] 

then is become of the Pharifee ? he mull: think no 
more of himfelf, for all his Boafts j neither of his 
Negatives nor his Pofitives, but of a rich unboun- 
ded Grace, that rewards according to itfelf, not 
according to what we can do ; and that to be 
judged at the laft Day according to our Works, 
if literally underftood, would be to be undone ; 
but we are to be judged by the Sincerity of our 
Repentance, be rewarded according to the infi- 
nite Grace of God, and Purchafe of Chriftj 
with a State of Eleffednefs to an endlefs Eter- 
nity. 

Indeed this Eternity is not a Meditation fuita- 
ble to the Man I am talking of, 'tis a fublirne 
ThonghL,which his bloated Imagination has never 
defcended to, or engag 'din, and when it comes, 
he is like to have as little Comfort of it, as he has 
had Thought about it. 

This Thought of Eternity raifes new Ideas in 
my Mind, and I cannot go forward without a 
Digreflion upon fo important a Subjed:; if the 
Reader approves the Thought, he will not quar- 
rel about its being a Digreflion.

But to the Purpofe in Hand ; for I have not 
done with this Man of Negatives yet : And now 
let us bring him more ?iearly and ferioufly to a 
Converfe witli the invifible World: He looks in- 
to it with Horror and dreadful Apprehenlions, as 
F(e//x,when Sz.Paul reafoned oFTemperance,Righ- 
teoufnefsj and of Judgment to come. FoeliXy was 

a moral 



[ 191 ] 

a moral Heathen, that is to fay, a Man of Nega- 
tives, like him I am fpeaking of. What was 
then the Cafe ? he trembl'd -, Pray, what is it rea- 
fonable to think Fcelix trembled at ? if I may give 
my Opinion, who am but a very mean Expofitor 
of Texts, it was this or fomething like it. 

Foelix was a Philofopher, as well as a Man of 
Powers and by his Wifdom^ as alfo by his Reve- 
rence of the Gods, which at that Time was the 
Sum of Religion, had been a Man of Morals, a 
Man that had prad:ic'd Temperance and Righre- 
oufnefe, as the Life which was unqueftionably to 
be rewarded by the Powers above, witli an Ely- 
iian Felicity ; that is to fay, according to the Ro- 
man Maxim, That the Gods were the Rewarders 
of Virtue. 

But when the bleffed Apoftle came to reafbn 
with Foeli)^^ how unlikely it was, that thefc Ne- 
gatives ihduld purchafe our Happinefs hereafter, 
he fhew'd him, that'the Gods could not be in Debt 
to us for the Pradice of Virtue, which was indeed no 
more than livmg moft fuitable to our Reafon> 
that a Life of Virtue and Temperance was its own 
Reward, by giving a healthy Body, a clear Head^ 
a compos^'d Life, &c. fitting the Man for all 
other worldly Enjoyments, adequate to his Rea." 
fon, and his prefent Felicity as a Man : Bnt 
eternal Happinefs mufl come from another Sprin^^^ 
namely from the infinite unbounded Grace of a 
provok'd God, who having ereded a righteous 
Tribunal, where every Heart fhould be fearched^ 
and where every Tongue would confefs itfelfguil' 
ty, and (land felf-condemn^'d. Jefus Chnfi, whom 
Paul preach'd, would feparate fuch as by Faith and 
Repentance he had brought home, and united to 
himfelf by tke Grace of Adoption, and on the 

Fo-o£ 



r 192- ] 

Footof his having laid down his Life a Ranroiti 
for them, had appointed them to Salvation. 

When poor Negative Foeltx heard of this, and 
that all his Philofophy, his Temperance, and 
Righteoufnefs, if it had been ten thoufand Times 
as great, could weigh nothing, and plead nothing 
for him at that Judicature ,• and that he began to 
fee the Juftice and Reafon o£ this \ for Paul rea- 
foncd him into it ; I fay, when he faw this, he 
trembl'd indeed, as well he might, and as all ne- 
gative People will. 

What a ilrange Idea muft that Pharifee have of 
God, who went up with thePublican to the Tem- 
ple to pray : 'Tis obfervablc, he went Vv^th a good 
Stock of Affurance in his Face, that could come to 
the Altar, as hedid* not to offer any^ Sacrifice ; we 
don't find he carry'd any Offering, or befpoke 
the Prieft to make any Attonement ,• he wanted no 
. Priefls to make any ConfefTion to : Good Man, as 
he thought he vv^as, he had no Sins to confefs; 
he rather came up to the Altar to even Accounts 
with Heaven \ and like the other Man in the Gof- 
pel, tell God, that he had fulfill'd the whole Law, 
and had done all thofe things that werecommand- 
ed,even from his Youth ; fo,as before, he only pul- 
led off his Hat to his God, and let him know, 
that there was nothing between them at prefent, 
and away he goes about his Bufinefs. 

But the poor Wretch, whom he defpis'd, and 
whom he had left behind him, for he durff come no 
farther, aded quite another Part. He had at firfl 
indeed, in Sence of his Duty, refolv'd to go up to 
the Temple; But when he faw the Splendor and 
Majefty of God rcprefented by the Glory of that 
elevated Building ; I fay, when he faw that, tho' 
a great Way off„ and then looked into his owa 
Heart, all his negative Confidences failing him, 

and 



[ 193 1 

and a Senfe of mfferable Circtimflances coiTiing 
upon him, he flops fliort, and with a Blow of Re- 
flexion and perfectly unmixc with any of the Pha- 
rifees Pride^ he looks down in Humility, but lifts 
up his Heart in a penitential Faith, with a Lord be 
merciful tome a Sinner. 

Here was Faith ^ Repentance, Duty, and Con- 
fefTion, all conjoin'd in one Ad, and the Man's 
Work was done at onee, he ^c^ent away piflified^ 
v^hch the negative Pharifee went home, the fame- 
felf vain Wretch, that he came out with G^i/ 
thank thee in his Mouth, and a Mafs of Pride in 
his Heart, that nothing could convince. 

In what glorious Colours do the Scriptutes up- 
on all Occ;a(ions reprefent thofe two Hand in Hand 
Graces, Paith ^nd Repentance} There is not one 
Mention of Faith in the whole Scripture, but 
what is recommending fome Way or other to our 
Admiration, and to our Practice ,• 'tis the Foun- 
dation and the Top-flone of all Religion, the 
Right-hand to lead, and the Left-hand to fypporr, 
in the whole Journey of a Chriftian, even thro'' this 
World, and into the next : In a Word, 'tis the / 
Sum and Subflance q^ the Gofpel Foundation. / 

Religion feems to have been founded upon thfee' 
Eftabliftiments in the Worlds in ail which the 
Terms of Life are laid down at the End of our 
Acceptance of it. 

The Firft Eftablifhment was with Ada?n in Pa" 
radife ; the Terms of which were, Forbear and 
Live, ^ ■ _ 

The Second feftabliiliment was with the Chil- 
dren of Ifrael, in the giving of the Law ; the Terms 
of which were, D o and Live. 

The Third Eftablilhment is that of the Gofpel 
of Jefus Chrift j the Terms of which are. Believe 
inndLi'Ve^ 

O So 



[ 194 ] 



So that in a Word, Faith is the Subflanee 
and Fulfilling of Gofpel Religion, the Plan of 
Righteoufnefs, and the great Efficient of eter- 
nal Life. Let me break out here upon this glo- 
rious Subjed, and pardon the Excurlioi], I en^

If all this be to be faid, and all indeed but a Poe- 
tical Trifle upon this exalted Subjed, What is be- 
come of our Negative Chriflian in all this? There 
is not a Word of Negative Religion in all the De- 
fcription of Faith, any more than there is of Faith 
in all our Negative Religion. 

Now let us fpllow this poor Negative Wretch to 
his Death-bed, and there having very lictle other 
Notion of Religion ; for 'tis the Fate of thofe 
that truft to their Negatives, to have little elfe in 
their Thoughts : If a good Man come to talk v/ith 
him, if he talks out of that Way, he puts him all 
into Confufion ; for if he cannot fwim upon the 
Bladders of his Negatives, he drowns immediate- 
ly, or he bouys himfelf up above your Reproofs, 
and goes on as before : He is a little like the Pa- 
///:? Captain Uratz., who was executed for the Mur- 
^ ther of Mr. I'bynne, who, when they talk\ to him 
of Repentance, and of Jefus Chrifl, faid, he was 
offuch and fuch a Family, and he hop'd God would 
have fome Refped to him as a Gentleman. 

But what muft a poor Minifler do, who being 
fiU'd with better Principles, prays for this vaiu 
glorious Man ? MufI: he fay. Lord accept this 
good Man, for he has been no Drunkard, no Swea- 
rer, no debauch^'d Perfon j : he has been a juft, a 
charitable Man, has done a gre^t deal of Good 
among his Neighbours, and never wilfully wrongM 
any Man ; he has not been fo wicked as it is the 
Cuftom of the Times to be ^ nor has he fhewn 
bad Examples to others; Lord be merciful to this 
excellent good Man? 

No, no, the poor fincere Miuifl:er knows better 
things j and if he prays, with him, he turns him 
quite in-fide-out, reprefents him as a poor mifla- 
ken Creature, who now fces^ that he is nothing, 

and 



[io3 ] 

and has nothing in hirpfelf, but cafts himfelf en- 
tirely, as a miferable loft Sinner, into the Arms 
of a moft mere ful Saviour, praying to be accep- 
ted on the Merits of Jefus Chnft, and no other ; 
fo that there's all his Negative Bottom unra- 
vell'd at once ; and if this is not his Cafe, it 
muft be worfe. ' •

Of U fining to the Voice of Pro. 

V I D E N C E. 

E are naturally backward to inform 
our {elves of our Duty to our Ma^ 
ker, and to our felves ; "'tis a Study 
we engage in with great Reludance, 
and ^tis but too agreeable to us, 
when we meet with any Difficulty 
v/hich we think gives us a ju/l Occafioi) to throw 
off any farther Enquiries or that kind. 

Hence I obferve the wifefl of Men often run 
into Miiiakes about the Things, which fpeaking 
ot Religion we call Duty, taking up flight Notions 
of them, and believing they underfland enough of 
them ; by which they rob themfelves of the Ad- 
vantage, as well as Corntort of a farther fearch. 
Or on the other hand, taking up with the gene- 
ral Knowledge of religious Princ'ples, and the 
common Duties of a ChriHian Life, are iatisfy'd 
with knowing what they fay is fulHcient to carry 
them to Heaven, withouc enquiring into thofe 
Things which are helpful and afliflant to make 
that flrait Path eafy and plcafant to themfelves ; 
and to make them ufeful to others by the 
Way. . _ _ ■ ' 

Solomon was quite of another Opinion, wheq 
he bid us cry after K'/Wiv/eJ^e, and lift up our l^^oice.

/or Underfianding ; dig for her as for Sihery zndfearch 
for her as for hid TrcYijure, It is certain here that he 
meant religious Knowledge ; and it is explained 
in the very next Words, with an encouraging Pro- 
mife to thofe that (liall enter upon the Search, (viz,) 
7 hen fhalt thou underftand ihe Fear of the LO RD^ 
and find the Knowledge of G D. 

I am of Opinion that it is our unqueflioned 
Duty, to enquire after every Thing in our Jour- 
ney to the eternal Habitation, which God has 
permitted us to know, and thus to raife DiiEcLiI- 
ties in the Way of our juit fearch into divine Dif- 
coveries is to di^XyVikQ Solomon s Sluggard, who faith^ 
^here is a Lion ivithout, Ijhall be (lain in the Streets^ 
Prov. xxii. 13. that is, he fits down in his Ignorance 
repuls'^d with imaginary difficulties, without making 
one Step in the fearch after the Knowledge, which 
he ought to dig for, as fir hid Treafure. 

Let us then be encourag'd to our Duty ; let us 
boldly enquire after every Thing that God has 
permitted us to know ; I grant that fecret Things 
belong to God, and I fhall labour to keep my due 
Diftance. But I firmly believe, that there are no 
fecret Things belonging to God, and which 
as fuch we are forbidden to enquire into, but what 
alfo are fo preferv'd in Secrecy, that by all our 
Enquiries we cannot arrive to the Knowledge of 
them ^ and it is a moil merciful, as well as wife 
Difpenfation, that we are only forbid enquiring 
after rhefe Things which we cannot know ; and 
that all thofe Things areeffedually lock'd up from 
our Knowledge, which we are forbidden to en- 
quire into. The Cafe is better with us, than it 
was with Adam. We have not the Tree of Know-^ 
ledge firfl: planted in our View, as it were tempt- 
ing us with its Beauty, and v/ithin our Reach, 
and then a Prohibition upon Pain of Death : But

fcleffed be God? we may eat of all the Trees la 
the GarCwii ; and all thofe of which we are not 
allowM to rake, are pJac d both out of our Sights 
and out of our Pveach. 

I am making Way here to one of the Trees of 
facred Knowledge, which tho' it may grow in the 
thickeft of the Wood, and be fnrrounded with 
fome Briars and Thorns, fo as to place it a little 
out of Sight i yet I hope to prove, that it is our 
Duty to tafte oFit : and that the Way to come at 
it, is both pradicable and plain. 

But to wave the Allegory, as I am entring into 
the niceft Search of divine things, that perhaps the 
whole Scheme of Religion direds us to ; 'tis ab- 
foluteiy neceflary at our Entrance, iffoffible, to re- 
move every Difficulty, explain every Principle^ 
and lay down every Foundation fo undeniably 
clear, that nothing may appear dark or myfterious 
in our firft Conceptions of things j no Stumbling- 
block lye at the Threfhold, and the humble Rea- 
der may meet with no Repulfe from his own Ap- 
prehenfions, of not under/landing what he is going 
to read. 

Liftening to the Voice of Providence y is my Subjed : 
I am willing to fnppofe in the firft Place, that I am 
tvriting to thofe who acknowledge the two grand 
Principles upon which all Religion depends, i. 
That there is 2l God, a firft great moving Caufe 
of all things, an eternal Power^ Prior ^ and confe- 
quently Superior to all Power and Being. 2. That 
this eternal Power, which I call God, istheCrea^ 
tor and Governour of all things, "viz.. of Heaven 
and Earth. 

To avoid needlefsDIftinaions concerning which 
of the Perfons in the God-head, are exercifed in the 
creating Power, and which in the governing Power. 
I offer that glorious Text, Pfalm xx^iii. 6. as a 

Repulfe 



[ 2.07 ] 

P.epulfe to all fuch cavilling Enquiries, where the 
whole Trinity is plainly entitled to the whole 
creating Work, by the Word {God the Son) of the 
Lord {God the Father) were the Heavens made, 
and all the Hoft of them, by the Breath {God the 
Holy Ghofl) of his Mouth. 

Having thus prefiippofed theBelief of the Being, 
and the creating Work of God, and declar'd, that 
I am writing to fuch only, who are ready to own^ 
they believe that God is^ and that he created the 
Heaven, and the Earth, the Sea, and all that m 
them is. I think I need not make any Preamble^ 
to introduce the follov/ing Propofitions, viz.* 

i. That this Eternal God guides by his Provi- 
dence the whole j^orld, which he has created by his 
Power- 

1 . ^hat this Providence manifefls a particular Care 
over, and Concern in the governing and direBing Man^ 
the befl and la ft created Creature on Earth. 

Natural P^eligion proves the firll, reveal'd Reli« 
gion proves the laft of thefe beyond Contradiction. 
Natural Religion intimates the NecefTity of a Pro- 
vidence guiding and governing the World, from 
the Confequencc^ of the Wifdom, Juftice, Pre* 
fcience, and Goodnefs ofthe Creator. 

It v/ould be abfurd to conceive of God exer- 
ting infinite Power to create a World, and not 
concerning his Wifdom, which is his Providence^ 
in guiding the Operations of Nature, fo as topre- 
ferve the Order of his Creation, and the Obedi- 
ence and Subordination of Confequences and Cau- 
fes throughout the Courfe of that Nature, 
which is in P^rt the inferior Lifg of that Cit- 
ation. 

ReveaVd 



[ 208 ] 

Revealed Religion has given fuch a Light into th'^ 
Care and Concern oi: this Providence in an efpe'^- 
cial Manner, "in and over that Part of the Creation 
caird MaUy that we muft likewife deny Principled, 
ii we enter into difpute about it. 

For him the Peace of the Creation is preferv'd, 
the Ch'mates made habitable, the Creatures fubje- 
ditA and made nourilhing, all vegetative Life made 
medicinal'; To that indeed the whole Creation feems 
to be entail'd upon him as an Inheritance,and given 
to him for a Pofleflion, fubjecled to his Authority, 
and governed by hinijas Viceroy to the King of ^11 
the Earth ; the Management of it is given to him as 
Tenant to the great Proprietor, who is Lord of 
the Mannor^ or Landlord of the Soil And it can 
not be conceiv^dy without great Inconiiflency o»f 
Thought, that this World isle ft entirely to Man's 
Condud without the fuperviilng Influence and 
the fecret Direftion of the Creator. 

This I call Providence^ to which I give the whole 
Power of guiding and direding of the Creation, 
ahd managing of it, by Man who is his Deputy 
orSubftitute, and even the guiding, influencing, 
and over- ruling Man himfelf alfo* 

Let critical Annotators enter into fpeciflck i)i- 
ftindio.ns of Pr3vidence, and its Way of ading^ 
as they pleafe,and as the Formalities oftheSchooH 
men dired. The fliort Defcription I fhall give of 
it is this, That it is that Operation of the Pow- 
er, Wifdom, Juftice, and Goodnefs of God, by 
which he influences;) governs, and direds, not on- 
ly the Means, but the Events of all things, which 
concern us in this World. 
J I fay, it is that Operation^ let them call it what 
■ they will, which aits thus; I am noWay concernM 
to ftiew how it ads, or why it ads thus and thus 
in particular; we are to reverence its Sovereignty, 

• as 



[ i09 ] 

as it is the Finger of God himfelf, who is the To- 
vercign Diredor, and we are to obferve its Mo- 
tions, obey its Didates, and liften to its Voice, as 
it is, and becaufe it is particularly employed for 
our Advantage. 

It would be a very proper and ufeful Obferva- 
tlon here, and might take up much of this Work, 
to illui^rate the Goodnefs of Providence, in that it 
is,* as I fay, particularly employed for the Advan- 
tage of Mankind: But, as this is not the main 
De(ign, and will come in naturally in every Part of 
the Work I am upon, I refer it to the common In- 
ferences, which are to be drawn from the Particu- 
lars, as I go on. 

It is indeed the moft rational Foundation of the 
whole Defign before me; 'tis therefore that we 
fhould liflen to the Voice of Providence^ becaufe it is 
principally determin'd, and determines all other 
things for our Advantage. 

But I return to the main Subjed, I'he Voice of 
Providence^ the Language or the Meaning of Pro- 
vidence, 

Nothing is more frequent, than for us to miftake 
Providence, even in its moft vifible Appearances : 
How eafy then mufl it be, to let its filent Adings, 
which perhaps are the mofl pungent and figniiicant, 
pafsour Obfervation. 

I am aware of the Error many fall into, who 
determining the univerfal Currency of Events to 
Providence,and that not the minuted thing occurs 
in the Courfe of Life, but by the particular Defli- 
nation of Heaven, by Confequence entitle Provi- 
dence to the Efficiency of their own Follies j as 
if a Perfdn, prefuming to fmoke his Pipe in a 
Magazin of Gun-Powder, (hould reproach Provi- 
dence with blowing up the Caflle, for which in- 
deed he ought to be hang'd ; or a Man leaving his 

P Houfe 



C 2.^0 3 

Houfe or Shop open ill the Night, fhduld charge 
Providence with appouiting him to be robb'd, and 
the like : Nay, to carry it farther, every Murtherer 
or Thief may allege Providence, that determines 
and direds every thing, direded him to f jch Wic- 
kednefs,,- whereas Providence itfelf, notwithftan- 
ding the Crimes of Men, is adively concerned in 
no Evil. , , 

. But I pafs ail thefe. things; the Subject I am 
treating upon, is of another Nature : The Defign 
here, is to inftrud us in fome particular things re- 
lating to Providence and its Government of 
Men iri the World, which it will be worth our 
While to obferve, without enquiring how far it 
does or does not ad in other Methods. 

.Thjcr-e isy 'tis true, a Difficulty to fhake off .all the. 
wry. Steps, which People take to amufe them- 
felves about Providence,* and for this Reafon, I 
take fo much Pains at firfl to avoid them : Many 
Men ttititle Providence to things, which it is not 
concerned about, ff eating ahftraitediy ; but, "which is 
a much worfe Error, many aifo take no Notice of 
thofe things, which Providence pa;-ticularly, and 
even in a very remarkable Manner, diilinguilhcs it 
feifby its Concern, in* ,.^ pcj..-^ 

If Providence guides the World," and direds the, 
lifues and Events of things, if it commands caufes, 
and forms the Connedion of Circumftances in the 
World, as no Man, that owns the Principles men- 
tioned above, will deny: And above all, if the 
general Scope of Providence, and of the Govern- 
ment of the World by its Influence, be for our 
Advantage ; then it follows neceflarily, that it 
is out Bufincfs, and our Intereft, to liften to its 
yoic,e, 

By Liilning. .to the Voice of Providence, I 
mean, to ftudy its^eaningin every Circumftance 

of 



[211 ] 

of Life, in every Event ; to learn to underfland tfie 
End and Dedga of Providence in every thing that 
happens, what is the Defign of Providence in it, 
refpeding our felves, and what our Duty to do 
upon the particular Occafion that offers. It a Man 
v^'cre in Danger o^ drowning in a fhipwreck'd 
VeiTel, and Providence prefented a Boat coming 
towards him, he would fcarce want to be told, 
that it was his Bufinefs to make Signals of Diflrefs, 
that the People in the faid Boat might not pafs 
by ignorant of his Condkion, and give him no 
AfTiftancej if he did, and omitted it, he would 
have little Caufe to concern Providence in his 
Ruine. 

There is certainly a Rebellion againfl Provi- 
dence, which Heaven itfelf will not always con- 
cern itfelfto over-rule; and he that throws him- 
feif into a River to drown himfelf, he that hangs 
himfelf up to a Beam, he that flioots himfelf into 
the Head with a Piflol, fhall die in Spite of all 
the Notions of Decree, Delliny, Fate, or what 
ever we weakly call Providence; in fuch Cafes, 
Providence will not always concern itfelf to pre- 
vent it ; and yet ^tis no Impeachment of the So- 
vereignty of Heaven, in directing, decreeing, and 
governing all Events in the World. 

Providence decrees, that Events fhall attend up- 
on Caufes in a dired: Chain, and by an evident 
Neceflity, and has doubtlefs left many Powers of 
Good and Evil, feemingly to our fehxs, and, as 
it were, in our Hands, as the natural ProduS: of 
fuch Caufes and Confequcnces, which we are not 
to limit, and cannot exprefsly determine about, 
but which we are accountable for the good or evil 
Application of; otherwife we were in vain ex- 
horted and commanded to do any good thing, or 
to avoid any wicked one : Rew^ards and Punifh- 

P 2 ments 



[lit] 

fttents woiiU be incongruous with fovereign Jiiflice^ 
and Promifes, and Threatnings, be perfecttjy un^ 
meaning ufelefs things, Mankind being no free 
Agent to himfeUj or entriifted with the necefl'ary 
Powers, which thofe Promifes and Threatnings 
imply. 

But all thefe things are out of my prefent En- 
quiry 'i I am for freely and entirely fubmitting aM 
Events to Providence ; but not to be fupinely and 
unconcernedly pafTive, as if there was nothing 
warning, inftrud:ing, or direding in the Premoni- 
tions of Code's Providence ; and which he expe- 
ded we fhould take Notice of, and take Warning 
by. The prudent Man forejeeth the Evil, and 
hideth himfelj : How does he forefee it, fince "'tis 
not in Man to direct himfelf ? There are Intima- 
tions given us, by which a prudent Man may fome- 
times forefee Evil, and hide himfelf; and I mui^ 
take thefe all out of the Devil's Hands, if poiTi- 
ble, and place Providence at the Head of the in- 
vifible World, as well as at the Helm of this 
World ; and tho^ I abhor fuperflitious and fcepti- 
cal Notions of the World of Spirits, of which 
I purpofe to fpeak hereafter, either in this Work, 
or in fome other by itfelf; I fay, tho' I am not at 
all a Sceptick, yet I cannot doubt, but that the 
invifible Hand of Providence, which guides and 
governs this World, does with a fecret Power like- 
wife influence the World, and may, and I believe 
does, dired from thence filent Meflengers on many 
Occafions, whether fleeping orwakmg, whether 
directly or indirectly, whether by Hints, Impul- 
fes, Allegories, Myiterfes, or otherwife, we know 
not; and does think fit to ^\vt us fuch Alarms,fuch 
previous and particular Knowledge of things, 
that if liflen'd to, might* many Ways be ufeful to 

the 



the prudent Man to forefee the Evil, and hid^ 
himfelf. 

The only Objedion, ^nd whiqh I can Tee no 
Method to give a Reafpn for, and no Anfwer to, 
is. Why, il: it be the Work of Providence, thofe 
things fhould be fo imperfed, fo broken, fo irre^ 
gular, that Men may either never be able tp paft 
any right Judgment of them, as is fometimes the 
Cafe, or make a peried Judgment of them, which 
is often the Cafe, and fo the End of the Intima- 
tion be entirely defeated, without any Faulty Ne- 
gled, or OmifTion of the Man. 

This we can no more account for, than we 
can for the Hand-writing upon the Wall at the 
great Feaft of Belfi^azzer, viz>. why it was writ- 
ten in a Charader, which none could underftand; 
^nd which, if the Prophet had not been -found, 
had perhaps never been known, or at leaft, not till 
the King's Fate, whiph was even then irretrieva- 
ble> had been over. 

This, indeed, we cannot account for, and can 
only fay, 'ps our Duty to ftudy thefe things, to liften 
to the Voice of them, and obey their fecret Di' 
dates, as far as Reafon direds, without an over 
fuperilitious Regard to them, any more than a 
total Negleft, leaving the Reafon of Providence's 
ading thus, to be better underftood hereatter. 

But to defcribe a little what I mean by Liflen- 
ing to the Voice of Providence ; it is the Reverfe 
of the fupine Itupid Man, whofe Charader I fliall 
come to by and by. The Man 1 would recom- 
mend, lives firfl in a general Belief, that Provi- 
dence has the fupreme Diredion of all his Affairs, 
even of his iir particular, as well as thofe of the 
World ; that 'tis his Mercy that it is fo, that 'tis 
the Effed of an infinitely wife and gracious DiipQ- 
fu'ion from above, that hefubfillsi and that 'tis 
P 3 not 



[ ^H ] 

not below the Dignity any more tfcan 'tis remote 
from the Power of an infinite, wife, and good 
Being, to take Cognizance of the kail thing con- ^ 
cerning him. 

This in the Confeqnence obliges him to all I I 
fay, for to him who firmly believes, that Provi- 
dence ftoops to concern itfelf for him, and to or- 
der the leaft Article of his Affairs, it neceflarily 
follows, that he fhould concern himfelf in every 
thing that Providence does, "which comes within his 
Reach, that he may know whether he be interelled I 
in it or no. " 

If he negleds this, he negleds himfelf; he a- 
bandons all Concern about himfelf, fince he does 
not know, but that the very next particular K€i of 
Providence, which comes within his Reach to 
diftinguifh, may be interefled in him, and he 
in it. < 

It is not for me to dfdate here to any Man, 
what particular things, relating to him, Providence 
is concerned in, or what not; or how far any In- 
cident of Life is or is not the particular Ad and 
Deed of the Government of Providence : But as 
it is the receiv'd Opinion of every good Man, that 
nothing befalls us without the aftive or paflive 
Concern of Providence in it ; fo it is impoiTible 
this good Man can be unconcern'd in what- 
ever that Providence determines concerning 
him. 

If it be true, as our Saviour himfelf fays, "fhat 
not a Hair falls from our Heads without the Will of 
our heavenly Father^ then not a Hair ought to fall 
from our Heads, w.thout our having our Eyes up 
to our heavenly Father in it. 

I take the Text in its due Latitude^ namely, 
that not the minutefl: Incident of Life, befalls us 
wiihouc the adive Will of our Father direfting it, 

or 



[ 115 ] 

or the paflive Will of our Father fuffering it, fo 
I take the Peduftioii from if in the fame Latitude^ 
that nothing of how he^n ii Nature foev^er can 
befal us, but we ought to have our Eyes up to 
our heavenly Father in it, be refign'd to him in 
the Event, and fubjeded to him in the Means ;^ 
and he that neglects this, lives in Contempt ot 
Providence, and that in the moft provoking Man- 
ner pofTible. 

I am not anfwerable for any Extremes thefe 
Things may lead weak People into ; I know fome 
are apt to entitle the Hand of God, to the com- 
mon and mod ridiculous Trifles in Nature; 
as a religious Creature, I knew, ^feeing a Bot- 
tle of Beer being over ripe burfl out, the Cork fly 
up againft the Ceiling, and the Froth follow it like 
an Engin, cried out, O ! the IVonders of Omnifo- 
tent Power /But I am reprerenting,how a Chriflian 
with an awful Regard to the Government of Provi- 
dence in the World, and particularly in all his own 
Affairs, fubjeds his Mind toacpnflant Obedience 
to the Didates of that Providence, gives an humble 
Preference to it in all his Coticlufions, waits the 
lilues of it wirh a chearful Refignation ; and in a 
Word liftens carefully to the Voice of Providence, 
that he may be always obedient to the heavenly 
Vifioii. 

Whether this divine Emanation has any Con- 
cern in the Notices, Omens, Dreams, Voices, 
Hints, Forebodings, Impulfes, &c. which (eem 
to be a kind of Communication with the invi- 
iible World, and a Converfe between the Spi- 
rits embodied and thofe unembodied, and how- 
far v/ithout Prejudice to the Honour and our Reve- 
rence of Providence, and without Danger of 
Scepticifm, and a kind of radicated Infidi^iityj 
thofe Things may be regarded, is a nice -and di£- 

P 4 ififUk 



[ il<5 ] 

ficult Thing to refolvc, and I fhall treat of it by 
icfelf. 

It has been the Opinion of good Men of all 
Ages, to fay how far they are to be depend- 
ed upon, that fuch Things are not to be to- 
tally disregarded, I am not to take upon me. 
How far they may or may not be concerned in the 
Influence of Providence, lalfodare not fay : But as 
the Verity of Aftronomy is evidenced by the 
Calculation of Eclipfes, fo the Certainty of this 
Communication oi Spirits is eftabliflied by the 
Concurrence of Events with the Notices they 
fometimes give; and if it be true, as I muft be- 
lieve,that the Divine Providence takes Cognifance 
of all Things belonging to us, I dare not exclude 
it from having fome Concern, how much 1 do notfay^ 
in thefe Things alfo : But of this in its Place. 

Whenever Providence difcovers any thing of this 
Jrcanumy I defire to liften' to the Voice of it ; and 
this is one of the Thiiigs I recommend to others : 
Indeed I would be very cautious, how I liflen to 
any other Voices from that Country, than fuch as I 
am fure are conveyed to me from Heaven for my 
better underftanding the whole Myflery. 

If then we are to liften to the Voice of Nature,and 
to the Voices of Creatures,'z//2:.. to the Voice of the 
invifible Agents of the World of Spirits as above, 
much niore are we to liften to the Voice of God..., 

I have already hinted that he that made the 
World, ive are fure guides it, and his Provi- 
dence is equally wonderful as his Power : But no- 
thing in the whole Courfe of his Providence .is 
more worthy our. Regard, efpeqially as it con-? 
cerns us his Creatures, than the filent Voice, if it 
may he allowed 7ne to call it foy of his managing 
Events and Caufes;. he that liftens ro the Provi- 
dence of Gods liftens to the Voic^ Qt God^

as he IS feen in the Wonders of his Government^ 
and as he is feen in the Wonders of his Omni* 
potence. 

If then the Events of Things are his, as well 
as the Caufes, it is certainly well worth our 
Notice, when the Sympathy or Relation between 
Events of Things and their Caufes, moft emi- 
nently appears ; and how can' any Man, who has 
the leaft Inclination to obferve what is remarka- 
ble in the World, ftiuf his Eyes to the vifibic 
Difcovery, which there is in the Events of 
Providence, of a fupreme Hand guiding them ^ 
tor Example, when vifible Punifhments follow vi- 
able Crimes, who can refrain confefling the appa*- 
rent Diredion of fupreme Juftice? When Concur- 
rence of Circumftances directs to the Caufe, 
Men that take no Notice of fuch remarkable 
Pointings of Providence, openly contemn Hea- 
ven, and frequently fland in the Light of their 
own Advantages. 

The Con-currence of Events, is a Light to 
their Caufes, and the Methods of Heaven in 
fome Things, are a happy Guide to us to make a 
Judgment in others ; he that is deaf to thefc 
Things, (huts- his Ears to Liftruftion^ and like 
Solomons Fool, hates Knoiv/edge. 
- The Difpofitions of Heaven to approve or con- 
demn our A&ions, are many of them difcovered 
by Obfervation ; and 'cis eafy to know, when that 
Hand of Providence opens the Door for, or 
fiiuts it againil our- Meafures, if we will bring 
Caufes together^ and compare former Things 
with prefenc, making our Judgment by the ordinary 
Rules of Heaven's dealing with Men. -

Judgment ; and Providence, or ' Juilice, rather 
obeys the Summons and comes at their call : A 
Man calls God to Witnefs to an Untruth, and 
wilhes himfelf f truck dumb, blind, or dead iF it 
is not true j and is ftruck dumb, blind, or dead ; 
is not this a Voice, does not Heaven with the 
Stroke, cry, Cafiigo te, Be it to thee as thou haft 
/aid : He muft be deaf who cannot hear it, and 
worfe than deaf that does not heed it; fuch Exe- 
cutions from Heaven are in Terrorem, as Offenders 
among Men are punifhed as well for Example to 
Others, as to prevent their doing the like again. 

Innumerable Ways the merciful Difpofition of 
Providence takes to difeover to us, what he ex- 
perts we fhould do in diiRcult Cafes, anddoubtlefs 
then> it expeds at the fame Time we fhould take 
Is otice of thofe Directions. 

We are fhort- lighted Creatures at beft, and can 
fee but a little Way before us, I mean as to the E- 
vents of Things i we ought therefore to make ufe 
of all the Lights and Helps we can get ; thefc if 
nicely regarded, would be fome of the moft con- 
liderable to guide us in many difficult Cafes. 

Would we carefully liiiQn to the Concurrence 
of Providence, in the feveral Parts of our Lives, 
we fhould ftand in iefs need of tl>e more dange- 
rous Helps of Vifions, Dreams, and Voices, 
iiom Iefs certain Intelligences. 

A Gentleman of my Acquaintance, being to 
go a Journey into the North, was twice ta- 
ken very ill the Day he had appointed to begin his 
Journey,and fo was oblig'd to put oifVoing , this he 
took for a Direction from Heaven, that he fliould 
not go at all ; and in very few Days after, his V/ife 
was taken (ick and died, which made it abfolutely 
r.ccciVary for him, to be at Home, to look after 

his 



his Affairs, and had he gone away before, muft 
certainly have been obliged to come back again. 

The Romans had certainly the Foundation of 
this Principle, in their prudent Obfervacion of 
Days and Circumftances of Days ; nor is Scrip- 
ture it ielf void of the like, but rather points out 
to the Obfervation, particularly that of the Chil- 
dren of Ifraelj who after 430 Years were expired 
from their coming into Egy^t^ Even in the felf- 
fame Day departed they themcy Exod. 12, 41,42. 
This is the Day, that remarkable Day, feveral 
other Scriptures mention periodical Times, dies 
Infauftusy the Prudent fhail keep Silence in that 
Tinie 5 for it is an evil Tjme. 

V/c find Providence floops to reftrain not the A- 
(Stions of Men only,but even its own Actions to Days 
and Times ; doubtleG for our Obferyation, and in 
fome Things for our Inftruclion ; I do not 
fo much refer to the Revolutions of Things and 
Families on particular Days, which are there- 
fore by fome People called lucky and unlucky 
Days, as I do to.the obferving, how Providence 
caufes the Revolutions of Days, to form a 
Concurrence between the Anions of Men, which 
it does not approve or does approve, and the Re- 
ward of thefe Actions in this World ; by which 
Men may if they think fit to diiiivigmitiy and ob- 
ferve right upon them, fee the Crime or Merit 
of thofe Actions in the divine Refentment, may 
read the Sin in the Punilhment, and may learn 
Conviction from the Revolution of Circumftanccs 
in the Appointment of 'Heaven. 

I have feen feveral Colledions of fuch Things 
made by private Hands, fome relating to Family 
Circumf]:ances5(ome to Public; alfo in the unnatural 
Wars in England^htlw^tn the King and the Parlia- 
.-nentj I have heard manv fuch things have been ob- 

(erv^d :

and Month, that Sir 'John Hotham kept out Hull a* 
gainft ^.mg pharles the ift, and refufed hhn En-

Eminent Deliverances in fudden Dangers are of 
the moil: {igiiiticant kind of Providences, and 
which accordingly have a loud Voice in themj 
calling upon us to be thankful, to that blefl'ed 
Hand, that has been pleafed to fpare and proted 
lis. The Voice of fuch (ignal Deliverances, is 
frequently a jufl Call upon us to Repentance 
and looks diredly that Way ; often tis a Caution 
againtf falling into the like Dangers we were ex- 
pofcd to, from vi^hich nothing but fo much Good- 
nefs could deliv^er us again. In how many Occa- 
gons of Life, if God 5 Providence had no greater 
Shaic v^ our Satety than our own Prudence, 
" ' fliould 



[ Zll ] 



ihould we plunge and precipitate our felves int6 
all manner oi Mifery and Diflrefs ? and how ot- 
ten for want of liftening to thofe Providences do 
we mifcarry ? 

Innumerable Inftances prefent themfelves to us 
every Day, in which the Providence of God fpeaks 
to us, in Things relating to ourfelves ,* in Delive- 
rances to excite our Thankfulnefs, in Views of 
Dangers to awaken our Caution, and to make us 
walk wifely and circumlpedly in every Step we 
take ; thofe that are awake to thefe Things, and 
have their Ears open to the Voice of them, many 
Times reap the Benefit of their Inflrudion by 
being Iproteded, while thofe who neglect them, 
are of the Number of the Simple, who pafs on 
and are puniihed. 

To be utterly carelefs of ourfelves in fuch Cafes, 
and talk of trufting Providence, is a Lethargy of 
the worft Nature ; for as we are to truft Provi- 
dence with our Elbtes, but to ufe at the fame 
Time, all Diligence an our Callings; fo we 
are to truft Providence with our Safety, but 
with our Eyes open to all its necefl'ary Cautions, 
Warnings, and Inflru<5tions i many of which Provi- 
dence is pleafed to give us in the Courfeof Life, for 
the Direction of our Conduft, and which we fliould 
ill place to the Account of Providence, without ac- 
knowledging that they ought to be regarded, and 
a due Reverence paid to them upon all Occafions. 

I take a generaF Negle(5i: of thefe Things, to 
be a kind of pradlical Atheifm, or at leaft a living 
in a kind of Contempt of Heaven, regardlefs of 
all that Share, which his invifible Hand has in the 
Things that befal us. 

Such a Man receives good at the Hand of his 
Maker, but unconcerned at the very Nature or 
Original of it, looks not at all to the Benefador : 

Agaiii, 



Again, he receives Evil, but hasnoSenfe ofit, as 
a judicial difpenfing of Punifliment from Heaven"^ 
but infenfible of one or other, he is neither thank- 
ful for one, nor humble under the other, but Ilupid 
in both, as i^ he was out of God's Care, and God 
himfelf out of his Thoughts ; this is jufl the re- 
verfe of the Temper I am recommending, and let 
the Pidure recommend it felf to any. according to 
its Merit. t : 

When Prince Vdndemont commanded the confe- 
derate Army ia Flanders, the fame Campaign that 
King William was befeigfng Namurey fome Troops 
were ordered to march into the flit Country to- 
wards Newport, in Order to make a Di verlion, 
and draw down the Count de Montal, who com- 
manded a flying Body about Menin, and to keep 
him from joyning the Duke de Villeroy, who com- 
manded the main Body of the French Army. 

The Soldiers were order'd upon Pain of Death 
not to flir from their Camp, or to plunder any of 
the Country People j the Reafon was evident, 
becaufe Provifions being fomewhat fcarce, if the 
Boors were not protedted they would have fled 
from their Houfes, and the Arm.y would have 
been put to great Straits, being juffentredinto the 
Enemies Country. 

It happened that five Enqli^o Soldiers flraggling 
beyond their Bounds were fallen upon, near a 
Farm-Hcufc, by fome of the Country People (for 
indeed the Boors were oftentimes too unmerciful 
to the Soldiers) as if they had plundered them, 
when indeed they had not : The Soldiers de- 
fended themfelves, got the better, and kill'd two 
of the Boors ; and being, as they thought, juftly 
provok'd by being firff attacked, they broke into 
the Houfe, and then ufed them roughly enough 
indeed. 

They 



[ ii3 ] 

Tliey found in theHonfe a great'QLUntity of 
Apples, the People being lied had kit them in 
Poileilion, and they made no Hafte to go away, 
but fell to work with the Apples ; and heating the 
Oven put a great Qiiantity of Apples into the 
Oven to roaft. In the mean Time the Boors, 
who knew their Number to be but five, and had 
got more Help on their Side, came down upon 
them again, attacked the Houfe, forced their Way 
in, mafter'd the Englifimen^ kiU'd two, and took 
a third, and barbaroufiy put him into the Oven, 
which he had heated, where he wasfmother^'d to 
Death ; it feems it was not hot enough to burn 
him. 

The other two efcaped, but in coming back to 
the Camp, they were immediately apprehended 
by the Provofls, and brought to a Court Martial, 
where they were fentenc'd not for Plundering, for 
that did not appear, but for being out of the 
. Bounds appointed by the general Order, as a- 
bove. 

When the Sentence came to be executed, the 
General was prevaird upon to fpa.re one of them, 
and to order them to call: Lots for their Lives« 
This, as ic is knov/n is ufuaily done by throwing 
Dice upon a Drumhead , and he that throws 
higheft or loweft, as is appointed before is to 
diei ar this time he that threw loweft was to 
live. 

When the Fellows were brought out to throw, 
the firR threw two Sixes, and fell immediately 
to wringing his Hands, crying he was a dead 
Man \ but was as much furpriz'd with Joy, when 
his Comrade throwing, there came up two Sixes 
alio. 

The 



The Officer appointed to fee Execution was a 
little doubtful what to do, but his Orders being 
poiirivei he commanded them to throw again ; 
they did fo, and each of them threw two Fives; 
the Soldiers that ftood round fhouted, and faid 
neither of them was to die : The Officer being a 
fober thinking Man, faid it was ftrange, and 
look'd like fomeching from Heaven, and he would 
not proceed without acquainting the Council of 
War, which was then ficting ; they confider'd a 
while, and at laftbrder'd them to take other Dice 
and to throw again, which was done, and both 
the Soldiers threw two Fours. 

The Officer goes back to the Courxil of War* 
who were furpriz'd very much, and looking on it 
as the Voice of Heaven, refpited the Execution 
till the General was acquainted with it. 

The General fends for the Men and examines 
them ftridly, who telling him the whole Story, he 
pardon'd them with this ExpreiTion to thofe about 
him, I love, fays he, in fuch extraordinary Cafes to 
liften to the Voice of Providence. 

While we are in this un-inform'd State, where 
we know fo little of the invifible World, it would 
be greatly our Advantage, if we knew rightly, 
and without the Bondage of Enthufiafm and Su- 
perfcition, how to make ufe of the Hints given 
us from above, for our Diredion in Matters of 
the greateft Importance. 

It has pleafed God very much to ftreighten the 
fpecial and particular Diredions, which he gives 
to Men immediately from himfelf ; but I dare not 
fay, they are quite ceafed j we read of many Ex- 
amples in Scripture, how God fpake to Men by 
Voice immediately from Heaven, by Appearance 
of Angels, or by Dreams and Vi(ions of the 
Night, and by ali thefe not in Public and more 

extra- 



C 2.25 ] 



extraordinary Cafes only, but in private, perfonali 
and family Concerns. 

Thus God is faid to have appeared to Abraham^ 
to Loty and to Jaah j Angels alfo have appeared 
in many other Cafes, and to many feveral Perfons, 
as to Manoahy and his Wife, to Zachanah^ to the 
Virgin Maryy and to the Apoflks ; others have 
been warned in a Dream, as King Ahimelech, the 
falfe Prophet Balaam^ Pontius Pilate s Wife, Herody 
Jofephy thQ Ap(. files Mo i and many others. 

VVe cannot (ay, but thefe and all ihe miracu- 
lous Voices, the prophetic Meflages prefaced 
boldly by the Anc ents, with thus faith the Lord 
are ceas'd, and as we have a more Jure M/ord of 
Prophefy handed to us by the Million of Gofpel 
Miniilers i to whic'i the Scripture fays, IVe 
do well that we take heed', and to whom our 
bleffed Lord has faid, Lo, I am with )qu to the End 
of the World : I fay, as we have this Gofpel backM 
with the Spirit and Prefenee of God, we are no 
Lofers, if we obferve the Rule laid down, 'viz., 
that ibe he obedient to the heavenly Vifion , for 
fueh it \Sy as well as that of the Apoflle Peter's 
Dream of the Sheet let down from Heaven. 

1 mention this to pay a di.e Reverence to the 
Sufficiency of Gofpel Revelation, and to thg 
guiding of the Spirit of God, who in fpiritual 
Things is given to lead us into all "tnithy nor 
would I have any Thing, which I am going to 
fay, tend to lefien thefe great Efficients of cur 
eternal Salvation. 

But I am chiefly upon our Condud in the infe- 
rior Life, as I may call it ; and in this, I think, 
the Voice of God, even his immediate Voicefrcm 
Heaven, \s not entirely ceafcd from us, though it 
may have changed the Mediums of Communica- 
tion. 



[ 116 ] 

1 have heard the Divines teil us by Way of Di- 
ftindion, that there is a Voice of God in his 
Word, and a Voice of God in his Work i the 
latter I take to be a fubject very awful and very 
inftruaing. 

This Voice of God in his Works, is either 
heard in his Works which are already wrought, 
fuch as of Creation, hvhich fill us with Wonder 
and Afloniihment, Admiration and Adoration ; 
When I view the Heavensy the ppork of thy Hands^ 
the Moon and the Stars -which thon haft made, then I 
Jay, What is Man^ &c. Or 2. His Works of Go- 
vernment and Providence, in which the infinite 
Variety affords a pleadng and infiruding Contem- 
plation ; and it is without Queftion^ our Wlfdom 
and Advantage to fludy and know them, and to 
liften to the Voice of God in them : For this 
liflening to the Voice of Providence, is a Thing 
fo hard to dired, and fo little underflood, that I 
find the very Thought of it is treated with Con- 
tempt, even by many pious and good People^ 
as leading to SuperRition, to Enthuiiafm, and 
vain Fancies, tainted with Melancholly, and 
amufing the Mind with the Vapours of the 
Head. 

It is true, an ill Ufe may be made of thefe 
Things, and to tye People too flridly down to a 
Rule, where their own Obfervation is to be the 
Judge, endangers the running into many foolilli 
Extreams, entitling a diftemper'd Brain, too much 
to the Expoiitionofthe fublimeftThings; and tack- 
ing the awful Name of Providence to every fancy 
of their own. 

From Hence I think, too mnch proceeds the 
extraordinary (Note, I fay. Extraordinary) Ho- 
mage paid to Omens, flying of hi^ds. Voices^ 
Noifes, Prediftions, and a thoufand fooliili 
■ t Things 



[ 1-i-l ] 

Things, ill which I fliall endeavour to fiate xht 
Cafe Vairly between the Devil and Mankind : But 
at prefent I need fay no more here, than that they 
have nothing to do with the Subject I am now 
upon, or the Subje6i: I am upon with them. 

But as my Defign \s lerious, and I hope pious, 
I fhall keep ilridiy to the Expofition I give of 
my own Meaning, and meddle v/ith no other. 

By the Voice of Providence therefore, I fiiall 
confine myfelf to the particular Circumftances in- 
cident and accident which every Man's Life is full 
of, and which are in a more extraordinary man- 
ner, faid to be peculiar to.himfelf or to his 
Family. 

By liftening to them3 Imean^ making fuch due 
Application of them to his own Circumftances^ 
as becomes a Chriftian, for Caution iw his Con- 
duit, and all manner of Inilrudion, receiving all 
the Hints as from Heaven, returning ail the 
Praife to, making a'i the Improvenr^ent fori and ^^"^ 
verencing the Sovereignty of h\^ Marker \\\ every 
Thing, not difputing or reproaching the Juilice 
of Providence,- and ^hich. i^ the main Thing I 
aim at, taking fuch Notice of the fcveral Provi- 
dences', that happen in the Courfe of our LiveSj 
as by one Circumftance to learn how to behave in 
another. 

For Example, fuppofing from my own Story j' 
^ When a young Fellow broke from his Friends, 
trampled upon all the wife K^sfic^s^ and moll af- 
fectionate Perfwafions of his Father, and even the 
Tears and Entreaties of a tender Mother, and 
would go away to Sea j but i% check'd in his firfl 
Excurfions by being Shipwreck'd, and in the ut- 
moft Diftrefs fav'd by the Affiflance of another 
Ship's Boat, feeing the Ship he was in, foon aftetr 
iink to the Bottom ,* ought not fuch a young Man 

li 2 t^ 



[ ii8 ] 

to have liflened to the Voice of this Providence, 
and have taken it for a Summons to h'm ; that 
when he was on Shore, he (hould ftay on Shore, 
and go back to the Arms of his Friends, hearken 
to their Council, and not precipitate himfelf into 
farther Mifchiefs ; what Happinefs might fuch a 
prudent Step have procured, what Miferies and 
Mifchiefs would it have prevented in the reft of 
his untorcunate Life* 

Ah Acquaintance of mine, who had feveral fuch 
Circumftances befel him, as thofe which I am in- 
ch'n'd to call Warnings, but entirely negleded 
them, and laugh'd at thofe that did otherwife, 
fufrered deeply for his disregard of Omens; he 
took Lodgings in a Village near the City of Lon- 
don^ and in a Houfe, where either he fought fbad 
Company, or at beft could meet with little that 
was good. Providence that feemed to animadvert 
upon his ConduS:, fo ordered it that fomething 
or other mifchievous always happened to him 
there, or as he went thither ; feveral Times he 
was robbed on the Highway going thither, once 
or tv/ice taken very ill, at other Times his Affairs 
in the World went iii, while he diverted himfelf 
there; feveral of his Friends cautionM him of it 
and told him, he ought to confider that fome fu- 
perior Hand feemed to hint to him, chat he 
(hould come there no more ; he flighted the Hint, 
or at leaft negleded it after fome Time, and went 
to the fame Place again : But was fo terrified 
with a moft dreadful Tempeft of Thunder and 
Lightnir.g, which fell as it were more particular- 
ly upon that Part of the Country than upon 
others ; that he took it as a Warning from Heaven, 
and refolv'd not to go there again, and fome 
Time after a Fire deflroyed that Houfe, very few 
efcaping that were in it. 



[ "9 ] 

Ic would be an ill Account we fliould gjve of 
tiie Government of divine Providence in the 
World, ii^ we fliould argue, chat its Events are fo 
unavoidable, and every Circumiknce fo determin- 
ed, that nothing can be altered; and that therefore 
thefe Warnings of Providence are inconfiftent with 
the Nature of it. This befides that I think it 
would take from the Sovereignty of Providence, 
and deny even God himfelf the Privilege of being 
a free Agent, it would alfo fo contradid the Ex- 
perience of every Man living, in the Varieties of 
his refpedive Life, that he fhould be unable to 
give any Account for what End many Things, 
which Providence direds in the World, are di- 
reded, and why fo many Things happen which 
do happen ; why are Evils attending us fo evi- 
dently foretold, that by thofe Fore- tellings they are 
avoided, if it was not determined before that they 
fliould be avoided, and fhould not befal us ? 

People that tye up all to Events and Caufes, 
ftrip the Providence of God which guides the 
World of all its Superin tendency, and leave it 
no room to ai5t as a wife Difpofer of Things. 

It feems to me that the immutable Wifdom and 
Power of the Creator, and the Notion of ic in 
the Minds of Men, iszs dutifully preferved, and is 
as legible to our Underflanding, though there be 
a Hand left at Liberty to dired the Courfe of na- 
tural Caufes and Events ; 'Tis futEcient to the 
Honour of an immutable Deity, that for the 
common Incidents of Life, they be left to the 
Difpofition of a daily Agitator, namely, divine 
providence, to order and dired them as it ihall fee 
good, within ^he natural Limits of Caufe and 
Confequence. 

Q 3 Thh 



[ /^3Q 1 

This Teems to me a much more rational Syftema 
than that of tying up the Hands of the fupreme 
Power to a Road of Things, fothat none can be 
aded or permitted, but fuch as was fo appointed 
before to be acted and permitted. 

But what, if after all, we were to fit down and 
acknowledge, that the immutability of God's 
Being, and the Unchangeablenefs of his Adings^ 
are not eafy to be comprehended by us, or that 
we may fay we are not able to reconcile them 
with the infinite Variation of his Providence, 
•which in'all its Adings feems to us to be at full 
Liberty to determine anew, and give Events a 
turn this V/ay or that Way, as its Sovereignty 
and Wifdom, fliall dired 5 does it follow, that 
thefe Things are not reconcileable, becaufe we 
cannot reconcile them ? why lliould we not as well 
fay, nothing of God is to be underilood, becaufe 
we cannot underfland it? or that nothing'in Nature 
is intelligible, but what we can underfland? 

Who can underftand the Reafon, and much lefs 
the Manner of the Needle rending to' the Pole, 
by being touch'd with the Loaditone, and by 
what Operation the magnetic Vertue is convey- 
ed vvith a Touch? why that Vertue is not com- 
municable to other Metals, fuch as Gold, Silver, 
or Copper, but to iron only? what Sympathetig 
Influence is there between the Stone and the 
Stat:, or the Pole ? v/hy tending to that Point in 
the whole Arch, and not to any other, and why 
face about to tHe South Pole as foon as ic has 
pail the Equinox ? yet we fee all thefe Things 
in their Operations ^nd Events, we know 
they muff be reconcileable in Nature^ though we 
cannot iccoiicil^ them , and intelligible in Nature, 
though We cannot underfland them : Sure it is 
as highly reafonable then for us to believe, that 

the 



[ ^31 ] 

tlie various Adings of Providence, which to us 
appear changeable; one Decree, as it were, re- 
vering another, and one Action fuperfeding a- 
nether, maybe as reconcilable to the Immutabi- 
lity oi God, and to the Unchangeablenefs of his 
Purpofes, tho' we cannot underfland, how it is 
brought to pafs, as it is to believe, that there is 
a Reafon to be given for the Agreement and fim- 
pathetick Correfpondence between the Magnet and 
the Poky tho at prefent the Manner of it is not 
difcover'd, and cannot be underdood. 

If then the Hand of divine Providence has a 
fpontaneous Power of acling, and di reded by its 
own Sovereignty, proceeds by fuch Methods, as 
it thinks fit, and as we fee d2ii\Y ii^ the Courfe 
ot human things : Our Bufinefs is to converfe 
with the ading Part of Providence, with which 
we more immediately have to do, and not con- 
found our Judgment with things which we cannot 
fully comprehend, fuch as the Why, to what 
End, and the how in what Manner, it ads fo 
and fo. 

As we are then converfant with the immediate 
Adions of divine Providence, it is our Buiinefs to 
ftudy it as much as may be in thar Part of its 
A dings, wherein it Is to be known ; and this in- 
cludes the (ilent Adings of Providence, as well as 
thofe which are more loud, and which being de- 
clar*d, fpeak in publick. 

There are feveral filent Steps, which Providence 
takes in the World, which fummon our Attention ; 
and he that will not liften to them, fhall deprive 
himfelf of much of the Caution and Council, as 
well as Comfort, which he might otherwife have 
in his Paflage thro' this Life, particularly by thus 
lifleningto the Voice, as I callit, of Providence, 
we have the Comfort of- feeing, that really an 



[ ^3^ ] 

invl/^bk and powerful Hand is employ 'd in, and 
concern^ for our Prefervation and Profperity in 
the World ; A nd who can look upon the manifeftDe-' 
liverances which he meets within the infinite Vari- 
ety of Life, without being convinced that they are 
wrought tor him without his own AffiHance, by 
the wife and merciful Difpofirions of an invxfible 
and friendly Power. 

The bringing good Events to pafs by the mofl; 
threatning Caufes, as it teflifies a Power that has 
the Government of Caufes and EfFedts in its Hand, 
fo ic gives a very convincing Evidence of that 
povN^er, being in good Terms with us ; as on the 
contrary, when the like Providence declares againil: 
lis, we ought to make a fuirable Ufe of it another 
Way, that is to fay, take thejuft Alarm, and ap-? 
piy to the necedary Duties of Humiliation and 
Repentance. 

Theie things may be jefted with by the Men of 
Fafnion ; but 1 am fuppofing myfelf talking to 
Men that have a Senfe or a future State, and of 
the Oeconcmy of an inv;iib!e World upon them, 
iind reither to Atheifls, Scepticks, or Perfons in- 
different, who are indeed rear of Kin to them 
both. 

As there are jufl Refledions to be made upon 
the various Condud of Providence in the feveral 
PailagGs of Man's Life, fo there are infinite Cir- 
cumftcjiCes, in which u^e may furnifh our felves 
wiih Diredions in the Courfe of Life, and in the 
moft fudden Incidents, as well to obtain Gjod, 
as avoid Evil. 

Much of the Honour due to the Goodnefs of 
Providence, is i.njuflly taken away from it, by 
Men that give them ft Ives a Loofe in a general 
1>Ieg'ccr cf thefe things: But that which is flill 
?npr^ abfurd to m? is, tliat fomc Men ate obfli- 

pat^ly 



[ 153 1 

nately refolv'd againft paying the Homage of their 
Deliverances to their Maker, or paying the Re- 
verence due to his Terrors, in any thing that be- 
falls them ill, where it ought to be paid, that 
they will give all that Honour to another. If it 
was well, they tell you, they know not how, but 
' fo it happened, or it was fo by good Chance, 
and the like. This is a Sort of Language I can- 
not underiland : It feems to be a felonious 
Thought in its very Defign, robbing Heaven of 
the Honour due to it, and lifting our felves in 
the Regiment of the Ungrateful. 

But this is not all, for one Crime leads on to a- 
ther^ if this Part is Felony or Robbery, the 
next is Treafon, for refolving firft to deny the 
Homage of good or evil Events to God from 
whole Hands they come, they go on and pay 
it to the Devil, the Enemy of his Praife, and 
Rival of his Power. 

Two of theie Wretches traveled a little Journey / 
with me fbme Years ago ; and in their Return, j 
fome Time after I was gone froni them, they met ' 
with a very different Adventure, and telling me 
the Story, they exprefs'd themfelvcs thus, T^hey 
vjere riding from Huntington towards London, and 
in fome Lanes betwixt Huntington and Caxton, one 
happen d by a Slip of his Horfe^s Foot, ivhich lam'd him 
a little, to flay about half a Mile behind the other, was 
fet upon by fome Highway-men, who rohFd him, and 
abus'd him very much ; the other went on to Caxton, 
not taking Care of his Companion, thinking he hadflafd 
pn fome particular Occa/ion, and efcap'd the 'Thieves^ 
they making off cY of s the Country towards Cambridge. 

Well, fays I ro the firft, How came you to 
efcape? I dont know not I, fays he, I happen d not 
to look behind me, when his Horfe ftumblM, and 
I went fprwardj and by ^ood Luck, adds he again, 

I heard 



[ 2-34 ] 

I heard nothing of the Matter; here was, it hap- 
fen dy,2iv\(i by good Luck, hill not the Jeaft Senfe of 
the Government of Providence in this Affair, or 
its Difpofition for his Good, but an empty Idol 
of Air, or rather an imaginary nonfeniical Nothing, 
an Image more inconiiftent than thofe I mencion'd 
among the Chinefes ', not a Monfter indeed of a 
ftightful Shape, and ugly Figure, loathfome and 
frightful, but a meer Pijantafm, an Idea^ a None- 
Eiuity, a Name without being a mifcalfd, unborn, 
iiolhingjhap, luck, Chance, that is to fay, a Name 
put upon the Mediumy which they fet up in their 
Imagination, for Want of a Will to acknowledge 
their Maker, and recognize the Goodnefs which 

. had particularly preferv'd him. 

This was the moft ungrateful Piece of Fol- 
ly, or to fpeak more properly, the maddeft and foo- 
iiibert Piece of Ingratitude that ever I met 
with. 

Well, if this was foolifh and prepoflerous, the 
other was as Vv^cked and deteftable : For when 
thehrft had told his Tale, I turn'd to the other, 
and ask'd him, What was the Matter? Why!' 
Hozv came this to pafs ? fa id I, ivhy this Difafter has 
fallen dJl ufon )cu?- Hovj vjas it^ Nay^ fays he, I 
don'c know, 1 was a little behind, and my Horfe 
cbancd to flip, and lame himfeif, and he went for- 
wa,rd, andleftme; and as the Devil would have

' , Here was firfc C/Wf^, the fame Mock-Goddefs, 
as before, lam'd his Korfe, and next, the Devil 
crder'd the Highway-men to chop upon him that 
Moment. Now, tho'itmay true, that the High- 
way-men were even by their Employment domg 
the Devils Office of going to and fro, feeking 
v/hom they might plunder; yet 'cwas a higher 

Hand 



[^35 ]^ 

Hand than Satan's, that dclivQv'd this poor blind 
Fellow into their Power. 

We have a plain Guide for this in Scripture 
Language, in the Law of Man-flaughter, or 
Death, as we call it foolijhly enough y by Mifadven- 
ture it is in the 21 Exod. 13. in the Cafe of cafual 
killing a Man, it is exprefs'd thus, If a Man lye 
not in Waity hut God deliz'sr him into his Hand. This 
was not to be accounted Murther, but the Slayer 
was to fly to the City of Refuge. 
. Here it is evident, that God takes all thefe 
Mifadventures into his own Hand; and a Man 
kill'd by Accident, is a Man whom God has de- 
livered up, for what End in his Providence is known 
only to himfeif, to be kill'd in that Manner,' per- 
haps vindidively, perhaps not. 

With what Face can fany Man fay, this was as 
the Devil would have it, or as bad Luck would have 
ity or it happen dy or chanced, or fell out ; all which 
are our iimple and empty V/ays of talking of things 
that are order'd by the immediate Hand or Dire- 
ftion of God's Providence. 

The Words laft quoted from the Scripture of 
God's delivering a Man into another Mans Hand to 
be killed unwillingly , are fully explained in another 
Place, Deut. xix. 5. 

As when a Man goeth into the Wood with his Neigh^ 
hour, to hew Wood^ and his Hand fetches a Stroke 
with the Ax to cut down, the Tree, and the Head fltp^ 
pethfrom the Helve, and lighteth upon his Neighbour ^ 
that he die-, he flo all fee unto one of thcfe Cities, and 
live. 

The wicked thoughtlefs Creature, I have jufl 
mentioned, whofe Horfe fell lame, and flopt his 
Travelling, till he might come jufl in the Way of 
thofe Thieves, who ic f;;^ems were croffing the 
Cquiury, perhaps upon fome other Exploit, ought 

to 



tp have refleded, that Providence, to chafiiTe 
him, and bring him to a Senfe of his Dependance 
upon, and being fubjefted to his Power, had di- 
reded him to be feparated from his Companion, 
that he might fall into the Hands that robb'd and 
abused him j and the other had no lefs Obliga- 
tion to give Thanks for his Deliverance : But how 
contrary they aded in both Cafes, you have 
beard, 

We have had abundance of Collefiions, in my 
Remembrance, of remarkable Providences, as they 
^re call'd ; and many People are forward to call 
them fo : But this does not come up to the Cafe 
in Hand. 

Tho' contemning Providence, and giving the 
Homage due to it, as above, to the Devil, or to 
Chance, Fate, and I know not what Embrio's of 
the Fancy are impious ; yet every one that avoids 
this Eyil, does not come up to the particular Point 
I am fpeaking of; for there is a manifefl Diffe- 
tence between acknowledging the Being and Ope- 
rations of Providence, and lifinhig to its Voicey as 
many People acknowledge a God, that obey none 
of his Commands, and concern themfelves in no" 
thing of their Duty to hipi. 

To liRen to the Voice of Providence, is to take 
firid Notice of all the remarkable Steps of Provi- 
dence, which relate to us in particular, to obferve, 
if there is nothing in them inflruding to our Con- 
dud ^ no Warning to us for avoiding fome Dan- 
ger i no Dirediou for the taking fome particular 
Steps for our Safety or Advantage ; no Hint to re- 
mind us of fuch and fuch things omitted; no Con- 
viction of fomething mnmitted ; no vindiftivQ 
Step, by V/ay of Retaliation, marking out the 
Crime in the Punifliment ; You may eaiiiy ob- 
ferve the Dift-erences between the Dirc(5ticns and

[ 2-37 ] 

Watnings of [Providence, when duly liflned to, 
and the Notices of Spirits from an invifible 
World, viz,, that thefe are dark Hints of Evil,with 
very little Direction to avoid it : But thofe Noti- 
ce^, which are to be taken fron'i the Proceedings 
of Providence, tho' the Voice be a Kind of filent 
orfoft VVhifper; yet *tis generally attended with 
an Ofter of the Means for efcaping the Evil, nay, 
very often leads by the Hand to the very proper 
Steps to betaken; and even obliges us, byaflrong 
Convidion of the Reafon of it^ to take thofe 
Steps. 

It is in vain for me to run into a Colledion of 
Stories ; for Example, where the Variety is infinite, 
and things vary as every particular Man's Circum- 
ftances vary : But as every Event in the World is 
Hianag'd by the Superintendencyof Providence; fa 
every Providence has in it fome thing inilrudringj, 
(ome thing that calls upon us tolookup, or look 
out, or look in. 

Every one of thofe Heads are big with particu- 
lar Explanations; but my Bufinefs is not Preach- 
ing; I am making Obfervations and ReHedfonSj 
let thofe makeEnlargements who read it: InaWord^, 
there is fcarce any particular Providence attends 
our Lives, but we fhail find, i^ we gi\jQ due 
Weight to it, that it calls upon us, either. 

I. To look tip, and acknowledge the Goodnefe 
of Godinfparingus, the Bounty of God ia 
providing for us, the Power of God in deli'' 
vering and proteding us, not forgetting to 
look up, and acknowledge, and be humble 
under the Juflice of God, in being angry, 
with, and aiilic^ing us.

Of the Proportion hetzveen the Chri- 
jtian arid Pa^an World. 



Have faid fomethiiig of this al^ 
ready in my Enquiry after the 
State of Religion in the World i 
but upon fonie E.efle6£ions which 
fell in my Way fince, I think it 
may offer further Thoughts, very 
improving, as well as diverting. 
When we view the World geographicallyj 
take the Plan of the Globe, and meafure it by 
Line, ' and cut it out into Latitude and Longitude^ 
Degrees, Leagues, and Miles ,• we may fee indeed 
that a pretty large Spot of the whole, is at pre- 
fent und^r the Government of Chriftian Powers 
and Princes, or under the LvRuence of their Pov/er 
and Commerce, by Arms, Navies, Colonies, and 
Plantations ; or their Fadories, MiffionarieSjReli- 
dences, &c. 

But I am loth to fay we fhoiiid take this for a 
Fulfilling the Promife made to the Meffiah, that 
his Kingdom fnould be exalted above all Nations^ 
and the Gofpel be heard to the Bind of the Earthy 
I was going to fay, and yet without any Propbane-- 
fiefs 'y that we hope God will not ^^/f m off SO« 
I muft acknowledge, I exped in the Fulfilling of 
thefe Promifesi that the Time willcome^ when tht 

Kno'w^

Knowledge of Godfiall cover the Earthy as the Waters 
cover the Sea, that the Church of God (hall be fee 
open to the four Winds, that the Mountain of the 
Lords Hotife fhall he exalted above the T'ops of the 
Mountains^ and all the ¥<ativns Jhall fiow into it^ Ifa* 
ii. 2. that is to fay, that the Chriftian Religion, 
or the Profeflion of the Dodrine of the Messiah, 
Ihali be made national over the whole Globe, ac- 
cording to thofe Words, Matth. xxiv. 14. MaYkxliu 
13, Luke xxiv. 17. But this 'may be a little too 
apocalyptical, or vifionary for the Times -, and 'tis 
no Bufinefs of mine, to enter upon the Interpre- 
tation of Scripture Difficulties, whatever I may 
underfland, or believe my felf about them ; but 
rather to make my Obfervations, as I have be- 
gun, upon things which now are, and which we 
have (een and know, let what is to come, be as he 
pleafes, who has ordered things paft, and knows 
what is to follow. 

The prefent Cafe is, to fpeak of the mathema- 
tical Proportion that there is now to be obferved 
upon the Plain of the G:obe, and obferve how 
fmall a Part of the World it is, where the Chri- 
ftian Religion has really prevailed, and is natio- 
nally profefs'd, 1 fpeak of the Chriftian. Religion, 
where it is, as I call it. National, that is, in its 
utmoft Latitude ; and I do fo, that I may give 
the utmofl Advantage, even againll my feif, in 
what I am going to fay ^ and therefore, when I 
come to make Dedudions for the Mixtures of bar- 
barous Nations, I fhall do it fairly alfo. 

1 have nothing to do with the Diflindions of 
Chriflians : I hope none will objed againll calling 
the Roman Church, a Chriftian Church, in this 
Refped, and the ProfefTors of the Popifh Church, 
Chriflians ; neither do 1 fcruple to call the Greek 
Church Chriflian^ tho' in iome Places fo blended 

-with 



fH'i 



xvith Superflltion, and barbarous Cuftoms, as m 
Georgia, Armenia, and the Borders of Perfia and 
7artary ; likewlfe in many Parts of the Cz^ar 
of Mufcovfs Dominions, that (as before) the Name 
of Chrift is little more than juft fpoken of, and 
literally known, without any material Knowledge 
of his Perfon, Nature, and Dignicy ; or of the 
Homage due to him as the Redeemer of the 
World. 

The Nations of the World then, where Chrift 
is acknowledged, and the Chriflian Religion is 
profefs'd nationally, be it Romijh Church or Greek 
Church, or even the Proteftant Church , in- 
cluding all the feveral Subdiviiions and Denomi- 
nations of Proreftants, take them all as Chriflians, 
I fay, thefe Nations are as follow. 

1 . In Europe ; Germany, France, Spain ^ Italy, Great 
Britain, Denmark, Sivedm, Mufcovy^ Poland, Htm- 
gary, Tranfllvania, Moldavia^ and Walachia, 

2. In Afia, Georgia, 2Lnd Armenia. 

3 . In Africa : No Place at all, the few JFadories o£ 
European Merchants, only excepted.

3. The British, on the Coafl of America, from, 

the Gulph of Florida to Cape Britoon on the 

Mouth of the Gulph o't Si. Lawrence, or the 

great River o^ Canada, alfo a little in New 

foundlandy and Hudfons Bay.

The chief Seat of the Chriflian Reh'gion is at 
prefent in Europe \ But if we meafure the Qiiartec 
of the World, we call Europe upon the Plan of the 
Globe^and caft up the northern, frozen, and indeed 
unhabitable Part ofit, fiich Laponia^ Petz>ora, Can-

Deiarts, bordering upon-^^, on the Way to Chi- 
nay and the vaft Extent of Land on that Side, 
which tho' nominally under the Dominion of 
Mufcovy, is yet all Pagan, even nationally fo, un- 
under no real Government, but of their own Pa- 
gan Gudoms. 

If we go from thence to the South y and takeout 
of ir the European Tartars, 'viz,, oi Circaffia,

minions ; I fay, take this Extent of Land out of 
Europe, and the Remainder does not meafure full 
two Thirds of Land in Europe, under the Chrifli- 
an Government, much of which is alfo Defart, 
and uninhabited, or at leaft, by fuch as cannot be 
caird Chriflians, and do not concern themfelves 
about it, as particular! y^ the Swedijh and Norwe- 
^^^^« Lapland, the moreeaflern andfouthern Muf- 
C6^7, beyond the IVolga, even to Karakathay, and to 
the Borders oi Afia on the Side of /Wmi I fay, 
taking in this Part, not above one half of Europe 
is really inhabited by Chriflians. 

The 



[ H3 ] 

The Cz^ar of Mufcovy, ot the Reifgiorij of where 
Subjects I have faid enough, is Lord of a vail: ex- 
tended Country -, and thofe who have meafur'd 
it critically, fay, his Dominions are larger than all 
the reft of Eimpe , that is to fay, that he poflefles 
a full Half as much as Europe-^ and in thofe Domi- 
nions, he is Mafter of Abundance of Nations, that 
are Pagan or Mahometan, as in particular Circaf- 
fiiy-, being conquered by him, the Circaffian 'tartars^ 
who are all Mahometans, or the moft of them^ are 
his Subjeds. 

However, fince a Chriftian Monarch governs 
them, we muft upon the Plan I laid down, call 
this a Chriftian Country ; and that alone obliges 
me to ^v^Q two Thirds of Europe to the Chri- 
ftians. 

But this will bring another Account upon my 
Hands to ballance it, i;/x,. That excepting this 
two Thirds, there will not come one Chriftian to 
be accounted for in any of the other three Parts of 
the World, except Georgia and Armenia ; as foe 
Africa, there is nothing to be mention^'d on thaC 
Side : All the Chriftians that are on the Conti- 
nent o^Africk, confifting only of a few Merchants 
refiding at the Coaft Towns in the Mediterranean^ 
as at Alexandria^ Gra?zd Cairo, Tunis, Tlipoli, AI-* 
gier. Sec. The Factories of the Englijh and Dutch^ 
on the Coaft oi Guinea, the Gold Coaft, the Coafk 
oi Angola, and atthQCapeof Good Hope; all which 
put together, as I have calculated them, and as 
they are calculated by a better Judgment than mine^ 
will not amount to 5000 People, excepting Chri- 
ftian Slaves in Sallee, Algier, Tunis, Tripoli, &c, 
which are not fo many more. * 

Arderica is throng'd with Chriftians, God wot,' 

fuch as they are; for I muft confefs, the Euro^ 

pean Inhabitants of fome of the Colonies there, 

R ^% as 



[ ^44 1 



^s well French and EngHjhy as Sfanijh and Dutch^ 
very ill merit that Name. 

Some Part o^ America is entirely under the Do- 
minion and Government of the European Nations ; 
and having indeed dellroy'd the Natives, and 
made defolate the Country, they may be faid to 
be Chriftian Countries in the Senfe, as above. 

But what Numbers do thefe amount to, com- 
pared to the Inhabitants of fo great a Part of the 
World, as that of Americay which at leaft is three 
Times as big as Europe, and in which are ftill 
vaft extended Countries, infinite Numbers ofPeo- 
I ^ pie of Nations unknown, and even unheard of ; 
1 1 1 which neither the Englijh, French, Spanijh^ or For- 
husuejehzMC ever feen j Witnefs the populous Ci- 
ties and innumerable Nations, which Sir Walter 
\ Raleigh met with in his Voyage up the great 
\ River Oroonoque j in one of which they talk of two 
Millions of People, Witnefs the Nations infinite- 
ly populous, fpread on both Sides the River de 
Amoz^mesy and all the Country between thefe two 
prodigious Rivers, being a Country above 400 
Miles in Breadth, and 1600 Miles in Length, 
beiides its Extent South even to the Rio Para- 
gjiay, and S. E. to the Brajilsy a, rich, fruitful, and 
populous Country ; and in which, by the Ac- 
counts given, there mufl be more People inhabit- 
ing at this Time, than in all the Chriftan Part of 
Europe put together, being the Chief, if not the on- 
ly Part of America, into which the Spaniards ne- 
. ver came^ and whether the frighted People fled 
' from them, being fo fortify 'd with Rivers and un- 
paflible Bays and rapid Currents, and fo inac- 
celTible by the Number of Inhabitants, the Heat 
of the Climate, and the Mountains, Waterfals, 
and fuch other Obflrudions, that the Spaniards 
durfl never attempt to penetrate the Way. 

What 



[ i45 ] 

What are the Numbers of Chn'flians in Ante- 
ricUy put them altogether to the Inhabitants of 
thefe Parts of Amerkay befides the Northern 
Parts of America not enquir'd into. 

But we are not calculating of People yet, but 
the Extent of Land, that the Chrillians poiTefs, 
the Britifi Colonies in the Norths are by far the 
moft populous even more than the Spaniards them~ 
felves, though the latter extend themfelves over 
more Land. 

The Britifi Colonies m the North of America 
arefuppofed to contain Three Hundred Thoufand 
Souls, including Nova Scotia^ New England y New 
Torky New Jerfey, Eaji and Td^efl Penfthania, Ma- 
ryland, Virginia, and Carolina, and thefe lye ex- 
tended upon the Coaft from the Latitude of 5 2 
Degrees, to 47, or thereabouts, being about 750 
Miles in Length -, but then much of this is very 
thinly peopled, and the Breadth they lye Weji 
into the Country is little or norhing, 50 Miles 
or 60 Miles i^ iw many Places the molt ; and ex- 
cept fome Plantations in Virginia in Rapahanock, 
and Janes River in Virginia, occa/ioned by the 
great In-let of the Bay there, and of the Rivers 
that fall into it. We can fee nothing an hundred 
Miles within that Land but wafte and Woods, 
whofe Inhabitants feem to be fled farther up in- 
to the Country from the Face of their Enemies 
the Chriftians. 

So that all this planting though fo confiderable, 
amounts to no more compared to the Country it- 
felf, than a long narrow Slip of Land upon the 
Sea-Coaft, there being very few Englifh Inhabi- 
tants planted any where above twenty Miles 
from the Sea, or from fome navigable River, and 
even that Sea-Coaft itfelf very thinly inhabited, 
^nd particularly from New- England to Nij.*Torky 

R 3 froxa 



from N'evj' England North to Annapolis, from Vir- 
ginia to Carolina ; fo that all this great Colony or 
Coiledion or Colonies, nay, tho' we include the 
French at Canada^ are but a Point, a Handful, com- 
par'd to the vail: Extent of Land lying V/ell and 
North- Weft from them, even to the South- Sea, 
an Extent of Continent full of innumerable Na- 
tions of People unknown, undifcovered, never 
fearch'd into or indeed heard of, but from one 
another, much greater in its Extent than all 
MtiroPe. 

IF we take the North Part of America exclufive 
of all the Cocmtry, which the Spaniards poilefs, 
and A'^^hich they call the Empire oi Mexico i and ex- 
clufiye too of what the EngUj'h and French poffefs 
on the Coaftj and in the two Rivers of Canada 
^wAhhjJifippi as abovejwhich indeed are butTrifles ; 
the reft of that Country uhich as far as it has been 
travelled into, is jotmd exceeding popidousy is a. great 
ileal larger than all Europe, though we have not 
reckoned the mofl Northern, Frozen and almofl 
unhabitable Part of it, where no End can be found, 
and where it is no doubt, but there is a conti- 
guous Continent with the Northern Part of AJia^ 
or fo near joyning, as to be only parted by a nar- 
row Guiph and Streight of Sea, eafily palled over 
both by Man or Beaft, or elfe it would be hard 
to give an Account how Man or Beaft came into 
that Part of the World ; I fay, this vad: Conti- 
nent full of People, and no doubt, inhabited by 
many Millions of Souls, is all wrapt up in Idola- 
try and Paganifm, given up to Ignorance and 
, Blindnefs, worfhipping the Sun, the Moon, the 
• Fire, the Hills their Fathers, and in a Word the 
Devil. 

As to the Thing we call Religion, or the Know- 
ledge of the true God, much kCs the Doftrine of 
'• the 



[ ^47 ] 

the Mefliah, and the Name of Chrift, they nor 
only have not, but never had the lead Incimai-ion o^' 
it on Earth, or Revelation o^ it from Heaven, 
till the Spaniards came among them : Nay, 
and now Chriftians are come among them, 
^tis hard to fay , whether the Paganifm is 
much abated, except by the infinite Ravages the 
Spaniards made where they came, who rooted 
out the Idolatry by deitLoying the Idolaters, not 
by converting them ; having cruelly cut oft, as 
their own Writers affirm, above feventy Millions 
of People, and \zk the Country naked of its In- 
habitants for many hundred Miles together. 

But what need we come to Calculations' forthe 
prefent Time with Refped to America^ let us but 
be at the Trouble to look back a little more than 
a Hundred Years, which is as nothing at all in the 
Argument i how had the whole Continent of A-' 
merica extended almofl: from Pole to Pole, with 
all the Iflands round itjand peopled with fuch innu- 
merable Multitudes of People, been as it were en- 
tirely abandoned to the Devil's Government, even 
from the beginning of Time, or at lead: from the 
fecond Peopling the World by Noah to the i5th 
Century, when Ferdinando Cortez,, General for the 
famous Charles the 5 th, firft landed in the Gulph 
of Mexico} 

We have heard much of the Cruelty of the Spa,- 
niards m dedroying fuch Multitudes of the Inha- 
bitants there, and of cutting off whole Nations 
by Fire and Sword : But as I am for giving up 
all the Adions of Men to the Government of Pro- 
vidence, it feems to me, that Heaven had 
determined fuch an Ad of Vengeance fhould 
be executed, and of which the Spaniards 
were Inflruments, to deflroy thofe People, who 
were come up (by the Influence of the Devil, no 

R 4 Doubt^ 



Doubt) to (mix a dreadful height, in that abhorr''^ 
Cuflom of human Sacrifices, that the innocent 
Blood cried for it, and it Teemed to be a Time to put 
a Stop to that Crime, left the very Race of People 
iliould at laft be extind by their own Butcheries. 

The Magnitude of this may be guefled at, by 
the Temple confecrated to the great Idol of 
Vifllipfllt in the City of Mexico^ where at the 
Command of Montez^uma the Pagan Monarch, 
twenty thoufand Men were facrificed in a Year, 
^nd the Wall hung a Foot thick with clotted 
Blood, dallied in Ceremony ^gainft the Side of 
that Place on thofe Occafions. 

This Abomination God in hi^ Prpvidence, put 
an End to, by deftroying thofe Nations from the 
Face of the Earth, bringing a Race qf bearded 
Strangers upon them, cutting in Pieces Man, V/o- 
man and Child, deftroying their Idols, and even the 
Idolatry it felf by the Spaniards ,• who, however 
wicked in themfelves, yet were in this to be 
efteemed Inflruments in the Hand of Heaven, to 
execute the divine Juftice, on Nations, whofe 
Crimes were come up to a full Height, ^nd that 
call'd for Vengeance. 

I make no doubt (to carry on this Digreflion a 
litt'e farther} that when God caft out the Hea- 
then, fo the Scripture calls it, from before the 
Jfyaelkes, and the Iniquity of the People of the 
Land was full, Jq/huay Mofes, and the Ijraelites 
were tax'd with as much Cruelcy and Inhumanity, 
;n deftroying the Cities, killing Man, Woman, 
and Child; nay, even deftroying the very C^ttle> 
•^nd Trees, and Fruits of the Earth, as ever the 
Spaniards were chargM with m tlie Cpnqueft of 

This is apparent by the Terror that was fpread 
^poD i'be Minds of the People lound about them, 

whereof 



[ ^4-9 ] 

wKereof thoufands fled to other Pares ot the 
World. That Hiilory tells us, that the firfl 
Builders of the City ot Carthage^ long before the 
Roman Times, or before the Fable of (^ueen Dido^ 
were fome Phenkians, that is to fay, Canaa^itesy 
who flying for their Lives, got Ships and wen|: 
away to Sea, planting themfelves on the Coaft ofc 
Afrtck^ as the firfl Place of Safety they arrived at, ; 
and to prove this a Pillar of Scone, was found not 
far from Tripoli, on which was cut in Phenician 
Characters, thefe Words, We are of thoje who fled 
from the Face of Jofhua the Robber. 

The Cruelties of the IfraeUtes, in deilroying i 
the Nations of the Land of Canaan^ was com- 
manded from Heaven ; and therein "Joflma was 
juflify'd in what v/as done. The Cruelties of the 
Spaniards, however abhorr'd by us, was doubtlefs 
an Appointment of God, for the Deftrudion of the 
wickedeft and moil: abominable People upon 
Earth. 

But this IS all a Digreffion ; I come to my Cal- 
culation: It is true, that the Spaniards, wjiom I 
allow to be Chriftians, have polTefs'd the Empires 
of Mexico and P^rui But after all the Havock 
they made, and the Millions of Souls they di^- 
mifs'd out of Life there, yet the Natives are in- 
finitely the Majority of the Inhabitants -, and tho' 
many of them are chriilianiz/d, they are little more 
than fubjefted, and take all the Spaniards, Chrilli- 
ans, and all the Portuguefe in the Brafils, all the , 
Englijh and Prench in the North, and in a Word, all / 
the Chriftians in America, and put them together, 
they will not ballance one Parr ot the Pagans or 
Mahometans in Europe : For Example, Take the 
CrimT'artars of Europe, who inhabit the Bank of 
the Euxine Sea, they are more in Number than all 
fhe Chriftians in America ; (o that fetting one Na- 
tion 



[ i5o ] 

tion againfl the Other, and you may reckon that 
there is not one Chriflian, or as if there were not 
one Chriflian in thofe three Partsof the World,^^, 
Africa^ and America^ except the Greeks of AJia, 

This is a jufl but a very fad Account of the 
fmail Extent of Chriftian Knowledge in the 
World ; and were it confider^'d, as it ought, would 
put the moil powerful Princes of Europe upon 
thinking ot feme Methods, at leaft to open a Way 
for the fpreading Chriftian Knowledge. I am 
' Fiot much of the Opinion indeed, that Religion 
Ihculd be planted by the Sword : But as the Chri- 
flian Princes of Europe, however few in Number, 
are yet fo fuperior to all the reft of the World in 
martial Experience and the Art of War, nothing 
is more certain than that, if they could unite their 
Intereft, they are able to beat Paganifm out of the 
World. Nothing is more certain than this, that 
would the Chriftian Princes unite their Powers, and 
a6t in Concert, they might deftroy the Turkifi Em- 
pire, and the Perfian Kingdom, and beat the very 
Name of Mahomet out of the World. 

It is no Boaft to fay, That were there no inte- 
fline Broils among us, the Chriftian Soldiery is 
fo evidently fuperior to the Turks at this Time, 
that had they all join'd after the late Battel at 
Belgrade, to have fent 80000 Veteran Soldiers to 
have joined Prince Eugene, and fupply'd him with 
Money and Provifions by the Ports o^ the Adriatic 
Gulph, and the Archipelago, that Prince would in 
two or three Campaigns, have driven the Ma- 
hometans out oi Europe, taken Conftantinople^ and 
have overturn 'd the TurkiJJj Empire. 
Ic After fuch a Conqueft, whether might not the 
Chriftian Religion have fprcadT The King o^ Spain 
with the fame Eafe would reduce the Moors 
oiBarharyy and difpoflefs tholc Sons of Hell the 

Alge- 



[ 151 ] 

Algerines^ 7'ripolmes, Tuniz^ems, and all the Maho- 
metan Pyrates of that Coaft, and plane again 
the antienc Churches o'iAjrkky the Sees of TertuUh 
any St. Cypriariy &c. 

Nay, even the Cx>ar of Mufcovy, an enterprizing 
and glorious Prince, well afTifted and fupported by 
his Neighbours, the Northern Powers, who to- . 
gether are Mailers of the befc Soldiery in the 
World, would not find it inripoffible to march an^. 
Army of 36000 Foot and 16000 Horfe, in Spite! 
of wafte and unhofpitable Defarts, even to attack 1 
the Chinefe Empire ; who, notwithftanding their) 
infinite Numbers, pretended Policy and great 
Skill in War, would fink in the Operation: And 
fuch an Army of difciplin'd Ewopean Soldiers^ 
would beat all the Forces of that vail: Empire,with 
the fame (or greater) Eafe, as Alexander with 
30000 Macedonians dc^ktoy'd the Army of Darius j^ 
which confifted of 680000 Men. 

And let no Alan ridicule this Projed, on Ac- 
count of the March which I know they will call 
3000 Miles and more : While there is no Obftru- 
dion, but the Length of the' Way, it is not fo 
difficult as fome may imagine ; 'tis far from im- 
polTible, to furnifh fufficient Provifions for the 
March, which is indeed the only Difficulty that 
carries any Terror in it» 

Such a Prince as the Cz.ar of Mufcovy cannot 
want the Afliftance of innumerable Hands^ for the 
Amailing or Carriage for conveying to proper Ma- 
gazines, fufficient Stores of Provifions, for the. 
maintaining a feleftchofen Body of Men to march 
over the Defarts; for in the grand March, no 
ufelefs Mouths Ihould be found to feed. 

Why then fiiould not the Chriftian. Princes think 
it a Deed of Compalfion to the Souls of Men, as 
well as an hiunble Agency to the Work of Proyi- 

denccs 



[ i5i ] 

dencc, and to the Fulfilling the Promifes of their 
Saviour, by a moderate, and as far as in them Ij^es, 
a bloodlefs Conqueil, to reduce the whole World 
to the Government of Chriilian Power, and fo 
plant the Name and Knowledge of Chriil Jefus 
iamong the Heathens and Mahometans ? I am not 
fuppofing, that they can plant real Religion in 
this manner -, the Bufinefs of Power, is to open 
the Way to the Gofpel of Peace, the Servants of 
the King of the Earth are to fight, that the Ser- 
vants of the King of Heaven may preach. 

Let but an open Door be made for the preach- 
ing of the Word of God, and the Minifters of 
Chrift be admitted, if they do not fpread Chrifti- 
an Knowledge over the Face of the Earth, the 
Fault will be their's. Let but the military Power 
reduce the Pagan World, and banifh the Devil and 
Mahomet from the Face of the Earth, the Know- 
ledge of God be diligently fpread, the Word of God 
duly preach'd, and the People meekly and faith- 
fully inftruded in the Chnftian Religion; the 
World would foon receive the Truth, and the 
Knowledge of divine Things would be the Study 
and Delight of Mankind- 

I know, fome nice and difficult People would 
objed here, how are the prefent Body of Chrifti- 
ans, as you call them, qualified to convert the Pa- 
gan and Mahometan World, when they are not 
able to fettle the main Point, ^viz,. What the Chri- 
fciin Religion is^ Or, what they would convert 
them to? That Chrifiianity is fubdividcd into fo 
many Parts, and particular Principles,the People fo 
divided m their Opinion ; and that which is fliU 
worfc, there is fo little Charity among the feveral 
Sorts, that fome of them would rather CxdQ with 
Mahomet againft their Neighboiirs^than aiTifl to pro- 
pagate that particular Do6lrine in Religion, which 

they 



[ ^53 ] 

they condemn. Thus the Members of the Prote- 
flant Faith would make it a Point of Principle, 
not to fupporr or propagate the Intereft of Popery 
in fuch a Conqueft as this : And again, the Ca- 
tholicks would as much make it a Duty on 
them to root out Herefy, fo they call the Prote- 
ftant DoElrine^ as they would to root out Paganifm 
and the Worfhip of Devils. 

I would not anfwer for fome Proteftan ts, that 
they would not be of the fame Mind as to particu- 
lar Divifions among Proteftants : The Difference 
among fome Opinions is fuch, and their Want 
of Charity one to another, fets them at fuch Va- 
riance, that if they do not cenfure one another for 
Devil- Worfhippers, yet we know they frequently^ 
call fome of the oppoiite Principles. Dodrines of 
Devils; and perfecute one another v/ith as much 
Fury, as ever the Heathen perfecuted the Primi- 
tive Churches. 

Witnefs the Violences which have reign'd be- 
tween the Epifcopal and Presbyterian Parties, in the | 
North of Ireland^ and in Scotland, which has (b j 
often broken out into a Flame of War, and that \ 
Flame been alv/ays quench^'d with Blood. 

Witnefs the frequent Perfecutions, Wars, MaC- 
facres, and other cruel and unnatural Doings, 
which have been in thefe Parts of the World among 
Chriftians, the Eftt£l of a miftaken Zeal for the 
Chriflian Religion , which as it was not planted 
by Blood and Violence, fo much lefs can Chrifti- 
ans juftify the Endeavours to ered this or that 
Opinion in it, by the Ruine and Blood of their 
Brethren. 

But this is far from being a Reafon, why we 
ihould not think it our Duty to fubdue the barba- 
rous and idolatrous Nations oF the Worlds in Or- 
der to fupprefs the WorjGhippi'ng the Devil3 who 

is 



[ 2.54 ] 

is the Enemy not only of God, and of all true Re- 
' ligion in the World, but who is the great Deftroy- 
er and Enemy of Mankind, and of his future or 
prefent Felicity ,• and whofe Bufinefs is always to 
theutmojfl: of his Power to involve and retain them 
either in Ignorance, or in Error. 

I diilinguifh between forcing Religion upon 

People, or forcing them to entertain this or that 

{ Opinion of Religion j I fay, I diflinguifh between 

f that, and opening the Door for Religion to come 

among them : The former is a Violence indeed, 

( inconliftent with the Nature of Religion it felf, 

j whofe Energy prevails and forces its Way into the 

I Minds of Men, by another Sort of Power j Where- 

f-*)^ I as the latter is removing a Force unjuftly put al- 



^^i- ^- I ready upon the Minds of Men by the Artifice of 
the Devil, to keep the Chriflian Religion out of 
the V/orld ; fo that indeed I propofe a War not 
with Men, but with the Devil j a War to depofe 
\ Sathans infernal Tyranny in the World, and fet 
( open the Doors to Religion, that it may enter if 
\ Men will receive it j if they will not receive it, 
! be that to themfelves. 
f In a Word, to unchain the Wills of Men, fet 

\ their Inclinations free, that their Reafon may be 
at Liberty to influence their Underflandings, and 
that they may have the Faith of Chrift preach'd 
I to them ; whether they will hear or forbear, I fay, 
as above, is no Part of the Queftion, let theChri- 
flian Doctrine and its fpiritual Enemies alone to 
ilruggle about that: I am for dealing with the 
Temporalities of the Devil, and depofing that hu- 
man Power which is armed in the Behalf ot obfti- 
nate Ignorance, and refolute to keep out the Light 
of Religion from the Mind. 

I think 



I think this is a lawful and juft War, and 'm the 
End, kind both to them and their Pofterity : Let me 
bring the Cafe home to our felves. 

Suppofe neither Julius Cefar ov any o( the Ro^ / 
man Generals or Emperors, had caft their Eyes ' 
towards Britain for fome Ages, or till the Chriftiaa 
Religion had fpread over the whole Roman Em- 
pire. 'Tis true, the Britains might at laft. have, 
received the Chriflian Faith in common with x.ht 
reft of the Northern World ,* but they had yet layn 
above 306 Years longer in Ignorance and Paganifm, 
than they did; and fome hundred thoufands of 
People, who prov'd zealous Chriftians, nay even 
Martyrs for the Chriftian Dodrincj ^vould have 
dy'd in the profefs^d Paganifm of the Britains. 

Now ^tis evident, the Invafion of the Romans 
was an unjufl, bloody, tyrannical Affault upon thg 
poor Britains^a^g^inR all Right and Pro petty, againil 
Juftice and Neighbourhood^ and meerly carry'd 
on for Conquefl and Dominion. Nor indeed had 
the Romans any jufl Pretence of War, yet God 
was pleafed to make this Violence be the kindeft 
Thing that could have befallen the BritiJJj Nation^ 
fince it brought in the Knowledge of God among 
the Britains, and was a Means of reducing a hea- 
then and barbarous Nation to the Faith of Chrifr^ 
and to embrace the Mellias. 

Thus Heaven ferves it felf of Mens worft De« 
figns, and the Avarice, Ambition, and Rage of 
Men, have been made Ufe of to bring to pafs the 
glorious Ends of Providence, without the leaf^ 
Knowledge or Defign of the Adors : Why then 
may not the great Undertakings of the Princes of 
Europe, if they could he brought to act in Concert, with 
a good Defign to bring all the World, to open their 
Doors to the Chriflian Religion, and by Confe- / 
quence their Ears? I fay, why may not fuch an ' 

Attempt 



Attempt be blelled from Heaven with fb much 
Succefs, at leafl as to make Way for bringing in 
nominal Chriftianiry among the Nations? For as 
to obliging the People to be of this or that Opini- 
on afterward, that is another Cafe. 

There is a great Pother made in the World a- 
mong the feveral Denominations of ChriffianS 
about Coertion, ereding a Church, and compel- 
ling Men to come in ; that is to fay, one Sort of 
Chriftians perfecuting another Sort of Chriftians, 
to make them wor&ip Chrifl their Way, as if 
Chrifl had no Sheep but one Fold. 

I diilinguifh much between ufing Force to re- 
duce Heathens and Savages to Chriftianity, and 
ufing Force to reduce thofe that are already Chri- 
ftians, to be of this or that Opinion ; I will not 
fay but a War might be very jufl, and the Caufe 
be righteous, to reduce the Wor/hippers of the Pa- 
gods of India, to the Knowledge and Obedience 
of Chriftianity, when it would be a horrible In- 
juftice to commence a like War, to reduce even 
a Popifh Nation to be Proteftant. 

But my proposM War does not reach fo far as 
that neither j for tho'I would have a Nation of Pa- 
gans conquered, that their Idols and Temples 
might be deftroy'd, and their Idol VVorfhip be 
abolifhM ; yet 1 would be very far from puni&ing 
and perfecuting the People for not believing in 
Chrift : For if we believe chat Faith, as the Scrip- 
ture fays is the Gift of God, How can we upon 
any Chriil:ian Foundation, punifh or perfecute the 
Man for not exerciling that which God had nor 
given him. 

Hence, compelling Men to conform to this 
or that particular Profeffion of the Chriftiati Re- 
ligion, is to me impious and unchrillian. 

And 



[ 157 ] 

And fliall I fpeak a Word here of the iinhap- 
py Cuftom among Chriflians, of reviling one 
another with Words, on Account of differing O^ 
pinions in Religion : It was a Part of Apocryphal 
Scripture, taken from one of the traditional Say- 
ings of the Rabbies, Thou jhalt not mock at the 
Gods of the Heathens : But Ribaldry, Satyr, and 
Sarcafnns, are the Ufage we give one another 
every Day on the Subject of Religion ; as if Slan- 
der and the Severities of the Tongue, were not the 
worfl kind of Violence in Matters of the Chri- 
ftian Religion. 

In a Word, I muft acknowledgej if I am to 
fpeak of Reproach in general, I know no worfe 
Perfecution than that of the Tongue i Solomon 
fays, I'here are that fpeak, like the piercing of a Sword ; 
and King David was fo fendble of the Bitternefs 
of the Tongue, that he is full of Exclamations 
upon the Subjed ; among the rell, he fays of his 
Enemies, "they have compaffed me about with IVords 
of Hatred. He cloathed himfelf with Curjing like as 
•with his Garment, Pfalm cix. 3,18. 

It is indeed remote from the Subje£i: I am upon^ 
to talk of this kind of uncharitable Dealing, but 
as juft Obfervations are never out of Seafon, it 
may have its Ufes : Let no Man flight the Hintj 
tho' it were meant of Religion only, for that indeed 
is my prefent Sobjed \ there is doubtlefs as fevere 
a Perfecution by the Tongue, as that of Fire and 
Faggot, and fome think 'tis as hard to be born. 

I have never met wichfo much of this any 
where in all my Travels as in England, where the 
Mouths of the feveral Beds and Opinions are fo 
eftedually open againft one another, that albeit 
common Charity commands us to talk the bed of 
particular Perfons in their Failings and Infirmi- 
ties j yet ^^r^, xenfuring, condemning and re- 

S proaehing 



[158] 

proaclnng one another on Account of Opinio'ns^ 
is carried on with fuch a Guft, that lets every one 
fee nothing but Death and Deftrudion can follow, 
and no Reconciliation can be expeded. 

I have liv'd to fee Men of the beft Light be 
miftaken, as well in Party as in Principles, as well 
in Politicks as in Religion, ^and find not only Oc- 
cafion, but even a Neceility to change Hands or 
Sides in both ; I have feen them fome times run in- 
to contrary Extremes, beyond their firfl Inten- 
tion, and even without Dcfign. : Nay, in thofe un- 
happy Changes, I have feen them driven into 
Lengths they never defigned, by the fiery Re- 
fentraent of thofe whom they feem^d to have 
left, and whom they diSct'd from^ I have lived to 
fee thofe Men acknowledge even publickly and 
openly, they were wTong and miftaken, and ex- 
prefs their Regret for being mifled very fincerely ; 
but I cannot fay, I have liv'd to fee the People, 
they have deiir'd to return to, forgive or receive 
them : Perhaps, the Age I have lived in, has not 
been a proper Seafon for Charity, I hope Futurity 
will be fiirniili'd vjich better Chriftians, or per- 
haps 'tis appointed [oy to iiluflrate the divine Mer- 
cy, and let Mankind fee, that they are the only 
Creatures that never forgive. I have feen a Man 
in the Cafe I fpeak of, oiter the mofl fincere Ac- 
knowledgments of his having been miftaken, and 
this net in Matters eflential either to the Perfon's 
Morals or Chriilianity, but only in Matters of 
Party, and with the mofl moving Expreffions, de- 
iire his old Friends to forgive what has been 
pafs'd ; and have feen their Return, be mockmg 
him with what they called a Bafenefs of Spirit, 
and a mean SubmifTion : I have feen him expoflu* 
late with tliem, wiiy they fhould not aft upon 
the fame Terms witii a Penitent, as God himfelf 

not 



[ -^59 ] 

hot only prefcribed, biii: yields to ; and have (tin 
them in Return, tell him, God might forgive hini 
if he plcafed, but they would never j and then ex- 
pofe all thofe Offers to the firlt Comer in Banter 
and Ridieale : But take me right too, I have i^^w 
at the fame Time, that to wlTer Meii it has been 
alvi'-ays thought to be an expoiing themfeives, and 
an Honour to the Perfon. 

I fpealc this too feelingly y and therefore fay no 
more j there is a Way by Patience, to conquer 
even the univerfal Contempt of Mankind ; and 
though two Drams of that Drug be a Vomit 
for a Dog,^ it is in my Experience the only Me- 
thod ; there is a fecret Peace in it, and in Time 
the Rage of Men wiW abate, a conilant fceady 
adhering to Vertue and Honefty, and fhewingth3 
World, that whatever Miflakes he might be led 
into, fuppoiing them to be Miftakes, that yet the 
main Intention and Defign of his Life, was iin- 
cere and upright ^ he that governs the Adions of 
Men by an unbiafs'd Hand, will never fuffer 
Csjch a Man to fink under the Weight of univerfai 
Prejudice and Clamour. 

I Robinson Crusoe, grown old in AfHi- 
d:ion, born down by Calumny and Reproaehj but 
fupported from within, boldly prefcribe this Re- 
medy againft univerfal Clamours and Contempt of 
Mankind j PatiencCi a fteady Life of Vertue and 
Sobriety, and a comforting Dependance on the

This very Thought made me long ago claim 
a kind of Property in fome good old Lines of 
the famous Gecrge Withers Efq; made in Prifon 
in the Toii'^r; he was a poetical Gentleman, who 
had in the Time of the Civil Wars in England^ 
been unhappy in changing of Sides too often, and 
and had been put into the "fower by every S^de in 
their Turn -, once by the King, once by the Par- 
liamenty once by the Army, then by the Rump, 
and at lafl again, / thinks by General Monk ; in- 
a Word, what ever Side got up, he had the Dli- 
after to be down, the Lines are thus : 

The World and I may ixiell agree ^ 

as mofl that are offended ; 
JFar I flight her, and floe flights mey 

and there's our Quarrel ended. 

For Service done and love exprefly 

Iho very jew regard ity 
My Country owes me Bread at lea(l : 

But if I am debar/ d it. 
Good Confcience is a daily Feafty 

and borrow never marr'^d it. 

But this Article of verbal Perfecution, has 
hurried me from my Subjed:, which I muft re- 
turn to. 

I have fpoken of a Projed for the Czar o( Muf- 
covyy worthy of a Monarch, vAio is Lord of fo 
vait an extent of Country, as the Rifftan Empire 
reaches to; which is in Eiied as i have (aid, 
much more than half Europe, and confequently an 
eighth Part of the World. I have given my 
1 hougliCb how a War to open a Door for the 

Chri' 



Chriftian Religion may be juftifiable.and that it has 
not the Icaft Tindure of Perfecution in it : If the 
Chriftian Princes of the World, who now fpend 
their Force (o much to an ill Purpofe, in real Per- 
fecution, would join in an univerfal War againft 
Paganifm and Devil- wo rfliip, the favage Part 
of Mankind would in one Age, be brought to 
bow their Knees to the God oi: Truth, and would 
blefs the Enterprife it felf in the End of it, as 
the bell Thing that ever befel them : Nor could 
fuch an Attempt fail of Succefs, unlefs Heaven in 
Juftice had determined to fliut up the World lon- 
ger in Darknefs, and the Cup of their Abomina- 
tions was not yet full : But I may venture to fay, 
there would- be much more Ground for fuch 
Chriflian Princes to hope and exped: the Con- 
currence of Heaven in fuch an Undertaking, than 
in fheathing their Swords in the Bowels of 
their Brethren, and making an Effufion of Chri- 
ftian Blood upon every flight Pretence, as we fee 
has been the Cafe in Europe for above thirty Years 
pafl. 

I had intended to remark here, that as the 
Country pofldfed by Chriftians is but a Spot of the 
Globe, compared to the Heathen, Pagan, and 
Mahometan World ^ fo the Number of real Chri- 
fhans among the Nations profelTing the Chriftian 
Name, is yet a more difproportioned Part, a mere 
Triflie, and hardly to be comparM with the infi- 
nite Numbers of thofe who tho'they call themfelves 
Chriftians, yet know as little of God and Reli- 
gion as can be imagined to be known, where the 
Word Chriflian is fpoken of, and neither feek or / 
defire to know more,- in a Word, who know but ^' 
little of God or Jefus Chrift, Heaven or Hell, and 
f^gard none of them. 

S 3 This 



Ii6z ] 

This is a large Field.and being througiy fearchM 
into, would I doubt nor, reduce the real faithful 
Subjects of the Kingdom of Jefus Chrifl, to a 
much fewer Number than thoie of Mahomet ; nay, 
than thofe of the Monarch of Germany \ and make 
our Lord appear a weakei^ Prince, fpeaking in the 
Senfe of Kingdoms, than many of the King^s of 
the Earth. And if it'be true that the old King 
o{ France fhould fay, That he had more loyal Sub- 
jeds than King Jefus ; I do not know, but in the 
Senfe his Mofl Chnllian Majefly meant it, the 
Thing might be very true. 

But this Obfervation is fomething out of my 
prefent Road:> and merits to be fpoken of by itfelh 
The Number of true Chriftians will never be 
known on this Side the great Bar, where they 
Ihall be critically feparaced. No political Arith- 
metick can make a Calculaticn of the -Number 
of true Chriftians, while they live blended with 
the falfe ones, iince it is not only hard, but im- 
pofUble to know them one from another in this 
World. 

We fnall perhaps be furprifed at the laft Day, to 
fee fome People at the Right-hand of the righ- 
teous Judge, whom we have condemned wicii 
the utmoft Zeal in our Opinions, while we were 
Contemporary Vv^ich them in Life j for -Charity, 
as ic is generally pradifed in this World, and 
mix'd with our human Infirmicies, fuch as Pride, 
Self-opinion^ and Perfonal-prejudice, is ftrangely 
mif-guided, and makes us entertain Notions of 
Things and of People, quite different from what 
they really deferve; and there is hardly any Rule 
to prefcribe ourfelves, except it be of the Text, 
In Meeknefsy every one efteeming other better than 
thmjelvjs^ which by the Way, is difficult to 

But 



[ ^^3 ] 

But though we ftiiU thus fee at the great Aii" 
dit, a Tranipofition of Perfons trom the Station 
they held in our Charity, we fhall only thereby 
fee that our Judgment was wrong ; that God 
judgeth not as M^n judgerh, and that we too 
ralhly condemn, whom he has thought fit to ju- 
ftify and accept. 

Let then the Number of Chriftians be more or 
lefs, as he that makes tiiem Chridians determines, 
thiS is not for us to enter into, and this brings 
me back to what I faid before, that though we 
cannot make Chriftians, we both can and may, and 
inderd ought to open the Door to Chriftianity> 
that the Preaching of God's Word, which is the 
ordinary Means of bringing Mankind to the Know- 
ledge ot Religion, may be fpread over the whole 
World. 

With what Vigour do we confulr, and how do 
the labouring Heads of the World club together 
to form Projects, and to raife Subfcripcions to 
extend the general Commerce* of Nations in- 
to every Corner of the World : But 'twould 
pafs for a Bubb.e of ail Bubbles, and a Whimfy 
that none Vv^ould engage in, if ten Millions ihould 
be asked to be fubicribed, for fending a ftrong 
Fleet and Army to conquer Heathenifm and Ido- 
latry, and proted a Miffion of Chriftians, to be 
empLy'd in Preaching the Gofpel to the poor 
Heathens, fay. it were on the Coaft of Cormayidel, 
the Illand of Cejlon and Country of Malabar, or 
any of the Dominions of the Great Mogul, and 
yet fuchan Attempt would not only be jaft, but 
infinitely advantageous to the People who (hould 
undertake it, and to the People of the Country, 
on who_m the Operation fhould be wrought. 

In the occafionai Difcourfes I had on this 
Subjecl, in Ccnverfarion with Men ofgood Judg- 

S 4 ' mexic 



[ 1^4 ] 

rtjent and Principles, I have been often ask'd 
in what Manner I would propofe to carry on fuch 
a Conqueft as I fpeak of, and how it fhould an- 
fwer the End ; and that I may not be fuppofed to 
fuggeft a Thing impradicable in itfelf or for 
which no rational Scheme might be propofed; I 
fliali make a brief Elfay, at the Manner, in which 
the Conqueft I fpeak of fhould be, or ought to be 
carried onj and if it be coniidered ferioufly, the 
Difficulties and perhaps all the reafonable Ob- 
jedions might vanifh in an Inftant. I will there- 
fore firfl', for the Purpofe only^ fuppofe that an At- 
tempt was made by a Chriftian Nation, to con- 
quer and fubdue fome Fleathen or Mahometan Peo^ 
pie at a Diftance from them, place the Conqueft 
where, and among whom we will : For Example, 
Suppofe it was the great Ifland of Madagafcavy ox 
that of Ceylon^ Borneo in the Indies, or thofe of 
^apan, or any other where you pleafe. 

I would firft fuppofe, the Place to be infinite- 
ly populous as any of tjiofe Countries, though 
they are Iflands, are faid to be ; and becaufe the 
Japnnefe are faid to be a moft fenfible fagacious 
People, under excellent Forms of Government, 
and capable more than ordinarily of receiving 
Impreflions, ftipported by the Argument and Ex- 
ample of a vertuous and religious Conqueror. 

For th.s Purpofe you muft grant me, that the 
Ifland or Iflands of Japan were in a Situation 
proper for the undertaking, and that a powerful 
'European Army being landed upon them, had in a 
great Battle or in divers Battles, over-thrown 
all their Military Force, ai)d had entirely re- 
duced the whole Nation to their Power : As to

f.he like. The fliort Scheme for eflablifhing the 
Government in thofe Countries Ihould be this j 

Firft> As the War is pointed chiefly a- 
gainft the Kingdom of the Devil, in 
behalf of the Chrillian Worfhip, (o 
no Qparter iliould be given to Satan's 
Adminiftration ,' and as nothing tile 
fliould willingly be treated with Vio- 
lence ; fo indeed no Part of the De- 
vils OEconomy fhould have any Fa- 
vour, but all the Idols ftiould imme- 
diately be deftroyed, and publickly 
burnt, 'all the Pagods and Temples 
burnt, and the very Face and Form 
of Paganifm and the Wor&ip attend- 
ing it, be utterly defaced and de- 
ftroyed. 

Secondly, The Priefls and dedicated Per- 
fons o£ every kind, by whatfoever 
Names or Titles known or diftin- 
guifhed, fhould be at ieafc removed, 
i^ not deilroyed. 

Thirdly, All the Exercife of profane and 
idolatrous Rites, Ceremonies, Wor- 
ihip, Feflivals, and Cuftoms, fiiould 
be aboliihed entirely, fo as by Time 
to be forgotten, and clean wjped out 
of the Minds, as well as out of the 
Pradice of the People. 

This is all the Coertion I propofe, and lefs than 
this cannot be propofcd, becaufe though we may 
not by Arms and Force compel'^Men to be reli- 
gious, becaufe if we dO;, we cannot make them 

fincere^ 



[ 166 ] 

fincere, and fo by Perfecution we only create Hy- 
pocrites ; yet I in(ift chat we may by Force, 
and that with the greatefi: Juftice poiTible, fup- 
prefs Paganifm, and the Woriliip of God's Enemy 
the Devil, and banifh it oiic of the World ; nay, 
that we ought to do it to the utmoil: of our Power * 
But I return to the Conqueft. 

The Country being thus entirely reduced under 
Chriftiaii Government, the Inhabitants if they 
fubmit quietly, ought to be ufed with Humanity 
and Juflice ^ no Cruelty, no Rigour ; they fhould 
fuffer no OpprelTion, Injury, or Injuftice, that 
they may not receive evil Impreffions of the Peo- 
ple that are come among them ; left entertaining an 
Abhorrence of Chriftians, from their evil Conduti, 
Cruelty, and Injuftice, they fhould entertain an Ab- 
horrence of the Chriftian Religion for their Sakes^ 
as the poor Wretches the Jyidians in America^ who 
when they were talked to of the Future State, 
the Refurredion of the Dead, Eternal Felicity in 
Heaven, and the like, enquir'd where the Spaniards 
I went after Death, and it any of them went to 
\ Heaven? and being anfwered in the Affirmative, 
; Ihook their Heads, and delired they might go to 
I Hell then, for that they were afraid to think of 
i being in Heaven, if the Spaniards were there. 
A jaft and generous Behaviour to the Native.'', 
or at leaft to fuch of them as fliould fiiow them- 
felves willing to fubmit, would certainly engage 
them in their Inrereft, and accordingly would iw 
a little while bring them to embrace that Truth,, 
which didated fuch juft Principles to thofe who 
efpoufed it. 

Thus Prejudices being removed, the Way to In- 
flru(5tion would be made the more plain, and then 
would be the Time for Gofpel-Labourers to enter 
upon the Harveft i Minifters fhould be initruded 

to 



to teach them our Language, to exhort them to 
feek the BleiTings of Religion and of the true 
God, and fo gradually to introduce right Prin- 
plcs among them at their own Requefl. 

From hence they fhould proceed, to teach all 
the young Children the Language fpoken by them, / 
who would then be their Benefaftors, rather than ' 
Conquerors, and a few Years wearing the old Ge- ; 
Deration out, the Pofterity of them, and of their \ 
Conquerors, would be ail one Nation. 

In Cafe any rejeded the Inftrudlion of religious 
Men, and adher'd obftioately to his Idolatry, and 
would not be reclaimed by gentle and chriftian U- 
fage, fuj table Methods are to be taken with foch, 
that they might not make a religious Fadion in the 
Country, and gain others to iide with them, ia 
order to recover their Liberty, as they might call it 
to ferve their own Gods, that i > to fay Idols ; for 
it muil be for ever as juft, not to permit them to go 
back to Idolatry by Force, as it was to pull 
them from it by Force. 

By this kind of Conqaeft, the Chriftian Reli- 
gion would be moil: effectually propagated amoiig 
innumerable Nations of Savages and Idola- 
ters, and as many People be brought to worfhip 
the true God, as may be faid to doit at this Time 
in the whole Chriftian World. 

This is my Cruifado, and it would be a War as 
juftifiable on many Accounts, as any that was ever 
undertaken in the World, a War that would bring 
Eternal Honour to the Conquerors, and an Eternal 
Bielling to the People conquer'd. 

It were eafy now to cut out Enterprifes of this 
Nature for other of the Princes of the World than 
the Czar of Uajcouy ; and I could lay very ratio- 
nil Schemes for fuch Undertakings, and the 
Schemes that could^ if througly purfued never 

fail 



[ 168 ] 

foil of Succefs : For Example, An Expedition 
againfl the ^oors of Africa^ by the French ^ Spanijh 
and Italian Princes, who daily fufFer fo much by 
them, and the lad of whom are at perpetual War 
with them; how eafy would it be to thofe 
Powers to join in a Chriftian Confederacy, to 
plant the Chriftian Religion again in the Numi- 
4ian and Mauritanian Kingdoms ', where was once 
the famous Church of Carthage^ and from whence 
Thoufands of Chriftians have gone to Heaven j 
the Harveft of the primitive Labours of St. Cy- 
pian^ Tenullian, and many more, whofe Pofte-^ 
rity now bow their Knees to that latefl and word 
of ail ImpoflorSj Mahomet. 

But unchriilian Strife was always a Bar againft 
the Propagation of Chriflian Religion, and unna- 
tural Wars carried on among the Nations I fpeak 
of, are made fo much the Bufinefs of the Chriftian 
World, that I do not expeft in our Time, to fee 
the Advantages taken hold of, that the Nature of 
the Thing offers : But I am perfuaded, and leave it 
upon Record as my fettled Opinion, that one 
Time or other, the Chriftian Powers of Europe^ 
fliali be infpired from Heaven for fuch a Work, 
and then the Eafinefs of fubduing the Kingdom of 
Africa to the Chriftian Power, fliall ftiame the Ge- 
nerations paft, v/ho had the Opportunity fo often 
in their Hands, bur made no \J[c of it. 

Note, In this Part of the Subjed I am upon, I 
inuft acknowledge there is a double Argument 
for a War : i. In Point of the interfering Inreafts> 
Europe ought to take Pofleflion ot thofc Shoars, 
without which it is manifcft her Commerce is not 
fecurcd j and indeed, while that Part of Ajrick 
bordering on the Sea, is m the Hands of Robbers, 
Pyrates cannot be iecur'd : Now, this is a Point 
of undifputed Right, tor a War-Trade claims the 

Pro- 



[ ^^9] 

Pi'Otecfcion of the Powers to v/hcm ft belongs, and 
we make no Scruple to make War upon one ano- 
ther, for the Protedion of our Trade, and it is 
allowed to be a good Reafon why we fhould do 
fo. Why then is it not a good Reafon to make 
War upon Thieves and Robbers ? If one Nation 
takes the Ships belonging to another, we imme- 
diately reclaim the Prize from the Captors, and 
require of the Prince^ that Juflice be done againil 
the Aggreifor, who is a Breaker of the Peace ; 
and it this is refufed, we make War. 

But fhall we do thus to Chriftians, and fcruple 
to make an univerfal War for the rooting out a 
Race of Pyrates and Rovers who live by Rapin, 
and are continually employed like the Lions and 
Tygers o^ their own Lyl^ia in devouring their 
Neighbours : This, I fay, makes fuch a War not 
only juft on a religious Account, but both juft 
and neceilary upon a civil Account. 

The War then being thus proved to be jufl on 
other Accounts, why fhould not 2. The Extir- 
pation of Idolatry, Paganifm, and Devil- Worfbip, 
be the Confequence of the Vidory. If God be 
allowM to be the Giver of Vidory, how can it 
be anfwered to him, that the Viftory fiiould not 
be made Ufe of , for the Intereft and Glory of 
the God of War, from whom it proceeds ? But 
thefe Things are not to be offered to the World, 
till higher Principles work in the Minds of Men, 
in their making War and Peace, than yet feems to 
take up their Minds. 

I was tempted upon this Occafion, to make an 
Excuriion here,- upon the Subject of the very 
light Occafions, Princes and Powers, States and 
Statefmen make ufe of, for the engaging in War 
and Blood one againft another ; one for being ill 
fatisfied with the other^ and another for preferving 

the 



[ 270 ] 

the Ballance of Power j this for nothing at a\U 
and that for fomething next to nothing; and how 
little Concern the Blood that is neceflariiy fpilt 
in thefe Wars produces among them : But this is 
not z Cafe that wih fo well bear, to be entred 
upon in 2l publick Manner at thisTnne. 

All I can add is, I doubt, no fnch Zeal for the 
Chriftian Religion, will be found in our Days, or 
perhaps in any Age of the World, till Heaven beats 
theDrumsitfelf,and the gloriousLegions from above 
come down on Purpofe to propagate the Work, and 
to reduce the whole World to the Obedience of 
Kingjefus; a Time which fome tell us is not far 
oft : But of which I heard nothing in ail my Travels 
and Illuminations, no not one Word, 

FINIS. 





VISION* 



OF THE 



Angelick World- 




ilEY muft be much takerf up 
with the Satisfadion of what 
they are already, that never fpars 
their Thoughts upon the Subjet^ 
(dF what they fhall be. 

The Place, the Company, the 
Employment which we exped to 
know fo much oi hereafter, muft eeirtainly be well 
worth our while id enquire after here. 

I believe the main Interruptions which have 
been given to thefe Enquiries, and perhaps^ the 
Reafon why thofe that have entred into them 

A h^te 



pw^3 



have given them up, and thofe who h^ve not 
entred into them, have fatisfied themfelves in the 
utter Kegled, have been the wild chimerick 
Notions, enthafiaftick Dreams, and unfatisfying 
Ideas, , which mofl: of the Conceptions of Men 
have led them into, about thefe Things. 

As I endeavour to conceive juftly of thefe 
Things, I ihali likewifc endeavour to reafbn upoli- 
them clearly, and, if pofTibie, convey fome fuch 
Ideas of the invifible World to the Thoughts of 
Men, as may not be confufed and indigefted, and 
fo leave them darker thajti I find them. 

The Locality of Heaven or Hell is no Part of 
my Search ; there is doubtlefs a Place referv'd 
for the Reception of our Souls after Death ; as 
ther^ is a State of Being for material Subftances, 
fo there mud be a Place ,• if we are to BE, we 
muft have a where; the Scripture fapports Rea- 
fon in it, Juda^ is gone to his Place, Dives in 
Hell lift up his Eyes, and faw Laz^arm in Abra^ 
ham's Bofom ; the 'Locality of Blifs and Mifery 
feems to be pofitiVely afferted in both Cafes. ' 

But there is not fo clear a View of the Company 
as of the Place ; it is not fo eafy ^to enquire into 
the World of Spirits, as it is evident that there 
are fuch Spirits, and fuch a World ; we find the 
Locality of it is natural, but who the Inhabitants 
are^Si^ '^-Search of ftilla fublimer Nature, liable 
to mote Exception, encumber^ with more Dif- 
ficulties, and expofed to much more Uncertainty. 

I {hall endeavour to clear up as much of it as 
lean, and intimate moft willingly, how much I 
rejoyce in the Expectation, that fome other En- 
quirers may go farther, ^till at laft, all that Pro- 
vidence ha^hought fit to difcover of that Pare 
may be.perfci^tly kjjown* 
;., '■• 

3' - The 



['?•] 



The Difcoverles in the Scripture whichead 
to this, are innumerable ,* but the pofitive Decla- 
ration of it feems to be declined. W"hen our Sa- 
viour walking on the Sea frighted his Dlfciples^ 
and they cried out^ what do we iind terrify 'd 
them ? Truly, they thought they had feen a Spi- 
rit. One would have thought fuch Men as they, 
who had the Vifion of God manifefl in the FlejJy^ 
Ihould not have been {o much furpriz'd, if they 
had feen a Spirit, that is to Ca,yyfeen an Apparition; 
for to fee a Spirit^ feems to be an Allufion, not 
an ExprefHon to be us^d literally, a Spirit being 
not vifible by the Organ of human Sight. 

, But what if it had been a Spirit? if it had 
been a good Spirit, what had they to fear? And 
if a bad Spirit, what would crying out have af- 
filed them ? When People cry out in fuch Cafe^^' 
it is either for Help, and then they cry to others; 
or for Mercy, and then they cry to the Subjed 
of their Terror to fpare them. Either Way it 
was either the fooliiheft, or the vVickedeft Thing 
that ever was done by fuch grave Men as the 
Apoftles ', for if it was a good Spirit, as before ; 
they had no Need to cry out; and if it was a bad 
one, who did they cry to? For 'tis evident they 
did not pray to God, or crofs and biefs them-^ 
felves, as v/as afterwards the FaOiion; but they 
cried out, that is to fay, they either cried out for 
Help, which was great Nonfenfe, to call to Man 
for Help againft the Devil ,* or they cried to the 
Spirit they faw, that it might not hurt them^ 
which was, in fhort, neither lefs, or more, than 
praying to the Devil. 

This put me in Mind of the poor Savages in 
many of the Countries o^ America and Africa, who 
really inflruded by their Fear, that is to fay, by 
meet Nature, worfcip the Devjl^ that he may not 
hurt them, A^ Here 



[4] 



Here I itiuft dlgrefs a little, and make a Trait- 
fition from the Story of a Spirit, to the ftrange 
Abfurdities of Mens Notions at that Time ; and 
particularly, ot thofe updn wh5m the firft Im- 
preffions of Chrift's Preachings were' wrought, 
and if it be look'd narroWly into, one cannot but 
wonder what flrange ignorant People, "even the 
Difciples themfelves were, at firft ; and indeed 
their Ignorance continued a great while, even 
to after the Death of Cfi rift himfelf j witnefs the 
ifoolifh Talk of the two Difciples going to Emam, 
It is true they were wifer afterwards when they 
Were better taught ; but the Scripture is full of 
the Difcoveries of their Ignorance y as in the No- 
tions of fitting at his Right-hand and his Left, m 
his Kingdom, ask'd for by Zehedees Children ,* no 
doubt but the good Woman their Mother thought 
one of her Sons fliould be Lord TreafUrer there, 
and the t'other Lord Chancellor, and fhe could 
not but think thofe Places their Due, when fhe 
faw them in fuch Favour with him here. Juft fo 
in their Notion of feeing a Spirit here, which 
put them into fuch a Fright, and indeed they 
might be faid, according to our dull Way of 
Talking, to be frighted out of their Wits; For 
had their Senfes been in Exercife, they would ei^ 
ther have rejoic'd in the Appearance of a good 
Angela and ftood ftill to hear his MefTage, as 
from Heaven ; or prayM to God to deliver them 
out of the Hands of the Devil, on their fuppofing 
it, as above, to be a Vifion from Hell. 

But I come to the Subjed. It is evident that 
the Notion of Spirits, and their intermeddling 
with the Affairs of Men, and even of their ap- 
pearing t(j Men, preVaird fo univerfally in thofe 
Ages of the Worldj that even God's own People, 
who were iiiftrudcd from himfclf, believ'd it* 

not 



[5] 

nox is there any Thing in all the Old Teftament 
Inlllitution to contradid it, tho' many Things 
to confirm it; fuch particularly, as the Law 
againft what is eall'da familiar Spirit, which 
was efleem'd no better ©r worfe than a conver- 
fing with the Devil, that is to fay, with fome 
of the evil Spirits of the World I fpeak of. 

The Witch of ^Wor, and the Story of an Ap- 
parition of an old Man pcrfon3.ting Sa?nuelj' which 
is (o plainly afferted in Scripture, and which the 
learned Oppofers of thcfc Notions have fpent fo 
much weak Pains to diflurb our Imaginations 
about, yet afl'ure us, that fuch Apparitions are 
not inconfiftenc with Nature, or with Religion j 
nay, the Scripture allows this Woman to Paic waw, 
as' the Indians in America call it, and con/ure for 
the raifing this Spcdre, and when it is come, al- 
lows it to fpeak a great prophetick Truth, fore- 
telling the King in all its terrible Particulars what 
was to happen to him^ and what did befal hini 
the very next Day. 

Either this Appearance mufl be a good Spirit,' 
or a bad ; if it was a good Spirit, it was aa 
Angel, as it is exprefs'd in another Place of the 
Apoflle Fetevy when he knocked at the good 
People's Door in Jerafalem^ABs xii.15. and then it 
fnpports my Opinion of the Spirits unembodied 
converfing with, and taking Care of the Spirits 
embodied ; if it was an evil Spirit, then they 
mufl grant God to be making a Prophet of the 
Devil, and making him perfonate Samuel to fore t el 
Things to come ; permitting Sathan to fpeak in the 
firft Perfon of God's own Prophet, and indeed to 
preach the Juftice of God's Dealing with Saul:, for 
ieje&ing his Prophet Samuel; which itk fliort, is not 
^ little odd, putting the Spirit of G'&d into the 

A3 Moutii 



[<5] 

Mauth of the I)€vil, , and making Sathan ^ 
Preacher of RfghteGurnefs. .- 

When I was in my Retirement, I had a-e 
biindance pf flrange Notions of my feeing Ap- 
paritions there, and efpeciaily when I hap- 
pen^'d to be abroad by Moon- fhine, wiien every 
Bufh Icok'd like a Man, and every Tree like a. 
J»^an on Horfe- back ;. and I fo prepoflefs'd my 
felf with it, that I fcarce durft look behind me 
for a good while, and aft^r that durfl; not go a- 
broad at ail at Night ; nay, it grew upon me to 
fi^ch a Degree at iaft, that I as" firmly believ'd I 
faw feveral Times real Shapes and Appearances, 
as I do now reaily believe and am aflur'd, that it; 
was all Hypochondriack Delufion. 

But however, that the Reader may fee how 
far the. Power of Imagination may go, and judge 
for me whether I fiiew'd any more Folly and Sim- 
plicity; j-h^n other Men might do, I'll repeat fome 
Utile Pillages, which for a while gave me very 
great Diiiurbances^ and every one fhall judge fot 
me, whether they might not have been deluded in 
|:he like Circumftances as well as I. 
^ r The firft Cafewas, when I crept into the dark 
Cave in the Valley, where the old Goat lay juft 
^xpk'mgj whiph, wherever it happened, is a true 
Hiiiory, I atfar^; you. 

When firil I wa^i ftopp'd by the Noife of this 
poor dying Cregture, you are to obferve, that 
the- Voice was npc only like the Voice of a Man, 
but even articulate, only that I could not form 
any Words' from it,- ^nd what did that amount to 
jnotei-p.r lefs than this, n4mely, that it fpoke, 
but only it was in a Language that I did noi: un- 
derftand. It it was poifible to defcribe the Sur- 
pri{e(5)f my, Spirits on that Occafion, I would do 
It hcicjt'y how all my Blood tnn^orrat/^erJioodflU/, 

chilld 



. f 7] 

clijird m my Veins-, how a cold Dew of Sweat 
fat on my Forehead i how my Joints, like Beljlazr 
t>ar\ Knees, fhook one againft another j and how, 
as I faid, my Hair would have lifted off my Hat, 
it' I had had one on my Head. 

But this \^ not all. After the firft Noife of the 
Creature which was a faint dying Kind of imper- 
fed Bleating, not unufual, as I found afterward ; I 
fay, after this, he fetch'd two or three deep ^i^\^ 
^s lively, and as like human, as it is poflible to 
imagine, as I have alfo faid. , '" V " , . 

Thefe were fo many ConfirmatiDtis^'oPtriy Sur- 
prize, befides the Sight of his two glaring Eyes, 
and carried it up to the Extreme of Fright and 
Amazement; how I afterwards conquered this 
childifb Beginning, and muflerM up Courage e- 
nough to go into the Place with a Firebrand for 
Light,- and how I was prefently fatisfy'd' with 
feeing the Creature whofe Condition made' all 'the 
little accidental Noifes appear rational, I have 
already faid. ^^''''•', '' 

Burl mufl acknowledge, that this real Surprize 
left fome Relicks or Remains behind it^ that did 
not wear quite off a great while, tho'Iiiruggl'd hard 
with them : The Vapours that v/ere raisM at firfc 
were never fo laid, but that on every trifling Oc- 
^afion they return^'d j and Ifaw, nay, I felt Ap- 
paritions, as plainly and diflindily as ever I felt 
pr faw any real Subftance iw my Life. 

The like was the Cafe with me before that, 
when I firft found the Print of a Man's Foot up- 
on the Sand, by the Seaiide on the North Fart of 
thelfland. - 1 nyin^3. 

And thefe, I fay, having left my Fancy a litt'e 
peeviili and wayward^ I had frequently fome Re- 
turns of thefe Vapours on difiering Occafions, 
and fometimes even without Occalion; nothing 
A 4 but 



[8] 

but meet Hypochondriack Whimfies, fluttering of 
the Blood, and rifing of Vapours, which nobody 
could give any Account of but myfelf. 

For Example : It was oneNight, after my having 
fecn feme odd Appearances in the Air, of no great 
Significance, that coining home and being in Bed, 
but not afleep, I felt a Pain in one of my Feet ; afc 
ter which it came to a kind of Numb dnefs in my 
Foot, which a little furpriz'd me, and after that, a, 
kind of Tingling in my Blood, as if it had been 
fome Diftemper running up my Leg. 

On a fudden I felt, as it were, fomething alive 
lye upon me, as if it had been a Dog lying upr 
on my Bed, from my Knee downwards about half 
Way my Leg, and immediately afterwards I felt 
it heavier, and felt it as plainly roll icfelf upon me 
upwards upon my Thigh, for I lay on one Side ; 
I fay, as if it bad been a Creature lying upon mc 
-with all his Weight, and turning his Body upon 
me. 

It was fo lively and fenfible to me, and I re- 
iperaber it h perfedly wpU, though it is now 
many Years ago, that my Blood chill? and flutters 
about my Heart at the very writing it. I imme- 
diately flung my felf out of my I3ed, and flew to 
my Mufquet, which flood always ready at my 
Hand, and, nal;ed as I was, laid about me upon 
the Bed in the dark, and every where elfe that I 
could think of where any Body might fland or lye, 
but could find nothing. Lord deliver me from an 
evil Spirit, faid I! What can this be ? And being 
tired with groping abput, and having broke twp 
or three of my Earthen Pots with making Blows 
here and there to no Purpofe, I went to light my 
Candle, for my Lamp which I us'd to burn in the 
Night, either had not been lighted, or was gon? 

Wheq 



[9] 



When 1 lighted a Candle, I could eafily fee 
there was no living Creature in the Place with 
me, but the poor Parrot, who was wak'd and 
frighted, and cry'd out. Hold your Tongue^ and, 
What^s the Matter with you ? Which Words he 
learn'd of me, from my frequent frying fo to him, 
when he ufed to make his ordinary wild Noife and 
Screaming that I did not like. 

The more I was fatisfy'd that there was nothing 
in the Room, at leaft to be feen> the more another 
Concern came upon me. Lord ! fays / aloudy this 
is the Devil. Hold your Tongue, fays Ppll. I was 
fo mad at the Bird, tho* the Creature knew no- 
thing of the Matter, that if he had hung near 
ynp, I believe I fhould have killed him. I put my 
Clothes on, and fat me down, for I could not find 
in my Heart to go to Bed again ; and as J fat 
down, / am terribly frighted, faid I. Whales the 
Matter with you"^ fays Poll. You Toad, faid I, Td 
knock your Brains out if you were here. Hjldyour 
'tongue, fays he again, and then fell to chatterin^^, 
Robin Crufoe, and. Poor jRobin Crufoe, as he us'd 
to do. 

Had I been in any Reach of a good Temper, it 
had been enough to have compofed me ^ but I 
was quite gone, I was fully poffefs'd with a Belief, 
that it was the Devil, and I pray^'d mod: heartily 
to God, to be delivered from the Power of the 
^vil Spirit. 

After fome Time, I compofed my felf a little, 
and went to Bed again, and lying juft in the Po- 
flure as I was in before, I felt a little of the Ting- 
ling in my Blood which I felt before, and I re- 
folv'd to lye fliil, let it be what it would ; it 
came up as high as my Knee, as before, but no 
higher ; and now I began to fee plainly that it was 
ill ^Piikmperp that it; was fomethipg Paralitick, 
^'' ■ ' ' ' and 



[ lO ] 

and that affeacd the Nerves ; but I had not ei- 
ther Experience of fuch a thing, or Knowledge 
of Difcafess, enough to be fully fatisfy'd of the Na- 
ture of them, ^nd whether any thing natural, any 
Nurabednefs or Dead Palfie affeding one Part of 
theThigh,cou]d feel as that did i till fome Months 
aker that, I felt fomcthing of the very fame again 
at my firll lying down in my Bed for three or four 
Nights together, which at firft gave me a little Con- 
cern as a Diftemper, but at laft gave me fuch Sa- 
tisfaction, that the firft was nothing but the' fame 
thing in a- higher Degree ,* that the Pkafure of 
knowing k was only a I)ik^k, was far beyond the 
Concern at the Danger ofit;j Th'o' a dead Palfie 
to one in my Condition might reafon ably have been 
one of the raoft frightful Things in Nature ,* fince 
having no body to help me, I mufl have inevitably 
perifh'd for meer Vyant of Food;, not being able to 
go from Place to Place to fetch ft.; ^H^^^'^^ ^^ 

Bur to go back to the C^fe iti-Haiid', and to 
the Apprehenfion I had been in; all the feveral 
Months that pals'd between the finl; of this and 
the laft, I went about with a melancholy heavy 
Heart, fully fatisfy'd that tlie Devil had been in 
my Rooin, and lay'tipon my Bed. 
• • Sometimes I w6uld trye to argue my felf a little 
out of it, asking my felf. Whether it was reafon- 
able to imagine the Devil had nothing elfe to do 
than to come thither, and only lye down upon 
Hie, and go away about his Bufinefs, and fay not 
one Word tome ? V/hat End it could anfwcr ? and 
whether I thought the Devil was really bufy'd 
about fuch Trifles ? Or whether he had not Em- 
ployment enough of a higher Nature, fo that fuch 
a Thing as that could be worth his while ? 

But fiill then I was anfwer'd with my own 
Thoughts, returning thus. What could it be ? Or, 

if 



if It was not a Devil, what was it ? This I could 
not anfwer by any Means at all i and fo I ftill funk 
under the Be.ief, that it was the DeviJ^ aad no- 
thing but the Devil. ,; vrr 

You may be fure, while I had this Fancy iri rtiy 
Head, I was of Courfe over-run with the Vapours^^ 
and had all the Hypochondriack Fancies that eyei 
^ny melancholy Head could entertain ; and what; 
with ruminating on the Print of a Foot upon the 
Sand, and the Weight of the Devil upon me in my 
Bed, I made no Difficulty to conclude,that the Old 
Gentleman really vifited the Place j and in a VVor4* 
it had been eaiy to have poffefs'd nie, if I had con- 
tinued fo much longer, that it was an enchanted. 
Ifland, that there were a Million of evil Spirits i^^ 
it, and that the Devil w as Lord of the Manor. 
. I fcarce heard the leaft Noiftj near or far of^ 
but I darted^ and tx^zditd to fee a Devil; every 
diftant Bulh upon a Hill, if I did not particularly 
remeniber it before, was a Man, and every Stump, 
an Apparition ; and I fcarce went twenty Yards 
together by Night or by Day, without looking 
behind me. 

Sometimes indeed I took a little Heart, and 
would fay welly let it be the Devil if it will, God 
is Mafler of the Devily and he can do me no Hurt, 
unlefs he is permitted i he can be no where, but 
he that made him is there too ; and as I faid after- 
wards, when I was frighted with the old Goat 
in a Cave, he is not fit to live all alone in fuch an 
Ifland for 20 Years that would be afraid to fee the 
Dedl. 

But all thefe Things lafted but a fhort while, 
gnd the Vapours that were raifed at firft, were not 
to be laid fo eafily ; for, in a Word, it was not 
meer Imagination, but it was the Imagination 
ras'd up to Difeafe : Nor did it ever quite wear 

off 



off till I got my Main Fiyday with me, of whom 
I have faid fo much ; and then having Company 
to talk to, the Hypo wore off, and I did not fee 
any more Devils after that. 

Before I leave this Part, I cannot but give a Cau- 
tion to all vapourifi melancholy People, whofc I- 
maginations run this Way^ I mean, about feeing 
the Devil, Apparitions, andthehke; namely, that 
they fhould never look behind them, and over their 
Shoulders as they go up Stairs, or look into thp 
Corners and Holes of Rooms with a Candle in 
their Hands, or turn about to fee who may be be- 
hind them in any Walks or dark Fields, Lanes, or 
the like ; for let ftch know-^ they will fee the Devil 
whether he be there or no ,• nay, they will be fo. 
perfwaded, that they do fee him, that their very 
imagination will be a Devil to them where-eyer 
they go. 

But after all this is faid, let nobody fuggeft, 
that jjecaufe the brain-fick Fancy, the vapourifh 
Hypochondriack Imagination reprefents Spe(5lres 
and Spirits to us, and makes Apparitions for us, 
that therefore there are no fuch Things as Spirits 
both good and evil, any more than we fhould con- 
ceive that there is noDevil, becaufe we do not 
fee him. 

The Devil hasWitneffes of his Being and Na- 
ture, )uft as God himfclf has of his; they are not 
indeed fo vifible or fo numerous, but we are all 
able to bring Evidence of the Exiflence of the 
JDevil from our own Frailties, as we are to bring 
Evidence ot the Exiriepce of God from the Facul- 
ties of our Souls, and from the Contexture of our 
Bodies. 

As our Propenfity to Evil rather than Good, Is 
a Tcftilnony of the original Depraviry of human 
Mature ; io the Harmony between the Inclination 

anti 



Ind the Occafion, is a Teftimony which leaveai 
the Prefence of the evil Spkk with uS out of Q_ue- 

ftion. 

Not that the Devil is always the Agent in btif 
Temptations ; idr tho' the Devil is a very dili-^ 
gent Fellow, and always appears ready to fall 
in with the Allurement, yet the Scripture clears 
him, and we muft do fo too, of being the main 
Tempter ; 'tis our own corrupt debaucl/d In- 
clination which is the firft moving Agent j iand 
therefore the Scripture fays, A Man is tempted 
\uhsn he is dra'xn dvjaj of his oum Lufis^ and enticed,, 
The Devil who^ as I faid, is a very diligent t'el- 
low ill the infernal Work, and is always ready t6 
Forward the Mifchief, is alfo a very'^ cutining 
Fellow^ and knows how mofl dextroufly to fuit 
alluring Obj'efts to the allurable Difpofitiohs > t6 
procure enfnariiig Things, and lay theni ih tht 
Way of the Man whom he finds fo eafy to be en- 
fnar d> and he never fails to prompt all the Mif- 
chief he can, full of Stratageni and Art t6 en* 
fiiare us by the Help of our corrupt AfFedionSj 
^ad^hefw are call'd Sathans Devices. 
X Biit having charg'd Sathan home in that Paft> 
I 'muft do the Devil that Juftice, as to own, th^t 
he is the moft flander'd, mod abus'd Creature 
alive j Thoufands of Crimes we lay to his Chatg^ 
that he is not guilty of j Thoufands of our bwri 
Infirmities we load him with which he has iid 
Hand in ; and Thbufahds of our Sins, which^ ja§ 
bad as he is^, he knows nothing of; calling him 
our Tempter, and pretending we did fo and fo> 
as the Devil would have ity when on the contrary 
the Devil had no Share in it, and we were only 
led away of our own Luflsy and enticed. 

But now, hailing made this DigreiSion in th^ 
Dwvii's Dwtence, I return to the main QLieftioti^ that 



[Hi' 

btthc Being of the Devil, and of evil Spirits > thi^^ 
1 believe, there is no Room to doubt of; but this, 
as I have obferv'd, is not the Thing; thcfe are 
Ihot the Spirits I am fpeaking of, but I fhall come 
jdiredly to what I mean, and fpeak plain without 
any PolTibility of being mifunderfloodi > 

. I make no Qiieftion, but that therein nbt only 
a World of Spirits, but that there is a certaiil 
Knowledge of it^ tho"* to us iitipoffible as to the 
Mannerof it; there is a certain Converfe between 
the World of Spirits, and the Spirits in thi$ 
World ; that is to fay, between Spirits uncafed or 
unembodyM, an^ Souls of Men embodyM or cafed 
iip in Flefh and Blood,as we ail are on this fide Death. 
It is true, that we cannot defcribe this Con- 
verfe of Spirits, as to the Way of it, the Manner 
bf the Conimunication, or how things are mutu- 
ally convey 'd frbm one to another. How Intelli- 
gences are given or receiv'd we know not ; we 
know but little of their being convey 'd this IVay^ 
from the Spirits unembody'd, to ours that are in 
Life ; and of their being convey 'd that Way^ name- 
ly, from us to them ; of that we know nothing : 
The latter certainly is done without the Help of 
the Organ, the former is conveyed by the Under- 
fianding, and the retirM Faculties of the Soul, of 
ivhich we can give very little Account. 

For Spirits^ without the help of Voiciy converfe. 

Let me, however, give, as Reafons for my Opi- 
nion, fome Account of the Confequences of thi§ 
Converfe of Spirits ; I mean fuch as are quite re- 
mote from what we call Apparition or Appearance 
of Spirits ; and I omit thcfe, becaufe I know they 
are objected much againft, and they bear much 
Scandal from the frequent Impofitions of our Fan- 
cies 



[ i5 ] 



eies and Imaginations upon opr Juclgments and 
UnderftandingSi as above. '' '^;,'''-'' 

But the more particular Difcovisrf^s of 'this Con- 
verfe of Spirits, and which to me are imdeniab.'ej 
are fueh as follows j namely, 

Dreams3 Impulfes, Involuntary Sad- 

Voices^ Hints, '---^nefs, dr^. 

Noifes, Apprehenfiot^s^'' '-'' 

Breams are dangerous Things to talk of,- and 
we have fuch dreaming about them, that indeed' 
the leaft Encouragement to lay any Weight upod 
'em, is prefently carry'd away by a fort of People 
that dream waking ; and that run into fuch wild 
Extreams about them, that indeed w6 ought to 
be very cautious what we fay of them. 

It is certain, Dreams of old were the Ways by 
which God himfelf was plcafed to warn Men, as 
well what to do, as what not to do ; what Set- 
vices to perform, what Evils to fbiin. Jofsph, the 
Husband of the Bl^fled Virgin Mary, was ap- 
pear'd to in both thefe, Matt. ii/i^. ip. He was 
direded of God, in a Dream, to go into Egyp^ 
and he was bid return out of Egypt in a Dream j 
and in the fame Chapter, the Wife-men of the 
Eaft were warn d of God in a Dream, to depart into 
their own Country another Way, to avoid the 
Fury of Herod. 

Now as this, and innumerable Inftances thro^ the 
whole Scripture, confirm, that God did once make 
life of this Manner to convey Knowledge and In- 
itrudion to Men, I wifli I could have this Qi.e- 
ft ion well anfwerM, (viz..) Why are zjje Jtow to di-^ 
teci People to take m Notice ofth^ir Dreams i 

Bui 



£ i<5 ] 

But farther, it appears that this was not only' 
the Method God himfelf took by his immediate 
Power, but 'tis evident he made ufe ofit by the 
Miniftry of Spirits ; the Scripture fays in both the 
Cafes ofjofeph above-nam'd, Tha,t the Angel of the 
Lord appea/d to Jofeph in a Dream, Now every 
iinembodyM Spirit is an Angel of the Lord in 
fome Senfe, and, as Angels and Spirits may be the 
fame thing in refpeft of this Influence upon us in 
Dreams, fo it is ftill i and when any Notice for 
Good, or Warning againft Evil, is given us in a 
Dream, I think "'tis no Arrogance at all for us to 
fay, the Angel of the Lord appearM to us in a 
Dream j or to fay, fome good Spirit gave me 
Warning of this in a Dream ; take this which 
Way you will. 

That 1 may fupport this with fuch undeniable 
'Arguments, drawn from Examples of the Fad, as 
no Man will, or reafonably can oppofe, I firft ap- 
peal to the Experience of obferving People j I 
mean fuch People as obferve thefe things without 
a fuperftitious Dependence upon the Signification 
of them, that look upon Dreams but with fuch 
a moderate Regard to them, as may dired to a 
tight Ufe of them : The Queftion I would ask of 
fuch isy Whether they have never found any re- 
jnarkable Event of their Lives fo evidently fore- 
told them by a Dream, as that it muft of Necef- 
fity be tfue> that fome invifible Being forefaw the 
Event, and gave them Notice of ic ? And that 
had that Notice been liften'd to, and the natural 
prudence ufed^ which would have been ufed if it 
had been certainly difcovered, that evil Event 
might have been prevented ? 

I would ask others, whether they have not, by 
Dreams, been fo warn'd of Evil really approach- 
ing, as that taking the Hint, and making ufe of 



ttie Caution given in thofe Dreams the Evil ha§ 
b'een avoided. If I may fpeak my own Expe- 
rience, 1 mufl; take leave to Tay, That I never had 
any capital Mifchief befel me in my Life, but I 
have had Notice of it by a Dream , and if I had 
not been that thoughtlefs unbelieving CreaturCj 
which I now would caution other; People againft, 
I might have taken niany a Warning, and avoided 
many of the Evils that I afterwards fell into, 
merely by a total oBftinate Negle(3: of thofe 
Dreams. 

In like Manner, I have in fome of the greatefl 
Diftreflcs of my Life, been encouraged to believd 
firmly and Fully, that I fiiould one Time or othet 
be delivered ; and I mufl acknowledge, that iri my 
greatefl and mofl hopelefs Banifhment, I h^d fuch 
frequent Dreams of my Deliverance, that I al-^ 
ways entertained a firm and fatisfying Belief, that 
my lafl Days would be better than my firflj all 
which has efeSually come to pafs. 

From which I cannot determine, as IknowfoTHi 
do, that all Dreams are meer Dofings of a deli^ 
rious Heady Delufions of a waking Devil, and Re« 
lifts of the Day's Thoughts, and Perplexities, 
or Pleafures : Nor do I fee any Period of Time 
fixed between the two dppofite Circum fiances i 
namely, when Dr,eanis were to be efleemed th^ 
Voice of God, and when the Delufion of the 
Devil. 

I know fbme have flruggled hard to fix that 
particular Article, and to fettle it as a Thing go- 
ing hand in hand with th^Jewifi Inflitutions j as if 
the Oracle cealing in the Temple with the Con- 
fommation of the typical Law, all the Methods 
which Heaven Was pleafed to take in the former 
Times for revealing his Will to Men, were to ceafe 
glfo at the fame Time, and the- Gofpel Revela^ 

B b xiotx 



tion being fully and effedually fnpplled by the 
MilTion cf the Holy Spirit, Dreams and all the 
Ufes and Significations of Dreams were at an 
End, and the Efteem and Regard to the Warn- 
ings and Inftrudions of Dreams was to expire 
alfo. 

But the Scripture is Point-blank againfl: this, 
in the Hiflory of Fad relating to Ananias^ and 
the Converiion of St. Paul -^ and in the Story of 
St. Peter and Cornelius the devout Centurion at 
Anticch ', both of them eminent Inftances of God's 
giving Notice of his Pleafure to Men, by the In- 
terpoiitioh or Medium of a Dream. The firfl: of 
thefe h Iw ABs ix. lo. There was a certain Dif- 
ciple at Damafcus named Ananias, lo him /aid the 
Lord in a Vifiony See. the Words fpokeh in this Vi- 
fion to AnaniaSy direding to go to feek out one 
Saul of Tdrfusy go on thus ^'. 12. And hath feen in 
a Vifiony a Man named Ananias coming im 

The other Paflage is of St. Peter and Cornelius 
the Centurion, Acls 10. 1;. 3, 10, u. m the third 
Verfe it is faid, Cornelius Fafting and Praying, 
/^lu a Vifion^ which afterwards in the 2 2d Verle, 
is called an holy Angel voaminghimy in the 30th 
Verfe it is faid, a Man flood before me in bright 
Cloathingi at the fame Time, v. 10. it is faid, 
St. Peter was Praying and fell into a Trance j this 
we all agree to be a Pofleffion of Sleep or a deep 
Sleep ; and in this Traunce 'tis faid, he faw Hea- 
ven opened, that is to faV:, he dreamed that he faw 
Heaven opened ; it could be nothing elfe 3 for 
no Interpreters will offer to infift that Heaven 
was really opened ; alfo the hearing a Voice, "i^-.is, 
15. muft be in a Dream,* thus 'tis apparent the 
Will of God concerning what we are to do or not 
to do, what is or is not to befal us, is and has 
been thus conveyed by Vifion or Dre.im; fincethe

When then did it ceafe ? and if we do not 
know when it ceafed, how then are we fiire k i$ 
kt all cealed, and what Authority have we now 
to rejed all Dreams or Vifioris of the Night, as thsy 
are called^ inore than formerly ? 

I will not fay, but there may be more nodur- 
nal Dekifions now m the World, than there were 
m thofe Times ; and perhaps the T)z\i\ may have 
gain'd more upon Mankind in thefe Days, than 
he had then, though we are not let into thofe 
Things enough, to know whether it is io or not; 
nor do we know, that there were not as many un- 
fignifying Dreams in thofe Days as now, and per- 
haps as much to be faid againfl: depending upon 
them ; though I think there is not one Word iti 
Scripture faid, to take off the Regard Men might 
give to Dreams, or to leflen the Weight whicli 
they might lay on them. 

The only Text that I think looks like it, is the 
Flout Jofeph's Brethren put upon him, or threw^ 
out at him, when they were fpeaking of him with 
Contempt, Genefis i^xxvii. ip. Behold this Dreamer 
cometh ; and again, v. 20. Let us flay him and cafi 
him into fome Pit^ and we ihall fee what will be^^ 
come of his Dreams. 

This indeed looks a little like the prefent Lan-' 
guage againft Dreams •, but even this,is fufEciently- 
rebuked in the Confequences, for thofe Dreams of 
Jofefh's did come all to pafs, and proving the fu- 
perior Influence fuch Things have upon the Affairs 
of Men, in fpight of all the Contempt th^y caa 
caft upon them. 

The Maxim I have laid dov/n to my felf for 
ttiy Condua: in this Affair is in few Words, thac

we Ihould not lay too great Strefs upon Dreams, 
and yet not wholly negleft them. 

I remember, I was once prefent, where a long 
Pifpute was warmly carried on between two 
Perfons of my Acquaintance upon this very Sub- 
jed, the one a Layman, the other a Clergyman, 
but both very pious and religious Perfons : The 
firfl: thought there was no heed at all to be 
given to Dreams, that they could have no jufti- 
fiable Original, that they were Delufions and no 
more, that it was Atheiftical to lay any Strefs up- 
on them, and that he could give fuch Objedions 
againft them, as that no Man of good Principles 
could avoid being convinced by \ that as to their 
being a Communication from the invifible to the 
vifible World, 'twas a Chimsera, and that he faw 
no Foundation for believing any Reality in fuch a 
Thing, unlefs I would fet up for a Popifh Limhus 
or Purgatory, which had no Foundation in the 
Scripture. 

I. He faid, If Dreams were from the Agency 
of any prefcient Being, the Notices would be 
more direct, and the Difcoveries clear i not by 
Allegories and emblematick Fancies, exprelTing 
Things imperfe{5l and dark : For to what Purpofe 
Ihould Spirits un-embodied fport with Mankind, 
warning him of approaching Mifchiefs by the 
moft ridiculous Enigmas, Figures, e^Tc. leaving 
the Wretch to guefs what awaited him, though 
of the utmoft Confequence, and to perifh if 
he miflook the Meaning of it ; and leaving 
him fometimes perfedlly at a Lofs, to know 
whether he was Right or Wrong, and without any 
Rule or Guide to walk by m the moft difficult 
Cafes. 

^^ 7. He 



[11 ] 

2. He objefted, that with the Notice of Evil, 
luppofe it to be rightly underflcod, there was not 
given a Power to avoid it ; and therefore it could 
not be alledged, that the Notice, was any way 
kind, and that it was not likely to proceed from a 
beneficent Spirit, but meerly Fortuitous and of 
no Significancy. 

3. He objeded. That if fuch Notices as thofe 
were of fuch Weight, why were they not Con- 
flant : But that fomecimes they were given, and 
fometimes omitted, though Cafes were equally 
ijnportant; and that therefore they did not feem 
tp proceed from any Agent, whofe Adions were 
to be fairly accounted for. 

4. He faid. That oftentimes we had very di- 
{kind: and formal Dreams, without any Significa- 
tion at all, that we couid neither know any Thing 
probable or any Thing rational of them ; and that 
it would be profane to fuggeft that to come from. 
Heaven, which was too apparently foolifh and 
inconfiftent. 

5. As Men were not always thus warned, or 
fupplied with Notices of Good or i^vil, fo all 
Men were not alike fupplied with them; and 
what Reafon could we give, why one Man or one 
Woman (hould not have the fame Hints as ano- 
ther. 

The Clergyman gave diftinct Anfwers to all 
thefe Obje(5tions, and to me, I confefs, very 
fatisfadory ; whether they may be fo to thofe that 
read them, is no Concern of mine^ lee every one 
judge for hirnf^lf. 

I. He faid, that as to the Signification of 
Dreams, and the Qbj'edions againPc them, be- 
caufe dark and doubtful, that they are exprefs'd 
generally by Hieroglyphical Reprefentations, Si- 
milies, Ailufions, and figurative emblematick 

B b 3 X\hys ■ 



[Ill 

Ways of expreffing Things was tme, and that 
by this MeanSj for want of Interpretation, the 
Thing was not underllood, and confequently the 
Evil not fhun'd. This, he faid, was the only 
Difficulty that remained to him in the Cafe, but 
that he could fee nothing in it againft the Sig- 
nification of thein, becaufc thus it was, be . 
fore ', for Drean:is were often allegorick and alki- 
five, when they were evidently from God ; and 
what the End and Defign of Providence in that 
was, we could not pretend to enquire. 

2. To the Second he faid, ' u'^ charged Godfoo- 
lijhly, to fay he had given the Notice of Evil 
without the Power to a'L^oid it, 'which he denied j 
and affirmed, that if any one had not Power to 
avoid the Evil, it was no Notice to him, that it 
t?vas want of giving due Heed to that Notice, 
not for want of the Notice being fufficient that, 
any Evil followed, and that Men firil negleded 
themfelves, and then charged the Judge of all the 
Earth with not doing right. 

2. Likewife he faid,the Complaint that thefe no- 
tices were not conftant, was unjuft, for he doubt- 
ed not but they were (oy but our difcerning was 
crazed and clouded by our Negligence in not tak- 
ing due Notice of it, that we hoodwink^'d our 
Underftanding by pretending Dreams were not to 
be regarded ; and the Voice really fpoke, but v^e 
refufed to hear being negligent of our own Goodo 

4. In the fame Senfe he anfwered the Fourth, 
and faid, it was a Miflake to fay, that fometimes 
Dreams had no Import at all, he faid it was only 
to be faid, none that ue could perceive the Rea- 
fon of, which was owing to our Blindnefs and fu- 
pine Neghgence to be fecure at one Time, and 
our Heads too much alarmed at another ,• fo that 
the Spirit which we might be hid to be conver- 

iing 



[ ^3 ] 

ling with in a Dream, was conflantly and equal- 
ly kind and careful, but our Powers, not always in 
the fame State of Adion, nor equally attentive 
to, or retentive of the Hints that were given ; or 
Things niight be rendred more or lefs iotelhgible 
to us, as the Povyers of our Soul were more or lefs 
doz'd or fomniated with the OpprelTion of Va- 
pours from the Body, which occaiions Sleep ; for 
tho' the Soul cannot be faid to deep itfel^, yet 
how far its Operations may be limited, and the 
Underftanding perfcribed by the Sleepinefs of the 
Body, fays he, I will not undertake, let the Ana- 
tomift judge of it, who can account for the Con- 
texture of the Parts, and for their Operations^ 
which I cannot anfwer to. 

5. As to the laft Qiieilion, why People are not 
equally fupplied with fuch Warnings, he faid, this 
feem'd to, be no QLieflion at ail in the Cafe ; for 
Providence itfelf might have fome Share in the 
Diredion of it, and then that Providence might 
perhaps be limited by fome fuperiour Diredion, 
the fame that guides all the folemn Difpoiitions oi 
"Nature, and was a Wind blowing where it lifr- 
eth : that as to the Converfe of Spirits, tho^ he 
allowed the Thing itfelf, yet he did not tie it op 
to a ftated Courie oi Converfing, that it ihould 
be the fame always, and to all People, and on all 
Occafions ^ but that it feem'd to be fpontaneousj 
and confcquently Arbitrary, as if the Spirits 
unembodicd had it left to them to converle as " 
they thought fit, how, v/here, and with whom 
they would ; that all he anfwered for in that Dif- 
courfe was for the Thing itfelf, that fuch a Thing 
there was, but why there was fo much of It^ or 
why no more, was none of his Bufinefs, and he 
believed a Difcovery was not yet made to Man- 
kind of that Part. 

B b 4 I thought 



[ H ] 

I thought it would be much to the Purppfe to 
remark this Opinion of another Man, becaufe it 
eorrefponded foexadly with my own, but I have 
Hot done with my Friend, for he led me mto a- 
riother Enquiry, which indeed I had not taken 
fo much notice of before, and this was introdu- 
ced by the following Qiieflion. 

You feem, fays he, to be very inquidtive about 
Dreams, and to doubt, tho' I think you have. no. 
Reafonforit, of the Reality of the World of Spi- 
rits, which Dreams are fuch an Evidence of. Pray, 
fays he, what think you of waking Dreams, Tran- 
fes, Vifions, Noifes, Voices, Hints, Impulf^s, 
and all thefe waking Teftimonies of an invifible 
World, and of the Communication that there is 
between ns and them, which are generally enter- 
tained with our Eyes open. 

This led me into many Reflexions upon paft 
Things, which I had been Witnefs to as well in 
myfelfas in other People, and particularly in my 
former Solitudes, when I had many Occafions to 
mark fuch Things as thefe ; and I could not but 
entertain a free Converfation with my Friend up- 
on this Subjed, as often as I had Opportunity, 
of which I mufl: give fome Account. 

I had one Day been converfing fo long with 
him upon the common received Notions of the 
Planets being habitable, and of a Diverfity of 
Worlds, that 1 think verily, I was for fome Days 
like a Man tranfported into thefe Regions myfelf^ 
whether my Imagination is more addided to reai- 
li.zing the Things I talk of, as if they were in 
View, I know not ; or whether by the Power of 
the Converfe of Spirits I fpeak of, I was at that 
Time enabled to entertain clearer Ideas of the 
Invifible World, 1 really cannot tell h but I cer- 
tainly made a Journey to all rhofe fnppofed ha- 
bitable 



bitable Bodies in my Imagination, and I knav/ 
not but it may be very ufeful to tell you what I 
met with in my Way, and what the wifer I am 
for the Difcovery ; whether you will be the wifeij 
for the Relation at fecond Hand, I cannot anfwei; 
for that. 

I could make a long Difcourfe here of the Pow- 
er of Imagination, and how bright the Ideas of 
Diftant Things may be found in the Mind, when 
the Soul is more than ordinarily agitated : It is 
certain the extraordinary Intelligence conveyed in 
this Manner is not always regular, fometimes it is 
exceeding confufed, and the Brain being not able 
to digeft it, turns round too faft ; this tends to Lu- 
nacy and Diflra(3:i.on, and the Swifcnefs of the Mo- 
tion thefe Ideas come in with, occafions a Com- 
motion in Nature, the underflandi'ng is mobb'd 
with them, difturb'd, runs from one Thing to ano- 
ther, and digefts nothing ; this is well expreffed 
in our common Way of talking of a mad Man, 
namely, that his Head is turned. Indeed I can 
Uk^n it to nothing fo well as to the Wheels of a 
\^ind-mill> which if the Sails or Wings are fer, 
and the Wind blow a Storm, run round fo fail, that 
they will fet all on Fire, if a skilful Hand be not 
ready to dired and manage it. 

But not to enter upon this whymflcal Defcription 
of Lunacy, which perhaps may be no Bodies Opi- 
nion but my own, I proceed thus. That when the 
Ilead is ftrong, and capable of the Impreflions ; 
when the Underilanding is impowered to digeO: 
the infinite Variety of Ideas, which prefent to it ,. 
from the extended Fancy ; then, I fay,the Soul of / 
Man.is capable to ad ilrangely upon the Invifibles 
in Nature, and upon Futurity, Reallizing every 
Thing to itfelf in fuch a lively Manner, that wh^t 
it thus thinks ofj it really fees, fpeaks to, hears, 

con- 



[ 16 ] 

converfes with, &c. as livelily, as if the Subftance 
was really before his Face i and this is what I 
mean by thofe that dream waking, by Vifions, 
Trances, or what you pleafe to call them ,• for it is 
not neceflary to this Part^ that the Man Ihould 
be afleep.. 

I return to my Share of thefe Things. It was 
after my con verfing with my learned Friend a- 
bout the heavenly Bodies, the Motion, the Di- 
flances, and the Bulk of the Planets, their Si- 
tuation, and the Orbits they move in, the 
Share of Light, Heat and Moiflure, which they 
enjoy, their Refped to the Sun, their Influences 
upon us, and at laft, the PoiTibility of their being 
habitable, with all the Arcana of the Skies i it 
was on this Occafion, I fay, that my Imagination, 
always given to wander, took a Flight of its own ; 
and as I have told you that I had an invincible 
Inclination to travel, fo I think I travelled asfen- 
fibly, to my underftanding, over all the Mazes 
and Wafles of infinite Space, in Qiieft ot thofe 
Things, as ever I did over the Defarts of Ka- 
rakathayy and the uninhabited Wafts of I'artary, 
and perhaps may ^wc as ufeful an Account of 
my Journey. ' ' 

- When firfl njiy Fancy rais'd me up in the Con- 
fines of this vaft Abyfs, and having now tra- 
velled thro' the mifcy Regions of the Atmo- 
fphere could look down as I mounted, and fee the 
World below me, tis fcarce poiTible to ima- 
gine,' how little, how mean, how d^^picMc every 
Thing looked ; let any Man but try this Experi- 
ment of hiniifelf, and he fhail certainly find the 
fame Things let him but fix his Thoughts fo in- 
tenily upon wliat is, and mufl neceifarily be (ctw 
in a Stage or two higher, than v/hcre wc now 
live removed from the particular Converfe v/ith 

the 



[^7 ] 

the World, as to reallize to his Imagination what 
he can fuppofe to be there, he fh ail find all that 
is below him, as diftant Objefts always do^ 
leflen in his Mind as they do in his Sight: ' 

Could a Man fubiifl without a fupply of Food, 
and live but one Mile in perpendicular Height from 
the Surface, he would defpife Life and the World 
at fuch a Rate^ that he would hardly come down 
to have it be all his own ; the Soul of Man is 
capable of being continually elevated above the 
very Thoughts of human Things*, is capable of 
travelling up to the highefi: and moft diflant Re- 
gions of Light, but when it does, as it rifes a- 
bove the earthly Globe, fo the Things of this 
Globe fink to him. 

When I was at iirfl lifted up in my imaginary 
Travels, this Vv^as the firft Thing of Moment I 
remarked ; namely, how little the World and every 
Thing about it Teemed to me : I am not given to 
preach or drawing long Corollaries as the Learned 
call them, but I commend it to my Friends to ob- 
ferve, that could we always look upon the Things 
of Life with the fame Eyes, as we fhall do when 
we come to the Edge of Time, when one Eye can 
as it were look back on the^World, and the other 
look forward into Eternity, we fhould fave our- 
felves the Trouble of much Repentance, and 
fliould fcorn to touch many of thofe Things, in 
which now we fancy our chief Felicity is laid up; 
believe me we (hall fee more with half an Eye 
then, and judge better at firfl; Glance, than we 
can now with all our pretended Wifdom and Pe- 
netration. Li a Word, all the Paflions and Af- 
fe6tions fuffer a general Change upon fuch a View, 
and what we defire before, we contemn then with 
Abhorrence, 

J'id.vin^ 



[ 28 ] ^ 

Having begun to foar, the V/orld was foon out 
of Sight, unlefs that as I rofe higher, and could 
look at her in a due Pofition as to the Sun, I could 
fee her turned into a Moon, and Ihine by Refle- 
ction : Ay, JJjime on, faid I, with thy borrowed Raysy 
for thou hafi hut very few of thy own. 

When ray Fancy had mounted m^ thus beyond 
the Veftiges of the Earrh, and leaving the Atmof- 
phere behind me, I had fet my firm Foot upon the 
Verge of Infinite, when I drew no Breath, 
but fubiifled upon pure ^ther, it is not pofTible 
to exprefs iuily the Vifion of the Place ; firil you 
are to conceive of Sight as unconfin'd, and you 
fee here at leaf! the whole folar Syfiem at one View. 
Nor is your Sight bounded by the narrow Cir- 
cumference of one Sun, and its Attendants of Pla- 
nets, whofe Orbits are appropriated to its proper 
Syftem, but above and beyond, and on every Side 
you fee innumerable Suns, and attending on them. 
Planets, Satellites, and inferior Lights proper 
to their refpedive Syflems, and all thefe mov- 
ing in their fubordinate Circumilances, without the 
leafl Confulion, with glorious Light and Splendor 
inconceivable. 

In this firfl Difcovery 'tis mofl natural to ob- 
ferve, how plainly it is ro be feen, that the Reafon 
of tiie Creation of fuch immenfe Bodies as the Sun, 
Stars, Planets, and Moons in the great Circle of 
the lower Heaven, is far from being to be found in 
the Study of Nature, on the Surface of our Earth : 
But he that will fee thorowly, why God has fornid 
the Heavens the Work of his Hands, and the 
Moon and the Stars which he has made, mufl; foac 
up higher ,* and then as he will fee with other Eyes 
th;?Ji he did before, fo he will fee the God of Na- 
ture has form'd an inftnite Variety which we know 

nothing 



[^9] 

nothing of, and that all the Creatures are a Rea^ 
fon to one another for their Creation. 

I could not forget myfelf however, when I was 
got up thus high, I fay, I could not but look baek 
upon the State of Man in this Life, how confined 
from thefe Difcoveriesj how vilely employed ia 
biting and devouring, envying, and maligning one 
another, and all for the vilefl: Trifles that can be 
conceived. 

But I was above it all here, and all thofe Things 
which appeared fo afHiding before, gave me noc 
the leaft Concern now ; for the Soul being gone of 
this Errand, had quite difi-erent Notices of the 
whole State of Life, and was neither influenced / 
by Paffions or Affedions as it was before. 

Here I faw into many Things by the Help of a . 
fedate Inquiry, that we can entertain little or no 
Notion of in a State of commmon fuperficiai 
Life, and I defire to leave a few Remarks of this 
imaginary Journey, as I did of my ordinary Tra- 
vels. 

When I came, I fay, to look into the folar 
Syftem as I have hinted , I faw perfectly the Emp- 
tinefs of our modern Notions, that the Planets 
v;ere habitable Worlds, and Ihall give a brief 
Defcription of the Cafe, that others may fee it 
toOj without the Neceflity of taking fo long a 
Journey. 

And firfl for the Word Habitable, I underftand 
the meaning of it to be, that the Place it is fpo- 
ken of, is qualify^ for the Subfiilence and Exi- 
flence of Man and Beaftj and to preferve the vege- 
tative and fenfitive Life ; and you may depend up- 
on it, that none of the Planets except the Moon, 
are in this Senfe habitable ; and the Moon, a poor 
little watery damp Thing, not above as big as 
Torkfiirei neither worth being called a World, nor 

capable 



[30], 

capable of rendring Life comfortable to Mankind^ 
if indeed fupportable , and if you will believe 
one's Mind capable of feeing at fo great a Di- 
ftance, I aflure you I did not fee Man, Woman or 
Child there in all my Contemplative Voyage to 
it ; my Meaning is^ I did not fee the leaft Rea- 
fon to believe there was' or could be any there. As 
to the reft of the Planets, I'll take them in their 
Order. Saturn, (the remoteft from the Sun, which 
is in the Centre of the Syftem J is a vaft extended 
Globe, of a Subftance cold and moiit, its greateft 
Degree of Light is never fo much as our greateft 
Darknefs may be faid to be in clear Weather, and 
its cold unfufFerable ; and i( k were a Body com- 
pofed of the fame Elemenrs as our Earth, its Sea 
would be all Brafs^, and its Earth all Iron j that 
is to fay, both would be continually frozen, as 
the North-Pole in the Winter Solftice. What Man 
or Men, and of what Nature, could inhabit this 
frigid Planet, unlefs the Creator muft be fup- 
pofed to have created animal Creatures for the 
Climate, not the Climate for the Creatures. All 
the Notions of Satums being a habitable World, 
are contrary to Nature,and incongruous with Senfe ; 
for Saturn is at fo infinite a Diftance from the 
Sun, that it has not above one ninetieth Part of 
the Light and Heat that we enjoy on our Earth ; 
fo that the Light there, may be faid to be much 
lefs than our Star- light, -and the cold ninety Times 
greater than the coldeft Day in our Winter^ 

Jupiter is in the fame Predicament, his Confti- 
tution, however in its Degree much milder than 
Saturn^ yet certainly is not quah'fy'd for human 
Bodies to fubfift, having only one twenty-feventh 
Part of the Ligiit and Heat that we enjoy here, 
confequently its Light is at beft as dim as our 
Twilight, and its Heat fo lictle in the Summer of 



[31 ] 

its Situation, as to be as far from comfortable, as 
it is in its Winter Situation infupportable» 

Marsy If you will believe our ancient Philofo- 
pliers, is a fiery Planet in the very Difpofition of 
its Influence, as v^ell as by the Courfe of its Mo- 
tion ; and yet even here, the Light is not above 
one Half, and its Heat one Third of ours. And 
on the other Hand, as Saturn is cold and moifl, 
[o this Planet is hot and dry, and would admit 
no Habitation of Man, through the manifeff In- 
temperance of the Air, as well as want of Light 
to make it comfortable^ and Moifture to make it 
fruitful ; for by the Nature of the Planet, as well 
as by clear-fighted Obfervation, there is never 
any Rain, Vapour, Fog, or Dew in that Pla- 
net. 

Venus and Mercury are in the extreme the other 
Way, and would deftroy Nature by their Heat 
and dazling Light, as the othej^^wbiild by their 
Darknefs and Cold, fo that you may depend up- 
on it) I could fee very clearly, that all thefe Bo- 
dies were neither inhabited or habitable ; and the 
Earth only as we call it, being feared between thefe 
Intemperantes appeared habitable, furrounded 
with an Atmofphere to defend it, from the Inva- 
fion of the inconfiflent ^ther, in which Ferfpiration 
could not be performed by the Lungs, and by 
which the needful Vapour it fends forth, is pre- 
ferv'd from diffipating into the Wafle and Abyfs, 
and is condenfed and timely returns in Showers of 
Rain to moiflenj cool, and nourifli the exhaufted 
Earth. 

Jt is true the Way I went was no common 
Road, yet I found Abundance of Paflengers go- 
ing to and fro here, and particularly innumerable 
Armies of good and evil Spirits, who ail feem'd 
bufiiy employed, and continually upon the Wing, as 

if 



iSf fome Exprefles pafs'd between the Earth, which 
in this Part of my Travels I place below me, and 
fome Country infinitely beyond all that I could 
reach the Sight o( ; for by the Way, though I 
take upon me in this fublime Journey to fee a 
great deal of the invifible World, yet I was not 
arrived to a Length to fee into any Part of the 
World of Light, beyond it all ,* that Vifion is 
beyond all, and I pretend to fay nothing of it 
here, except this only, that a clear View of this 
Part with Opticks unclouded is a great Step to 
prepare the Mind for a Look into the other. 

But to return to my Station in the higheft crea* 
ted World, flatter not yourfeiveis that thofe Re- 
gions are uninhabited, becaufe the Planets ap- 
pear to be fo. No, no, laflbre you this is that 
World of Spirits, or at leaft is a World of Spirits* 

Here I faw a clear Demonftration of .Satan be- 
ing the Prince of the Power vj the Air ; \is ih this 
boundlefs Wafte he is confined, whether it be his 
bufie reftlefs Liclihation has ported him here, that 
he may affront God \}^ his Government of the 
World, and do Jnjury to Mankind in meer Envy 
to his Happinefs, as the faih'd Mr. Milton fays it, 
or whether it is that by the eternal Decree of Pro- 
vidence he is appointed to be Mans continual 
Difturberfor divine Ends, to us unknown ,* this 
I had not wandred far enough to be informed of> 
thofe Secrets being lodged much higher, than !■* 
magination itk\^ ever travelled. 

But here, I fay, I found Sathan keeping his*^ 
Court, or Camp we may call it, which we plea(c. 
The innumerable Legions that attended his im- 
mediate Service were fuch, that it is not at all to 
be wondred that he fupplied every Angle of this 
World, and had his \Voik going forward, not ifl 
every Country only, but even in every individual 

In- 



[ 33 ] 



Inhabitant of it, with all the Dexterity and ApplI^ 
cation imaginable. 

This Sight gave me a juft Idea of the Devil 
as a Tempter, but really let mc into a Secret, 
which I did not fo Well know before, or at leaft 
did not confider j namely, that the Devil is not 
capable of doing half the Mifchief in the World 
that we lay to his Charge ; that he works by En- 
gines and Agents, Straiagems and Art is true, and 
a great deal is owing to his Vigilance and Ap- 
plication ; for he is a very diligent Fellow in his 
Calling : But 'tis plain, his Power is not fo great 
as we imagine, he can only prompt to the Crime, 
he cannot force us to commit it ; fo that i^ we Cm 
\is all our own, the Devil is only to be charged 
with the Art of Infinuation ; jufl: as he began with 
Eve J he goes on with us ; in fhort he reafons us 
out of our Refolutions to do well, and wheedles us 
to an Agreement 'to do ill-; working us up to an 
Opinion, that what Evil we are about to do is nO 
Sin, or not fo great a Sin as we feared, and fo 
draws us by Arc into the Crime we had refolved 
againft ; this indeed the Scripture intim.ates when 
it fpeaks ^f Satan's Devices, the Subtilty of the 
'wicked one, his lying in wait, &c. But to charge 
the Devil with forcing us to offend, is doing the 
Devil a great Deal of Wrong : Our doing Evil is 
from the native Propenfity of our Wills : Huma- 
mim efl peccare. I will not enter here into the Dif- 
pute about an original Corruption in Nature5which 
I know many good Men and learned Men dxfputejf 
but that there is a fecrec Aptnefs to offend, and a 
fecret Backwardnefs to what is Good, which if 
it is not born with us, we can give no Account how 
we came by, this I think every Man will grant; 
and that this is the Devil that tempts us, the Scrip- 
tare plainly tells us, when it fays, Ei^ery Man is 



[?+] 



tempted ivhen he is drawn away 0J his oiva Lufi a:nd 
enticed. 

There is a fecrec Love of Folly and Vanity in^ 
the Mind, and Mankind are hurry 'd down the 
Stream of their own Affedions into Crime, "'tis 
agreeable to them to do this, and *cis a Force up- 
on Nature not to do it. 

Vice is down Hill^ and ivhen zue do off-end^ 
^'Tis Nature all^ vje acl as we intend, 

Vertue^s up Hill^ and all againfl the Grain 
Refolvd relutlant^ and purfued with Pain. 

But to return to. the Devil; his Power not 
extending to Creation, and being not able to force 
the World into an open Rebellion againft Heaven,, 
as doubtlefs he would do if he could, he is left to 
the Exercife of- his Skill ; and in a Word we may 
fay of him, that he lives by Ms- IVits ; that is to fay, 
maintains his Kingdom by Subtilty and moil: ex- 
jqiuiue Cunning ; and if my Vifion of his Poli- 
ticks is not a neiv Difcovery, I am very much 
miftaken. 

His innumerable Legions as I hinted above, like 
I Aid du Camps to a General, are continually cm- 
ployed to carry his Orders, and execute his Corn- 
millions in all Parts of the World, and in every in- 
dividual to oppofe the Authority of God, and the 
Felicity of Man to the utmoO: of his Power. 

The firil: and greateft Part of his Government, 
is over thofe Savage Nations where he has obtain- 
ed to fet himfelf up as God, and to be worfliippcd 
inllead of God ; and I obfervcd, that though ha- 
ving full PoileiTion of thefe People, ev^n by whole 
Nations at a Time, that is the ealieflPart of his. 

Govern.- 



[35] 



Government, yet he is far from negleding his Inte- 
reil there, but is exceeding vigilant to keep up his 
Authority among thofe Peopie. This he does 
by fending Meffengers into thofe Parts to anfwec 
the Pawawrags or Conjurings, even of the moft 
ignorant old Wizard, railing Storms and making 
Noifcs and Shreiks in the Air, Flafhes of infernal 
Fire, and any Thing but to fright the People, 
that they may not forget him, and that they may 
have no other Gods hut him. 

He has his peculiar Agents for this Work, 
which he makes Detachments of, as his Occafions, 
require, feme to one Part of the World, fome to 
another, as to the North America^ even as far as 
to the frozen Provinces oi Groenland ; to the North 
of Europe, to the Laplanders^ Smnoiedes, and Mon^ 
gul-tartarsy alfo to the Gog and Magog of AJta^ 
and to the Devil- makers of China and Japan, 
again to the Southern Parts of AJia, to the Ides 
of the Indian and South- Seas^ and to the South 
Part of America and Africa, 

Through ail thefe Parts he has an uncontrouird 
Povvrer, and is either worfhipped m Perfon, or by 
his Reprefentatives, the Idols and Mongers which 
the poor People bow down to, and Satan has very 
little Trouble with them. 

He employs indeed fome Millions of his Miffio-' 
nariesinto thofe Countries, who labour ad prop a^ 
gand.fid. and fail not to return and bring him aa 
Account of their Saccefs, and I doubt not but 
fome of them were at Hand in my IQand, when 
the Savages appear'd there j for it the Devil had 
not been in them, they would hardly have come 
ftraggling over the Sea fo far, to devour one 
another. 

C c 2 In 



C ^^ ] 

In all thefe Countries the Brutality, the Cruelty 
and ravenous bloody Dlfpofitions of the People, is 
to me a certain Teftimony that the Devil has full 
PofleiTion of them. 

But to return to my Obfervations in the exalted 
State of my Fancy, I mufl tell you, that though 
the Devil carried on his Schemes of Governmenr, 
in thofe blinded Parts of the World with great 
Eafe, and all Things went to his Mind ,• I found 
he had more Difficulty in the northern Parts of 
the temperate Zone, I mean, our Climate and 
the reft of Chriilendom, and confequently he did 
not ad here by whole Squadrons and by Generals ; 
but was obliged to carry on his Bufinefs among us 
by particular Solicitations, to ad by particular 
Agents upon particular Perfons, attacking the 
perfonal Conduct of Men in a Manner peculiar to 
himfelf : But fo far was this Difficulty from being 
any Advantage to the World, or Difadvantage to 
the Devil, that it only obliged him to make Ufe 
of the more Engines ; and as he had no want of 
Numbers, I obferved that his whole Clan feemed 
bufy on this Side^ the Number of which coniifts 
of innumerable M.llions ,* fo that in fliort, there 
was not a Devil wanting, no, not to manage eve- 
ry individual Man, Woman, and Child in the 
World. 

Hov\/ and in what Manner evil Angels attend us, 
what their Bufinefs, how far their Power extends, 
and how far it is reftrained, and by who, were all 
made plain to me at one View in this State of 
Eclavkiffiment that I flood in now, and I will de- 
fcribe it \'i I can in a few Heads of Fad ; you may 
enlarge upon them as Experience guides. 



And 



J ^7] 

And firfl, the Limitations of the Devil's Power, 
are neceflary to be iinderflood; and how direfted; 
for Example, you mull know, that though the 
Numbers of thefe Evil Spirits, which are thus 
diligently employed in Mifchief, are fo infinitely 
great, yet the Numbers of good Angels or good 
Spirits, which are employed by a fuperior Au- 
thority, and from a Place infinitely diflant and 
high above the Devils bounds, is not only equal; 
I fay, equal at leafl in Number, but infinitely fu- 
perior in Power, and it is this Particular which 
makes it plain, that all the Devil does, or that his 
Agents can do, is by continual Subtilty, extreme 
Vigilance and Application, under infinite Checks, 
Rebukes, and Callings off by the attendant Spi- 
rits, who have Power to corred and reflrain him 
upon all Occafions ; jufl: as a Man does a Dog or 
a Thief when he is difcovered. 

On this Account, 'tis firft plain, I fay, that the 
Devil can do nothing by Force, he cannot kill, 
maim, hurt or deflroy ; if he could. Mankind 
would have but a very precarious State of Life in 
the World : Nay, the Devil cannot blaft the Fruits 
of the Earth, caufe Dearth, Droughts, Famine, 
or Scarcity, neither can he fpread noxious Fumes 
in the Air to infed the World ; if any of thofe 
Things were in his Power, he would foon unpeo- 
ple God's Creation, and put his Maker to the 
Necellicy oF a new Fiat, or of having no more 
human Creatures to worfhip and honour him. 

You will ask me, how I came to know all this ? 

fay, ask me no Queflions, till the Elevation 
of your Fancy carries you up to the outer Edge of 
the Atmofphere, as I tell you mine did^ There 
you will fee the Prince of the Air in his full Statp^ 
managing his univerfal Empire with the moll exqui- 
lite Art : But if ever you can com^ to a cle^r View 

C c 3 of 



Lsn 



of his Perfon, do but look narrowly, and you'll 
/ fee a great Clog at his Foot, in token of his li- 
mited Power, and though he is himfeltimmenfe in 
Bulk, and moves like a Fiery Meteor in the Air, 
yet you always fee a Hand with a Thunderbolt 
impending juft jover his Head ; the Arp coming 
out of a fiery Cloud, which is a Token of the Sen- 
tence he is under, that at the End of his appointed 
Time that Cloud Ihali break, and that Hand flrike 
him with the Thunder reprefented, Down, Down 
forever, into a Place prepared forh m. 

But all this does not hinder him, who is 
prompted by infernal Rage againfl the Kingdom 
oi God, and the Welfare of Man, from pufhing 
Mankind as above, upon all the Methods of theic 
own Ruin and Deflrudion, by alluring Baits, cun- 
ning Artifice, Night-whifpers,infuling wicked De- 
iires, and fanning the Flames of Men^s Lulls, 
Pride, Avarice, Ambition, Revenge, and all the 
wicked Excurfions of corrupt Nature. 

It would take up a long Trad by icfelf, to form 
aSyftemof the Devil's Politicks, and to lay down 
a Body of his Philofophy : I obferv'd how- 
ever, that fome of his general Rules are fuch as 
rhefe. 

I. To infufe Notions of Liberty into the 
Minds of Men ; that it is hard they fhould be 
born into the World with Inclinations, and then be 
forbidden to gratify them ; that fuch and fuch 
Pleafures fiiould be prepared in the Nature of 
Things, made (uitable and proper to the Senfes 
and Faculties, which on the other Hand, are pre- 
pared in mere Conftitution, and placed in his 
Soul, and that then he fhould be forbidden under 
the Penalty of a Curfe to tafte them j that to place 
an Appetite in the Man, and a ftrong powerful 
Guft to thefe Delights, and then declare them fa- 
tal 



[J9] 

rai to hhuy would be laying a Snare to Man- 
kind in his very Confritution;, and making his . 
brighteil Faculties be the Betrayers of his Soul to 
Miiery, which would not conliO: with Juftice, 
much lefs with the Goodiiefs of a Creator. 

2. To perfuade from ijence, that the Notions 
of future Punilhments are Fables and Amufc- 
ments, that it is not rational to think a jnft God 
would prepare infinite and eternal Punifliments, 
for finite and trivial Oitenccs ; that God does not 
take Notice of the minute acls of Life, and lay 
every Slip to our Charge^ but that the merciful 
pifpofitions of God, who fo bountifully dire(5ts 
the whole World to be aiiiifant to the Profit and 
Delight of Mankind, has certainly given him 
leave to enjoy it at fill, and take the Comfort of 
It without Fear. 

3. Of late indeed the Devil ha^- learn'd, for De* 
'vils may improve as well as Men in the Arts, of doing 
ill. At ialf, I fay, he has learned to infufe a wild 
Notion into the Heads of fome People, who are 
Hrll fitted for it, bv havinij reafoned themfelves in 
Favour ot their loofe Delires up to a Pitch, that 
there is no fuch Thing as a God or a future Stace 
at ail. 

Now as at ' firft the Devil was not Fool enc)ugh 
to attempt to put this Jell upon Man, his own 
Antiquity and Eternity being a Contradidion to it ; 
fo I found among my new Difcoveries,that,the Devii 
took this Abfurdiry from Man. himfeit and that it 
went among Satan^'s People for a new Invention : I 
found alfo that there was a black Party employed 
upon this new Subtilty, thefe were a Sort of De- 
vils, for Satan never wants Inilruments, who i^ere 
caii'd InfimiatorSy and who Were formerly employed 
to prompt Men to Crimes by Dreams i and here I 
ihaii obfervej, that I learned a Way how to make 

C c 4 ary 



[ 40 ] 

any Man dream of what I pleafe : For Exampky 
fupppfe one to be found afleep, or as we fay, in a 
deep Sleep, or dead afleep, let another lay his 
Mouth clofe to his Ear, and whifper any Thing 
to him fo foftly as not to awaken him, the fleep- 
ing Man (hall certainly dream of what was fo 
whifpered to him. 

Let no Man defpife this Hint, nothing is more 
fure, than that many of our Dreams are the Wif- 
pers of the Devil, who by his Infinuators whifpers 
into our Heads, what Wicked Things he wou^d 
have our Thoughts entertain and work upon ; and 
take this with you as you go, thofe infinuating 
Devils can do this as well when we are av/ake, as 
\vhen we are adeep, and this will bring me to 
what I call Imfulfes upon the Mind, which are cer- 
tainly whifpers in the Ear and no other, and come 
cither from good Angels attending us, or from the 
Devil's Infmuators, which are always at hand, and 
may be judged of according as the SubjeQ: our 
Thoughts are prompted to work upon, are Good 
or Evil. 

From v/hence but from thefe Infinuators, come 
our caufelefs PaiTions, our involuntary Wickednefs, 
{inning in Defire as effeduaily, as by adual com- 
mitting the Crime we defire to commit ? 

Whence comes Imagination to work upon 
wicked and vicious Objefts, when the Perfon is 
fall: afieep, and when he had not been under the 
Preparadcn of wicked Difcourfe , or wicked 
Thoughts previous to thofe Imaginations? who 
forms Ideas in the Mind of Man? who prefents 
beautiful or terrible Figures ta his Fancy, when 
his Eyes are clos'd with Sleep ? who, but thefe in- 
finuating Devils, who invifibly approach the 
Man ileeping or waking, and whifper all man- 
iier of lewd abor^in^bk Things into his Mind. 

Mr. #7-

Mr. Milton, whofe Imagination was carried up 
to a greater He ghc than I am now, went farther 
into the Abyfs of Satan's Empire a great Way, 
efpecially when he form'd Satan's Palace oiPande- 
monium/lfay, hewasexadly of this Opinion,when 
he reprefented the Devil tempting our Mother Eve, 
in the Shape of a Toad lying juft at her Ear. when 
fhe lay fad afleep in her Bower, where he whifper'd 
to her Ear all the wicked Things which (he en- 
tertained Notions of by Night, and which 
prompted her the next Day to break the great Com- 
mand, which was the rule of her [Life ; and ac- 
cordingly he brings in Eve telling Adam what an 
uneafy Night's Reft ihe had, and relating .her 
Dream to him. 

This Thought, however laid down in a kind of 
Jeft, is very ferioufly intended, and would, if well 
digefted, dired us very clearly in our Judgment of 
Dreams ; viz,, not to fuggeft them to be always 
Things of meer Chance ; but that fometimes they 
are to be heeded as ufeful V/arnings of Evil or 
Good by the Agency of good Spirits, as at other 
Times they are the artful Iniinuations of the De- 
vil to injeft wicked Thoughts and abhorr'd abo- 
minable Ideas into the Mind -, which we ought not 
only as much as pollible to guard againft, but even 
to repent of, fo far as the Mind may have enter- 
tained and aded upon them. 

From this general Viiion of the Devil's Ma- 
nagement of his Affairs, which I muft own I have 
had with my Eyes wide open, I find a great many 
ufeful Obfervations to be made ; and firft, it can 
be no longer ftrao^ge, that while the Commerce of 
Evil Spirits is fo free, and the intercourfe between 
this World and that, is thus open, I fay, it can be 
no longer ftrange, chat diere are fo many fiient 

Ways 



[40 

Ways of Spirits converfing, I mean Spirits of 
all Kinds* 

For as I have obferved already, there is a Reg- 
deuce of good Spirits, but they are placed infinite- 
ly higher out of the Reach, and out of the Sight of 
this lower Orbit of Satan^s Kingdom ,* as 
thofe pafs and repafs invifible, I confefs, I have 
yetshad no Ideas of them, but thofe which I have 
received from my iirft View of the infernal Re- 
gion ; If I fhould have any fuperior Elevations, 
and fhould be able to fee the O Economy of Heaven 
in his Difpofition of Things on Earth, I (hall be 
as careful to convey theiii to Pofterity as they 
come in. 

However, the Tranfadions of good Spirits with 
Man are certainly the famQ ; for as God has for 
a Protedion and Safeguard to Mankind, limited 
the Devil from affrighting him, by vilible Appear- 
ances in his native and hellifii Deformity, and the 
horrrid Shape he would neceiTarily bear: So for 
Man's Felicity, even the glorious Angels of Hea- 
ven are very feldom allowed, at leaft not lately, 
to appear in the glorious Forms they formerly 
took, or indeed in any Form, or with a Voice ; 
the reftraint of our Souls in the Cafe of Fiefh and 
Blood we now wear not admitting it, and not 
being able to familiarize thofe Things to us ; Man 
being by no Means, in his encorporated State,qua- 
lifted for an open and eafy Converfation with un- 
embodied Spirit. 

Moreover, this would be breaking into the 
Limits, which the Wifdom and Goodnefs of God 
has put to our prefent State, I mean as to Futurity, 
our Ignorance in which, is the greateil Felicity of 
human Life ; and without which neccflary Blind- 
nefs Man could notfupport Life, fjr Nature is no 
way able to fupport a V^iew into Futurity j I mean 

noc 



[43] 



not into that Part of Futurity which concerns us in 
our State ot Life in this World. 

I have often been myfelf among the Number of 
thoie Fools, that would be their own Fortune-tel- 
lers ; but when 1 look thus beyond the Atmofphere, 
and fee a little fpeculatively into Invifibles, 1 could 
eaiily perceive, that it is our Happinefs that we 
are Ihort-fighted Creatures, and can fee but a very 
little before us : For Examfle, were we to have the 
Eyes of our Souls opened through the Eyes of our 
Bodies, we fhould lee this very immediate Region 
of Air which we breath in, rhrong'd with Spirits, 
to us, blcjfed he God, now invifible, and which would 
otherwife be moft frightful : We fhould fee into 
the fecret Tranfadions of thofe Meffengers who 
are employ 'd when the paffing Soul takes its Leave 
of the Reludant Body, and perhaps fee Things Na- 
ture would fhrink back from with the utmofl Ter- 
ror and Amazement.In a Word, the Curtain of Pro- 
vidence for the Difpoiition of Things here, and 
the Curtain of Judgment for the Determination of 
the State of Souls hereafter, would be alike 
drawn back, and what Heart could fupport here 
its future State in LIFE, much lefs that of its 
future State after LIFE even good or bad. 

It IS then our Felicity, that the Converfe of Spi- 
rits, and the Vifions of Futurity, are fiient, em.- 
blematick, and done by Hints, Dreams, and Im- 
pulfes, and not by clear Vilion and open Difcovery; 
they that defire a fuller and plainer Sight of thefe 
Things, ask they know not what ; and it was a 
good Anfwer of a Gypfy, when a Lady of my Ac- 
quaintance, ask*d her, to tell her Fortune j Do not 
ask me, Lady^ faid the Gypfy. to tell you zvhat you 
dare not hear. The Woman was a little honefter than 
her Profeffion intimated, and freely confefs'd it was 
ail aCheat^and that they knew nothing of Fortunes, 
^ ^ ■ . ■ but 



[ 44 ] 

but had a Courfe or Round of doubtful Expreilions, 
to amufe ignorant People and get a little Money. 

Even the Devils Oracles> for fuch no doubt 
they were at Delphos, and at other Places, though 
the Devil feemed at that Time to have fome Li- 
berties granted him, which it is evident have (ince 
been denied him, were allowed to be given only 
in doubtful Exp rellions, double Entendres, Ecchoes 
of Words, and fuch like : For Example, A Man 
going to Sea and enquiring of the Oracle, thusj 

Have Ijufi caitfe the Seas and Storms to Fear > 
E(:cho. Fear. 

Another. 

Shall ive the Parthian Bovjmen fight or Fly i 
Eccho. ' Fly, 

Such dark Replies, and other Words doubtful 
and enigmatic, were frequently given and taken for 
Anfwers, by which the deluded World were kept in 
doubt of that Futurity they hunted after: But Satan 
even then, was not permitted to fpeak plain, or 
Mankind to fee what awaited him behind the dark 
Veil of Futurity, nor was it proper on any Ac- 
count whatfoever, that it fhould be otherwife. 

But beFore I come to this, let me put fome Li- 
mits to the Elevations and Villous I have men- 
tioned before ; for as I am far from Enthufiaftic 
in my Notions of Things, (o I would not lead any 
one to fancy themfelves farther enlightned than is 
meet, or to iee Things unfeeable, i.s St. Paul heard 
Things unutterable. 

And therefore let me add here, that the higheli 
Raptures, Trances and Elevations of the Soul, are 
bounded by the eternal Decree of Heaven and let 

Men 



C 45 ] 

Men pretend to what Vifions they pleafej ft is ail 
Ron:iance, all beyond what I have talked of a- 
bove, is fabulous and abfurd, and it will for ever 
be true, as the Scripture fays, not only, thofe 
'things are hid from the Eye^ but even from the 
Conception. 

Upon this Occafion I mufl: own, that I think 
'tis Criminal to attempt to form Ideas either of 
Hell or of Heaven in the Mind, other than as the 
Scripture has defcribed them, by the State rather 
than the Place ; we are told in plain Words, it 
hath not entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, ei- 
ther of what is prepared for the future State of the 
Happy or Miferablej 'tis enough for us to enter- 
tain the general Notion, the Favour of God is 
Heaven, and the Lofs of it the moft dreadful 9f 
all Hell. 

A Heaven of Joy mufl in his Prejence dwells 
And in his Abjence every Place is Hell. 

My Meaning is this, all Vifions, or propoun- 
ded Vilions either of Heaven or Hell, are meet 
Delufions oftheMind> and generally are Fidions 
of a waking be wild red Head ; and you may fee 
the Folly of them in the meannefl of the Deferip- 
tions, which generally end in fhewing fome glo- 
rious Place, fine Walks, noble illuftrious Palaces, 
Gardens of Gold, and People of Ihining Forms^ 
and the like. Alas ! thefe are all fo fhort, that 
they are Unworthy the Thoughts of a Mind 
elevated two Degrees above Darknefs and Dirt: 
All thefe Things amount to no more than Ma- 
hornet's Alchoran, and the glorious State of Things 
reprefented by him to his Believers. In Ihort, 
all this makes only a Heaven of Senfe, but comes 
To infinitely fhort of what alone muft or can be 

a Hea- 



a Heaven to an exalted glorified Spirit, that I 
as much want Words to exprefs how concern- 
tible the beft of thefe Defcriptions are as to a 
true Defcription of Heaven, as I do to exprefs a 
true Idea, or Defcription of Heaven myieif. 

And how fhould this be done? We can Form 
no Idea of any Thing that we know not and have 
not feen, but in the Form of fomething that we 
have feen. Hov/ then can 'we form an Idea of 
God or Heaven, in any Form but of fome- 
thing which we have feen or known ? By what 
Image in the Mind can we judge of Spirits ? By 
what Idea conceive of eternal Glory ? Let us 
ceafe to Imagin concerning k^ 'tis impofTible to 
attain^ ^tis cdm.'nal to attempt it. 

Let me therefore hint here, that fuppofing my 
felf, as before, in the Orbit of the Sun, take it 
in its immenfe Diftance as our Aftronomers con- 
ceive of it, or on the Edge only of the Atmof- 
phere with a clear View of the whole Solar Sy- 
ftenty the Region of Satan^s Empire all in View, 
-^nd the World of Spirits laid open to me. 
- . Yet let me give you this for a Check to your 
Imagination, that even here the Space between 
Finite and Infinite is as impenetrable as on Earth, 
and will for ever be fo, till our Spirits being un- 
c%,kd. fhall take their Flight to the Center of 
Glory, where every Thing fhall be feen as it is ; 
and therefore you mulf not be furprized, if I am 
come down again from the Ver^je of the World 
of Spirits, the Tame (hortfighted Wretch, as to Fu- 
turity and Things belonging to Heaven and Hell 
as 1 went up ; for Elevations of this Kind are 
meant only to give us a clearer View of what we 
arti not of whaz' WQ fiall be'^ and 'tis an Advan- 
tage worth Travelling for too. All this I thought 
liCcciTary to prevent the whimfical Building of 

er- 



[47] 



erroneous Srrudures on my Foundation, and fan- 
eying thenfifelves carried farther than they are 
able to go. 

I come therefore back to talk of Things fa- 
miliar, and particularly to mention in the next 
Place, fomeof thofe other Ways by which we 
have Notice given of this Converfe of Spirits 
which I have been fpeaking of ,* for the Whif- 
pers and Iniinuators I have mentioned, go fome- 
times farther than ordinary. 

One of thofe other Methods is, when by 
firong Impuljes of the Mind> as we call them, we 
are directed to do, or not to do, this or that 
particular Thing that we have before us to do, or, 
are under Conlultation about. I am a Witnefs 
to many of thefe Things, as well in my own Life, 
as in my Obfervation of others. 

I know a Man, who being at fome Diftance 
from London^ not above fix or feven Miles, a 
Friend that came to vific and dii\Q with him urged 
him to go to London. V/hat for, fays his Friend^ 
is there any Bulinefs wants me? Nay, nothing, 
fays the other, but for your Company \ I do not 
know of any Thing wants you; and fo gave over 
importuning him : But as his Friend had given 
it over, a ftrong Impiilfe of Mind feized him and 
followed him like a Voice with this, Go to London^^ 
go to London. He put ic by feveral Times, but it 
went on ftil!. Go to London^ go to London, and 
nothing q\(q could come upon his Thoughts but. 
Go to London. He came back to his Friend, 
Hark ye, fays he, tell m.e fincerely, is all well 
at London} Am I wanted there? Did you ask me 
to go to London with you on any particular Ac- 
count. Not I, fays his Friend, in the leaft; I 
faw all your Family, and all is very well there ,• 
nor did they fay, they had any particular Occa- 
* iioa 



[48 ] 

fion for you to return ; I only ask it as I told 
you, for the Sake of your Company : So he put 
off going again, but could have no Quiet, for it 
fiill followed him, and no doubt, a good Spirit 
communicated it. Go to London ; and at length 
he refolved he would go, and did fo -, and when 
he came there he found a Letter and Meffcngers 
had been at his Houfe, to feek him, and to tell 
him of a particular Bufinefs, which was firfl: and 
laft worth above a thoufand Pounds to him, and 
which if he had not been found that very Night, 
would have been in Danger of being loft. 

I ferioufly advife all fober thinking Perfons not 
to difregard thofe powerful Impulfes of the Mind, 
in Things other wife indifferent or doubtful, but 
believe them to be Whifpers from fome kind Spi- 
rit, which fees fomething that we cannot fee, 
and knows fomething that we cannot know. 

Beiides, unlefs infinite Power fhould take off 
the Silence that is impofed upon the Inhabitants 
of the invifible World, and allow them to fpeak 
audibly, nothing can be a plainer Voice ; they 
are Words fpoken to the Mind, tho' not to the 
Ear, and they are a certain Intelligence of Things 
unfeen, becaufe they are given by Perfons un- 
feen, and the Event confirms it beyond all Di- 
fpute, 

I know a Man, who made it his Rule always 
to obey thefe filent Hints, and he has ofteu de- 
clared to me, that when he obeyed them he ne- 
ver mifcarried, and if he negleded them, or went 
on contrary to them, he never fucceeded ; and 
gave me a particular Cafe of his own, among 
a great many others, wherein he was thus direct- 
ed. He had a particular Cafe befallen him, 
wherein he was under the Difpleafure of the Go- 
vernment, and was profecuted for a Mifdemea- 

nory 



[ 49 ] 

not, and brought to a Tryal in the Kfng^s-Bench 
Court, where a Verdid was brought againfthim> 
and he was caft ,• and Times running very hard 
at that Time againft the Party he was of, he 
was afraid to (land the Hazard of a Sentence 
and abfcondedj taking Care to make due Provi- 
fion tor his Bail, and to pay them whatever they 
might fufer. In this Circumftance he was in 
great Diftrefs, and no Way prefented unto him 
but to fly out of the Kingdom, which being to 
leave his Family, Children and Employment) was 
very bitter to him, and he knew not what to 
do ; all his Friends advifing him not to put him- 
felf into the Hands of the Law^ which tho^ thg 
Offence was not Capital, yet in his Circum- 
ftances feemed to threaten his utter Ruin. In 
this Extremity he felt one Morning, ( juft as he 
had awaked^ and the Thoughts of his Misfor- 
tune began to return upon him j ) I fay, he felt a 
ftrong Impulfe darting into his Mind thus, fi^rit^ 
a Letter to them : It fpoke fo diftindly to him^,' 
and as it were forcibly, that as he has often faid 
lince, he can fcarce perfuade himfclf not to be- 
lieve but that he heard it ; but he grants that he 
did not really hear it, too* 

However it repeated the Words daily and 
hourly to him, till at length walking about in 
his Chamber where he was hidden, very pen- 
five and fad, it joggM him again, and he an- 
fwered aloud to it, as if it had been a Voice> 
Who Jhall I write to ? Ic returned immediately. 
Write to the Judge. This perfued him again foe 
feveral Days, till at length he took his Pen, Ink 
and Paper, and fat down to write, but knew not 
one Word of what he (hould fay, hntDabitur inhac 
hora, he wanted not Words : It v/as immediately im-^ 
preffed on his Mind, and the Words flowed up- 
D d Qu 



[56] 

on his. Pen in a manner, that even charm'd him- 
felf, and filled him with Expedations of 5uccefs. 

The Letter was fp ftrenoiis in Argument, (o 
pathetick in its Eloquence, and fo moving and 
perfwafive, that as foon as the Judge read it, 
he fent him Word he fhould be ea(ie, for he 
would Endeavour to make that Matter light to 
him, and in a Word never left, till he obtained 
to ftop Profecution, and reftore him to hii Li- 
berty and to his Family. 

Thefe Hints, I fay, are of a Nature too figni- 
ficant to be negleded ; whence they come is the 
next Enquiry. I anfwer. They are the Whifpers 
of fdme fubfifting Spirit communicated to the 
Soul, without the Help of the Organ, withoiit 
the Affiftance of a particular Sound, and with- 
out any other Communication ; but take it as you 
go, not without the merciful Difpofition of that 
Power, that governs that World, as well as this 
"that we are fenfible of ; How near thofe Spirits 
are to us, who thus forefee what concerns us, 
and how they convey thefe Hints into our Minds 
as well waking as fleeping, or how they are di- 
Srcfiedi that I could not difcover, nor can yet re- 
folve, no not in, the highefl of my imaginary Ele- 
vation,, any more than in what Manner they are 
Lim'ted and retrained. 

I have been a-ked by fome, to whom I have 
talked freely of - my frequent Applications to 
thefe Things, If I knew any Thing by thofe 
'Obfcrvatfons, of the Manner of the Difpo/ition of 
human Soul after its Departure out of the Body? 
I mean as to its middle State, and whether, as 
fome, it has a wanJring Exiftence in the upper 
Fart of the'VVaflc or Abyfs near to, but not in 
a' prefent State of Felicity ? Whether it is f^ill 
confined within die Atmofphere of the Earth 

* ac- 



[51 ] 

according to others, as in a Lhnhm, or Purga^* 
tory ; or in the Circle of the Sun, as others fay ? 
Whether I knew or perceived any Thing of our 
Saviour's being afcended into the Body of the 
Sun only, and not into the higheft Heaven re- 
ceiving his redeemed Souls to himfelf, and in- 
to an Incorporation with his Glory there, tillthe 
Refthution of all 'things ? Whether I perceived any 
Thing of Satan being pollelled of the reprobate 
Souls as they departed i and of his Subflitutes 
as Executioners, being empowered and employ- 
ed to torment them according to the receiv- 
ed Notions of the wife Contemplators of fuch 
Things. 

I anfwered, as I do now, that not only nor- 
thing of all this appears, but on the contrary, fuch 
ferious Contemplations as mine give a great and a^ 
bundant Reafon to be fatisfied, that there is no'- 
thing in it all but meer Dream and enthufiafticfc 
Conjecture : I own that the Agents I mention- 
ed, make ufe of all thofe Things to terrify and 
affright poor ignorant People out of their Senfes> 
and to drive them often into Defperation, and 
after to refcore them by a Cure that is worfe 
than the Diftemper, namely, by a Hardnefs and 
Coldnefs of Temper, rejeding entirely all the No- 
tions of Eternity and Futurity, and fo fitting them 
to go out of the World as they lived in it, (viz..y 
without troubling themfelves with what is to 
come after it. 

But 1 return to the Article of Impulfes of the 
Mind, for I lay greater Weight upon thefe than 
upon any of the other Difcoveries of the In- 
vifible World, becaufe they have fomething in 
them relating to what we are about, fome- 
thing dire61:ing, fomething to guide us in avoid- 
ing the evils thac attend us, and to accepting, or

felves good when they prefenr, which many 
Times for want of the knowledge of our Way, 
We irrecoverably let Vdp,

low the Neighbourhood of Spirits; in the Air 
we breath in, feem to have much k{s Significa- 
tion,-^/ to m, than thefe feafonable kind Whif- 
pe.. s to our Souls, which it is plain, are direfted 
for the Advantage oP Life. 

It feems hard that Mankind fhould be fo open 
to the fecret Iniinuators the whifpering Devils I 
have been fpeaking of, who are Night and Day, 
ileeping and waking, working upon his Senfes by 
the Arts and Subtiities of Hell, to fill his Ima- 
gth^ioii with a thoufand devilifh Contrivances 
m gratify his V'anity and Liifl ; and that our 
Thoughts Oiould be ahvays ready to receive the 
Impreffions they make, preiied to follow the 
infernal Counfel, be awake to liflen to all his 
Dire.£ions, but fhould be deaf to the Inftrudions 
of any kind Spirits that v/ould influence us for our 
Advantage^ and infenfible of rhofe Impreffions 
which are made upon us for our immediate Good, 
by an Agent Good in itfelf, and ading from a 
Principle whatever it be, of Good to us.

Well, I knew fome Mifchief would come of it ;

I will take the Liberty to fay, I durfl be pofi- 
tive in it^ relating to my feli-V and I durft be po- 
iitive from the Nature and Reafpn of the Thing. 

As to my own Experience, I wave faying much 
of it, but that in general I never flighted thefe 
Impulfes, but to my great Misfortune ; I never 
liften'd to and obey a them, but to my great Ad- 
vantage, but I choofe to argue from the Reafoii 
of them5 rather than from my own Experience. 

As they are evident Warnings of what is to 
come, and are teftiiied daily and hourly by the 
Things coming to pafs afterwards, fo they are 
undeniable Teftimonies, that they proceed from 
fome Being, intelligent of thofe Things that are 
at Hand, while they are yet to come. If then 
I am fatisfied that it is a Notice given from a 
Something, be it what it luill, which is fully in- 
formed ot what is attending aie, tho' conceard 
from me ; why fhould I flight the Hint giveri

Evils to come.

prehenhons in the Family, that they were all 
ia a Fright, and applied themfelves to fearch 
from the Top of the Houfe to the Bottom, and 
to fee every Fire, and every Candle fafe out, fo 
that, as they all faid> it was impoffible any 
Thing could happen in the Houfe, and they fent 
to the Neighbours on both Sides to do the like. 
Thus far they did well, but had fhe obeyed the 
Hint, which preft upon her flrangely not to go 
to Bed, Ihe had done much better, for the Fire 
was adualiy kindled at that very Time, tho' not 
broken out. 

In about an Hour, after the whole Family was 
in Bed, the Houfe juft over the Way, diredly 
oppofite, was all in a Flame, and the Wind 
which was very high, blowing the Flame upon 
the Houfe this Gentlewoman lived in, fo fiu'd it 
with Smoke and Fire in a few Moments, the 
Street being Narrow, that they had not Air to 
breath, or Time to do any Thing, but jump 
out of their Beds and fave their Lives ; had (lie 
obey'd the Hint given, and not gone to Bed, fhe 
might have faved feveral Things of Value, 
which fhe loih but as fhe neghctcd that, and 
would go to Bed, the Moments fhe had fpar'd 
toner, were but juft fuiKcient to get out of Bed, 
get fome Cloaths on, and get down Stairs, for 
the Houfe was, on Fire in half Quarter of an / 
Hour. 

It might be ask^'d here, why could not the 
fame kind Spirit have intimated by the fame 

Whif- 



[55^ 

Whifpers, where the Danger Jay, and from what? 
Quarter it was to be expeded ; in what Man-'i 
ner the Fire would attack them, and that if 
would come from the other Side of the Street, ^ 
the Wind blowing it diredly upon them ? 

To this, I anfwer, that it is our Bufinefs the 
more vigilantly to obferve and iiften to the Hints 
which are given, feeing the Intimations are not 
fo Particular as we might wifo, without enqui- 
ring into the Reafons, why they are given no 
plainer. We have a great deal of Reafon tobe-- 
lieve the kind Spirit that gives thefe Intimations 
andWhifperSj thus to us, gives us ail the Light 
it is permitted to give, and whifpers as much,-^ 
either as it knows, or as it is allow'd to comma-- 
iiicate ; otherwife, why does it give any ^Inti- 
mations at ail /* But on the other Hand, it may 
be alJedg'd, that enough is intimated to fuffice 
for our Safety, i^ we will obey the Intimation ; 
and it would be a much more reafonable Quc- 
iiion, to ask, why we flight and difobey thelm-' 
prefTion that we acknowledge to have received,-^' 
rather than why the Intimation was no plainer. ' ^ 

A Perfon of my Acquaintance being to go to; 
Nevo- England by Sea, two Ships prefented, and-^ 
the Mailers earneftly foh'cited- to take him as a 
Pafl'enger ; he asked my Advice, profciiing,' = that 
as well the Ships, as the Captains, were rnvktl-' 
ly indifferent to him, both the Men being equally- 
agreeable to him, and the YeiTels equally good. 
I had my Eye upon this Notion oF Impuifes, and 
preft him to obferve fiiridly, if he hadrnot fome^ 
fecret Motion of his Mind to one Ship rathet 
than another, and he faid he had not. 

After fome Time he accidentally met one of 
the Captains, and falling into Terms with him," 
agreed for his Paffage, and accordingly prepar'd- 

D d 4 1^ 



[ 56 ] 

to go on board ; but from the very Time that 
he made the Agreement, nay, even while he was 
making the Bargain, he had a ftrong Impreffion 
on his Mind, that he fhould not go in that 
Ship. 

It was fome Days after this, that he told me 
of thefe Impreffions, which increased on him e- 
very Day j upon which I preft him earneftly not 
to go, but to take Paflfage with the other. Af- 
ter he had refolv'd upon thisj he came to me, 
and told me, that he had with fome Difficuhy, 
and fome Lofs, put off the firfl Ship, but that 
now he had the fame, or rather llronger Averfi- 
on to going in the fecond Ship, and had a flrong 
Impreffion on his Mind, that if he went in the 
fecond Ship he fhould be drowned ; I bid him 
confider it a little, and tell me if he ha<i any 
farther Intimations of it ; and he continued to 
tell me, that he had no Reft about his going in 
either of thofe Ships, and yet his Affairs lay fo, 
that he was under a Neceffity of going, and 
there was no other Ship put up upon the Ex-* 
change for going, 

I prefs'd him, however, not to venture by any 
Means ; I convinced him, that thofe ImpuKes of 
his Mind were the Whifpers ot feme kind Spi- 
rit, that faw Things farther than he could, and 
were certainly given him as Cautions to fave 
him from fome Mifchief which he might not 
forefee ; that it could be no evil Spirit, becaufe 
the keeping him back could be no Injury to 
him, of fuch a Nature as would gratify the De- 
vil in any Part of his ufual Defires ; it muft there- 
fore be fomething for his Good, and he ought 
to be very cautious how he flighted the filent Ad- 
1 monition. In a Word, I prepoffefs^'d him fo much 
in aid of the fecret Irapulfes of his own Mind, 

that 



[57] 

that he refolved rot to go that Year, and he 
faw clearly afterwards, that the/ecret Infimari- 
mation was fiom a good Hand, for both tne 
Ships mifcarried ; the firfl: being taken by tne 
Turks, and the latter caft away and all the Men 
loft, the Ship foundring at Sea, as was fiippos^d, 
for fhe was never heai-d of. 

I could fill this Trad with Accounts of this 
Nature, but the Reafon of the Cafe is ftronger 
than the Example ; for as it is an Intimation of 
fomething future, and that is to come to pa{s,it is 
certain., there is a State in which what is Future 
and mufl: come to pafs is know^n, and why Oiould 
we not believe the News, ii it comes from the 
Place where the Certainty of it is known ? 

Some give all this to a Prefcience peculiar to 
the Sou) it felf, and of kin to that we call the 
Second Sight ,* but I fee no Ground for this, but 
mere Prefumption. Others call it an Afflatus^ 
which they think is a Diftemper of the Brain. 
Others call it a Sympathetick Poiver in the Soul^ 
foreboding its own Difafters. Bat all this is 
ihort of the Thing, for here is not a Foreboding 
only, which indeed is often felt, but is exprefs'd 
another V/ay; but here is a dired Intelligence; a 
plain Intimation of the Evil, and warning to a- 
void it : This muft be more than an Afflatus,, more 
than a Sympathy ; this muft be from a certain 
Knowledge of a Thing that exifts not, by a Some- 
thing that ^£?^^ ^x?/?; and muft be communicated 
by a Converfe of Spirits unembodied, with the 
Spirit embodied, for i:s Goodi uiilefs you win 
call it Divine Revelation^ which i fee no Ground 
for. 

All thefe Reafonings make ic abundantly our 
Concern to regard thefe Things, as what we are 
greatly concerned in i However that is not the chief 



[58] 



Ufe I make of them here, but (i.) they abundantly 
explain the Nature of the World of Spirits, and 
the Certainty of an Exiftence after Death ; (2.) 
they confirm that the Difpofition of Providence 
concerning Man, and the Event of Things, are 
not fo much hidden from the Inhabitants of that 
World as they are from us,- as alfo (3.) that Spirits 
iinembodied fee with a Sight differing from us, 
and are capable of knowing what attends us, 
when we know nothing of it our felves. 

This ofitr'd many ufeful Reflexions to my 
Mind, which, however, \u impoflible for me to 
communicate with the fame Vivacity, or to ex- 
prefs with the fame Life, that the ImprefTion 
they make on my own Thoughts came with. 

I. The Knowledge of there being a World of 
Spirits, may be many Ways ufeful to us, and efpe- 
cially that of their feeing into Futurity, fo as to 
be able to communicate to us, by what Means fo* 
ever they do it, what we (hall, or fliall not do, 
or what iliall, or fhall not befall us ; to communi- 
cate Dangers before us, fo as they may be avoided, 
and Mifchiefs awaiting us, fo as they may be pre- 
vented, and even Death it felF, fo as we may pre- 
pare for it ; For we may certainly, if we would at- 
tend tothefe Things, encreafe our Acquaintance 
with them, and that very much to our Advantage. 

I would be far from prompting the crazy Imagina- 
tions of Hypocondriac Didemper^d Heads, which 
run Men out to (o manyExtravagancies,and which 
in fixing their Thouphts upon the real World 
of Spirits, make this an imaginary World of Spi- 
rits to them ; who think they are talk'd to from 
the inviiible World, by the Howling of every Dog, 
or the Screeching of every Ov/1. I believe it was 
much of this vapourifli dreaming Fancy, by which 
thQA/i^un of thc/ic;;//?/7j determined Events from the 

Fly- 



[59] 

Flying of Birds, and the Entrails of Beafts. It will 
be hard for me to be prevail'd on to luppofe, 
that even thofe inteUigent Spirits which I fpeakof, 
who are able by fiich eafy Ways, as the Impul- 
fes of our Minds, Dreams, and the like, to con-r 
vey the Knowledge of Things to us, can be put 
to the NecefTity, or find Reafon to make Ulc of 
the Agency of Dogs and Birds, to convey their 
Notices by ; this would be to fuppofe them to 
be much more confin'd in their Converfe with us, 
than we evidently find they are ; and on the orher 
Hand would fuppofe the inanimate World to have 
lEore Knowledge of the inviiible, than v/e have^ 
whereas on the,other Hand we know they have no- 
thing at all to do with it. 

There is only this to be faid for ir, namely, 
that thofe inanimate Creatures do it involunta- 
rily, and as it were, under the Power of a Pof- 
feliion. 

I will not affirm, but t/iat the invifibie Inhabi- 
tants I have been fpeaking ot] may have Power to 
ad upon the brute Creatures, fo as to employ 
them, or make ufe of their Agency in the Warn- 
ings and Notices which they give to us of Things 
to come ; but that the Brutes have otherwife a- 
ny farther Sight of Things than we have, I can 
fee nothing at ail of that. It is true, Balaam's 
Afs faw the Angel with the flaming Sword, flan- 
ding in the Road, when the Prophet did not, 
but the ReafoQ is plainly exprefs'd ; the Angel 
was really there, and aftually prefenting Terror 
to them with a flaming Sword in his Hand, on- 
ly the Prophets Eyes were miraculoufly witheld, 
that he could nor fee him. 

I fhali unriddle thisMyPcery of the Agency of 
Beads, and Birds, as far as Reafon didates ; 
and it feqms to be Eaiy upon the Scheme of tlie 

Near- 



[do] 

Nearnefs of the Spirits I am fpeaking of to us, 
and their Concern to convey Intelligence to us : 
' They may, I fay, have Power to Terrify the 
Brutes by horrible Apparitions to them, fo as to 
force thofe Howlings and Screichings we have 
been told of, and to do this in fuch Places, and 
at fuch Times as fnall fuit with the Circumflances 
of the Family or Perfon concern'd, and fo far 
their faid extraordinary Howlings and Screichings 
may be iignificant ; but that the Brutes can ei- 
ther by Senfe, or by extraordinary Sight have any 
Foreknowledge of Things in Futurity relating to 
us, or to themfeives ,• this has no Foundation in 
Reafon or Philofophy any more than it has in Re- 
ligion. Matter may Sitt upon material Objeds, 
and (o the Underftanding or Senfe of a Brute 
may ad upon vifi ble Objeds, but Matter cannot 
ad upon immaterial Things, and fo the Eye of a 
Beaft cannot fee a Spirit, or the Mind of a Brute 
aft upon Futurity, Eternitya and the fublime 
Things of a State to come. 

What Ufe then the Spirits we fpeak of, inhabi- 
ting the invifible World, can make of the inani-^ 
mate World to dired them, as MifTionaries to us, 
I do not fee, neither did I in all my Altitudes, 
perceive they employed any fuch Agents. 

It is from the Mifunderflanding ofthele Things 
that we place abundance of Incidents mecrly for- 
tuitous to the Devils Account, which he knows 
nothing of; many a Storm blows that is none 
of his raifing ,• many a M d-night Noife hap- 
pens that is none of his making ; i^ Satan or his 
Inftruments had one Tenth Part of the Pow- 
er, either of the Air, or in the Air, or over the 
Elements, that we give them in our Imginations, 
we fl:ould have our Kor.fes burnt every Night, 
Hurricanes ra' fed in the Air, Floods made in the 

Coun- 



[6i ] 

Country, and in a Word, the World would not 
be habitable : But you remember I told you, as 
powerful as he is^ he is chain'd, he has a great 
Clog at his Foot, and he can do nothing by Vio- 
lence, or without PermifTion. 

I might hint here at abundance of idle ridicu- 
lous Devils, that we are d^ily told of, that come 
and only make Game among us, put out our Can- 
dles, throw Chairs and Stools about the Houfe, 
break Glafles, make a Smoak, a Stink of Brim- 
flone, &c. whereas after all, the Devil has no 
more Sulphur about him than other Folks, and I 
can anfv^er for it, that Satan is not difpofed for 
Mirth ; all the Froiicks and Gambols we afcribc 
to him, I dare fay, are Anticks of our own Brain. 
I heard of a Houfe in EJfex, which they told me 
was haunted, and that every Night the Devil or 
a Spirit, call it which you will, came into fuch a 
Room, and made a mofi: terrible Knocking, as if 
it had a Hammer or a Mallet, and this for two 
or three Hours together : At length, upon looking 
about in an empty Clofet in that Room, there 
was found an old Mallet, and this was prefently 
concluded to be the Mallet which the Devil made 
fuch a Noife with, fo it was taken away : Buc 
the next Night they faid, the Devil made fuch a 
Racket for want of the Mallet, that chey were 
much more diflurb'd than before, fo they were ob- 
liged to leave the Maiiet there again, and every 
Night the Devil would come and knock in the 
Window, for two or three Hours together with 
that Maiiet. I have feen the Room, and the 
Mallet, in neither of which was any Thing ex- 
traordinary, but never heard the Noife, though 
I fat up to wait for it ; nor after cauiing the Mal- 
let to be taken away, was there any Noiie ,• be ■ 

like 



[ ^^ ] 

like the mannerly Spirit would not diflurb us who 
were Strangers. 

This pafs'd for a moPc eminent Piece of Walk- 
ing or Haunting, and ail the Difficulty was to 
enquire, to what Purpofe ail this Diilurbance was 
made, feeing there was no End anfwered in it, 
and I always thought the Devil was too full of 
Buiinefs to fpend his Time to no manner of Pur- 
pofe. 

At laft, all the Cheat was difcovered, ^iz., that 
a Monkey kept in a Houfe three or four Houfes 
from it, had found the Way unto that Room, 
and came every Night almoll: about Midnight, 
and diverted himfelt with the Frolick, and then 
went Home again. 

If thefe Tilings were not frequently deteded, 
it would be a great Scandal upon the Devil, that 
he had nothing to employ himfelf in, more figni-* 
ficant, than Rapping all Night with a Hammer 
to fright and diilurb the Neighbours^ making 
Noifes, putting out Candles, and the like : When 
we come into the invifible S^ate, of which we 
now know fo little, we fhall be eaf^Iy convinced, 
that the Devil is otherwife employ'd, and has Bu- 
iinefs of much more Importance upon his Hands. 

It v/ould be very infignificant, to have us fo fre- 
quently warned againft Satans Devices, to have us 
be caution'dto be fober and vigilant, knowing that 
our Adverfary the Devil, goes about like a roar- 
ing Lion, feekiiiP, &c. Ail thefe Things import, 
that he is diligent in attacking us, watching all 
Advantages, hunting us down, circumventing, 
waiting, and conftantly plying us with Snares that 
he may trapan and devour us : This admits not 
any of thofe (imple, ludicrous, and fenfelefs Di- 
grelTions, which we fet him to work upon in our 
imaginations. 

Perhaps 



Perhaps, it may be expeded I fhould enter here 
upon the Subjeft of Apparitions, and difcourfe 
with equal Certainty of that yet undecided Que- 
flion, concerning the Reality of Apparitions, 
and whether departed Souls can revifit the Place 
of their former Exiflence, take up Shapes, Bodies, 
and vifible and apparent BeingSjaflume Voices,and 
concern themfelves with the Affairs of Life, of 
Families, Perfons, and even of Eftates, and the 
like, as many have affirmed they have been Wit- 
nefles to. 

I muft be^allowed to leave this where I find if ; 
-there are fome Difficulties which I am not yet got 
over in it, nor have I been elevated high enough 
to determine that Point, and fhaLl* not venture to 
decide it, v/ithout more certainty than I am yet 
arriv^'d to. 

I would warn ail People not to fufFer their Ima- 
gination, to form Shapes and Appearances where 
there are none ; and I may take upon me to fay, 
that the Devil himfelf does not appear half fo of- 
ten, as fome People think they fee him; Fancy go- 
verns many People, and a fick Brain forms flrange 
Things to itfeif: But it does not follow from 
thence that nothing can appear, becaufe nothing 
does at that Time. 

However, as my Defign is to inftrud, not a- 
mufe, fo I fay, I forbear to enter upon a Sub}e(3:, 
which I mud: leave as doubtful as I find it, and 
confequently talk of to no Purpofe. 

I have heard of a Man that would allow the 
Reality of Apparitions, but would have it be no- 
thing but the Devil, that the Souls of Men de- 
parted or good Spirits never appeared, it happened 
that to this very Man fomething appear'd,as he faid, 
and infixed upon it to the lail : He faid he faw 
the Shape of an ancient Man pafs by him in the 

Dusk 



[ H ] 

jDask of the Evening, who holding up his Hand, 
as it were in a threatning Po/lure, faid aloud> 
wicked Creature, repent, repent. He was exceedingly 
terrified, and conlulted feveral People about it, 
who all advifed him ferioufly to take the Advice ; 
for his Life made it well known it feems, that he 
ftood in need of it : But being ferioufly debating 
about it, one of his Friends asked what he thought 
of the Apparition, and whether it was any of the 
Devils Bulinefs to bid him Repent ; this puzzled 
his Thoughts, and in a Word, he grew a very fo- 
ber Man : Bat after all, it was a real Man, and no 
Apparition that fpoke to him, though his frighted 
Fancy made him affirm that he vaniih*d out of his 
Sight, which Tie did not. And the Perfon whb 
did it, being a Grave anfd pious Gentleman, met 
him by mere Accident without any Defign* and 
fpoke as he did, from the Knowledge he had of his 
being indeed a molt wretched v/icked Fellow : By 
iho, Way^ the Gentleman had tlie Opportunity to 
hear the Ufe that was made of it, and to heat 
himfelf miftaken for an Apparition of the Devil, 
but he was fo prudent as not to difcover it to the 
Man, left the Reformation, which was the Gon- 
fequence of the Fright, fhould wear off, when he 
fliould know, that there was nothing in the Thing 
but what was common. 

If we would always make the like good Ufe of 
Satan s real Appearances, I do not know but it 
would go a great Way to banifh him from the vi- 
fible World ; for I am well affur'd he would very 
feldom vilic us, if he thought his Com"ng would 
do i\s any Good ; at lealf he would never come, 
but when he was fent, he would never come wil- 
lingly : For he is fo abfolutely at the Divine Dif- 
pcfal, that if Ht^aven Commands, he muft go, 
though it were to do the good he abhors 5 not 

thac 



that I believe Heaven ever thinks ^t to employ Kim 
in doing Goodj it ever he is Jet loofe, 'tis to adt in 
Judgment as an Inftrument of Vengeance, and 
Ibme are of Opinion, he is often employed as 
a deAroying Angel, tho'I do not grant that; I can 
hardly think tlie Juftice of God would gratify 
Satan's Guflof domg Evil, fo'far as to fufter him 
to be even To ranch as an Executioner : But that is 
by the Way. 

I have another Turn to give this Part of my 
Obfervations, which tho* perhaps fome may noE 
think fo much to the Purpofe, as entring into 
a critical Enquiry after the Devils particulac 
Million in thefe Cafes : Yet I think otherwife. 

I have obferv'd, that feme defperate People 
make a very ill ufeof the general Notion, that there 
are no Apparitions, nor Spirits at all \ anci really 
the Ufe they make of it, is worfe than the ex-^ 
treme of thofe, who, as I faid, make Viiions 
and Devils of every Thing they fee or hears 
For thefe Men perfuade themfelves there are no 
Spirits at all, either in the viiible or inviiible 
World, and carrying it on farther, they next an- 
nihilate the Devil, and believe nothing about 
him, either of one idnd or anothero 

This would not be pf fo much bad Confequence, 
if it was not always followed by a worfe; namely^ 
that when they have prevailed with themfelves to 
believe there is no Devil, the next Thing iSy and 
they foon come to it, Ihat there is no God, and (o 
Atheifm takes its rife in the fame Sink, with a 
Carelefnefs about Futurity. 

I have no Mind to enter upon an Argument to 
prove the being of our Maker, and to illuftrate 
his Power by Words, who has fo many undeniable 
Teftimonies in the Breads of every rational Being 
to prove his Exiftence : But I have a Mind to con- 

E @ <ilu40 



[ ^4 ] 

elude this Work with a ihort Hiftory of feme A- 
theifls , which I met with many Years ago, 
and whether the Fafts are teftified or not, may 
be equally uk^ul in the Application, i( you do 
not think them a little too Religious for you< 

Some Years ago, there was a young Gentleman,- 
a Sciiolar at the Univerfity, eminent for Learn- 
ing and Vertue, of prompt Parts, and great Pro- 
ficiency, infomiich that he was taken great No- 
tice of by the Maflers and Fellows, and every 
one promifed fair in their Thoughts for him, that 
he would be a great Man. It happened, whe- 
ther from his earneft Deiire of more Knowledge, 
or the Opinion of his own great Capacity, I know 
not which ; that this Gentleman falling upon the 
Study of Divinity, grew fo opinionative, fo very 
podtive and dogmatic in his Notions in religious 
Things, that by Degrees it came to this Height, 
that his Tutor faw plainly, he had little more than 
Notions in all his religious Pretences to Know- 
ledge, and concluded, he would either grow 
Enthufiaftic or obllinately Profane and Athei- 
ftick. 

He had three Chums or Companions in his Stu- 
dies, and they all fell into the fame Error, as well 
by the Confequence of a great deal oi Wit and 
little Grace, as by the Example and Leading of 
this other young Gentleman, who was indeed 
their Oracle, almofl in every Thing. 

As his Tutor who was a very good Man, fear'd 
for him, fo it came to pafs with him, and all the 
reft ; ^ot they ran up" their fuperficial Notions in 
Divinity to fuch a Height, that inflead of Rea- ''• 
foning themfelves into good Principles of Reli- " 
gion, they really reafon'd themfelves out ot' all 
Religion whatfoever ; running en to expunge 
every right Idea from their Minds,pretending thofe 

Things 



Things really tvere mt, of which they could not 
define both how and what they were ^ they pro- 
ceeded to deny the Exiftence of their Maker, the 
Cercaintyof a future State, a Refurredion, a Judg- 
ment, a Heaven, or a Hell. 

They were not contented to fatisfie themfelves 
with thefe impious Foundations, but they fet up 
to difpute in private Societies againft all revealed 
Religion, "-thereby bringing on themfelves theCurfe 
denounced in Scripture againft thofe, that do Evil 
and teach Menfo to do ; in a little Time they grew 
fo publick, that more Company came in, and 
which was worfe, many joined with them in 
Principle, or as I fliould rather have faid, in call- 
ing off all Principles, and they began to be famous 
in the Place, though to the Offence of all good Men^ 
and were call'd, T'he AtheiftkaCCluh. 

They foon began to fee fober,religious People (huti 
them, and in fome Time, upon Information given, 
they were obliged by Authority, to feparate foe 
Fearcf Punifhment, fo that they could not hold 
their publick Difputations, as they began to do f 
yet they ab'ated nothing of their wicked Cuilom; 
and this dreadful Creature, who fet up at the 
Head of the reft, began to be fo open in his 
Blafphemies, that he was at Length obiigM to fly 
from the Univeriity. 

However, he went a great while before it came 
to that \ and though he had been often admonifh- 
ed, yet inftead of reclaiming, he grew the more 
impious, making- the mofi: Sacred Things \m 
Jeft , and the Subjed: of his Ridicule : He gave 
out. That he could frame a new Gofpelj and a 
much better Sjfiem of Religion, than that which 
they cau'd Chnftian', and that if he would trouble 
himfelf to go about it, he would not fail to draW 
in as great a Pare of the World to run after him, 

^ % % as

as had been ^fter any other, I care not to repeat 
any of his blafphemous Words, it is not to be 
fuppofed there can be any blafphemous abominable 
Thing, that this Set of wicked wretched young 
Men did not run into, neither any Wicked- 
nefs of that kind within their Reach, which they 
did not commits 

k w^ould be too long to enter into the particu- 
lar H-flory of thefe Men, and how it pleafed 
God todifpofe of them j they might be in Number 
before they feparated about twenty-two in all, I 
ftall tell you of fome of them however, who did 
not run luch Lengths as the reft : There was a 
young Man, who frequented their Society, though 
as he ajterivards faid, he was rather pcrfuaded to 
be among them, than to be one of them i he had 
however too much yielded to their Delulions; 
and though they made him very much their Jeft, 
becaufe they found he ftili retained fome little Senfe 
of a God, and of a future State in his Mind, yet 
he had yielded dreadfully to them, and began to do 
fo more and more every Day. 

It happen'd one Day, this young Man was going 
to their hellifh Society, and not minding the Wea- 
ther, the Clouds gathered over his Head, and he 
was flopped by a fudden Shower of Rain in the 
Street : It rained fo very hard, that it obhged him 
to ftand up in the Gate-way of an Inn for fome 
Time ; while he was ftanding here, a great Flafh 
of Lightning more than ordinarily furprizM him ,* 
it feems the Fire coming fo diredly in hjs Face, 
that he felt the very Warmth of it, and was ex- 
ceedingly ftartled ; in the fame Moment almoft, 
as is natural in the Cafe, followed fuch a Clap of 
Thunder thatperfedly aftoniflied him. The Rain 
continuing, kept him in theGace-way, asIfiiid,fora 
good While, till he had T;me for fuch Refled ons, 



( 



as thefe. Where am I going ! What am I going- about b 
Who is it has ftopt me thus I Why are tbefe ThUfUderSy 
thefe Rains jand this Lightning thus li'errible'i and whence 
are they ! and with the re (t came in this Thought, 
warm and fwift as the Lightning, which had terri- 
fied him before, What if there (Jmdd be a God! What 
will become of me then 1 Terrified with thefe Things, 
he flarts out of the Gate-way into the Street;, not- 
withflaiiding the Wet, and runs back through the 
Rain, faying to himfelt as he went, I will go among 
them no more ! When he came Home to his Cham- 
bers, he fe'Ll into dreadful Agonies of Mind,; and at 
length. broke.out thus \ What have I been doirigljpay^:! 
been denying the Power that made me ! Def^fing that 
God whofe Fire flajh'd jujinow in my Facet. And 
whichlbad mi that Mercy I, have abufed inteypofed^y^ 
might have burnt me to Death ! What kind of Q'eatijr^ 
am I ! While he was thusgiving vent;to his Re- 
flexions, a near Relation of his, a pious good 
Man, who had often ufed to fpeak very pjain-^ 
ly to him of the horrid Sin ije was^guilcy^ot,, kap- 
pened to come to vifit jhiiti.>;;.^^{ jr.^j yj |^'Hol|i;i 

The young Man had thrown" himfelf upon his 
Bed, and had with the deeped Senfe of his Mard- 
nefs, and mod ferious Reproaches of himCelf for 
his horrid Life, been expreiTing himfelf to his 
Friend, and he had been comforting hini in the 
beft Manner he could, when after a while he defir'd 
his Friend to retire, that he might be a little alone, 
and might give vent to his Thoughts with the 
more Freedom, and his Friend, taking a Book in 
his Hand, flaid in the outer Room. 

In this Interval came another Scholar to the 
Door, who was one of the wicked Company I 
mentioned jufc now : He came not to vifit this 
firft Gentleman, but to call him to go with him to 
the ufual Meeting of their dreadful Soqiety. And 
E e 3 ' knocking 



[68] 



knocking at his Chamber Door ; this Gentleman, 
who was kft in the Chamber, ftept to the Door, 
and looking through a little Grate, not only knew 
the Perfon, but knew him to be one of the wicked 
Company I have been fpeaking of: Now as he 
was very loath, his Friend fhould have fuch an In- 
terruption to the good Difpofition he was then in, 
fo above all, he was loth he fhould be perfuaded 
to go any more among that miferable Gang ; 
wherefore he opened the Door a little Way, fo 
as he was not very diftindly feen, and fpeaks aloud 
in the Perfon of his Friend thus : O Si r, BefeeJj 
them aU to refenf, for depend upon it, "there is a 
God, tell them, I fay fo ; and with that he fhut 
the Door upon him violently, giving him no Time 
to reply, and going back into his Friends Room, 
took no Notice of any Body having been at the 
Door at all. 

The Perfon who knocked at the Door, you may 
fuppofe, was one of the Leaders of the Company, 
a young Scholar of good Parts and Senfe, but de- 
bauch'd by that horrid Crew; and one that 
had made himfelf eminent, for his declarM Oppo- 
fition to all the common Notions of Religion; a 
complete Arheifl: and publickly fo, without God 
or the Defire of God in the World : However, 
(as he afterwards confeffed) the Repulfe he met with 
at the Door, and which he thought came from his 
Friend, gave him a ftrange Shock at firft, and fill'd 
him with Horror : He went down the College- 
Stairs in the greateft Confufion imaginable, and 
went mufing along a good Way, not knowing 
where he was, or whither he went, and in that 
Embarraflment of Thought went a whole Street 
out of the Way; the Words had made an unufual 
ImprefTion upon his Mind, but he had his orher 
Surprifes too i for he Thought his Friend, for he 

bcliev'd 



[^9] 

Mievd firmly, that it was be that had fp^jken to him, 
had treated him very rudely. 

Sometimes he refented it, and receded upon it 
as an Aftront, and once or twice was upon the 
Point oF going back again to him, to know the 
Reafon ot his uling him fo, and to demand Satif- 
fadion : ButftilJ the Words, THERE IS A GOD, 
dwelt upon his Mind, and what if it fiould be Jo > 
Tays he, what then ? Upon this Qiieftion to him- 
fdfj the Anlwer immediately occurr'd to his Mind, 
fi/hat then ! Why, then I am undone j for, have not 
J d: da/d War againft the very Notion, deffd all the 
Pretenders to it, as mere Rnthufiafis and Men of 
Whlmfy ? However, after thefe Thoughts his 
Mind cool'd a little again, and it ofcred to him, 
no doubt injetied by an Evil 'Spirit, that he ihoiild not 
trouble himfelf with enquiring into it one Way or 
another, but beea[y. 

This pacified him for a little While, and he 
{hook olf the Surprife he was in ; the hardned 
Temper reein^d to return, and he kept on his Way 
towards the hellifh Society, that he was gomg to 
before : But fliil the Words returned upon him, 
THERE IS A GOD, and began ro bring 
forae Terror with it upon his Mmd ; 2,nd the 
laft Words of his Friend came into his Mmd often, 
tell the?n, I fay Jo, this fiW'd him with a Curioiity 
which he could not withftand, viz,, of going back 
to his Friend,'' and enquiring of him, vv^ha^ Difco- 
veries he had made of this Kind ? iiow he came to 
have changed his Mind fo fuddenly ? and efpeciallys 
hew he was arrived to a Certainty of the Thing? 

I told you, that there had been a gre:t Shower 
of Rain, which had flopp'd the firft }Ojng Geii'" 
tleman in his Way out ; k feems the Day was i'till 
ihowery and ;a little Rain happening to fail again^ 
as this Gentleman went by a Bookfeller^s Shopi 

E e 4 lie 



[70] 

he ftops at the Door to ftand up a little out of 
the wee. 

There happens to be fitting in the Shop reading 
a Book, a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, though 
far diftering from him in his Frinciples, being a 
very fober, ftudious^, rch'gious young Man, a Stu- 
dent in Divinity of the fame College, who look-? 
ing i^P called him in, and after a few common Sa- 
lutes, he whifpers in his Ear. 

Student, I was looking in an old Book here juft 
now, and began the following fhort Dialogue ; and 
1 found four L'uks written on the Back of the Title 
Page, which put me in Mind of you. 

Jltbeifi,. Me! why did they put you in Mind of 
me ? 

Stud. I'll tell you prefently, *come hither. 

* He retires into a hack Room, and calls the 
other after him. 

Atk Well, now tell me. 

Stud. Becaufe I think they are very fin for fuch 
m atheiftical Wretch as you to read. 

Ath. You are very Civil. 

Stud. You know ypu deferve it. 

Ath. Come, let me fee them however. 

St^id. Let me look in your Face all the While 
then. 

Ath. No you flian't. # 

St^id. Then you llian^'t fee them. 

Ath. Well, let it alone then. 

Stud. Come give me your Hand, yon fhall fee 
them, if you will promife to read them over three 
Times. 

Ath. There's my Hand, I'll read them out to 
you. 



[yi ] 

Stud, ru hold your Hand all the While, becaufc 
rn be ftire of your Pertormance. 
Atth Til warrant you I'll ^ read them. 

'^ He reads. 

But if it Ihould/^// out, as who can tell? 
That there M A Y B E a God, a Heaven and 

* Hell : 
Had I not befl confider well, for fear 
'T fhou'd be too late when my Miftakes appear. 

* He held him by the Hand till that Word, 
and then Lt it go: pr effing gently one o) 
his Fingers. 

Stud. Well, what do you fay to them ? 

Ath. ru tell you my Thoughts farther by and 
by, but firft tell me what did you prefs my Hand 
for when you let it go« 

Stud. Did you feel no Motion within you, when 
you read thole Words, Inhere may be a God. 

Ath. W^hat Motion ? What do you talk of? 

Stud, Come do not deny it, for I am a Witnefs 
againfl you. 

. Ath. Witnefs, for what ? I have kill'd no Body, 
I have robb'd no Body , if you would turn Informer, 
J value not your Evidence. 

Stud. No, no, I fhall not turn Informer of that 
Kind, but I am a Witnefs in your Maker's Behalf. 

Ath. What can you Witnefs ? 

Stud, ru tell you what I can Witnefs, I can te- 
tify, that your own Confcience \^ againft you, in 
your impious denying the ExiRence of that God 
that gave you Life \ you could no£ conceal it, I tell 
you I felt it, 

Ath. 



[7^ 

Ath. How do you pretend to know, what my 
Confcience didates to me, or what the Refult of 
fecret Refledions may be m the Mind ? You may 
be miftaken, have a Care; you know you are not to 
bear falfe Witneji. 

Stud* \i\ in vain to flruggle with it, 'tis not to 
to be conceal'd, you betray 'd yourfelf, I tell you, 

Ath. How betray 'd myfelf ? you are mighty dark 
in your Expreffions. 

Stud. Did I not tell you, I v/ould look in your 
Face all the While you read? Did I not fee into the 
Diftradion of your Soul ? Did you not turn pale at 
the very Words, when your Tongue faid, Inhere 7nay 
he a God} Was there not a vifible Horror in your 
Countenance, when you read the Word HEAVEN? 
A Horror, which fignified a Senfe of your haying 
no Share in it, or Hope about it ? And did I not 
feel aT^remhling in your very Joints, as I held you 
by the Hand, when you read the Word HELL ? 

Ath, And was that ix. you held mc by the Hand 
for? 

Stud, Indeed it was , I was perfuaded I fhould 
find iti for I could never believe, but an Atheift 
had always aHell within him, even whiie.he brav'd 
it out againll: a HeU without him. 

Ath, You fptak enough to fright one; how can 
Tou fay fo pofitively a Thing, which you cannot 
be fure of? 

Stud. Never add Sin to Sin, ^cis in vain to deny 

it. 

Ath. Well, well, its none of ^ your Bufinefs ,* 
who made you my Father Confeilor ? 

* He is a little Angry, 

Stud. Nay do not be angry wich your Friend, 
and though you arc, do but take the Hint, and be 
as Angry as } ou v/ili. Ath. What 



[7J] 



Ath. What Hint, what is it you aim at ? your 
Hints are all fo general, I can make nothing of 
them. 

Stud. I aim at nothing but your eternal Felicity, 
I thought thofe Lines very appofite to your Cafe, 
and was wilhing you had them, before I happen'd 
to (ee you ; I thought, that fuch a Reflexion in 
the Cafe of Atheifm, fo natural, fo plain, efpe^ 
daily ble (fed fro?n him, ivhofe fecret Voice can effeEiually 
reach the Mind, might be fome Means to open your 
Eyes. 

Ath. Open mine Eyes ! to what ? 

Stud, To fomething that I am perfuaded you fee 
already in Part, though I find you flruggle hard 
againft yonr own Convidions. 

Ath. What is this fomething you fpeak of? 

Stud, J mean in a few Words, what the Lines 
you have read mean^ "viz.. That perhaps there may 
be a God, a Heaven, and Hell. 

Ath. 1 don I know * but there may. 

* He ohferves T'ears [lands in his Eyes^ 

Stud. Well, I fee it begins to touch you, if you 
are uncertain,that is a Step to Convidion ,' and the 
reft of the Words you have read, are amoft natural 
Inference in your Cafe. 

■ — Toi/d befl confider voell jor Fear^ 

^Tjlooud be too late vohen your Mifiakes appear * 

Ath. What would you have me confider ? 

Stud. I am not able to enter into that Part now i 
the firll: Thing is to perfuade you to look in ; liften 
to the Voice of Confcience, I am fatisfied you 
ftand convided at that Bar, you cannot plead Nut 
ntilty fheie. 

Ath. Con* 



[74] 

Atif. Convided of what ? 

Stud. Of having aded contrary to the Light of 
Nature, of Reafon, and indeed of common Senfe; 
aioft impioufly denied the God whofe Air you 
breath in, whofe Earth you tread on, whofe Food 
yoa eat, whofe Cloaths you wear, who is your 
Life, and will be your Judge. 

Ath. I do not abfolutely deny ; I tell youj-i 
don't know, but there may b^e a God. 

Stud. Dont you know but there may ! O S I R, 1 
hejeech yoti repent ; for certainly THERE ISA 
G O D,^ depend upon it, I S A Y S O. 

Atk i ou * Fright me. 

^ Heflarts.and looks fur priz.'d^ 

Stud, Indeed I think it may well Fright yon. 

Ath. But you fright me upon a quite differing 
Account from what you imagine ; I am indeed ve- 
ry much furpris'd, and fo would you coo if you 
knew the Circumftance. 

Stud. What Circumftance ? 

Ath. Pray did you hear thofe Words fpoken any 
where to Day before you fpoke them. 

Sttid. No, not I. 

Ath. Was you at Mr. 's Chamber about 

half an Hour ago ? 

Stud.l have not been there this Month paft, 
I have given over vifiting him, and all fuch as he 
is, long ago. 

Ath. Have you feen him to Day, or when did 
you laft fee him, did he fpeak thofe Words to 
you, or you to him. 

Stud. I have not feen him, fince I faw him with 
you about fourteen Days ago, when your Difcourfe 
(even both of yon) was fo Blafphcmous and fo 
Athciftical, as made my very Flearc tremble, and 

Ire- 



[75] 

I refolv'd never to come into Company with ei- 
ther of you again, and it was that very Difcourfe, 
that made me think of yon when I found thofe 
Lines in this Book ; I fhpuld think it an evident 
Difcovery of God, and what I might hope fhould 
bell: forward your Convidion, if his Providence 
fliould have fent you to this Door at that Minute, 
to receive the Hmt on this Occafion. 

Ath. There is fomething more than common^ 
in every Thing that has happened to me to Day 1 

Stud. If you would explain yourfelf a little, I 
might fay more i but you know very well, I can- 
not make the leaft guefs ar what you mean. 

Ath. Ask me no more Quellions, there mufl be 
A ^ GOD or A DEVIL in Being, 

* He looks wildly and ama£d. 

Stud. Dear Friend, there are both, depend upon 
it, but I befeech you compofe your Mind, and do 
not receive the Convidion with Horror, but witk 
Comfort and Hope. 

Ath, One or other of them has been concerned 
in what has happened to mc to Day ; it has been a 
ilrange Day with me. 

^ Stud. If it relates only to thefe Things, perhaps 
it may be of Ufe ro you to communicate the Par- 
ticulars, at leaft it may give fome vent to the Op- 
preffion of Thought, v/hich you feem to be under^ 
you cannot open your Mind to One, that has 
more earneft Deiires to do you Good, tho' per- 
iiaps not fufEcientiy furnifh'd toadvife you. 

Atb. I muft tell it or * Burft i 

Here hegave him the v^hole Story of his going 
to his Friend^ s Chamber ^ in order to take 
him vjith him to the wicked Club they had 



[ 7^ ] 

keft^ and how he had met him at the Door^ 
and faid the fame IVords to him^ that the 
Student had repeat edy and when he had 
done, fays he to his Friend ; 

and who now do you think mufl: didate the fame 

Words to him, and afterwards to yoU) to fay to me 

on the fame Occafion. 

Stud, Who do I think ! Nay, who do you think ? 

Ath. Who! The Devil, if there is a Devil, 

Stud* Why, do you think the ^ Devil preaches 

Repentance ! 

* Heflands Stock- fiill, and [ays not a Word^ 
which the other perceivings goes on. 

Pray think ferioufly, for I fee it does a little touch 
your Reafon ; is it hkely the Devil fiiould bid ei- 
ther of us, or both of us, intreat you to repent ? Is 
it the Devil think you, that would pronounce the 
Certainty of the great Truth I fpeak of?' Is it his 
Bufinefs to convince you that there is a God I 
Ath. That's very true. 

Stud, One Thing however, .I'll fay in Satan *s 
Behalf j and that is, that he never came up to yout 
height of Sinning. The Devil has frequently fee 
i up himfelf, and perfuaded poor deluded People to 
; worGiip him as a God ; but to do him Jufiice, he 
\ never had the Impudence to deny the Being of a 
; God J that's a Sin purely Human, and even among 
Men very Modern too, the Invention of witty 
Men, as they call themfelves ; a Way they have late* 
ly found out to cherifli fuperlative Wickednefs, 
and flitter themfelves, that they fhall have no Au- 
dit of their Accomprs in a Future State j of whom 
it may indeed be faid in that Particular, they have 
eut'finndthe DeviL 



[ 77 ] 

Ath. Indeed I think we have. 

Smd. I wifh you would confider a little farther 
of it. 

Ath. What can Men confider that have gone 
that Length ? 

Stud. Yes, yes, remember what St. Peter faid to 
Shnon the Sorcerer. 

Ath. What was that ?' 

Stud. Read.^^J viii. 22. Repent therefore of this 
thy l^^kkednefs, and pray God, ij perhaps the thought 
of thine Heart may be forgiven thee. 

Ath. NO) No, the laft of your Verfes is againft 
me there moil diredly. 

Its all "Too LATE now my Mi flakes appear. 

Stud. No, no. Remember what you faid, thac 
it mud be a God ox. a Devil. 

Ath. What is that to the Purpofe? — 

Stud. Why you fcem'd fatisfied, that it could not 
be from the Devil. 

Ath* But what the better am I for that, if the 
other is my Enemy ? 

Stud. Much the better if it was from God, if the 
Words you heard were from God, and that two un- 
concerted Perfons fo eminently concurred in fpeak- 
ing to you, you cannot believe God would bid you 
REPENT, if it was too late, or i^ he were your 
irreconcileable Enemy ,* on the contrary, if you 
believe it to be the Voice of his Providence, you 
ought to liften to and obey it. 

Ath. You have a jl: range Power of Perfuafion^ 
there's no refilling your Argument. 

Stud. It is not in me to perfuade, but Heaven 
may make ufe of me to convince. 

Ath. To convince is to perfuade, I am convinc'd 
that I have been a dreadful Wretch. 

Stud. I am perfuaded you were convinced of that 
before. Ath, I 



[7»] 

'Ath. I cannot deny but my Heart always ftruck 
me, a kind of chill Horror ran through my 
Veins, when I have utter'd the blafphemous Opi- 
nions that I have been drawn into, my very Blood 
flagnated at the Thought of ir, and I look back 
on it with Allonifhment. 

Stud. I tell you, I felt a Tremor even in your 
Flefh, when you read the Word-, a God, a Hea- 
ven, a Hell. 

Ath» I confefs to you my very Heart funk with- 
in me at the Words ijoho can tell; my Soul anfwer'd 
that I could tell myfelf, that it both iSy and muft 
be fo. 

Stud, Confcience is a faithful and never-failing 
Evidence in his Maker's Behalf. 

Ath. It is a very terrible Evidence againfi: mcj 
and where will it End ? 

Stud. I hope it will End where it began, I 
mean in a heavenly Call to you to Repentance. 

Ath, That is not always the Gonfequence of 
Conviftion. 

Stud, You muft therefore diftinguifh again of 
what proceeds from Heaven, v/hat from Hell, the 
Voice of God, and the Voice of the Devil j the 
firft calls upon you to repent, the laft prompts 
you to defpair. 

Ath* Defpair feems to be the natural Gonfe- 
quence of denying God ; for it (huts out the 
Power that can alone reftore the Mind. 

Stud. The greater is that Love which refufes to 
befhutout, that fends fuch a heavenly Summons 
to you to repent, and in fo eminent a Manner j it 
is not your having been an Enemy, a Blafphemer, 
a Denyer of God ; Peter denied Chriii three 
Times, nay, the third Time he even abjur'd him, 
and yet mark the U^ords^ The Lord looked on him, 
and immediately he repented. 

Ath 



C79] 

Ath, My Cafe is worfe than Pete/s. 

Stud, And yet you fee you are call'd on to 
irepent. 

Ath. I think you .are call'd to make me repent, 
there's no anfweringyou. 

Stud. Amen ; may I have the Bleffing of being 
an Inftrument to To good a Work^ there leems to 
be fomeching extraordinary in it all. 

Ath. It's all a Surprife to me, how came I hi- 
ther ! 

Stud. Nay, how came I hither ! how came this 
Book here ! who writ the Lines in the Frontif- 
piece ! how came I to read them ! 'tis all a Dream 
to me. 

Ath. How came you to think of me upon the 
reading them ! and how came I here juft at the 
* Moment, and out of my Way too 1 

^ He lifts uf his Hands and cries out. There 
is a God, certainly there isy lam con* 
vincd oj ity it mufl be fo. 

Stud. Nothing more certain ; nor is there any 
Doubt but all thefe Things are of him. 

Ath. But there are yet greater Things behind, I 
wifli you would go with me to my Friend 

Mr. 's Chamber, I am perfuaded fome- 

thing yet more extraordinary mufl: have befallen 
him. 

Stt^d. With all my Heart, t 

1i7%ey both go to the firfl Gentleman^ s Cham- 
ber^ and found hi?n at Home very much 
out of Order, but imlling enough to dif* 
courfe with them. 

F f Ath, 



[ So ] 

Ath. Well, Friend of mine, I hope you are bet-^ 
ter difpos'd to your Friends than when I faw you 
laft. 

Gent, Truly when I faw you laft, I was difpofed 
of by the Devil, and fo I doubt was you; I hope 
I (hall never come into that horrid Place again. 

Ath. What horrid Place ? 

Gent, You know where I mean, I tremble at 
the very Thoughts of the Place, and much more 
of the Company; I wifh I could prevail upon you 
to come no more among them too ; I afl'ure you 
if 1 know myfelf, and if God would affift me 
to do it, I would much rather go to a Stake to be 
burnt.. 

Srud. I rejoice in fuch an Alteratiofl, Sir, upon 
you, I hope our Friend here is of the fame Mind, 
long may it continue in you both. 

Ath. Well, pray tell us fomething of the Occa- 
fion of this happy Alteration ; for it will feem flill 
more ftrange, how you came to be inftrumental to 
my Change, if 1 know nothing of the Means that 
brought about your own. 

Gent. Mine! I aflure you, it was all from Hea- 
ven : Not the Light that Ihone about St. Paul, was 
more imtnediately from Heaven, than the Stroke 
that touched my Soul ; it is true, I had no Voice 
without, but a Voice has fpoken (I hope) efte- 
dually to my Underdanding, I had Voice enough 
to tell me, how I was in the Hands of that Power, 
that Majefty, that GOD, whom 1 had wickedly, 
and with a Hardncfs not to be exprefled, difown'd 
and deny'd. 

Stud. Pray Sir, i^ you care to have it known, 
give us fome Account of the Particulars of this 
wonderful Thing. 

Gent. 



[8i ] 

Gem. Sir, I fhall do it * freely, I think I ought 
not to conceal it. 

* H&re he gives an Account of the Surprife he 
vjas in by the Lightnings how he was 
ftopt in his Way to his wicked Com- 
fany^ and went hack to his Chamber* 

Ath. Well, now I will no more wonder at the 
Salutation you gave me, when I came to call you, 
but thank you for it. 

Gent, What Salutation ? 

Ath. Why,, when I was at your Chamber about 
tv^o Hours ago. 

Gent, You at my Chamber ! 

Ath. Nay, you need not conceal it, for I have 
told our Friend here all the Story. 

Gent, I know nothing of what you talk of, much 
lefs what you mean. 

Ath. Nay, what need you go about to conceal 
it ? I tell you I do not take it ill, I hope I may have 
Reafon to be thankful for what you faid to me, 
and look upon it as fpoken from Heaven j for I 
alTure you, it has been an Introdadion to that 
Light in my Thoughts, which I hope lliall never be 
extinguifli^d. 

Gent. Dear Friend, as I believe you are ferious, 
fo I hope you believe I am fo ; I profefs I know 
nothing of all you talk about. 

Ath. V/hy, was I not at your Door this After- 
noon, a little after the great Shower of Rain ? 

Gent. Not that I know of 

Ath. Why, did not I knock at your Chamber- 
Door, and you come to the Door yoiirfelf and 
(peak to me ? 

Gent, Not to Day, I am very fare of it. 

F f s Ath. 



[ 8i 



Ath. Am I awake ! are you Mr. am I 

fure we are all alive, and know what we are fay- 
ing, and to who ? 

Gent. I befeech you unriddle yourfelf, for I am 
furprifed 

Ath, Why, about three a Clock this Afternoon, 
I came to this Chamber- Door; I knock'd ; you 
came and open\i the Door ; I began to fpeak, you 
interrupted me, and 

Here he repeats th^ IP^ffcige at lav gey 
and his own T'houghts, and Rejent- 
ment as before, 

Gent. Depend upon it, 'cwas fome Voice from 
Heaven, it was nothing of mine,* I have not been 
at the Door fince two of the Clock, when I came 
firft in, but have been on the Bed or in my Study 
ever fince, wholly taken up with my own Thoughts, 
and very much indifpos'd. 

T'be young Man turns PaJe^ and falls 
into a Swouud. 

There was a great deal more belonging to this 
S:ory, but "'tis too long for the piefcnt Purpofe> I 
have related this Part on feveial Accounts, and it 
hits the Purpofe I am upon many Ways. 

I. Here is a vifible Evidence of God, and of 
his Being and Nature fix'd fo in the Mind, 
that not'the moft hardn'd Atheift can deny it. 
Nature recoils at every Endeavour to fup- 
prefs it, and the very Pulfation of his Blood 



fhall difcover and acknowledge it. 



2, Yet

2. Yet even in this, we fee how the Power of 
Imagination may be work'd up, by the fe- 
cret Agency of an unknown Hand, how ma- 
ny Things concurred to make this Man be- 
lieve he had feen an Apparition, and iieard 
a Voice, and yet there was nothing in it 
but the Voice of a Man unfcen and midakcn ; 
the young Man was fo furprifcd at his 
Friends declaring that he knew nothing of 
his coming there, that he concluded it had 
been ail a Vifion or Apparition that opened 
the Door, and that it was a Voice that had 
fpoken to him, of what Kind he knew not ; 
and the Refledion upon this forpriled him fo 
much as threw him into a Swound, and yet 
here was neither Vifion or Voice, but that 
of an ordinary Perfon, and one who meant 
well, and faid well 

It is not to be doubted, but that many an Ap- 
parition related with a great deal of Certainty 
in the World, and of which good Ends have fol- 
lowed, has been no more than fuch a ferious Mi- 
ftakeasthis. 

But before I leave it, let me obferve, that this 
ihould not at all hinder us from making a very 
good U(c of fuch Things j for many a Voice may 
be dircded from Heaven, that is not immediately 
Ipoken from thence ; as when the Children cried 
Hofannah to our Saviour, they fulfilled the Scrip- 
ture, which faid out of the Mouths of Babes and 
Sucklings thou haft ordainM Praife i fo doubtlefs 
he that made all Things and created ail Things i 
may appoint Inftrudion to be given by fortuitous 
Accidents, and may dired concurring Circum- 
ftances to touch and affed the Mind as much, and 
as effedualiy, as if they had been immediate and 
liiiraculoas. Thus 



[hi 



Thus was the two Perfons happening to fay the 
fame Words to the Atheift, the ftrange reading of 
thofe Lines, when the Perfon came into the Book- 
feller's Shop, the incident of h.s running into the 
Shop for Shelter, and many the like Things of the 
fame Nature, and order^'d in the fame Manner as 
the Cock crowing when Peter denied Chrift, which 
though wonderfully concurrent Vl^ith what his 
blefled Mafler had foretold, yet was no extraor- 
dinary Thing in a Cock, who naturally Crows at 
fuch a Time of the Morning. 

In a Word, all thefe Things ferve to convince 
us of a great Super-intendency of Divine Provi- 
dence in the minutefl Affairs of this World, of a 
manifeft Exiflence of the invifible World, of the 
Reality of Spirits, and of the Intelligence between 
us and them. I hope I have faid nothing of it to 
mif-gnide any Body, or to aflifl them to delude 
rhemfelves, having fpoken of it with the utmofl Se- 
rioufnefs in my Delign, and with a fincere Defire 
for a general Good.
