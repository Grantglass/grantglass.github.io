DE FOE. 



The first publication which appears in this se- 
lection has so little the air of a common novel, 
that many will probably be surprised to see it 
included under that denomination; and some, 
who consider their old friend Robinson Crusoe 
as, a mere school-boy acquaintance, may wonder 
to see him in such good company as the Sir 
Charleses and the Lady Betties of fashionable 
life. But the truth is, this favourite of our early 
years, though it has no pretensions to the graces 
of style, nor aims at touching the tender pas- 
sions, yields to few in the truth of its descrip- 
tion and its power of interesting the mind. Its 
author, DANIEL DeFoe, is a name well known 
in the political history of his age. He was bom 
in London in l66S ; his father was a butcher ; 
his education was a common one, and none of 
his works bear any marks of thSit polish and ele- 
gance of style which is the mingled result of a 
classical education, and of associating with the 
' more cultivated orders of society : but he was a 
'man of truly original genius, and possessed in 
a remarkable degree the power of giving such 
an air of truth and nature to his narrations that

they are rather deceptions than imitations. In 
that particular cast of his genius he resembled 
Swift, his antipodes in politics and religion. 
The talent of grave irony, and the attention to 
those minute circumstances, those apparently 
undesigned touches, which cause the reader to 
exclaim, "No man could surely have thought 
of this if it had not been true," were alike in 
both. To the humour of Swift, De Foe had no 
pretensions. This author was educated a dis- 
senter, and was greatly attached to the cause of 
liberty and protestantism : he was early in life 
engaged in the unfortunate rebellion of the Duke 
of Monmouth, but had the good fortune to es. 
dape the severe vengeance which was exercised 
after his defeat, and to return unmolested to 
London, where he followed his business of a 
maker of bricks and pantiles. He was not how- 
ever successful, and became insolvent ; but he 
honourably paid his creditors as soon as his cir- 
cumstances enabled him so to do. From tliis 
period he attracted great notice as a writer by a 
namber of publications, chiefly political, which 
came from his pen. One of them, entitled, 
The shorten Way with the Dissenters, drew upon 
him a severe punishment. It was written in 
1702, when the high-church party were inclined 
to persecute the sectaries. The grave ironical 
style in which it was written, at first deceived 
the public, and many thought him in earnest. 
The same thing is said to have happened to 
Swift, on the publication of his Proposalffiflr

matter differently, they oixterai the book to be 
burnt by the K^ingman ; and a protecutioii was 
begun against the publishers. De Foe had se- 
creted himself, but h(»iourably came forward to 
;Bcreen the pubUshers/and was sentenced to the 
severe and degrading punishment of the pillory, 
besides fine and imprisonments The compo- 
sure with which he bore his punishment gave 
occasion to the following sarcasm from Pope, 
who l^ated both whigs ami diseenters, 

<^ Ettlett Ott high sCdod utiAbdidk'd De l^oe." 

While he was still in prison he commenced a 
periodical publication entitled Th^ Review* It 
was published twice or thrioe a week, and be- 
sides news, domestic and political, contained 
the fiction of a club discussing various topics o( 
a miscellaneous nature, which in all probability 
gave the hint to Steele and Addison for the frame 
tney used afterwards with so much success in 
the papers of The Taller and Spectator. De Foe 
was liberated by the interposition of Harley, and 
afterwards employed by the queen in Scotiand^ 
when the union was projected. He had great 
l^nowledge of affairs of commerce and revenue, 
on which subjects he was often consulted. After 
the \mion had taken place, he wrote the history 
of it in a folio volume. It seems strange that 
one so much employed as he was at that time 
should obtain no settled provision; and still more^ 
that upon the accession of George the Second, 
wh^i the whigs were again in power, he was not 
rewarded for his sufferings in the cause of li- 
ber^ civil and religious, a ca\]kse he certainly

had at heart. But it is to be feared his integri- 
ty was not quite equai to his abilities, and he 
had given ofience by some pubUcattons which 
were at least ambiguous, and laid him open to 
the censure of writing on both sides, • He seems 
therefore from this time to have given up poli- 
tics, and to have employed his pen in compos- 
ing those works by which his name has been 
best known to posterity. Among these were hi» 
Family Imiructor and Religious Courtship. They 
both consist of dialogues on religious and moral « 
subjects, relative to the conduct of life in its va- 
rious situations and occurrences. They have 
not the least pretensions to elegance, and an air 
of religious austerity pervades the whole of them ; 
but their dramatic form of dialogues, supported 
with much nature and feeling, and the interest 
which his manner of writing has thrown into 
the familiar stories and incidents of domestic 
and common life, have made these publications, 
especially the former, exceedingly popular to 
this day among those whose religious opinions 
are similar to his own. De Foe also wrote A 
Journal of the Plague Year. It is written in 
the person of a citizen, a shopkeeper, who is sup- 
posed to have staid in the metropolis during the 
whole time of the calamity ; and the particulars 
are so striking, so awful, and so circumstantial, 
that it deceived most of his readers, and amongst 
others it is said Dr. Mead, into a belief of its 
authenticity ; — an exercise of ingenuity not to 
be commended ; — though, after all,the particulars 
were probably most of them true, though the 
rclater was fictitious. De Foe also wrote many

Bt. FOE.' V 

I^ieces in verse, which, though they had no pre- 
tensions to poetry properly so called, had many 
passages that were nervous and pointed. One, 
entitled Reformation of Manners, contains a 
strong invective against the slave-trade. A sa- 
tire called The true-born Englishman was much 
read in its time, though it gave great ofience. Its 
purport was to parry the attacks made against 
king WiUiam as a foreigner, by showing that 
the English themselves were a very mixed breed, 
who had no purity of blood to boast of. — But 
the work by which this writer is best known, 
both at home and abupoad, is that which is pre- 
sented to the public m this selection, The Life 
and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. 

It has be6n translated into most modem lan- 
guages, has passed through' numberless editions, 
and has always been found particularly agree- 
able to the taste of youth. The story turns upon 
tlie ingenuity and contrivance with which a so- 
litary being, wrecked upon a desert island, pro- 
vides for his subsistence, and by degrees sup- 
plies himself with all the most desirable ac- 
commodations of life. The reader is wonder- 
fully delighted to see him acquire one comfort 
after another, and grows at length almost in love 
with his solitude. Some have thought the author 
has shortened his labour too much by allowing 
him so many articles out of the ship; but with- 
out them the story, tl)ough it might have 
displayed more mechanical invention, would 
have gone on rather heavily. Besides the inge- 
nuity of contrivance displayed in this work, 
there are many circumstances which strongly*

aflbct tho feelings. The terror inspired by the 
impres&ion of the foot in the sand ; the lumi- 
nous eyesy glaring like two lamps^ at the bottom 
of the cave ; and the affectionate simplicity of 
poor Friday, agitate the mind in various ways. 
The latter has a great deal of simple and natural 
pathos ; and nothing in description can be more 
Hvely than the account of his meeUog with his 
old father, who is ^aved from the cannibals, and 
of the fond and animated expressions of his af- 
fection to him both then, and when he meets 
bim again on the island. 

A strong tincture of religious feeling runs 
^ough the work, not unmixed with superstition. 
Dreams, omens, and impressions on the mind oc- 
cur, in which i)e Foe was either a believer, or at 
least he knew how to take advantage of them in 
impressii^ his readers. That he was not very scru- 
pulous in this point, appears from the followis^ 
anecdote : — Drelincourt on Death, a grave Feligi* 
ous book, not ^>ing off so well as the booksellers 
wished, they appbed, it is said, to De Foe to 
write something which might give it a lift ; ios 
which purpose he composed The AffaritioH of 
Mrs. VeaL Though pure invention, it was told 
in so natural and circumstantial a way, that it 
gained credit with hundreds of readers ; and 
being prefixed to the work, the impression sold 
rapidly. — It is said that Robinson Crusoe has 
given many a boy a predilection for a seafaring 
life ; which is not unlikely ; for the variety of 
adventures it contains kindles curiosity, and even 
when the subject of th^oci is in his most forlorn 
and aobtajryr state, there if somethix^ gratifying

to the imagination in contemplating him ae kiqg 
and owner of every tiling about him; 

^ I am monarch of aU I survey^ 
My right there is none to dispute^** 

Among the striking passages of the work may be 
mentioned the encounter with the wolves and 
bears in crossing the Pyrenees. The second 
part, like most second parts, is much inferior 
to the first. We lose our old acquaintance the 
Solitary, and are presented with a Missionary in 
his stead. The story is confused with a variety 
of adventures, in which however the author ex- 
hibits his knowledge of the course of trade, 
which he was well acquainted with, and man- 
ners and customs which he had heard or read of, 
in China, Tartary, Siberia, and other countries. 
The most striking passage in this volume is the 
lively description of the sufferings of a young 
woman dying in the agonies of hunger. De 
Foe has shown a candour, at that time not very 
common, in giving a very amiable character or 
9, French catholic priest ; but the adventure of 
burning the Tartar idol, if it is meant as a heroic 
exploit, shows very confused ideas of justice* — 
It must not be concealed that the originality of 
this work has been disputed to De Foe from the 
following circumstance. One Alexander Sel- 
kirk really passed some years alone on the 
island of Juan Fernandez, and a sketch qf his 
story had been given in the relaUon of Woodes 
Rogers. This might very probably give tjie first 
hint of )m romance ; but as to the report that

be possessed papers of Selkirk's and had made 
unacknowledged use of them, it appears to have 
been propagated without any solid ground what- 
ever; and indeed the situation in which Robin- 
son Crusoe is placed, and from which most of 
the incidents arise, materially difiers from that 
of Selkirk. — De Foe wrote many other lives and 
adventures, and employed his ready pen to the 
end of his laborious life, which took place in 
London^ in April 1731, in his 68th year.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



I WAS bo«p4n the year 16S% in the city of York, 
of a good family, though not of that country, my 
father beine a foreigner of Bremen, who settled 
first at HulL He got a good estate by merchandise, 
and, leavmg off his trade, lived afterwards at York; 
from whence he had married my mother, whose re- 
lations were named Robinson, a ^ry good family 
in that country, and from whom I ^as called Ro- 
binson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption 
of words in England, we are now called, nay, we 
call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe ; and so 
my companions always called me. 

I bad two elder brothers, one of whom was lieu- 
tenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in 
Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous colo- 
nel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near 
Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became of 
my second brother, I never knew, any more than 
mv father and mother did know what was become 
oi me.

2 ADVENTURES OF 

Being the third son of tiie family, and not bred 
to any trade, my head began to be filled very early 
with rambling thoughts. My father, who was very 
ancient, had given me a competent share of learn- 
ing, as far as house-education and a country free- 
school generally go, and designed me for the law ; 
but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to 
sea : and my inclination to this led me so strongly 
against the will, nay, the commands of my father, 
and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my 
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be 
something fatal in that propension of nature, tend- 
ing directly to the life of misery which was to befall 
me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious 
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was 
my design. He called me one morning into his 
chamber^ where he was confined by the gout, and 
expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject: 
he asked me what reasons, more than a mere wan- 
dering inclination, I had for leaving his house, and 
my native country, where I might be well intro- 
duced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by 
application and industry, with a life of ease and 
pleasure. He told roe it was for men of desperate 
fortunes, on one hand, or of aspiring, superior 
fortunes, on the other, who went abroad upon ad- 
ventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves 
famous in undertakings of a nature out of the com- 
mon road ; that these things were all either too far 
above me, or too far below me ; that min0 was the 
middle state, or what might be called. the upper 
station of low life, which he had found, by long 
experience, was the best state in the world, the 
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the 
miseries and hardships, tiiie labour and sufferings of 
the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed

ROBINSON CRUSOE. S 

with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the 
upper part of mankind: he told me, I might judge 
of the happiness of this state by one thing, viz. that 
this was the state of life which all other people en- 
vied ; that kings have frequently lamented the mi- 
serable consequences of being bom to great things^ 
and wished they had been placed in the middle of 
two extremes, between the mean and the great; 
that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the 
just standard of true felicity, when he prayed to 
have neither poverty nor riches. 

He bade me observe it, and I should always find, 
that the calamities of life were shared among the 
upper and lower part of mankind: but that the 
middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not 
exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or 
lower part of mankind : nay, they were not sub- 
jected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, 
either of body or mind, as those were, who, by 
vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies, on one 
hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and 
mean and insufficient diet, on the other hand, bring 
distempers upon themselves by the natural conse- 
quences of their way of living; that the middle 
station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues, 
and all kind of enjoyments ; that peace and plenty 
were the handmaids of a middle fortune ; that tem- 
perance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all 
agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, 
were the blessings attending the middle station of 
life ; that this way men went silently and smoothly 
through the world, and comfortably out of it, not 
embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the 
head) not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, 
or harassed with perplexed circumstances, which 
rob the soul of peace, »id the body of rest; not

tug lust of ambition for great things ; but, in easy 
circumstances, sliding gently through the world, 
and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without 
the bitter; feeling that thej are happy, and learn- 
ing, by every day's expenence, to know it more 
sensibly. 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the 
most affectionate manner, not to play the young 
man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which 
nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed 
to have provided against; that I was under no ne- 
cessity of seeking my bread ; that he would do well 
for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the 
station of life which he had been just recommend- 
ing to me; and that if I was not very easy and 
happy in the world, it must be my mere fate, or 
fault, that must hinder it ; and that he should have 
nothing to answer for, having thus discharged hi» 
duty in warning me against measures which he 
knew would be to my hurt : In a word, that as he 
would do very kind tnings for me if I would stay 
and settle at nome as he directed ; so he would not 
have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me 
any encouragement to go away: and, to close all, 
he told me 1 had my elder brother for an example, 
to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions 
to keep him from going into the Low Couptry 
wars ; but could not prevail, his young desires 
prompting him to run into the army, where he was 
killed ; and though, he said, he would not cease to 
pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, 
that if I did take this foolish step, God would not 
bless me ; arid I would have leisure, hereafter, to 
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, ^ when 
there might be none to assist in my recovery. 
. I observed, in this last part of his discourse,

father did not know it to be so himself; I say^ I 
observed the tears run down his face very plentiful- 
Ijf especially when he spoke of my brother who 
was killed ; and that, when he spoke of my havkig 
leisure to repent, and none to asaist me^ he was so 
Bftored, that he broke off the discourse, and told 
me his heart was so full, he could say no more to me« 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse r as» 
indeed, who comd be otherwise ? and I resolved not 
to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at 
home, according to my father's desire. But alas! 
a few days wore it all off : and, in ^ort, to prevent 
any of my father's further importunities, in a few 
weeki after I resolved to run quite away from him. 
However, I did not act so hastily, neither, as my 
first heat of resolution prompted ; but I took my 
mother, at a time when I thought her a little plea- 
santer than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts 
were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I 
riiottld never settle to any thing with resolution 
enou^ to go through with it, and my father had 
better give me his coment ihan force me to go 
without it; tliat I was now eighteen years old« 
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or 
clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure, if I did, I 
should never serve out my time, and I should cer- 
tainly run away from my master before my time 
was out, and go to sea ; and if she would speak to 
my father to let me make but one voyage abroad, if 
I came home again, amd did not like it, I would go. 
no more ; and I would promise, by a double dili* 
gence, to recover the time I had lost« 

Hiis put my mother into a great passion : she

speak to my father upon any such a subject ; that

consent to any thing so much for my hurt ; and

that she wondered how I could think of any sacfa 
thing, after such a discourse as I had from my fa-> 
ther, and such kind and tender expressions as she 
knew my father had used to me : and that, id 
short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for 
me ; but I might depend I should never have their 
consent to it : that for her part, she would not have 
so much hand in my destruction ; and I should 
never have it to say, that my mother was willing 
when my father was not. 

Though my mother refused to move it to my fa- 
ther, yet, as 1 have heard afterwards, she reported 
all the discourse to him ; and that my father^ aft;er 
showing a ereat concern, at it, said to her with a 
sigh, That Doy might be happy, if he wouldstay 
at home; but, if he goes abroad, he will be the 
most miserable wretch that ever was bom : I can 
give no consent to it. 

It was not till almost a year after this that I 
broke loose ; though in the mean time I continued 
obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to busi- 
ness, and frequently expostulating^ with my &ther 
and mother about their being so positively deter- 
mined against what they knew my inclinations 
prompted me to. But, being one day at Hull, 
whither I went casually, and without any purpose 
of making an elopement at that time, and one of 
my companions then going to London by sea in his 
father's ship, and prompting me to go with them 
by the common allurement of sea-faring men, viz. 
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, 
I consulted neither father nor mother any more, 
nor 80 much as sent them word of it; but left them 
to hear of it as they might, without asking God's 
blessing, or my father's, without any consideration 
of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill 
hour, God knows.

ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. 7 

On the iBt of September, 1651, 1 went on board 
ft ship bound for London. Never any young^ ad- 
venturer's misfortunes, I believe, began earlier, or 
continued longer, than mine! The ship had no 
sooner got out of the H umber, than the wind began 
to blow, and the waves to rise, in a most frightful 
manner ; and as I had never been at sea before, I 
was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in 
mind : I began now seriously to reflect upon what 
I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the 
judgement of Heaven, for wickedly leaving my 
father's house, and abandoning my duty. All the 
good counsel of my parents, my father's tears, and 
my mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my 
mmd; and my conscience, which was not yet come 
to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since, 
reproached me with the contempt of advice, and 
the breach of my duty to God and my father. 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, 
which I had never been upon before, went very 
high, though nothing like what I have seen many 
times since : no, nor what I saw a few days after ; 
but, such as it was, enough to affect me then, who 
was but a young sailor, and had never known any 
thing of the matter. I expected every wave would 
have swallowed us up, ana that every time the ship 
fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow <^ 
the sea, we should never rise more ; and in this 
agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions, 
that if it would please God to spare my life this 
voyage, if ever 1 got my foot once on dry land, I

take his advice, and never run myself into such mi* 
series as these any more. Now I saw plainly the

tion of life ; how easy, how comfortable he had lived 
all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests

at sea or troubles on shore ; and I resolved that I 
would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to 
my father. 

These wise and sober thoughts continued during 
the storm, and indeed some time after; but the 
next day, as the wind was abated, and the sea calm* 
er, I began to be a little inured to it. However, I 
was very grave that day, being also a little sea-sick 
still : but towards night the weather cleared up, the 
wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening 
followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear, and 
rose so the next morning ; and having little or no 
wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, 
the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that 
I ever saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no 
more sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with won- 
der upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the 
day before, and could be so calm and pleasant in a 
litUe time after. 

And now, lest ray good resolutions should conti- 
nue, my companion, who had indeed enticed me 
away, came tcr me, and said. Well, Bob, clapping 
me on the shoulder, how do you do after it? 1 
warrant yott were frightened, wa'nt you, last night, 
when it blew but a cap-full of wind? — A cap-full, 
do you call it ? said J ; 'twas a terrible storm. — 
A storm, you fool! replies he, do you call that 
a storm ? Why, it was nothing at all ; give us but a 
good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of 
such a squall of wind as that : you are but a fresh- 
water sailor. Bob ; come, let us make a bowl of 
punch, and we*ll forget all that. D'ye see what 
charming weather 'tis now? To make short this 
sad part of my story, we wwit the way of all sailors ; 
the punch was made, and 1 was made drunk with it ; 
and in that one night's wickedness i drowned all 
"uy repentance, all my reflections upon my past

conduct, and all my resolutions for the future. In 
a word, as the sea was returned to, its smoothness 
of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of 
the storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, 
my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up 
by the sea forgotten, and the current of my former 
desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and pro- 
mises I had made in my distress. 1 found, indeed, 
some intervals of reflection ; and serious thoughts 
did, as it were, endeavour to return again some- 
times; but I sHook them off, and roused myself 
from them, as it were from a distemper, and, ap- 
plying, myself to drink and company, soon mastered 
the return of those fits, — for so I oedled them ; and 
I had in five or six days got as complete a victory 
over conscience as any young fellow, that resolved 
not to be troubled with it, could desire. But I was 
to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as 
in such cases generally it does, resolved t^ leave me 
entirely without excuse : for if I would not take this 
for a deliverance, the n^t was to be such a one as 
the worst and most hardened wretch among us 
would confess both the danger and the mercy of. 
The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into 
Yarmouth roads ; the wind having been contrary, 
and the weather calm, we had made but little way 
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to 
an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing 
contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight 
days, during which time a great many ships from 
Newcastle came into the same roads, as the common 
harbour where the ships mi^t wait for a wind for 
the River. We had not, however, rid here so long, 
but we should have tided up the river, but that the 
wind blew too fresh; and, after we had lain four or 
five days, blew very hard. However, the roads being 
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage 
good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men

were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive 
of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, 
afler the manner of the sea. But the eighth day, 
in the morninff, the wind increased, and we had all 
hands at work to strike our topmasts, and make 
every thing snug and close, that the ship might 
ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went 
very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, 
shipped several seas, and we thought, once or twice, 
our anchor had come home ; upon which our master 
ordered out the sheetoanchor ; so that we rode with 
two anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to 
the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed ; and 
now I began to see terror and amazement in the 
faces of even the seamen themselves. The master 
was vigilant in the business of preserving the ship ; 
but, as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I 
could hear him softly say to himself, several times, 
Lord, be merciful to us ! we shall be all lost ; we 
shall be all undone ! and tlie like. During these 
first hurries I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, 
which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my 
temper. I could ill re-assume the first penitence, 
which I had so apparently trampled upon, and har- 
dened myself against ; I thought that the bitterness 
of death had been past, and that this would be no- 
thing too, like the nrst : but when the master him- 
self came by me, as I said just now, and said we 
should be all lost, I was dreadfully frightened. I 

Sot up out of my cabin, and looked out ; but such a 
ismal sight I never saw ; the sea went mountains 
high, and broke upon us every three or four mi- 
nutes. When I could look about, I could see no- . 
thing but distress around us ; two ships, that rid 
near us, we found had cut their masts by the board, 
being deeply laden; and our men cried out that a 
ship, which rid about a mile a-head of us, waa

AOBINSON CRUSOE. 11 

foundered. Two more ships, being driven from 
their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at 
all adventures, and that with not a mast standing. 
The light ships fared the best, as not so much la« 
bouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove, 
and came close by us, running away, with only 
their spritsai^ out, before the wind. Toward even- 
ing, the mate and boatswain begged the master oC 
our ship to let them cut away the foremast, which 
he was very loth to do ; but the boatswain protest- 
ing to him, that if he did not, the ship would 
founder, he consented ; and when they had cut 
away the foremast, the mammast stood so loose, 
and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to 
cut it away also, and make a clear deck. 

Any one may judge what a condition I must b^ 
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who 
had been in such a fright before at but a Itltle. 
But if I can express, at this distance, the thoughts 
I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more 
horror of mind upon accoimt of my former convic- 
tions, and the having returned from them to the 
resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was 
at death itself; and these, added to tlie terror of the 
storm, put me into such a condition, that I can by 
no words describe it, but the worst was not come 
yet ; the storm continued with such fury, that the 
seamen themselves acknowledged they had never 
known a worse. We had a good ship, but she was 
deep laden, and so wallowed in the sea, that the 
seamen every now and then cried out, she would 
founder. It was my advantage, in one respect, that 
I did not know what they meant by founder^ till 
I inquired. However, the storm wds so violent, 
that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the 
boatswain, and some others, mrore sensible than the 
rest^ at their prayers> and expecting every moment

the ship wpuld go to the bottom. In the middle of 
the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, 
one of the men, that had been down on purpose to 
see, cried out, we had sprung a leek; another 
said, there was four feet water in the ho1d« Then 
all hands were called to the pump. At that very 
word, my heart, as 1 thought, 4ied within me ; and 
I fell backwards upon tlie side of my bed, where I 
sat in the cabin. However, the men roused me, and 
told me, that I, who was able to do nothing be- 
fore, was as well able to pump as another: at 
which I stirred up and went to the pump, and work- 
ed very heartily. While this was aoing, the master 
fieeing some light colliers who, not able to ride out 
the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea, 
and would not come near us, ordered us to fire a 
gun, as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing 
what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought 
the ship had broke, or some dreadful thing had hap- 
pened. In a word, I was so surprised, that I fell 
down in a swoon. As this was a time when every 
body had his own life to think of, no one minded 
me, or what was become of me : but another man 
stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside 
widi his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead ; 
and it was a great while before I came to myself. 

We worked on ; but the water increasing in the 
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder ; 
and though the storm began to abate alittle, yet as 
it was not possible she could swim till we might 
run into a port, so the master continued firing guns 
for help ; and a light ship, who had rid it out just 
a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It 
was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, 
but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for 
the boat to lie near the ship's side ; till at last the 
men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives

to save oursy our men cast them a rope over the 
stem with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a 
^eat length, which they, afler great labour and 
hazard, took hold of, and wef h^ed them close 
under our stem, and got all into their boat. It was 
to no purpose for them or us, afler we were in the 
boat, to think of reaching their own ship ; so all 
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in to- 
wards shore as much as we could ; and our master 
promised them, that if the boat was staved upon 
shore, he wotdd make it good to their master; 
so partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went 
away to the northward^ sloping towards the shore 
almost as far as Winterton-Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an 
hour out of our ship when we saw her sink ; and 
then I understood, for the first time, what was 
meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must ac- 
knowledge, I had hardly eyes to look up when the 
seamen told me, she was sinking ; for, from that 
moment, thev rather put me into the boat, than 
that I might be said to go in. My heart was, as it 
were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly 
with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was 
yet before me. 

While^we were in tliis condition, the men yet la- 
bouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore, 
we could see (when, our boat mounting the waves, 
we were able to see the shore) a great many people 
running along the strand, to assist us when we 
should come near : but we made slow way towards 
the shore; nor were we able to reach it, till, being 
past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off 
to the westward, towards Cromer, and so the land 
broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we 
got in, and, though not without much difficulty, 
got all safe on shpre, and walked afterwards on foot

to Yarmouth ; where, as unfortunate men, we were 
used with great humanity, as wtll by the magistrates 
of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by 
the particular merchants and owners of ships ; and 
had money given us sufficient to carry us either 
to London or back to Hull, as we thought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to 
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy ; and 
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour s para-^ 
ble, had even killed the fatted calf for me ; for, 
hearing the ship I went in was cast away in Yar- 
mouth roads, it was a great while before he had any 
assurance that I was not drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on with an obstinacy 
that nothing could resist ; and though I had several 
times loud calls from my reason, and my more com- 
posed judgement, to go home, yet I had no power 
to do it. — I know not what to call this, nor will I 
urge that it is a secret, over-ruling decree, that hur- 
ries us on to be the instruments of our own destruc- 
tion, even though it be before us, and that we rush 
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but 
some such decreed unavoidable misery attending, 
and which it was impossible for me to escape, could 
have pushed me forward against the calm reason- 
ings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, 
and against two such visible instructions as I had 
met with in my first attempt. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me be- 
fore, and who was the master's son, was now less 
forward than I : the first time he spoke to me afler 
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or 
three days, for we were separated in the town to 
several quarters ; I say, the first time he saw me, it 
appeared his tone was altered, and, looking very 
melancholy, and shaking his head, asked me how I 
did : telling his father who I was, and how I had

come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go far- 
ther abroad. His father, turning to me, with a 
grave. and concerned tone, Young man, says he^ 
you ought never to go to sea any more ; you 
ought to take this for a plain and visible token, that 
you are not to be a sea-faring man. — Why, sir? 
said I; will you go to sea no more? — That u$ 
another case, said he ; it is my calling, and there* 
fore my duty ; but as you made this voyage for a 
trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you of 
what you are to expect if .you persist. Perhaps this 
has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah m 
the ship of Tarshish. — Pray, continues he, what 
are you, and on what account did you go to sea? 
Upon that I told him some of my story ; at the end 
of wliich he burst out with a sUange kind of pas^ 
sion. What had I done^ said he, that such an 
Bnhappy wretch should come into my ship! I would 
not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for 
a thousand pounds. This indeed was, as I said, an 
excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by 
the sense of his loss^ and was farther than he could 
lave authority to go. — ^However, he afterwards talk- 
ed very gravely to me ; exhorted me to go back to 
my &ther, and not tempt Providence to my ruin ; 
lold me, I might see a visible hand of Heaven 
against me ; and, young man, said he, depend upoQ 
it, if you do npt go back, wherever you go, you ' 
will meet widi nothing but disasters and disap- 
pointments, till your lather s words are fulfilled 
upon you. 

We parted soon after, for I made him little an- 
swer, and I saw him no more ; which way he went» 
I know not : as fo^ me, having some money in my 
pocket, I traveled to London by land; and there» 
as well as on the road, had many struggles with my- 
self what course of life I should take, and wbetlier

I should go home or go to sea. As to going homey 
shame opposed the best motions that offered to my 
thoughts ; and it immediately occurred to me how 
I should be laughed at among the neighbours, and 
should be ashamed to see, not my father and mother 
only, but even every body else. From whence I 
have often since observed, how incongruous and ir- 
rational the common temper of mankind is, espe- 
cially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide 
them in such cases, viz. that they are not ashamed 
to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent ; not ashamed 
of the action for which they ought justly to be 
esteemed fools ; but are ashamed of the returning^ 
which only can make them be esteemed wise men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some 
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what 
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance 
continued to going home ; and as I stayed awhile, 
the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore 
off; and, as that abated, the little motion I had in 
my desires to a return wore off with it, till at last I 
quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out 
for a voyage. That evil influence which carried me 
first away from my father's house, that hurried me 
into the wild and indigested notion of raising my 
fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly 
upon me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and 
to the entreaties, and even the commands of my 
father ; I say, the same influence, whatever it was, 
presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to 
my view ; and I went on board a vessel bound to 
the coast of Africa ; or, as our sailors vulgarly call 
it, a voyage to Guinea. 

It was my great misfortune, that in all these ad- 
ventures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, 
though I might indeed have worked a little harder 
than ordinary, yet, at the same time, I had learned

ROBINSON CBUSO£. |7 

the duty and office of a foremast-man, and in time 
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant* 
if not a master : but as it was always my fate to 
choose for the worse, so I did here ; ror having mo- 
ney in my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, 
I would always go on board in the habit of a gentle- 
man ; and so I neither had any business in the ship^ 
nor learned to do any. It was my lot; first of all, 
to fall into pretty good company in London ; which 
does not always happen to such loose and misguided 
young fellows as 1 then was ; the devil, generally, 
not omitting to lay some snare for them very early. 
But it was not so with me : I first fell acquainted 
with the master of a ship, who had been on the 
coast of Guinea, and who, having had very good 
success there, was resolved to go again. He, txudng 
a fancy to my conversatioa, whicn was not at all 
disagreeable at that time, and hearing me say I 
had a mind to see the world, told me, that if I 
would go the voyage with him, I should be at no 
expense ; I should be his mess-mate and his com- 
panion ; and if I could carry any-thing with me, I 
should have all the advantage of it that the trade 
would admit ; and perhaps I might meet with some 
encouragement. I embraced tl^ offer, and, enter- 
ing into a strict friendship with this captain, who 
was an honest and plain-dealing man, I went the 
voyage with him, and carried a small adventure with 
me ; which, by the disinterested honesty of my 
friend the captain, I increased very considerably; 
for I carried about ^OL in such toys and trifles as 
the captain directed me to buy. This 40/. I had 
mustered together by the assistance of some of my 
relations whom I corresponded with ; and who, I 
believe, got my father, or, at least, my mother, to 
contribute so much as that to my first adventure. 
This was the only voyage which 1 may say was suc-

Cessful in all my adventures, and which I owe to the 
integrity and honesty of my friend the captain; 
under whom also I got a competent knowledge of 
the mathematics and the rules of navigation, learned 
' how to keep an account of the ship's course, take 
an observation, and, in short, to understand some 
things that were needful to be understood by a 
sailor ; for, as he took delight to instruct me, I took 
delight to learn ; and, in a word, this voyage made 
me both a sailor and a mierchant : for I brought 
home 5lb. 9oz. of gold-dust for my adventurcy 
which jrielded me in London, at my return, almost 
300/. and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts 
which have since so completed my ruin. Yet even 
in this voyage I had my misfortunes toa; particu-^ 
larly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into 
a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the cli- 
mate ; our principal trading being upon the coast, 
from the latitude of 15 degrees norto, even to the 
Line itself. 

I was now s^ up for a Guinea trader ; and m^ 
firiendy to my great misfortune, dying soon after his 
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again ; and 
I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his 
mate in the former voyage, and had now got the 
command of the ship. This was the unhappiest 
voyage that ever man made ; for though I did not 
carry quite 100/ of my new-gained wealth, so that I 
had 200/. left, and which I lodged with my friend's 
widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into ter- 
rible misfortunes in this voyage : and the first was 
this, viz."Our ship, making her course towards the 
Canary Islands, or rather between those islands and 
the African shore, was surprised, in the grey of the 
morning) by a Turkish rover, of Sallee, who gave 
chase to us with all the sail she could make. We 
crowded also as much canvas as our yards would

fibread, or our masts carry, to get cliear ; but finding 
the pirate gamed upon us, and would certainly come 
up with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight, our 
ship having 12 guns, and tlie rover 18. About 
three in the afternoon he came up with us ; and 
bringing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, 
instead of athwart our stern^ as he intended, we 
brought eight of our guns to beiu: on that side, and 
poured in a broadside upon him, which made him 
sheer off again, after returning our fire, and pouring 
in also his small shot from near 200 men wnich he 
had oh board. However, we had not a man touched, 
all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack 
us again, and we to defend ourselves ; but laying us 
«on board the next time upon our other quarter, he 
entered 60 men upon our decks, who immediately 
fell to cutting and hacking the sails and rigging. 
We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powder- 
chestSi and such like, and cleaned, our deck of them 
twice. However, to cut short this melancholy part 
of our storV) our shijp being disabled, and three of 
our men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged 
to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a 
port belonging to the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at 
first I apprehended ; nor was I carried up the coun- 
try to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men 
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as 
his proper prize, and made his slave, being young 
and nimble, and fit for his business. At this sur- 
prising change of my circumstances, from a mer- 
chant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly over- 
whelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's 
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miser- 
able, and have none to relieve me ; which I thought 
was now so effectually brought to pass, that it could 
niot be worse ; that now the hand of Heav«i had

overtaken me> and I was undone, without redemp- 
tion. But, alas ! this was but a taste of the misery 
I was to go through, as will appear in the sequel of 
this story. 

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home 
to his house, so I was in hopes he would take me 
with him when he went to sea again, believing that 
it would, some time or other, be his fate to be taken 
by a Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and that 
then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of 
mine was soon taken away ; for when he went to 
sea, he lefl me on shore, to look afler his little 
garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves 
about his house ; and when he came home again 
from his cruise, he ordered me to he in the cabin, 
to look af^er the ship.^ 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and 
what method I might take to effect it, but found no^ 
way that had the least probability in it. Nothing 
presented to make the supposition of it rational ; 
ior I had nobody to communicate it to that would 
embark with me ; no fellow-slave, no Enfflishman, 
Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself; so that 
for two years, though I often pleased myself with 
the imagination, yet I never had the least encourag* * 
ing prospect of putting it in practice. 

After about two years, an odd circumstance pre- 
sented itself, which put the old thought of making 
some attempt for my Hberty again in my head. My 
> patron lying at home longer than usual, without 
fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want 
of money, he used constantly, once or twice a week, 
sometimes oflener, if the weather was fair, to take 
the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a-fish* 
ing ; and as he always took me and a young Moresco 
with him to row the boat, we made him very merry, 
and I proved very dexterous in catching lish, inso-

much that sometimes he would send me with a 
Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth/ the Mo^ 
resco, as tiiey called him, to catch a dish of fish for 
him. 

It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a 
stark calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that Uiough 
we were not half a league from the shore, we lost 
sight of it; and rowing, we knew not whithef, or 
which way, we laboured all day and all the next 
night, and when the morning came, we found we 
had pulled off to sea, instead of pulling in for the 
shore, and that we were at least two leagues firom 
the shore: however, we got well in again, tlioiieh 
with a great deal of labour, and some danger, ror 
the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the mofn- 
ing ; but particularly we were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned b v this disaster, resolved 
to take more care of himselif for the future ; and 
having lying by him the long-boat of our English 
ship he hacT taken, he resolved he would not go 
a-fishing any more without a compass and some 
provision ; so he ordered the carpenter of the ship, 
who was an English slaye, to bwld a little state* 
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like 
that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it, to 
steer and haul home the main sheet, and room be- 
fore for a hand or two to 9tand and work the sails. 
' She saDM with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton 
sail, and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin, 
which lay very snug and low, and had in it room 
for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to 
eat on, with some small lockers to put in some bot- 
tles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink, and 
particularly his bread, rice, and coffee. 

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, 
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him, 
he never went without me; It happened, that he

some distinction in that place, and for whom he had 
provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent on 
board the boat, overnight, a larger store of provi- 
sion than ordinary, and had ordered me to get 
ready three fusees, with powder and shot, which 
were on board his ship, for . that they designed 
some sport of fowling as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready as he directed, and waited 
the next morning with the boat washed clean, her 
ensign and pendants out, and every thing to accom- 
modate his guests; when, by and by, my patron 
caine on board alone, and told me his guests had 
put off going, upon some business that fell out, and 
ordered me, with the naan and boy, as usual, to go 
out with the boat, and catch them some fi^, for 
that his friends were to sup at his house ; and com* 
manded, that as soon as I had got some fish, I 
should bring it home to his house : all whidi I pre- 
pared to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance 
di^rted into my thoughts, for npw I found I was 
like to have a little ship at my command ; and mj 
master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself 
not for a fishing business^ but for a voyage ; though 
I knew not, neither did I so much as consider, 
whither I should steer ; for any where, to get out 
of that place, was my way. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to 
speak to this Moor, to get something for our sub- 
sistence on board ; for I told him we must not pre- 
sume to eat of our patron's bread : he said, that was 
true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or bis- 
cuit, of their kind, and three jars with fresh water, 
into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of 
bottles stood, which it was evident^ by the makfiti

were taken out of some English prize, and I eon« 
veyed them into the boat while the Moor was on 
shore, as if they had been there before for our mas- 
ter. I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wa* into 
the boat, which weighed above half a hundred- 
weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, 
a saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use 
to us afterwards, especially the wax, to make can- 
dles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he in- 
nocently came into also: his name was Ismael, 
whom they call Muley, or Moley : so I called to him, 
Moley, said I, our patron's guns are on board the 
boat, can you not get a little powder and shot ? 
it may be we may kill some alcamies (fowls like our 
curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the 

gunner's stores in the ship — Yes, says he, I will 
ring some ; and accordingly he brought a great 
leather pouch, which held about a pound and a halt 
of powder, or rather more, and another with shot, 
that had five or i^ix pounds, with some bullets, and 
put all into the boat : at the same time I found 
some powder of my master's in the great cabin, 
with which I filled one of the large bottles in the 
case, which was almost empty, pouring what was in 
it into another; and thus furnished with every 
thing needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. 
The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, 
knew who we were, and took no notice of us ; and 
we were not above a mile out of the port, before we 
hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish. The 
wind blew from' N.N.E. which was contrary to my 
desire; for, had it blown southerly, I had been sure 
to have made the coast of Spain, and at last reached 
to the bay of Cadiz: but my resolutions were, blow 
which way it would, I would be gone from the hor- 
rid )>lace where I was, and leave the rest to fate. 
After we had fished sdme time and catched no*

thing, for when I had fish on my hook I would not 
pull them up, that he might not see them, I said to 
the Moor, ** This will not do ; our master will not 
be thus served ; we must stand farther off." He, 
thinking no harm, agreed ; and being at the head 
of the boat, set the sails ; and as I had the helm, I 
run the boat near a league farther, and then brought 
to, as if I would fish. Then giving the boy the 
helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, 
and 1 took him by surprise, with my arm under his 
waist, and tossed him clear overboard into the isea. 
He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and 
called to me, begged to be taken in, and told me he 
would go all the world over widi me. He swam so 
jBtrong after the boat, that he would have reached 
me very quickly, there being but little wind ; upon 
which t stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of 
the fowling pieces, I presented it at him, and told 
him, I had done him no hurt, and if he would be 
quiet, I would do him. none: But, said I, you 
swim well enough to reach the shore, and the sea is 
calm ; make the best of your way to shore, and I 
will do you no harm: but if you come near the boat, 
I will shoot you through the head ; for I am re- 
solved to have my liberty. So he turned himself 
about, and swam for the shore; and 1 make no 
doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an 
excellent swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this 
Moor with me and have drowned the boy, but there 
was no venturing to trust him. When he was gone, 
I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and 
said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me 
I will make you a great man ; but if you will not 
stroke your race to be true to me, (that is, swear by 
Mahomet and his father's besu-d,) I must throw you 
into the sea too. The boy smiled in my face, and

ROBINSON CAU80E. ^ 

spoke 80 innocently, diat I could not mistrust him ; 
and swore to be faidiful to me, and go all. over the 
world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swim-^ 
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, ra« 
ther stretching to windward, that they might think 
me gone towards the Strait's mouth (as indeed any 
one that had been in their wits must have been sup- 
posed to do); for who would have supposed we 
were sailing on to the southward, to the truly Bar- 
b^an coast, where whole nations of Negroes were 
sure to surround us with their canoes, and destroy 
us ; where we could never once go on shore but we 
should be devoured by savage beasts, or more mer- 
ciless savages of human kind ? 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I 
changied my course, and steered directly south and 
by east, bencUng my course a little toward the east, 
that I might keep in with the shore; and having a 
fiur fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I 
made such sail, that I believe by the next day, at 
three o'clock in the afternoon, when I made the 
land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of 
Sallee, quite bevond the emperor of Morocco's do- 
minions, or indeed of any other king thereabout ; 
for we saw no people. 

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, 
and the dreadful apprdiensions I had of falling into 
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, 
or come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till 
I had sailed in that manner five days ; and then the 
wind shifting to the southward, i concluded alsd 
that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they 
also woidd now eive over : so I ventured to make 
to the coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth 
of a little river ; I knew not what or where^ neither 
what latitude, what country, what nation, or what

river. I neither saw, nor desired to see, any people; 
the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We 
came into this creek in the evening, resolving to 
swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover 
the country : but as soon as it was quite dark, we 
heard such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, 
and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not 
what kinds, thatthe poor boy was ready to die with 
fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day. 
Well, Xury, said I, then I will not; but it may 
be we may see men by day, who will be as bad 
to us as those lions — Then we may give them 
the shoot-gun, says Xury, laughing ; make them 
run away. Such English Xury spoke by convers- 
ing among us slaves. However, 1 was^lad to see 
the boy so cheerful, and 1 gave him a dram out of 
our patron's case of bottles to cheer him up. After 
all, Xury*s advice was g6od, and I took it. We 
dropped our little anchor, and lay stiU all night : I 
say, still, for we slept none ; for in two or three 
hours we saw Vast creatures, (we knew not what to 
call them), of many sorts, come down to the sea- 
shore, and run into the water, wallowing and wash- 
ing themselves, for the pleasure of cooling them- 
selves ; and they made such hideous bowlings and 
yellings, that 1 never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was 
I too; but we were both more frightened when we 
heard one of these mighty creatures swimming to- 
wards our boat: we could not see him, but we 
might hear him, by his blowing, to be a monstrous, 
huge, and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, 
and it might be so, for aught 1 know ; but poor 
Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor, and row 
away. No, says 1, Xury; we can slip our ca- 
ble with a buoy to it, and go off to sea: they 
cannot follow us far, I had ho sooner said so, but

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 

I perceived the creature (whatever it was) within 
two oars length, which something surprised me; 
however, I immediately stept to the cabin door, and 
taking up my gun, fired at him ; upon which, he 
immediately turned about, and swam to the shore 
again. 

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, 
and hideous cries and bowlings that were raised, as 
well upon the edge of the shore as higher within 
the country, upon the lioise or report of the gun ; 
a thing, I believe^ those creatures had never lieard 
before. This convinced me there was no going on 
shore for us in the night upon that coast : and how 
to venture on shore in the day, was another ques- 
tion too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of 
the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen mto 
the paws of lions and tigers ; at least, we were 
equally apprehensive of the danger of it. 

Be that as it would^ we were obliged to go on 
shore somewhere or other for water, for we had not 
a pint lefl in the boat : when and where to get it 
was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on 
shore with one of the jars, he would find if there 
was any water, and bring some to me. I asked him 
why he would go ; why I should not go, and he 
stay in the boat. The boy answered with so much 
affection, thai he made me love him ever after. 
Says he, If wild mans come, they eat me, you go 
w«y. — ^Well, Xury, said I, we will both go ; and 
if the wild mans come, we will kill them ; they 
shall eat neither of us. So I gave Xury a piece of 
rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's 
case of bottles, which I mentioned before ; and we 
hauled in the boat as near the shore as we thought 
was proper, and so waded to shore, carrying no* 
thing but our arms, and two jars for water.

ing the coming of canoes with savages down (he 
river ; but the boy, seeing a low place about a mile 
up the country, rambled to it ; and, by and by, I 
saw him come running toward me. I thought he 
was pursued by some savage, or frightened by some 
wild beast, and I therefore ran forwards to help 
him ; but when I came nearer to him, I saw some* 
thing haheins over his shoulders, which was a crea- 
ture that he nad shot, like a hare, but different in 
colour, and longer legs : however, we were very glad 
of it and it was very good meat : but the great joy 
that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he nad 
found good water, and seen no wild mans. 

But we found siflerwards, that we need not take 
such pains for water ; for a httle higher up the 
creek where we were, we found the water fresh when 
the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up ; 
sb we filled our jars, and, having a fire, feasted on 
the hare we had killed ; and prepared to go on our 
way, having seen no footsteps oiany human crea- 
ture in that part of the country. 

As I had been one vojage to this ooast before, I 
knew very well that die islimds of the Canaries, and 
the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far from the 
coast. But as I had no instruments to take an ob- 
servation, to find what latitude we were in ; and did 
not exactly know, or at least remember, what lati- 
tude they were in, I knew not where to look for 
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them, 
otherwise I might now have easily found some of 
. these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood 
along this ipoast till I came to the part where the 
English traded, I should find some of their vessels 
upon dieir usual design of trade, that would relieve 
and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, the place where i 
now was, must be tha^ countiy which) lying between

tbe emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Ne-* 
groes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except by wild 
beasts ; the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone 
farther south, for fear of the Moors, and the Moors 
not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its 
barrenness : and, indeed, both forsaking it because 
of the prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, 
and other furious creatures which harbour there : 
so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, 
where they go like an army, two or three thousand 
men at a time ; and, indeed, for near a hundred 
miles together upon this coast, we saw nothmg but 
a waste, uninhabited country by day, and heard no-? 
thing but bowlings and roaring of wild beasts by 
night. 

Once or twice, in the day time, I thought I saw 
the Picoof TenerifFe, being the top of the mountam 
Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a great mind to 
venture out, in hopes of reaching thither ; but hay- 
ing tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary 
winds ; the sea also going too high for my little ves- 
sel ; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep 
^ong the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land fqr fresh water, 
lafter we had left this place ; and once, in particular, 
being early in the morning, we came to an anchor 
under a little point of land which was pretty high ; 
and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still, to go 
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him 
than, it seems, mine were, calls soflly to me, and 
tells me, that we had best go farther off the shore ; 
for, says he. Look, yonder lies a dreadful monster 
on the side of that hillock, fast asleep. I looked 
where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster in- 
deed, for it was a terrible great lion, that lay on 
the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of 
tl^e hilly t^t bung, as it were, over hisi. Xury,

says I, you shall go on shore and kill him. Xury 
looked frightened, and said, Me kill ! he eat me 
at one mouth : one mouthful he meant. However, 
I said no more to the boy, but bade him be still ; 
and I took our biggest gun, which was almost mus- 
quet bore, and loaded it with a good charge of pow- 
der, and with two slugs, and laid it down ; then I 
loaded another gun with two bullets ; and a third, 
for we had three pieces, I loaded with five smaller 
bullets. I took the best aim I could with the first 
piece, to have shot him in the head; but he lay so, 
with his Ipg raised a little above his nose, that the 
slugs hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone : 
he started up, growling at first, but finding liis leg 
broke, fell down again,4md then got up upon three 
legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I 
heard. I was a little surprised that I had not hit 
him on the head ; however, I took up the second 
piece immediately, and though he began to move 
off, fired again, and shot him m the head, and had 
the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little 
noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took 
heart, and would have me let him go on shore. 
Well, go, said I : so the boy jumped into the wa- 
ter, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to 
shore with the other hand, and coming close to the 
creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and 
shot him m the head again, which dispatched him 
quite. 

This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food ; 
and 1 was very sorry to lose three charges of powder 
and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing 
to us. However, Xurv said he would have some of 
him ; so he comes on Board, and asked me to give 
him the hatchet : For what, Xury ? said I. Me 
cut off his head, said he.< However, Xury could 
not cut off his head; but he cut off a foot, and

brought it with him, and it was It monstrous great 
one. I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the 
skin of him might, one way or other, be of some va- 
lue to us; and I resolved to take off his skin, if I 
could. So Xury and I went to work with him : but 
Xury was much the better workman at it, for I 
knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us both 
up the whole day ; but at last we got off the hide of 
him, and spreading it on the top of pur cabin, the 
sun effectually dried it in two days' time, and it 
af'terwards served me to lie upon. 

After this stop, we made on to the southward con- 
tinually, for ten or twelve day8,living very sparingly 
on our provisions, which began to abate very much, 
and going no offcener into the shore than we were 
obliged to for fresh water. My design in this, was 
to make the river Gambia, or Senegal ; that is to 
say, any where about the Cape de Verd, where I was 
in hopes to meet with some European ship ; and if I 
did not, I knew not what course I had to take, but 
to seek for the islands, or perish among the Negroes. 
I knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed 
either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the 
East Indies, made this cape, or those islands : and, 
in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this 
single point, either that I must meet with some ship, 
or must perish. 

' When I had pursued this resolution about ten days 
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land 
was inhabited ; and in two or three places, as we 
sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to 
look at us: we could also perceive they were quite 
black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to have 
gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better 
counsellor, and said to me. No go, no go. How- 
ever, I hauled in nearer the shore, that I might talk 
to them ; and I found they ran along the shore by

32 ADV£NTUB£S QF 

me a good way. I observed they had no weapons in 
their hands, except one, who had a long, slender 
stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they 
would throw them a great way with good aim ; so I 
kept at a distance, but talked to them by signs, as 
well as I could, and particularly made signs for 
something to eat. They beckoned to me to stop my 
boat, and they would fetch me some meat : upon 
this, I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and 
two of them ran up into the country ; and in less 
than half an hour came back, and brought with 
them two pieces of dry flesh and some corn, such as 
is the produce of their country ; but we neither 
knew what the one or the other was ; however, we 
were willing to accept it. But how to come at it 
was our next dispute, for I was not for venturing 
on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of 
us : but they took a safe way for us all, for they 
brought it to the shore, and Icud it down, and went 
and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, 
and then came close to us again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nch 
thing to make them amends : but an opportunity 
offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully ; 
for while we were lying by the shore, came two 
miffhty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we 
took It) with great fury, from the mountains tor 
wards the sea ; whether it was the male pursuing the 
female, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we 
could not tell, any more than we could tell whether 
it was usual or strange ; but I believe it was the lat- 
ter, because, ii^ the first place, those ravenous crea- 
tures seldom appear but in the nisht; and, in the 
second place, we found the people terribly fright- 
ened, especially the women. The man that had the 
lance, or dart, did not fly from them, but the rest 
did ; however, as the two creatures ran directly into

the water, they did not seem to offer to fall upon any 
of the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, 
and swam about, as if they had come for their diver* 
sion : at last, one of them began to come nearer our 
boat thanl at first expected ; but I la^ ready for him, 
for I had loaded my gun with all possible expedition, 
and bade Xury load both the others. As soon as he 
came fairly within my reach, I fired^ and shot him 
directly in the head : immediately he sunk down into 
the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and 
4own, as if he was struggling for life, and so indeed 
he was; he immediately made to the shore, but be- 
tween the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and 
the strangling of the water, he died just before he 
reached the shore. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of 
these poor creatures, at the noise and fire of my gun ; 
some of them werp even ready to die for fear, and 
fell down as dead with the very terror ; but when 
they siaw the creature dead, ana sunk in the water^ 
and that I made signs to lliem to come to the shore, 
diey took heart and came to the shore, and began to 
search for the creature. I found him by hb blood 
staining the water ; and by the help of a rope, which 
I slung round him, and gave the Neeroes to haul, 
they £agged him on shore, and found that it was a 
most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admir- 
able degree ; and the Negroes held up their hands 
with admiration, to think what it was 1 had killed 
him with. 

The other creature, frightened with the flash of 
fire and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran 
up directly to the mountains from whence they 
came ; nor could I, at that distance, know what it 
was. 1 found quickly the Negroes were for eating 
the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have 
them take it as a favour from me ; which, when I

made signs to them that they mi^ht take him> they 
were very thankful for. Inmiediately they fell to 
work with him ; and though they had no knife» yet, 
with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off hia 
skin as readily, and much more readily/ than we 
could have done with a knife. Thev offered me some 
of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would 
give it them, but made signs for the skin, which 
they gave me very freely, and brought me a great 
desu more of their provisions, which, though I did 
not understand, 3ret I accepted. I then made signs 
to them for some water, and held out one of my jars 
to them, turning it bottom upward, to show mat it 
was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They 
called immediately to some of their friends, and there 
came two women, and brought a great vessel made 
of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun : this 
they set down to me, as before, and I sent Xury on 
shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The 
women were as stark naked as the men. 

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as 
it was, and water ; and leaving my friendly Ne^oes^ 
I made forward for about eleven days more, without 
offering to so near the shore, till I saw the land run 
out a great length into the sea, at about the distance 
of four or five leagues before me; and the sea being 
very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point. 
At length, doubling the point, at about two leases 
from liie land, I saw plainly land on the other side^ 
to seaward : then I concluded, as it was most certain 
indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those 
the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd Islands. 
However, they were at a great distance, and I could 
not well tell what I had best to do ; for if I should 
be taken with a gale of wind^ I might neither reach 
one nor the other. 

In this dilemmai as I was very pensive, I stepped

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 

into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the 
helm ; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out, Mas- 
ter, master, a ship with a sail! and the foolish 
boy was frightened out of his wits, thinking it 
must needs be some of his master's ships sent to 
pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough 
out of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and 
immediately saw, not only the ship, but what she 
was, viz. that it was a Portuguese ship, and, bs I 
thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea for Ne« 

f'oes. But, when I observed the course she steered, 
was soon convinced they were bound son^e other 
way, and did not design to come any nearer to the 
shore: upon which, I stretched out to sea as much 
as I could, resolving to speak with them, if pos- 
sible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should 
not be able to come in their way, but that they 
would be gone by before I could make any signal 
to them : but after I had crowded to the utmost, 
and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me, by 
the help of their perspective glasses, and that it was 
some European boat, which, they supposed, must 
belong to some ship that was lost ; so they short- 
ened sail, to let me come up. I was encouraged 
with this, and as I had my patron's ensign on board, 
I made a waft of it to them, for a signal of distress, 
and fired a gun, both which they saw ; for they 
told me they saw the smoke, though they did not 
hear the gun. Upon these signals, tfiey very kindly 
brought to, and lay by for me ; and in about three 
hours' time I came up with them. 

^TTiey asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in 
Spanish and in French, but I understood none of 
them; but, at last, a Scotch sailbr, who was on 
board, called to me, and I answered him, and told 
him I was an Englishman, that I had made my

escape out of slavery from the Moors, at SaUee : 
they then bade me come on board, and very kindly 
took me in, and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, whjch any one 
will believe, thatl was thus delivered, as I esteemed 
it, from such a miserable, and almost hopeless, con- 
dition as I was in ; and I immediately offered all I 
had to the captain of the ship, as a return for my 
deliverance ; but he generously told me, he would 
take nothing from me, but that all I had should be 
delivered safe to me, when I came to the Brazils. 
For, says he, I have saved your life on no 'other 
terms Uian I would be glaa to be saved myself; 
and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be 
taken up in the same condition. Besiiles, said he, 
when 1 carry you to the Brazils, so great a way 
from your own country, if I should take from 
you wnat you have, you will be starved there, and 
then I only take away that life I have given. No, 
no, Seignor Inglese (Mr. Englishman), says he ; I 
will carry you uiither in charity, and these things 
will help to buy your subsistence there, and yoiu: 
passage home again. 

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was 
just in the performance, to a tittle ; for he ordered 
the seamen, that none should offer to touch any 
thing I had : then he took every thing into his own 
possession, and gave me back an exact inventory 
of them, that I might have them, even so much as 
my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one ; and that 
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the 
ship's use ; and asked me what I would have for it ? 
I told him, he had been so generous to me in every 
thing, .that I could not offer to make any price of 
the boat, but left it eQtvely to him : upon whidt,^ 
he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay

me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil ; and when 
it came there, if any one ofii^ed to give more, he 
would make it up. He offered me also sixty pieces 
of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loth 
to take ; not that I was not willing to let the cap- 
tain have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor 
boy's liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in 
procuring my own. However, when I let him know 
my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me 
this medium, that he would give the boy an obliga- 
tion to set him free in ten years, if he turned Chris- 
tian : upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to 
go to him, I let the captain- have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and 
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints* 
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I 
was once more delivered from the most miserable 
of all conditions of life ; and what to do next with 
myself, I was now to consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I 
can never enough remember: he would take no- 
thing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats 
for the leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin» 
which I had in my boat, and caused every thing I 
had in the ship to be punctually delivered to me ; 
and what I was willing to sell, he bought of me ; 
such as the case of bottles, two of my guns, ^d a 
piece of the lump of bees-wax, — ^for I had made 
candles of the rest : in a word, I made about two 
hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; 
and with this stock, I went on shore in the Brazils* 

I had not been long here, before I was recommend- 
ed to the house of a good honest man, like himself, 
who had an ingeino as they call it, (that is, a planta* 
tion and a sugar-house). I lived with him some time, 
and acquainted myself, by that means, with the 
manner of planting and making of sygar ; and see-

Id this luanDer, i used to look upon my eooditioft 
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to conveifie 
with, but now and then this neighbour ; no work to 
be done, but by the labour of my hands : and I used 
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some 
desolate island, that had nobody Uieve but himself^ 
But how just has it been ! and how should all m&n 
reflect, that when they campcUre their preseM eon-^

to the person who has your money in London, to

are all subject to changes and disasters, I would 
have you eive orders for but one hundred pounds 
sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let 
the hazard be run for the first, so that if it come 
safe, you may order the rest the same way ; and, if 
it miscarry, you may have the other half to have 
recourse to for your supply. 

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so 
friendly, that I could Hot but be convinced it was 
the best course I could take ; so I accordingly pre- 
pared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I left 
my money) and a procuration to the Portuguese 
captain, as he desired me* 

I wrote the English captain's widow afiill account 
of all my adventures ; my slavery, escape, and how 
I had met with the Portuguese captain at sea, the 
humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was 
now in, with all other necessary directions for my 
supply; and when this honest captain came to Lis- 
bon, he found means, by some of the English mer- 
chants there, to send over, not the order only, but a 
full account of my story to a merchant at London, 
who represented it effectually to her : whereupon she 
not only delivered the money, but, out of her own 
pocket, sent the Portuguese captain a very hand* 
some present for his humanity and charity to me* 

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred 
pounds in English goods, such as the captain had 
wrote for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and 
be brought them all safe to me at the Brazils: 
among which, without my direction (for I was too 
young in my business to think of them), he had 
taken care to have all sorts of took, iron work, and 
utensils, necessary for my plantation, and which 
were of great use to me. 

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune 
made, for I was surprised with the joy of it; and

my geod steward, the caplaiD, had laid a^t the five 
pounds, which my fpiend had sant him as a prasant 
for hiia^alf, to purchase and bring rae over a ser* 
vant, under bond for aix yeavs* service, and would, 
not accept of any consideration, except a little to* 
baoco, which I would have him accept, being of 
my own produce. 

Neither was this all : but my goods being all En- 
glish manufactures, such as clothiB, stu£&, baise, andi 
Uiings particularly valuable and desirable in the 
country, I found means to sell them to a very great 
advantage; so that I might say, I had more than 
four times the value of my first cargo, and was now 
infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the 
advancement of my plantation : for the first |hing 
.1 did, I bought me a Negro slave, and a European 
servant also ; I mean anoUier besides that whi^ the 
oaptatn brought me irom Lisbon, 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very 
means of our adversity, so was' it with me. I went 
on the next year with great success in my pkntap 
tion ; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own 
ground, more than I had disposed of for necessariea 
among my neighbour ; and these fifly rolls, being 
each of above 100 lb. weight, were well cured, and 
laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon : 
and now, increasing in business and in wealth, my 
head began to be fniU of projects and undertakings, 
beyond my reach ; such as are, indeed, often tha* > 
nun of the best heads in business. Had I continued 
in die station I was. now in, I had room for all the 
happy things to have yet befiillen me, for which my 
famer so eamestlvrecoimnended a <]^uiet, retired life, 
and'which he had so sensibly described the middle 
stati'on of life to be full of: but other things attend-

fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which ^ 
in my future sorrows I should have leisure to make, 
all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent 
obstinate adhering to m}r foolish inclination, of wan- 
dering about, and pursuing that inclination, in con- 
tradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good 
in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and 
those measures of life, which nature and providence 
concurred to present me with, and to make my duty. 

As I had once done thus in breaking away from 
my parents, so I could not be content now, but I 
must go and leave the happy view I had of being a 
rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to 
pin-sue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster 
than the nature of the thing admitted ; and thus I 
cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of 
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps 
could be consistent with life, and a sjtate of health 
in the world. 

To come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars 
of this part of my story : — ^You ma)r suppose, that 
having now lived almost four years in the Brazils^ 
and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon 
my plantation, 1 had not only learned the language, 
but had contracted an acquaintance and friendship 
among my fellow-planters, as well as among the 
merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; 
and •that, in my discourses among them, I haa fre- 
quently given uem an account of my two voyages 
to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with 
the Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase 
on the coast for trifles — such as'beads, toys, knives, 
scissars, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like— not 
only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephant's teeth, &c. 
but Negroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great 
numbers.

courses on these heads, but especially to that part 
which related to the buying Negroes ; which was a 
trade, at that time, not only not far entered into, 
but, as far as it was, had been parried on by the 
assientos, or permission of the kings of Spain and 
Portugal, and engrossed from the public ; so Uiat 
few Negroes were bought, and those excessive dear. 

It happened, being in company with some mer- 
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking 
of those thmgs very earnestly, three of them came 
to me the next morning, and told me they had been 
musing very much upon what I had discoursed with 
them of the last night, and they oame to make a 
secret proposal to me : and, after enjoining me to 
secrecy, they told me that they had a mind to fit 
out a ship to go to Guinea ; that they had all plan^- 
tations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing 
so much as servants ; that as it was a trade that 
could not be earned on, because they could not 
publicly sell the Negroes when they came home, so 
they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the 
Neeroes on shore privately, and divide them among 
their own plantations : and, in a word, the question 
was, whether I would go their supercargo in the 
ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of 
Gumea ; and they offered me that I should have an 
e^qual share of the Negroes, without providing any 
par^ of the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had 
it been made to any one that had not a settlement 
and plantation of his own to look after, which was 
in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and 
with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was 
thus entered and established, and had nothing to do 
but go on as I had begun, for three or four years 
more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds 
from England; andjirho^in that time, and with that

my first rambling designs, when my father's good 
counsel was. lost upon me. In a word, Ltold them 
JL would go with all my heart, if they would under- 
take to look after my plantation inmy absence, and 
would dispose of. it to such as I should direct, if I 
miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and en- 
tered into writings or covenants to do so : and I 
made a formal will, disposing of my plantation and 
e&Qts, in. case of my deadi ; making the captain of 
the ship that had saved my life, as before, n^ uni- 
vecsal heir ; but obliging him to dispose of my effects 
as I had directed in; my will ; one half of the pro- 
duce being to himself, and the other to be shipped 
to England. 

In «iort, I took all possible caution to preaerve 
my effects, and to keep up my plantation : had I 
used half as much prudence to have looked into 
Bw own interest, and have made a judgement of 
what J ought to have done and not to hav« done, I 
had certainly never gone away from so prpsperoua

attended with all its common hazards, to say no- 
thing of the reasons I had to expect particular mis- 
fortunes to myself.

evil hour again, the first of September, 1659, being 
the same day eight years that I went from my father 
and mother at HuU, in order to act the rebel to 
their authority, and the fool to my own interest. 

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons 
burden, carried six guns, and fourteen men, besides 
the .master, his boy, and myself; we had on 
board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys 
as were fit for our trade with the Negroes, such as 
beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially 
little looking-glasses, knives, scissars, hatchets, and 
the like. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, stand- 
ing away to the northward upon our own coast, with 
design to stretch over for the African coast. When 
they came about ten or twelve degrees of northern 
latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of their 
course in those days, we had very good weather, 
only excessive hot all the way upon our own coast, 
till we came to the height of cape St. Augustino; 
from whence, keeping farther off at sea, we lost sight 
of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle 
Fernando de Noronha, holding our course N.E.by N. 
and leaving those isles on the east. In this course 
we passed the line in about twelve days* time, and 
were by our last observation, in 7 degrees 22 mi- 
nutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or 
hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge : it 
began from the south-east, came about to the north- 
west, and then settled in the north-east; from 
whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for 
twelve days together we could do nothing but drive, 
and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither 
ever fate and the fury of the winds directed ; and, 
during these twelve days, I need not say that I ex- 
pected every day to be swallowed up ; nor, indeed, 
idid any in the ship expect to save their lives.

by dashing against the ship's rudder, and, in the 
next place, she broke away, and either sunk, or 
was driven . off to sea ; so there was no hope from 
her: we had another boat on board, but how to get 
her off into the sea was a doubtful thing; however^ 
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the 
ship would break in pieces every minute, and some 
told us she was actuaUy broken already. 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of 
the boat, «uid with the help of the rest of the men, 
they got her flung over the ship's side ; and getting 
all mto her, lei her go, and committed ourselves, 
being eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the 
wild sea: for though the storm was abated consi« 
derably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the 
shore, and might be well called den wiui zee^ as the 
Dutch call the sea in a stomu 

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for 
we all saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that 
the boat could not live, and that we should be in- 
evitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none ; 
nor, if we had, could we have done any thing with 
it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, 
though with heavy hearts, like men going to execu' 
don ; for we all Knew that when the boat came 
nearer to the shore, she would b^ dashed in a 
thousand pieces by the breach of the sea How>* 
ever, we committed our souls to God in the most 
earnest manner ; and the wind driving us towards 
the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own 
hands, pulling as well as we could towards land. 

What the shore was— whether rock or sand, whe* 
ther steep or shoal — ^we knew not ; the only hope 
that coula rationally give us the least shadow of ex-^ 
pectation, was, if we might happen into some bay 
or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where by. 
great chance we might have run our boat in, or got

under the lee of the land, and perhaps madesmoctb 
water. But there was nothing of this appeared;, 
andt as we made nearer and nearer the shore, the 
land looked more frightful than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a- 
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, 
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plain*^ 
ly bade us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it 
took us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at 
once; and separating us, as well from the boat a» 
from one another, gave us not time hardly to say, " O 
God !'^ for we were all swallowed up in a moment* 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought 
which I felt, when I sunk inio the water; for 
though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver 
myself from the wavjps so as to draw my breath, till

the sea come after me as high as a ffreat hill, and as 
furious as an enemy, whidi I had no means or 
strength to contend with : my business was to hold 
my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I 
cou)d ; and so, by swimming, to preserve my breath-

my greatest concern now being, that the wave, as

S2 ADVENTURES OF 

breach and froth of the sea being so biglcould hard- 
ly see it, it lay so far off— and considered, Lord! 
how was it possible I could get on shore ? 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfort- 
able part of my condition, I began to look round 
me, to see what kind of a place I was in, and what 
was next to be done; and I soon found my comforts 
abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliver- 
ance : for I wais wet, had no clothes to shift me, 
nor any thing either to eat or drink, to comfort me; 
neither did I see any prospect before me, but that of 
perishing with hunger, or being devoured by wild 
beasts : and that which was particularly afflicting to 
me was, that I had no wefif]Non, either to hunt and 
kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend 
myself against any other creature that might desire 
to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing 
about me but a knife, a tobacco pipe, and a little 
tobacco in a box. This was all my provision; and 
this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, 
that, for a while, I ran about like a madman* 
Ni^t coming upon me, I begai^ with a heavy heart, 
to consider what would be my lot if there were any 
ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night 
they always come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at 
that time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, 
like a fir, but thorny — which grew near me, and 
^'here I resolved to sit all ni^ht — ^and consider the 
next day what deatli I should die, for as vet I saw 
iio prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from 
the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to 
drink, which I did, to my great joy ; and having 
drank, and put a little tobacco into my mouth to 
prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up 
mto it, endeavoured to place myself so, as that if I 
should fall asleep, I might not mi; and having cut

ed tears from my eyes again ; but as there was lit* 
tie relief in that, 1 resofvedy if possible, to get to 
the ship ; so I pulled off my clothes, for the wea- 
ther was hot to extremity, and took the water : but 
when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still 
greater to know how to get on board; for a» she 
lay aground, and high out of the water, there was 
nothing within my. reach to lay old of. I swam 
round her twice, and the second time I spied a small 
piece of a rope, which I wondered I did not see at 
first, hang down by the fore-chains so low, as that 
with great difficulty, I got hold of it, and by the 
help of that rope got into the forecastle of the ship. 
Here 1 found that the ship was bulged, and had a 
great deal of water in her nold ; but that she lay so 
on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather efurth» 
that her stem lay lifted up upon the bank, and her 
head low, almost to the water. By this means all 
tier quarter was free, and all that was in that part 
was dry ; for you may be sure my first work was to 
search and to see what was spoiled and what was 
free : and, first, I found that all the ship's provisions 
were dry and untouched by the water; and, being 
veiy well disposed to eat, 1 went to the bread-room, 
and filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I 
went about other things, for I had no time to lose. 
I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which 
I took a large dram, and which I had indeed need 
enough of, to spirit me for what was before me. 
Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish my- 
self with many things which I foresaw would be very 
necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was 
not to be had, and this extremity roused my appli- 
cation : we had several spare yards, and two or tnree 
large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in 
,the ship ; I resolved to fall to work with these, and

Aung as many overboard as I could manage for their 
weighty tying every one with a rope, that they might 
not drive away. When this was done, I went down 
the ship's side, and puUins them to me, I tied four of 
them fast together at botli ends, as well as I could, 
in the form^f a raft, and laying two or three short 
pieces of plank upon them, crossways, I found I could 
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to 
bear any great weight, the pieces being too light : 
so I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I 
cut a spare top*mast into three lengths, and added 
them to my raft, with a great deiU of labour and 
pains. But the hope of fmmishing myself with ne- 
cessaries, encouraged me to go beyond what I should 
have been able to have done upon another occasion* 
My raft was now strong enough to bear any rea- 
sonable weight. My next care was what to load it 
with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from 
the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering 
this. I first laid all the planks or boards upon it 
that I could get, and having considered well what I 
most wanted, I got three of the seamen's chests, 
which^ I had broken open and emptied, and lowered 
them down upon my raft ; these I filled with pro* 
visions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five 
pieces of dried goats* flesh (which we lived much 
upon), and a little remainder of European corn, 
which had been laid by for some fowls which we had 
brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. 
lliere had been some barley and wheat together, 
but, to my great disappointment, I found afterwards 
that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for li- 
quors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to 
our skipper, in which were some cordial waters; 
and, in all, about five or six gallons of rack. These 
[ stowed by themselves, there being no need to put 
them into the chests, nor any room for theoK

two saws, an axe, and a hammer; and with this 
cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, m j 
raft went very well, only that I found it drive a lit* 
tie distant from the place where I had landed before ; 
by which I perceived that there was some indraft of 
the water, and consequently I hoped to find some 
creek or river there, which I might make use of as 
a port to get to land with my cargo. 

As I imagined, so it was : there appeared before 
me a little opening of the land, and 1 found a strong 
current of the tide set into it ; so I guided my raft, 
as well as I could, to get into the middle of 
the stream. But here 1 had like to have suffered a 
second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily 
would have broken my heart ; for knowing nothing 
cyf the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it 
upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other 
eni, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had 
slipped off towards that end that was anoat, and so 
fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by setting 
my back against the chests, to keep them in their 
places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my 
strength \ neither durst I stir from the posture I 
was in, but holding up the chests with all my 
mi^ht, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in 
which time the rising of the water brought me a lit- 
tle more upon a level ; and a little after, the water 
still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off 
with the oar I had into the channel, and then driv- 
ing up higher, I at length found myself in the 
mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, 
end a strong current or tide running up. I looked 
on both ^ides for a proper place to get on shore, 
for I was not willing to be driven too high up the 
river; hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and 
therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast 
as I could.

60 ADYENTURES OF 

I now began to consider, that I mi^ht yet get a 
great many things out of the ship, which would be 
useful tp me, and particularly some of the rigging 
and sails, and such other things as might come ta 
land ; and I resolved to make another voyage on 
board the vessel, if possible. And as I knew that 
the first storm that blew must necessarily break her 
all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, 
till I got every thing out of the ship that I could 
get. Then I called a council, that is to say, in my 
thoughts, whether I should take back the rafl ; but 
this appeared impracticable : so I resolved to go aa 
before, when the tide was down ; and I did so, only 
that I stripped before I went from my hut ; hav- 
ing nothing on but a chequered shirt, a* pair of linen 
drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a 
second raft ; and having had experience of the first, 
I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so 
hard, l>ut yet I brought away several things very 
useful to me : as, first, in the carpenter's stores, I 
found two orvthree bags of nails and spikes, a great 
screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets ; and, above 
all, that most useful thing called a grind-^stone. 
All these I secured together, with several things be- 
longing to the gunner.; particularly, two or three 
iron-crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven 
muskets, and another fowling piece, with some 
small quantity of powder more ; a large bag-full of 
small-snot, and a great roll of sheet lead ; but this 
last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it 
over the ship's side. 

Besides these things, 1 took all the men's clothes 
that I could find, and a spare fore-top sail, a ham- 
mock, and some bedding ; and with this I loaded my 
second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, t(^ ] 
my very great comfort.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6t 

I was under some apprehensions, during m^ ab- 
sence from the land, that at least mv provisions 
misht be devoured on shore : but when I came back, 
I round no sign of akiy visitor ; only there sat a 
creature like a wild ciat, upon one of the chests, 
which, when I came towards it, ran away a little 
distance, and then stood still. She sat very com- 
posed and unconcerned, and looked full in my face, 
as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I 
presented my gun to her, but, as she did not under- 
stand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor 
did she offer to stir away ; upon which I tossed her 
a bit of biscuit, though, by the way, I was not very 
free of it, for my store was not great : however, 1 spared 
her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and 
ate it, and lodked (as pleased) for more; but I thank- 
ed her, and could spare no more : so she marched off. 

Having gotmy second cargo on shore— though I 
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring 
Uiem by parcels, for they were too heavy, being 
large casks — ^^I went to work to make me a little tent, 
wim the sailj and some poles, which I cut for that 
purpose ; and into this tent I brought every thing 
that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun ; 
and I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a 
circle round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden 
attempt either from man or beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of 
the tent with some boards within, and an empty 
chest set up on end without ; and spreading one of 
the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols 
just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I 
went to bed for the first time, and slept very auietly 
all night, for I was very weary and heavy; tor the 
night before I had slept little, and had laboured very 
hard all day, as well to fetch all those things from 
the ship, as to get them on shore.

the ground ; one of those knives is worth all this 
heap : 1 ha\ne no manner of use for thee : e'en re- 
main where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a 
creature whose life is not worth saving. However, 
upon second thoughts, I took it away; and wrapping 
all this in a piece of canvass, I began to thinlc of 
making anodier raft ; but while I was preparing 
this, I found the sky over-cast, and the wind began 
to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh 
gale from the shore. It presently occurred to me, 
Siat it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with 
the wind offshore ; and that it was my business to 
be gone before the tide of flood began, or otherwise 
I mi^ht not be able to reach the shore at all. Ac- 
cordingly I let myself down into the water, and 
-swam across the channel which lay between the 
ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty 
enough, partly with the weight of the things I had 
about me, and partly the roughness of the water ; 
for the wind ro^e very hastily, and before it was 
quite high water it blew a storm. 

But I was got home to my little tent, where 
I lay, with all my wealth about me very secure. It 
blew yery hard all that night, and in the morning, 
when I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be 
seen ! I was a little surprised, but recovered myself 
with this satisfactory reflection, viz. that I had lost 
no time, nor abated no diligence, to get every thing 
out of her that could be useful to me, and that, in- 
deed, there was little left in her that I was able to 
bring away, if I had had more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, 
or of any thing out of her, except what might drive 
on shore, from her wreck ; as, indeed, divers pieces 
of her afterwards did ; but those things were of 
small use to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about

Vpanner and description. of which, it oi/aiy QOt be im* 
^proper to give an accQunt of. 

1 soon found the place I was in was .not for my

moorish ground, near ^be se^, an^ I p^lieve^ it 
would not be whole^Qipe ; anfl ipoi^e ^particularly

mi^ht not lose any advantage for oly dieliverance, of 
which I was not willing. to bapish all iny expiecta-

In search for a pl^ce proper ftv: this, I .fp\in4

way down into the low ground by the sea side. It 
was on the N. N. W. side of the hill ; so that k 
was sheltered from the heat every day, till it came 
to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, m 
those countries, is near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle be- 
fore the hollow-place, which took in about ten yards 
in its semi-diameter from the rock, and twenty 
yards in its diameter, from its beginning and ending. 

In thb half circle I pitched two rows of strong 
stakes, driving them into the ground till they 
stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being out 
of the ground about five feet and a half and sharp- 
ened on the top. The two rows did not stand above 
six inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I cut in 
the ship, and laid them in rows, one upon another, 
within the circle, between these two rows of stakes, 
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, 
leaning against them, about two feet and a half high, 
like a spur to a post ; and this fence was so strong, 
that neither man nor beast could g^t into it or over 
it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour, 
especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them 
to the place, and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by 
a door, but by a short ladder to go over the top ; 
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me ; 
and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I 
thought, from all the world, and conseauently slept 
secure in the night, which otherwise 1 could not 
have done; though, as it appeared afterwards, 
there was no need of all this caution from the ene- 
mies that I apprehended danger ftom. 

Into this fence, or fortress, lyitl^ infinite labour, I 
carried all my riches, all n^v provisions, ammunition, 
and stores, of which. you nave the account above;

and I made a lar^e tent, which, to preserve me from 
the rains, that m one part of the year are very 
violent there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent 
within, and one larger tent above it, and covered 
the uppermost with a large tarpaulm> which I had 
saved among the sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed 
which I had brought on shore^ but in a hammock, 
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged to 
the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought aQ my provisions, and 
every thing that would spoil by the wet ; and having 
thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance 
which till now I had left open, and so passed and 
repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way 
I into the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones 
that I dug down out through my tent, I laid them 
up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so 
that it raised the ground within about a foot and an 
half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my 
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. 
It cost me much labour and many days, before all 
thesie things were brought to perfection; and 
therefore I must go back to some other things 
which took up some of my thoughts. At the same 
time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for 
the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that 
a storm of rain, falling from a thick, dark cloudy a 
sudden flash of lightnmg happened, and after tliat, 
a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of 
it. I was not so much surprised with the lightning, 
as I was with a thought, which darted into my mind 
as swifl as the lightning itself: O my powder! 
My very heart sunk within me when I thought, that 
at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed ; 
on which, not my defence only> but the providing

nothing near so anxious about my own dai^er, 
,though, had the pqwder took fire^l hadn^yer^no^>Y^ 
who^ had hurt me. 

Such impression did this m^e upon v^e, tl^at 
after the storm was over, I'laid aside all my yrqrlisy 
my building and fortifying, and applied, myself io 
make bags and boxes, td'separate the'powper, ai^d 
to keep it. a little anji a little in ^a parcel, in lion© 
ihat' whatever might come, it might, n^t jail take 
.fire at onpe ; and to keep it so apaH; !:hat it should 
not be possible to make one part .fire anpther. I 
.iinisheid this work in about a fortnight; and I thin^ 
my powder, which in all was about 240 lb. weigl^t, 
was divided in not less than a hundred parcels. ' ^s 
to the barrel that had been wet, I did pot appre- 
hend any danger from that ; so I placed ft in my 
new cave, which in my fancy, I called my kitchen, 
and the rest 1 hid up and down iii holes among the 
roqks, so that no wet might come to it, marking 
very carefully where I laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I vent 
out at least once every day with my guii, jis well 
to divert myself, as to see if I'could kill any. thine 
fit for food; and, as near as I could, to acquaii^t 
myself with what the island produced. The fir^t 
time I went out, I presently discovered that therp 
were goats upon the island, which was a great sa- 
ti8fac];ion to me; but then it was attended wit)i 
this misfortune to me, viz. that thiey were so shy, so 
subtle, and so swift of foot, that U was the most 
difficult thing in the world to come lat them; but 
I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but 1 
might now and theii shoot one, as it soon happen- 
ed ; for after I had found their haunts a UtUe, I laid 
wait in this manner for them : I observed. If th^y

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright; 
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was 
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me ; from 
wtience I concluded, that by the position of their 
optics, their sight was so directed downward, that 
•they did not readily see objects that were above them : 
•so, afterwards, I took this method — I always climbed 
the rocks first, to get above them, and then had 
frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made 
among these creatures, I killed a she-goat, which 
fiad a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, 
which grieved me heartily ; but when the old one 
feU, the kid stood stock still by her, till I came and 
took her up ; ^d not only so, but when 1 carried 
the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid 
followed me quite to my enclosure ; upon which, I 
laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, 
and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred 
it up tame; but it would not eat; so I was forced 
to kill it, and eat it myself. These two supplied 
me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and 
preserved my provisions (my bread especially) as 
much as possibly I could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it abso- 
lutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, 
and fuel to bum ; and what I did for that, as also 
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I 
made, I shall give a full account of it in its proper 
place : but I must first eive some little account of 
myself, and of my thoughts about living,, which, it 
may well be supposed, were not a few. 

I had a dism^ prospect of my condition; 
for as I was not cast away upon that island 
without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm 
quite out of the course of our intended voyage ; and 
a great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of 
tiie ordinary course of the trade of mankind^ I had

again as the rest, and every 6rst day of the month 
as long again as that long one : and thus I kept 
my calen£r, or weekly, monthly, and yearly rec- 
koning of time. 

But it happened, that amon^ the many things 
which I brought out of the ship, m the several voy- 
ages which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got 
several thines of less value, but not at all less useful 
to me, whicn 1 found, some time after, in rummag- 
mg the chests ; as, in particular, pens, ink, and pa- 
per ; several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gun- 
ner's, and carpenter's keeping ; three or four com^ 
passes, some mathematical instruments, dials, per- 
spectives, charts, and books of navigation; all which 
I huddled together, whether I mi^t want them or 
no : also 1 found three veir good bibles, which came 
to me in my cargo from England* and which I had 
packed up among my things ; some Portuguese books 
also, and, among them, two or three popish prayer 
books, and several other books, all which I carefuUy 
secured. And 1 must not forget, that we had in the 
ship a dog, and two cats, of whose eminent history 
I may have occasion to say something, in its place : 
for I carried both the cats with me ; and as tor the 
dog, he jumped out of the ship himself, and swam 
on shore to me the day after 1 went on shore with 
my 6r8t cargo, and was a trusty servant to me for 
many years : I wanted nothing that he could fetdi 
me, nor any.company that he could make up to me, 
I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that 
would not do. As I observed before, I found pens, 
ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the ut« 
most ; and 1 shall show that while my ink lasted, I 
kept things very exact, but after that was gone I 
could not ; for 1 could not make any ink, by any 
Hieanslhat I could devise. 

And this put n^ in mind that I wanted many

ROBINSON CRU80S. 73 

things^ notwithstanding all that I had amassed to- 
gether ; and of these, this of ink was one ; as also 
a spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the 
earth; needles, pins, and thread: as for linen, I 
60on learned to want that without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on 
heavily ; and it was near a whole year before I had 
entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded my ha- 
bitation. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy 
as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and 
preparing in the woods, and more, by far, in bring- 
ing home ; so that I spent sometimes two days in 
cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and 
a third day in driving it into the ground; for which 
purpose, I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but 
at last bethought myself of one of the iron crows ; 
which, however, though I found it, yet it made 
driving these posts or piles very laborious and tedi- 
ous work. But what need I have been copcerned 
at the tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing 
I had time enough to do it in ? nor had I any other 
employment, if that had been over, at least that I 
could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek 
for food ; which I did, more or less, every day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, 
and the circumstance I was reduced to ; and I drew 
up the state of my afiairs in writing, not so much 
to leave them to any that were to come after me 
(for I was like to have but few heirs), as to deliver 
my thoughts from daily poring upon them, and af- 
flicting my mihd : and as my reason began now to 
master my despondency, I began to comfort myself 
as well as I could, and to set the good against the 
evil, that I might have something to distinguish my 
case from worse ; and I stated very impartially, like 
debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against 
the miseries I suffered, thus :

I am cast upon a horrible, 
desolate island, void of all 
hope of recovery. 

I am sittgled' oat and sepa- 
rated, as it were, from all the 
world, to be miserable. 



I am divided f^rom man- 
kind, a solitaire | one banish- 
ed from human society. 

I have no clothes to cover 
me. 

I am without aajr defence, 
ormf afis to resistany violence 
of man or beast.

Good. 

But I am alive; and not 
drowned, as all my ship's 
company were. 

Bat I am singled oot too 
from all the ship's crew, to be 
spared from death; and he 
that miraculously saved me 
from death, can deliver me 
from this condition. 

But I am not starved, and 
perishing io a barren place, 
affording no sustenance. 

But I am io a hot climate, 
where. If I had clothes, I 
could hardly wear them. 

But I am cast ou ao island 
where I see no wild beast to 
hurt me, as 1 saw on the coast 
of Africa: and what if I had 
been shipwrecked there? 

But God wonderfully sent 
the ship in near eooogh to the ' 
shore, that I have got out ho 
many necessary things as will 
either supply my wants, or 
enable me to supply myself, 
even as long as I live. 



Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testi- 
mony, that there wag scarce any condition in the 
world so miserable, but there was something n^g«- 
tive, or something positive, to be thankful for in it: 
and let this stand as a direqdon from die experi- 
enoe of the most miserable of all conditions in this 
world, that we may always find in it something to 
comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the descrip- 
tion of good and evil, on die credit side of the ac- 
count.

see if I could spy a Ihip ; I say, giving ovev these 
things, 1 be^tn to apply myself to acoommodate 
my way of living, and to make things as easy to me 
as I could. 

I have already described my halutationy which 
was a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded 
with a strong pale of posts and cables ; but I might 
now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall 
aj^ainst it of turft, about two feet thick on the out^ 
side : and after some time (I think it was a year 
and a half) 1 raised rafters from it, leaning to the 
rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs, of 
trees, and such things as I could get> to keep oat 
the rain ; which I found, at some times of the year, 
ve^ violent* 

I have already observed how I brought all my 
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had 
made behind me. But I must observe, too, that at 
first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as 
they lay in no order, so they took up all my place; 
I had no room to turn myself: so 1 set myself to 
enlarge my cave, and work farther into the earth ; 
for it was a loose, sandy rock, which yielded easily 
to the labour I bestowed on it : and when I found 
I was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey, I worked 
sideways, to the right hand, into the rocK, and then 
taming to the right again, worked quite out, and 
made me a door to come out in the outside of my 
pale or fortification. 

lliis gave me not only egress and regress, as it 
were, a back-way to my tent and to my stordiouse, 
but gave me room to stow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such 
necessary things as I found 1 most wanted, particu* 
Uurly a chair and a table ; for without these 1 was 
not able to enioy the few comforts I had in the 
world ; I could not write, or eat, ot do several

things with so much pleasure, without a table : &o 
I went to work. And here I must needs observe^ 
that as reason is the substance and original of the. 
mathematics, so by stating and squaring every thing 
by reason, and by making the most rational judge- 
ment of things, every man may be, in time, master 
of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool 
in my life ; and yet, in time, by labour, application^ 
and contrivance, I found, at last, that I wanted no- 
thing but I could have made, especially if I had 
had tools. However, I made abundance of things^ 
even without tools ; and some with no more tools . 
than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were 
never made that way before, and that with infinite 
labour. For example, if I wanted a board, I had 
no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an 
edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with 
my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank^. 
and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true^ 
by this method I could make but one board of a 
whole tree; but this 1 had no remedy for but pati- 
ence, any more than I had for a prodigious deal of 
time and labour which it took me up to make a plank 
or board : but my time or labour was little worth, 
and so it was as well employed one way as another. 
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob* 
served above, in the first place ; and this I did out 
of the short pieces of boards that I brought on my 
raft from the ship. But when I wrought out some 
boards, as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth 
of a foot and a half, one over another, all alon^ one 
side of my cave, tolay all my tools, nails, and iron- 
work on ; and, in a word, to separate every thing at 
large in their places, that I might easily comeat them. 
I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock, to hang 
my guns, and all things that would hang up : so that 
had my cave been seen, it looked like a general mii-

gazine of all necessary things; and I had every 
Sling so ready at my hand, that it was a great plea- 
sure to me to see aU my goods in such order, cmd 
especially to find my stodc of all necessaries so great. 

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of 
every day's employment : for, indeed, at first, I was 
in too much hurry, and not only hurry as to labour, 
but in much discomposure of mind ; and my journal 
would, too, have been full of many dull things : for 
example, I must have said thus — '* Sept, 30th. After 
I had got to shore, and had escaped drowning, in- 
stead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, 
having first vomited, with the great quantity of salt 
water which was gotten into my stomach, and re- 
covering myself a little^ I ran about the shore, 
wringing my hands, and beating my head and face, 
exclaiming at my misery, and crying out, I was un- 
done, undone ! till, tired and faint, I was forced to 
lie down on the ground to repose ; but durst not 
sleep, for fear of being devoured." 

Some davs after this, and after I had been on 
board the ship and got all that I could out of her, 
I could not forbear getting up to the lap of a little 
mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing 
ft ship : then fancy that, at a vast distance, I spied 
a sail, pleased myself with the hopes of it, and, 
after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it 
^uite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus 
increase my misery by my folly. 

But, having gotten over tnese things in some 
measure, and having settled my household-stuff and 
habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as 
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my 
journal : of which I shall here give you the copy 
(though in it wiU be told all these particulars over 
again) as long as it lasted ; for, having no more ink, 
I was forced to leave it off.

78 ADVENTUIJBS O* 

THE JOURNAL. 

September 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Robiti' 
son Crusoe, being shipwrecked, durbg a dreadfiil 
storm, in the offing, came on shore on this dismal 
unfortunate island, which I called the Island or 
Despair ; all the rest of the ship's company being 
drowned, and myself almost dead. 

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting my* 
self at the dismal circumstances I was brought to^ 
viz. I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, nor 
place to fly to : and, in despair of any relief, saw 
nothing but death before me ; that I should either 
be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, 
or starved to death for want of food. At the ap" 
proach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild crea-> 
turet ; but slept soundly, though it rained all night. 

October I. In the morning I saw, to my great 
surprise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and 
w^ driven on shore again much nearer the island ; 
which, as it was some comfort on one hand ^for see*^ 
ing her sit upright, and not broken in pieces, I 
hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board, 
and get some food and necessaries out of her for my 
relief), so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief 
at the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we 
had all staid on board, might have saved the ship, 
or, at least, that they would not have been all 
drowned, as they were ; and that, had the men been 
saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat, out 
of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some 
other part of the world. I spent great part of this 
day in perplexing myself on these things ; but, at 
length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the 
sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. 
This day also it continued raining, though with no 
wind at all. 

From the 1st of October to the 24:th. All theie

days entirely spent in many several voyages to get 
all I could out of the ship ; which J brought on shore, 
every tide of flood, upon rails. Much rain also in 
these days, though with sOme intervals of fair wea^ 
ther : but, it seems, this was the rainy season. 

OcU 20. I overset m^ riaA, and aJl the goods I 
had got upon it ; but bemg in shoal water, and the 
things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of 
them when the tide was out. 

Oct. 25, It rained all night and all day, with 
some gusts of wind; during which time the ship 
broke in pieces (the wind blowing a little harder 
than before) and was no more to be seen, except 
the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I 
spent this day in covering and securing the goods 
which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them. 

Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all 
day, to find out a place to fix my habitation ; greatly 
concerned to secure myself from any attack in the 
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards 
night I fixed upon a proper place, under a rock, 
and marked out a semicircle from my encampment ; 
which I resolved to strengtlien with a work, wall, 
or fortification, made of double piles, lined within 
with cables, and without with turf. 

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in 
carrying all mv goods to my new habitation, though 
some part of the time it rained exceedingly hard. 

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the 
island with my gun, to see for some food, and dis- 
cover the country ; when I killed a she-goat, and 
her kid followed me home, wl)ich I afterwards killed 
also, because it would not feed. 

November I. I set up my tent under a rock, and 
lay there for the first night ; making it as large as !• 
could, with stakes driven in to swing my hammock 
upon.

Ndt. S. I Jiet up all iny dbfista and boards, and 
the pieces of timber which made my rafts ; and with 
them formed a fence round me, a little within the 
place I had marked out for my fortification. 

Nov. S. I went out with my gun, and killed two 
fowls like ducks, which were very cood food. In 
the afternoon I went to work to make me a table. 

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order mv times 
of work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, 
and time of diversion ; viz. every morning 1 walked 
out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did 
not rain ; then employed myself to work till about 
eleven o'clock ; then ate what I had to live on ; and 
from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather 
being excessive hot , and then, in the eveninff, to 
work again. The working part of this day and the 
next was wholly employed in making my table, 
for I was yet but a very sorry workman : though 
time and necessity made me a complete natural 
mechanic soon after, as I believe they would any 
one else. 

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and 
dog, and killed a wUd cat ; her skin pretty soft, but 
her flesh good for nothing : of every creature that 
I killed I took off the skins, ahd preserved tliem. 
Coming back by the sea-shore, I saw many sorts of 
sea-fowl which I did not understand : but was sur« 
prised, and almost frightened, with two or three 
seals ; which, while I was gazing at them (not well 
knowinff what they were) got into the sea, and 
escaped me for that time. 

Nov. 6* After my morning wdk, I went to work 
with m^ table again, and finished it, though not to 
my likmg: nor was it long before I learned to 
mend it, 

Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. 
The 7th, 8th, 9th, lOUi, and part of the 12th (for

the nth was Sunday, according to my reckoning ) 
I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with 
much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but never 
to please me ; and, even in the making, I pulled it 
in pieces several times. 

Note. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; 
for, omitting my mark for them on my post, I ior- 
got which was which. 

Nov. 13. This day it rained; which refreshed 
me exceedingly, and cooled the earth : but it was 
accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning, 
which frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my pow- 
der. As soon as it was over, I resolved to separate 
my stock of powder into as many little parcels as 
possible, that it might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in 
making little square chests or boxes, which might 
hold about a pound, or two pounds at most, of pow- 
der : and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in 
places as secure and as remote from one another as 
possible. On one of these three days 1 killed a. 
large bird that was good to eat ; but I knew not 
what to call it. 

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my 
tent, into the rock, to make room for my farther 
convenience. 

Note. Three things 1 wanted exceedingly for this 
work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel-barrow, 
or basket ; so I desisted from my work, and began 
to consider how to supply these wants, and make 
me some tools. As for a pick-Axe, I made yse of 
the iron crows, which were proper -enough, though 
heavy ; but the next thing was a shovel or spade ; 
this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I 
could do nothing effectually wiuiout it ; but what 
kind of one to make 1 knew not. 

Nov, 18. The next day, in searching the woods.

r found ft tree of that wood, or like it, wMdh, in the 
Brazils, they call the iron tree, from its exceeding 
hardness s of this, with great labour, and almost 
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece ; and brought it home, 
too, with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding 
heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and 
my having no other way, made me a Ions while 
upon this machine : for I worked it effectutuly, by 
little and little, into the form of a shovel or spade ; 
the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only 
that the broad part having no iron shod upon it at 
bottom, it would not last me so long: however, it 
served well enough for the uses which I had occa- 
sion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe^ 
made after that fashion, or so long a*makine. 

I was still deficient; for I wanted a basLet, or a 
wheel-barrow. A basket I could not make by any 
means, having no such things as twigs that would 
bend to make wicker-vrare ; at least, none yet found 
out: and as to the wheel-barrow, I fancied 1 could 
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion 
of; neither did I know how to eo about it ; besides, 
I had no possible way to make iron gudgeons for 
the spindle or axis of the wheel to run m; so I gave 
it over : and, for carrying away the earth which I 
duff out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod, 
which the labourers cany mortar in for the brick- 
layers. This was not so difficult to me as the mak- 
ing the shovel: and yet this and the shovel, and the 
attempt which I made in vain to make a wheel- 
barrow, took me up no less than four daj^s ; I mean, 
always excepting my morning walk with my gun, 
which I seldom omitted, and very seldom failed also 
bringing home something fit to eat. 

Nov. 28. My other work having now stood still, 
because of my making these tools, when they were 
finished I went on; and working every day, as my

Strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days 
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it 
might hold my goods commodiously. 

Note^ During all this time, I worked to make 
this room, or cave, spacious enough to accommo- 
date me as a warehouse or magazme, a kitchen, a 
dining-room, and a cellar. As for a lodging, I kept 
to the tent; except that sometimes, in &e wet sea- 
son of the year, it rained so hard that I could not 
keep myself dry ; which caused me afterwards to 
cover all my place within my pale with long poles, 
in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and 
load them with flags and large leaves of trees, Uke 
a thatch. 

December 10. J hegan now to think my cave or 
vault finished; when on a sudden (it seems I had 
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell 
down from the top and one side: so much, that, in 
short, it frightened me, and not without reason too ; 
for if I had been under it, I should never have 
wanted a grave«digger. Upon this disaster, I had a 
oreat deal of work to do over again, for I had the 
loose earth to carry out; and, wtadi was of more 
importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I 
might be sure no more would come down. 

Dee. 11. This day I went to work with it ac- 
cordingly; and got two shears or posts pitched up- 
right to the top, with two pieces of board across 
over each post: this I finished the next day; and 
setting more posts up with boards, in about a week 
noore I had the roof secured ; and the posts stand- 
ing in rows, served me for partitions to part off 
my house. 

Dee. 17* From this day to the 30th, I placed 
shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts, to hanff 
every thing up that could be hung up : and now I 
began to be in some order within doors.

Dec. 20. I carried every thing into the cave, and 
began to furnish my house, and set up some pieces 
of boards, like a dresser, to order my victuals upon; 
but boards began to be very scarce with me: also 
I made me another table.

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat ; and lamed ano- 
ther, so that I catched it, and led it home in a 
string; when I had it home, I bound and splintered 
up its leg, which was broke. 

N. B. I took such care of it that it lived; and 
the leg grew well, and as strong as ever ; .but, by 
nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed upon the 
little green at my door, and would not go away. 
This was the first time tiiat I entertained a thought 
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might 
have food when my poWder and shot was all spent. 

D^c. 28,29,30,31. Great heats, and po breeze; 
so that there was no stirring abroad, except, in the 
evening, for food : this time I spent in putting all 
my things in order within doors. 

Jantjuiry I . Very hot still ; but I went abroad 
early and late with niy gun, and lay still in the 
middle of the. day. This evening, going farther 
into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the 
island, I found there was plenty of goats, though* 
exceeding shy, and hard to come at; however, I re- 
solved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt 
them down. Accordingly, the next day, I went out 
with my dog, and set him upon the goats : but I 
was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the 
dog : and he knew his danger too well, for he would 
not come near them.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

Jan, 3. I began'inv fence or wall ; which, being 
still jealous of my bemg attacked by somebody, I 
resolved to make very thick and strong. 

N. B, This wall being described before, I pur- 
posely omit what was said in the journal: it is suf- 
ncient to observe, that I was no less time than from 
the Sd of January to the 14th of April, woricing, 
finishing, and perfecting this wall ; though it was 
no more than about 25 yards in length, being a 
half-circle, from one place in the rock to anotner 
place about twelve yards from it, the door of the 
cave being in the centre, behind it. 

All this time 1 wcnrked very hard ; the rains hin- 
dering me many days, nay sometimes weeks toge- 
ther; but I thought I should never be perfectly se- 
cure till this wall was finished ; and it is scarce cre- 
dible w4iat inexpressible labour every thing was 
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the 
woods, and driving them into the ground; for I made 
them much bigger than I needed to have done. 

When this wall was finished, and the outside 
double-fenced, with a turf-wall raised up close to it, 
I persuaded myselfthatifany people were to come 
on shore there they would not perceive any thing 
like a hi^itation : and it was very well I did so, as 
may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable 
occasion. 

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods 
for game qvery day, when the rain permitted me, 
and made frequent discoveries, in these walks, of 
something or other to my advantage ; particularly, 
I found a kind of wild pigeons, who build, not as 
wood-pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons, 
in the holes of the rocks: and, taking some young 
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and 
did SO; but when they grew older, they flew all 
away; which, perhaps, was at first for want of

howevor^ I frequently fouad their nests, «ad got 
their young ones, which were Tery good meat. And 
BOW, m the managing my boosehold affiurs, I found 
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at 
^t it was impossible for me to make ; as indeed, 
at to some of them, it was : for instuice, I eould 
nerer make a cask to be hooped. I had a small 
runlet or two, as I observed before ; but I Gouid 
never arrive to tlie capacity of making one by thenO) 
thoi;^h I spoilt many weeks aboot it: I could nei- 
ther put in the heacis, nor join the staves; so true to 
one another as to make them hold wat^; so I gave 
that also over. In the next place, I was at a great 
loss for candle; so that as soon as it was dark, 
which was generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged 
to go to bed. I remember the lump of bees-wax 
with which I made candles in my African adven^ 
ture ; bat Iliad none of that now : the only remedy 
I had was, that when I had killed a goat, I saved 
the tidlow ; and willi a little dish made of clay, 
which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick 
of some oakam, J made me a lamp; and this gave 
me light, though not a clear steady H^t lihd a can*- 
dle. in the middle of all my labours it happened, 
IJbat in rummaging my things, I found a little bag ; 
which, as I hinted ben>re, had been filled with con^, 
for the feeding of poultry ; not for this voyage, but 
before, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lis- 
bon. What little remainder of corn had been m 
the h»g was all devoured with the rats, and I saw 
notbbg in the bag but huska and dust ; and being , 
willing to have the bag for some other use (I think, 
it was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear 
of the lii^tning, or some such use), I ^ook the 
husks of com out of it, on one side dT my fortifica>>

ROBINSQN cBuaos. 87 

It was a little before the great rain just now 
mentioned, that I threw this stuff away ; taking no 
notice of any thing, and not so much as remeo^r- 
ing that I had thrown any thing there ; when about 
a month after, I saw some few stalks of somethinff 
green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied 
might be some plant 1 had not seen; but I was sur* 

Erised, and periectly astonished, when, after a little 
mger time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come 
out, which were perfect green barley of the same 
kind as our European, nay as dur English barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and 
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion t I had 
hitherto acted upon no religious foundati<Hi at all ; 
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my 
head, nor had entertained any sense of any thing 
that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance^ or, 
as we lightly .say, what pleases God; without so 
much as inquiring into the end of Providence in 
these things, or his order in governing events in 
the world. But after I saw barley grow there, in 
a climate which I knew was not proper for com» 
and especially as I knew not how it came there, it 
startled me strangely; and I began to suggest, that 
God had miraculously caused this grain to grow 
without any help of seed sown, and that it was so 
directed purely for my sustenance, on that wild 
miserable place. 

This touched my heart a httle, and brought team 
out of my eyes; and I beean ty bless myself Siat such 
a prodipy of nature should happen upon my account: 
and this was the more strange to me, because I 
saw near it still, all along by the side of the rock» 
some other straggling stalks, which proved to be 
stalks of rice, and which I knew, because 1 had seen 
it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.

Providence for my support, but, not doubtine that 
there was more in the place, I went over all that 
part'of the island where I had been before searching 
m every corner, and under every rock, for more 
of it; but I could not find any. At last it occur- 
red to my thoughts, that I had shook out a bag 
of chicken*8-meat in that place, and then the won- 
der began to cease ; and I must confess, my religious 
thaokuilness to God*8 providence began to abate 
tooy upon the discovering that all this was nothing 
but what was common; though I c^ght to have 
been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a 
providence, as if it had been miraculous ; for it was 
really the work of Providence, as to me, that should 
order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn 
should remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroy- 
ed fiU, the rest, as if it had been dropt from heaven ; 
as also, that I should throw it out in that particular 
place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it 
sprang up immediatelv ; Vhereas, if I had thrown 
it any where else, at that time, it would have been 
burnt up and destroyed. 

I carefiillv saved the ears of this com, you may 
be sure, in their season, which was about the end of 
June; and, laying up every com, I resolved to sow 
them all again; hoping, in time, to have some 
quantity sufficient to supply me with bread. But 
it was not till the fourth year that I could allow 
myself the least grain of this com to eat, and even 
then but sparingly, as«I shall show afterwards, in 
its order ; for 1 lost all that I sowed the first sea- 
son, by not observing the proper time; as I 
sowed just before the dry season, so that it never 
came up at all, at least not as it would have done ; 
of which in its place* 

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty 
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the

to the aame piurpoie^ viz. to make mc bread, or ra^ 
ther food; for I foimi wayi to cook it up without 
baking, though I did that also after some time.-^ 
But to return to my Journal. 

I worked excesaivelj hard these three or four 
months, to get my wall done; and the 14th of 
April I closed it up; contriving to get into it, not 
by a door, but over the wall, by « ladder, that there 
might be no sign on the outside of my habitation. 

April 16. 1 finished the ladder ; so I went up 
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up 
after me^ and let it down in the inside : this was a 
complete enclosure to me ; for within I had room 
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-* 
out, unless it could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was fioished, I 
had almost all my labour overthrown at cmce) end 
myself killed ; the case was thus i^-Am I was busy 
in the inside of it, behind my tent, just at the en- 
trance into rav cave, I was terribly frightened with a 
most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for all on a 
sudden, I found the earth come crumbling down 
firom the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the 
hill over my head, and two of the posts I had set up 
in the cave cracked in a frighti^ maimer. I was 
heartily acared; but thought nothing of what really 
was the cause, only thinSng that the top of my 
cave was &lline in, as some of it bad done before; 
and for fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward 
to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there 
neither, 1 got over my wall for foar of the pieces of 
the hill which 1 expected mig^t roU down upon me. 
I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, 
than I plainly saw it was a temble eartbqui^e ; for 
the ground 1 stood on shook three times at about 
eight minutes distance, with three sud) ahocks as

would have overturned the strongest building that 
could be supposed to have stood on the earth ; and 
a great piece of the top of a rock, which «tood about 
htdf a mile from me, next the sea, fell down, with 
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life. 
I perceived also that the very sea was put into a vio- 
lent motion by it ; and I believe the shocks were 
stronger under the water than on the island. 

I was so much amazed with the thing itself (hav- 
ing never felt the like, nor discoursed with any one 
that had) that 1 was like one dead or stupified ; and 
the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like 
one that was tossed at sea: but the noise of the 
falling of the rock awaked me, as it were; and 
rousing me from the stupefied condition I was in, 
filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing 
but the hill, falling upon my tent and my household 
goods, and burying all at once ; this sunk my very 
soul within me a second time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more 
for sometime^ I began to take courage; yet I had 
not heart enough to g^^over my wall again, for fear 
of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground 
greatly cast down, and disconsolate, not knowing 
what to do. All this while, I had not the least se- 
rious religious thought ; nothing but the common 
Lord have mercy upon me ! and when it was over, 
that went away too. 

While 1 sat thus, I found the air overcast, and 
grow cloudy, as if it would rain; and soon after 
die wind rose by little, and little, so that in less than 
half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane: the 
sea was, all on a sudden, covered with foam and 
froth ; the shore was covered with a breach of the 
water; the trees were toi-n up by the roots; and a ter- 
rible storm it was. This held about three hours, and 
than began to abate; and in two hours more it was

quite calm, and began to rain very hard. A 11 this while 
1 sat upon the ground, very much terrified and deject- 
ed ; when, on a sudden, it came into my thoughts, 
that these winds and rain being tlie consequence of 
the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and 
over, and I might venture into my cave again. With 
this thought my spirits began to revive ; and the rain 
also helping to persuade me, I went in, and sat 
down in my tent ; but the rain was so violent, that 
my tent was ready to be beaten down witli it ; and I 
was forced to get into my cave, thoueh very much 
afraid and uneasy, for fear it should faU on my bead. 
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to 
cut a hole through my new fortification, like a smk, 
to let the water go out, which would else have 
drowned my cave. Afler I had been in my cave 
for some time, and found no more shocks of the 
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. 
And now to support my spirits, which indeed want- 
ed it very much, I went to my little store, and took 
a small sup of rum ; which, however, I did then, and 
always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no 
more when that was gone. It continued raining 
all that night, and great part of the next day, so 
that I could not stir abroad : but my mind being 
more composed, I began to think of what I had 
best do ; concluding, diat if the island was subject 
to these earthquakes, there would be no living for 
me in a cave, but I must consider of building me 
some little hut in an open place, which I might sur- 
round with a wall, as I had done here, and so make 
mvself secure from wild beasts or men : for if I staid 
where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, 
be buried alive. 

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my 
tent from the place where it now stood, being just 
under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which,

if it shQuld be shaken agaio, would oertainly fall 
upon my tent. I spent the two next days, being 
the 19th and ^tb of April, in contriving where and 
how to remove my habitation. 'Die fear of being 
swallowed alive a&cted me 80» that I never slept in 
quiet ; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad, 
without any fence, was almost equal to it : but still^ 
when I looked about, and saw how every thing was 
put in order, how pleasantly I was concealed, and 
how safe from danger, it made me very loth to re* 
move. In the mean time, it occurred to me that it 
would reouire a vast deal of time for me to do this ; 
and that I must be contented to run the ri^ where 
I was, till I had formed a convenient camp, and s&> 
cured it so as to remove to it. With this conclusion 
I composed myself for a tinle ; and resolved that I 
would so to work with all speed to build me a wall 
with pUes and cables, &c. in a circle as belbre, and 
set up my tent in it when it was finished ; but that 
I would venture to stay where I was till it was rea* 
dy, and fit to remove to. This was the 91st. . 

April 92. The next morning I began to consider 
of means to put this mesisure mto execution ; buti 
was at a greait loss about the tools. I had three larse 
axes» and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the 
hatchets for traffic with the Indians) ; but with much 
obopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were 
all full of notches, and dull : and thou^ I had a 
grind-stone, I could not turn it and grind my took 
too* This caused me as much thought as a stafees« 
man would have bestowed upon a grand point of 
politics> or a judge upon the life and death of a 
man. At length I contrived a wheel with a string, 
to turn it with my foot, that I might have bodi my 
hands at lib^v. 

Notef I had never seen any such thing in Bag* 
land, or at least net to take notice how it was doiM,

though since I have obsenred it is very common 
there : besides that, my ^ind-stone was very large 
and heavy. This machine cost me a full week's 
work to bring it to perfection. 

AprU 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in 
grinding my tools, my machine for turning my 
grind-stone performing very well. • 

April 30. Having perceived that my bread had 
been iow a great while, 1 now took a survey of it, 
and reduced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which 
made my heart very heavy. 

May 1 . In the morning, looking toward the sea- 
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the 
shore bigger than brdmary, and it lomied like a 
cask : when I came to it, 1 found a small barrel, and 
two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which 
were driven on shore by the late hurricane ; and 
looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it 
seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used 
to do. I examined the barrel that was driven on 
shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpow- 
der; but it had taken water, and the powder was 
caked as hard as a stone : however, I rolled it farther 
on the shore for the present, and went on upon 
the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the 
ship, to look tor more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it 
strangely removed. The forecastle, which lay be- 
fore buned in sand, was heaved up at least six feet : 
and the stem (which was broke to pieces, and 
parted from the rest, by the force of the sea, soon 
tt^r I had lefl ruromagmg of her) was tossed, as it 
were, up, and cast on one side : and the sand was 
thrown so high on that side next her stem, that I 
could now walk quite up to her when the tide was 
out ; whereas there was a great piece of water be- 
fore, so that I could not come within a quarter of a

nule of the wreck witheut twimming. I was 0iir- 
prised with this at first, but soon concluded it must 
be done by the earthquake ; and as by this violenca 
the ship was more broke open than formerly, §m 
many things came daily on shore, which the sea had 
loosened, and which the winds and water rolled bj 
degrees to the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the de- 
sign of removing my habitation ; and I busied my- 
self mightilv, that day especially, in searching whie^ 
ther I could make any way into the ship: but I found 
nothing was to be expected of that kind, for all the 
inside of the ship was choked up with sand. How- 
ever, as I had learned not to despair of any thing, I 
resolved to pull every thing to pieces thai 1 could of 
the ship, concluding that every thin^ I could get 
from her would be of some use or other to me. 

Mai/ S. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of 
A beam through, which I diought held some of the 
upper part or quarter-deck together ; and whov I 
had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well 
M I could from the side which lay highest ; but the 
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that 
time. 

Mat/ 4. I went a-fishine, but caught not one 
fish that I durst eat of, till iwaa weary of my sport ; 
wh&o^ just going to leave off, I caueht a young dol- 
phin. I had nme me a long line of some rope^yarDt 
but I had no hooks ; yet I frequently caught fish 
enough, as much as I cared to eat ; all which I 
dried in the sun, and ate them dry. 

May 5. Worked on the wreck : cut another beam 
asunder, and brought three great fir-planks off from , 
the decks; which I tied together, and made swim 
on shore when the tide of flood came on. 

May 6. Worked on the wreck ; got several iron 
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iroQ«work ;

and had diosffhts of giving it over. 

M<ry 7. 'Went to the wreck aeain, but not with 
an intent to woric : but found the weight of the 
wreck had broke itself down, the beams beine cut ; 
that several pieces of tlie ship seemed to lie loose ; 
and the insioe of the hold lay so open that I could 
see into it ; but almost full of water and sand. 

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron 
crow to wrench up the deck, whidi lay now quite 
clear of the water and sand. I wrenched up two 
planks, and brought them on shore also with the 
tide. 1 left the iron crow in the wreck for next day. 

M(iy 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow 
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt seve* 
ral casks, and loosened them with the crow, but 
could not break them up. I felt also a roll of £ng« 
lish lead, and could stir it ; but it was too heavy to 
remove. 

May 10 to 14*. Went every day to the wreck ; 
and got a great many pieces oi timber, and boards, 
or plank, and two or three hundred weight of iron. 

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I 
could not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing 
the edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the other ; 
but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I 
could not make any blow to drive the hatchet. 

May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and 
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of the 
water ; but I staid so long in the woods, to ^t pi- 
geons for food, that the tide prevented my going to 
the wreck that day. 

May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown 
on shore, at a great distance, two miles off me, but 
resolved to see what they were, and found it was a 
piece of flie head, but too heavy for me to bring 
away.

96 ADVENTURES OF 

May 24*. Every day, to this day, I worked on the 
wreck; and with hard labour I loosened somethings 
80 much ^ith the crow, that the first t)lQwing tide 
several casks floated out,^ and two of the seamen's 
chests : but the wind blowing from the shore, no- 
thing came to land that day but pieces of timber, 
and a hogshead, which had sotne Brasil pork in it ; 
but the salt water and the sand had spoiled it. I 
continued this work every day to the ,15 th of June, 
except the time necessary to get food ; which I al- 
ways appointed, during this part of my employment, 
to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready 
when it was ebbed out : and by this time I had got- 
ten timber, and plank, and iron-work^ enough to 
have built a good boat, if 1 had known how : and I 
also got, at several times, and in several pieces, near 
one hundredweight of the sheet-lead. 

June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a 
large tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had 
seen ; which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not 
any defect of the place, or scarcity: for had I hap- 
pened to be on the other side of the island, I might 
have had hundreds of them every day, as I found af- 
terwards ; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them. 

June 17, I spent in cooking the turtle. I found 
in her threescore eggs: and her flesh was to me, at 
that time, the most savoury and pleasant that 1 ever 
tasted in my life; having had no flesh, but of goats 
and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place. 

June 18. Rained all that day, and I staid with- 
in. I thought, at this time, the rain felt cold, and 
I was somewhat chilly ; which I knew was not usual 
in that latitude. 

June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the wea- 
ther had been cold. 

June 20. No rest all night ; violent pains in my 
head, and feverish.

June 21. Very ill; frightened almost to death 
with the appreheDsions of my sad condition, to be 
sick, and no help: prayed to God, for the first time 
since the storm off Hull ; but scarce knew what I 
said, or why, my thoughts being all confused. 

JuTie 22. A little better ; but under dreadful 
apprehensions of sickness. 

June^%. Very .bad again; cold and shivering, 
and then a violent head-ache. 

June 24. Much better. 

June 25, An ague very violent : the fit held me 
seven hours ; cold St, and Aot, with faint sweats af- 
ter it. 

June 26. Better ; and having no victuals to eat, 
took ihy gun, but found myself very weak: however, 
I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty got it 
home, and broued some of it, and ate. I would fain 
have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot. 

June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay 
abed all day, and neither ate nor drank. I was 
ready to perish for thirst ; but so weak, I had not 
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to 
drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-headed : 
and when i was not, I was so ignorant that I knew 
not what to say ; only lay and cried, Lord, look up- 
on me! Lord, pity me ! Lord, have mercy upon me! 
I suppose I cUa nothing else for two or tnree hours ; 
till me fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not 
wake till far in the night. When I awoke, I found 
myself much refireshed, but weak, and exceeding 
thirsty : however, as I had no water in my whole 
habitation, I was forced to lie till mornings and 
went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this 
terrible dream; I thought that I was sitting on the 
ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat 
when the storm blew afler the earthquake, and that 
1 saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a

bright iama pf (ir«, and light upon the ground : he 
was all otet as bright aa a flame, so that I coidd but 
just bear to look towards him : his countekiince was 
tnost imeitpressiblv dreadful, impossible for words to 
describe : when ne stepped upon the ground with 
his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had 
done before in the earthquake ; and all the air look- 
ed, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled with 
flashes of fire. He had no sooner landed upon th« 
earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a 
long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me ; and 
when he came to a rising ground, «t some distance, 
he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible that it 
is' impossible to express the terror of it : all that I 
can sej I understood, was this : Seeing all these 
things have not brought thee to repentance,* now 
thou shalt die ; at which words, I thought he lifted 
up the spear that was in his hand^ to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account, will ex- 
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors of 
mv soul at thi« terrible vision ; I mean, that even 
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those hor- 
rors ; nor is it any .more possible to describe the im- 
pression that remained upon my mind when I 
awaked, and found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas ! no dinne knowledge : what I had re^ 
ceived by the good instruction of my fieither was 
then worn out, by an uninterrupted series, for dght 
years, of sealkring wickedness, and a constant con- 
versation with none but such as were, like myself, 
wicked and profane to the last de^ee. K do not re- 
member that I had, in all that tmne, one thought 
that so much as tended either to looking^ upward 
towards God, or inward towards a reflection upon 
my own ways : but a certain stupidity of soul, with- 
out desire of good^ oreonseiousnessof evil, had en-

common siiilors, can be supposed to be ; not having 
tbe least sense, either of the fear of God, in danger^ 
•r of thankfulness to him, in delnrerances. 

In the relating what is already past of my story, 
this wUl be the ni<M*e easily believed, when I shall add, 
that through all Uie variety of miseries that had to 
this day befallen me, I never had so mudi as one 
thougb^ of its being the hand of God, or that it wm^ 
a just punishment for my sin ; either ray rebellious 
hehaviojor agisinst my &ther, or my present sins, 
which were great ; or even as a punishment for the 
general course of my wicked life. When I was on 
2ie desperate expedition on the desert shoses of 
Africa, I never had so muph as one thought of what 
would become of me ; or one wish' to God to direct 
me whither I should go, or to keep me from the dan* 
gei which apparently surrounded me, as well from 
voracious creatures as crud savages i but I was quite 
thoughtless of a God or a Providence ; acted like a 
mere brute, from the principles of nature, and by the 
dictates of common sense only ; and indeed hardly 
that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea bv 
^ Portuguese captain, well used, and dealt with 
justly and honorably, as well as charitably, I had 
not the least Uiankfulness in my thoughts. When, 
agaizi, I was shipwrecked, miaed, and in danger of 
drowning, on this island, I was as &r from remorse^ 
or looking on it as a judgement : I only said to my- 
self often, that I was an un£9rtunate dog, and born 
to be always miserable. 

It is true, when I first got on shore here, and 
found all my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, 
I was surprisejd with a kind qf ecstasy, and some 
transports of soul, which, had the grace of God as- 
sistect might have come up to true thankfulness :

of joy ; or, as I may say, being slad I was alive, 
without the least renection upon the distinguished 
goodness of the hand which had preserved me, i|nd 
had singled me out to be preserved when all the rest 
were destroyed, or an inquiry why Providence had 
been thus merciful to me : just the same common 
sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they 
are got safe ashore from a shipwreck ; which they 
drown all in the next bowl of punch, and forget al- 
most as soon as it is over : and all the rest of my 
life was like it. Even when I wa«, afterwards, on 
due consideration, made sensible of my condition, 
—-how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the 
reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief, or 
prospect of redemption, — 9s soon as I saw but a 
prospect of living, and that I should not starve and 
perish for hunger, all the sense of my affliction 
wore off, and I began to be very easy, applied myself 
to the works proper for my preservation and supply, 
and was &r enough from being afflicted at my con- 
dition, as a pudgeibent from Heaven, or as the hand 
of God agamst me : these were thoughts which very 
seldom entered into my head. 

The growing up of the com, as is hinted in my 
Journal, had, at first, some little influence upon 
me, and began to affect me with seriousness, as 
long as I thouj^ht it had something miraculous in 
it ; but as soon as that part of the thouffht was re- 
moved, all the impression which was raised from it 
wore off also, as I have noted already. Even the 
earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible 
in its nature, or more immediately directing to the 
invisible Power which alone durects such things, yet 
no sooner was the fright over, but the impression it 
had made went off also. I had no more sense of God^ 
or his judgements, much less of the present affliction 
of my circumstances being from his hand, than if I

These rejections oppressed me for the second or

rable condition, raised vapours in my head with the 
mere apprehension: and, in them hurries of my 
soul, I knew not what my tongue might eiipress : 
but it was rather exclamation, such as, Lord, what 
a miserable creature am I ! If I. should be sick, I 
ahall certainly die for want of help ; and what will 
become of me ? Then the tears burst out of my 
eyes> and I could say no more for a good while* In 
this interval, the good advice of my father came to 
niy mind, and presently his prediction, which I men^- 
tioned at the beginning of this story, viz. that if I 
did take this foolish step, God would not bless m# ; 
and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon 
having neglected his counsel, when there niight be 
none tp assist in my reoovery. Now, said h aloudl

hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence, which 
had mercifully put me in a station of life wherein I 
might liave been happy and easy; but I would nei- 
ther see it myself 9 nor learn from my parents to know 
the blessing of it. I left them to mourn over my 
folly ; and now I am left to mourn under the conse- 
quences of it : I refused their help and assistance, 
who would have pushed me in the world, and would 
have made every thing easy to me ; and now I have 
difficulties to struggle with, too great for even na- 
ture itself to support ; and no assistance, no com- 
fort, no advice. Tnen I cHed out, Lord, be my help, 
for I am in ffreat distress. This was the first prayer, 
if I may call it so, that I had made for many years. 
But I return to my Journal. 

June^, Having been somewhat refreshed with the 
sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, 1 got 
up ; and though the fright and terror of my dream 
was very great, yet I considered that the nt of the 
ague would return again the next day, and now was 
my tim& to get something to refresh and support 
myself when I should be ill. The first thing I did 
was to fill a large square case-bottle with water ; 
and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed : and 
to take off the chiU or aguish disposition of the wa- 
ter, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, 
and mixed them together. Then I got me a piece 
of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but 
could eat very little. I walked about ; but was very 
weak, and withal very sad and heavy-heilrted in the 
sense of my miserable condition, dreading the re- 
turn of my distemper the next day. At night, I 
made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs; which 
I roasted in tne ashes, and ate, as we ciul it, in the 
■shell : and this was the first bit of meat I had ever 
asked God's blessing to, as I could remember, in my 
whole life. After I hs^ eaten, I tried to walk ; but found

myself so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun 
(for I never went out without that) ; so I went but 
a little way, and sat down upon the ground, look- 
ing out upon the sea, which was just before me, and 
very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such 
thoughts as these occurred to me : What is this earth 
and sea, of which I have seen so much ? Whence is 
it produced ? And what am I, and all the other crea* 
tures, wild and tame, human and brutal ? Whence 
are we ? Surely, we are all made by some secret 
power, who formed the earth and sea, the air and 
sky. And who is that? Then it followed most na- 
turally, It is God that has made all. Well, but then, 
it came on strangely, if God has made all these 
things, he guides and governs them all, and all 
things that concern them ; for the power Uiat could 
make all things, must certainly have power to guide 
and direct them : if so, nothmg can happen in the 
crreat circuit of his works, either without his know- 
ledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, 
he knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful 
condition : and if nothing happens without his ap- 
pointment, he has appointed all this to befall me. 
Nothing occurred to my thought, to contradict any 
of these conclusions : and therefore it rested upon me 
with the greatest force, that it must needs be that 
God had appointed all this to befall me ; that I was 
brought to tiiis miserable circumstance by his direc- 
tion, ne haying the sole power, not of me only, but 
of every thing that happens in the world. Immedi- 
ately it followed, Why has God done this to me? 
What have I done to be thus used ? My conscience pre« 
gently ch'ecked me in that inquiry, as if I had blas- 
phemed ; and methoueht it spoke to me like a voice> . 
Wretch \ dost thou ask what thou hast done ? Look

«bip was taken by the Sallee man of war; devoured 
by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa ; or drownr 
ed herey when all the crew perished but thyself? 
Dost thou ask what thou hast done ? I was struck 
dumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and 
had not a word to sav ; np, not tp answer to myself; 
and, rising up pensive and sad» walked back tp my 
retreat, and went over ray wall^ as if I had been go- 
ing to bed : but my though^ were sadly disturbed* 
and I had no inctination to sleep ; so I sat down in 
the chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be 
dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my 
distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my 
thought, that the Brazilians take no phvsic b^^ 
their tobacco for almost all distempers; and I had a 
piece of a roll of tobacco in on^ of the chests, whiph 
was quite cured; and some also that was green, an4 
not quite cured* 

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt: for in this 
chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I 
.opened the chest, and found what I looked for, viz. 
the tobacco ; and as the few books I had savf^d lay 
there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I men- 
tioned before, and which to this time I bfid ngt 
found leisure, or so much as inclination* to look ix^- 
to. I say, I took it out» and brought both that and 
the tobacco with me to the table. What usfe to makp 
of the tobacco I knew not, as to mv distemper, npr 
whether it was good fpr it or not; but 1 tried seve- 
re experiments with it, as if I was resolved^t^sboutd 
hit one way or other. X first took a pi^e of a leaf, 
and chewea it in my mouth ; which, indeed, at firs^ 
almost stupefied my brain ; (he tobaccp being green 
and strong, and such as 1 had not i^een mucn use^

to* Then I took some and steeped it an hour or twd 
in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when 
I lay down : and, lastly, I burnt some upon a pan 
of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of 
it as long as I could bear it ; as well for the heat, as 
almost for suffocation. In the interval of this ope- 
ration, I took up the Bible, and began to read ; but 
my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco 
to bear reading, at least at that time ; oifly, having 
opened the book casually, the first words that oc- 
curred to me were these : " Call on me in the day of 
trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glo* 
rify me." These words were very apt to my case ; 
and made some impression upon my thoughts at the 
time of reading them, though not so much as they 
did afterwards; for, as for being delivered^ the 
word had no sound, as I may say, to me ; the thing 
was so remote> so impossible in my apprehension 
of things, that, as the children of Israel said when 
they were promised flesh to eat, " Can God spread a 
table in the wilderness?" so I began to say, Can even 
God himself deliver me from this place ? And as it 
was not for many years that any hopes appeared, 
this prevailed very often upon my thoughts : but, 
however, the woros m^e a great impression upon 
mre, and I mused upon them very often. It now 
grew late ; and the tobacco had, as I swd, dozed my 
head Ibo much, that I inclined to sleep : so I left my 
lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want any 
thing in the night, and went to bed. But before 1 
lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life ; 
I kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the pro^ 
mise to me, that if I called upon him in the day of 
trouble, he would deliver me. After my broken and 
imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which 
I had steeped the tobacco; which was so strong and 
rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce get

after ; tor otherwise, I know not how I should lose 
a day ouW)f my reckoning in the days of the week, 
as it appeared some years after I had done ; for if I 
had lost it by crossing and^re^crossing the Line* I 
should have lost more than one day; but certainly I 
lost a day in my account, and never knew which 
way. Be that, however, one way or the othert 
when I awakedlfound myself exceedingly refreshed^ 
and my spirits lively and cheerful : when I got upi 
I was stronger than I was tli^ day before, and my 
stomach better, for I was hungry ; and, in short, I 
had no fit the next day, but continued much aUered 
for the better. This was the 99th, 

The 30th was my well dajr, of course ; and I wept 
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel toe 
far. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a 
brand goose, and brought them home ; but was not 
very forward to eat them ; so I ate seme more ef 
the turtle's eggs, which were verv good. This 
evening I renewed the medicine, which I had sup^ 
posed did me good the day before, vis. the tobacco

fore, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold mv

the next day, which was the 1st of July, as I hoped 
I should have been; for I had a little of the cold fit» 
but it was not much.

Jfe/y S. I missed the fit for good and all> though 
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks 
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my 
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this scripture, " I will 
d^Ter thee ;" and the impossibility of my deliver- 
ance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever 
expecting it : but as I was discouraging myself with 
0uch thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored 
80 much upon my deliverance from the main afflic- 
tion, that 1 disregarded the deliverance I had re-* 
ceived ; and I was, as it were, made to ask myself 
such questions as these, viz. Have I not -been deli- 
vered, and wonderfully too, from sickness ; from the 
most distressed condition that could be, and that 
was so irightfiil to me? and what notice have I 
taken of itr Have I done my part? God has delivered 
me, but I have not glorified him ; that is to say, I 
have not owned and been thankful for that as a de- 
liverance : and how can I expect a greater deliver- 
ance ? This touched my heart very much ; and im- 
mediatdy I knelt down, and gave Grod thanks aloud 
for my recovery from my sickness. 

July 4. In the morning I took the Bible ; and 
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously 
to read it ; and imposed upon myself to read awhile 
every mormng and every night : not binding my- 
B^f to the number of chapters, but as long as my 
thoughts should engage me. It was not long after 
I set seriously to this work, that I found my heart 
more deeply and sincerely affected with the wicked- 
ness of my past life. The impression of my dream 
revived; and the words, All these things have not 
brought thee to repentance, ran seriously in my 
thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to give 
me repentance, when it happened providentially, 
the very same day, that, reading the scripture, 1 
came to these words, " He is exalted a Prince and a

Saviour ; to give repentance, and to give remission.'^ 
I throw down tlie book ; and wjth my heart as wel^ 
asmy hands Jifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy 
of joy, I cried out aloud, Jesus, thou son of David ! 
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour! ^ve me re- 
pentance ! This was the first time in ail my life I 
could say, in the true sense of the words, that I 
prayed ; for now I prayed with a sense of my condi- 
tion, and with a true scripture view of hope, found- 
ed on the encouragement of the word of God : and 
fironi this time, I may say, I began to have hope 
that God would hear me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned 
above, ** Call on me, and I will deliver thee,*' in a dif- 
ferent sense from what I had ever done before ; for 
then I had no notion of any thing being called deli' 
verancey but my being delivered from the captivity 
I was in : for though I was indeed at large in the 
place, yet the island was certainly a prison to me, 
and that in the worst sense in the world. But now 
I learned to take it in another sense : now I looked 
back upon my past life with such horror, and my 
sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought no- 
thing of God but deliverance from the load of guilt 
that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary 
life, it was nothing ; I did not so much as pray to 
be delivered from it, or think of it; it was all of no 
consideration, in comparison with this. And I.add 
this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that 
whenever they come to a true sense of things, they 
will find deliverance from sin a much greater bless- 
ing than deliverance from affliction. But, leaving 
this part, I return to my Journal. 

My condition began now to be, though not less 
miserable as to my way of living, yet mudi easier to 
my mind : and my thoughts being directed, by con- 
stantly reading the scripture and praying to God, to

things of a higher nature, I had a creat deal of com^ 
fort within, which, till now, I knew nothing of; 
also, as my health and stren^ returned, I bestiiv 
red me to furnish myself with every thing that I 
wanted, and make my way of living as regular as I 
could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly 
employed in walking. about with my gun in my 
hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that 
was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness: 
for at is hardly to be imagined, how low I was, and 
ito what weakness I was reduced. The implication 
which I made use of was perfectly new, and per- 
haps what had never cured an ague before ; neither 
can I recommend it to any one to practise, by this 
experiment : and though it did carry off the fit, yet 
it rather contributed to weakening me ; for I had 
frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for 
some time : I learned from it also this, in particu- 
.lar; that being abroad in the rainy season was the 
most pernicious thing to my health that could be, 
especially in those rains which came attended with 
storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which 
came in the dry season was almost always accom- 
panied with such storms, so I found that this rain 
was much more dangerous than the rain which fell 
in September and October. 

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten 
months ; all possibility of deliverance firom this con- 
dition seemed to be entirely taken from me ; and I 
firmly believed .that no human shape had ever set 
foot upon that place. Having secured my habita- 
tion, as 1 thought, fully to my mind, I had a ereat 
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the 
island, and to see what other productions I might 
find, which i vet knew nothing of. 

It was on the 15th of July, that I began to take

up die creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my 
rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two 
miles up, that the trde did not flow any higher ; and 
that it was no more than a little brook of ranning 
Mrater, very fresh and eood : but this being the dry 
season, there was hnrSy any water in some parts of 
It ; at least, not any stream. Oh the tanks of this 
brook I found many pleasant savannahs or meadows, 
{^ain, smootii, ana covered with grass : and on the 
rising parts of them, next to itte hi^er grounds 
(where die water, as ft might be supposed, never 
overflowed), 1 found a«great ded of tobacco, green, 
and growing to a veiy great and strong sudk : and 
there were obivers other plants, which 1 iMdno know- 
ledge of, or trnderstaxiding about, and that might, 
{lerhflps, have virtues of tlieir own, which I could 
not find out. I searched for the cassava root, whidi

wh^ course I might take to know the virtue and 
^oodneis of any or the fruits or plants which 1 dioidd 
discover ; but could bring it to no contusion ; for, 
in short, I had made so litde dbservation while I 
was in the Brazils, that I knew little ot* the plmits 
in the field ; at least, very litde that might serve me 
to any purpose n6^ in my distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up die same '«% 
again ; and after going somethmg fiudier than 1

th^ trees: tb^ vines, indeed, bad spread over tbe 
tr^es, and the; clusters of grapes were now just in 
their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising 
discovery, and ( w^ exceedingly glad of them, but 
I was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of 
them ; remeinbering that when I was ashore in Bar- 
bary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Eng- 
lishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them 
into fluxes and fevers. I found, however, an excel* 
lent iise for these grapes ; and that was, to cure or 
dry thein in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes 
or raisins are kept ; which I thought would be (as 
indeed ^y were) as wholesome and as agreeable to 
eat, when no grapes were to be had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back 
to fny habitation ; ^hich, by the way, was the first 
night, as I might say, I had lain from home. At 
liighty I took my first contrivance, and got up into 
9 ti^y where I slept well ; and the next morning 
proceeded on n^y discovery, travelling near four 
]pile§, 9s I might judge by the length of the valley $ 
)i§qiif)g ftill due nprui, with a ridge of hills on the 
south and north sides of me. At the end of diis 
march I came to an opening, where the country 
seemed to descend to tne west; and a little spring 
of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the 
hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due east ; and 
the countiy ai>peared so fresh, so green, so flourish* 
ing, every thing bemg.in i^ constant verdure, or 
flourish of spring, that it looked lOce a planted gar- 
den* I descended a liMie on the side of that deli-

might have it in inheritance as completely as any 
lord of a manor in England. I saw here abundance 
bf cocoa trees, and orange, lemon, and citron trees, 
but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit ; at least 
not then. However, the green limes that 1 gathered 
were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; 
and I mixed theu* juice afterwards with water, which 
made it very wholesome, and very cool and refresh- 
ing. I found now I had business enough, to gather 
and carry home ; and I resolved to lay up a store, 
as well of grapes as limes and lemons to fumisb 
myself for the wet season, which I knew was ap-^ 
proaching. In order to this, I gathered a great 
heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another 
place ; and a great parcel of limes and melons iir 
another place ; and, taking a few of each with me, 
J travelled homeward ; and resolved to come again,* 
and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to 
carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent 
three days in this journey, I came home (so I must 
now call my tent and my cave) : but before I got 
thither, the ^apes were spoiled ; the richness of the 
fruits, and the weight of die juice, having broken 
and bruised them, they were good for litUe or no- 
thing : as to the limes, they were good, but I could 
bring only a few. 

The next day being the 19th, 1 went back, hav- 
ing made me two smsJl bags to bring home my har- 
vest; but I was surprised, when, coming to my 
heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when F 
gathered them, I found them all spread about, trod 
to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some 
there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By •' 
this I concluded there were some wild creatures I 
thereabouts which* had done this, but what they | 
were I knew not. However, as I found there was 
no laying them up in heaps, and no carrying them

destroyed, and the other way they would be crush- 
ed with their own weight; 1 took another course: 
J then gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and 
bung them upon the out-branphes of the trees, tha|: 
dit^y might cure and dry in the sun ; and as for the 
limes and lemons, I carried as many b4|ck as I CQuld 
well stand under. 

When I came home from this jourpey, I contem- 
plated with great pleasure tb(^ fruitfulness of th,at 
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation ; the 
security from storms on that side ; the yrater and 
the wood : and concluded that 1 had pitched upon a 
place to fix my abode in, whij^h was by far the worst 
part of the country. Upon thf& whole, I began to 
consider of removing my habitation, lu^d to Ipok put 
for a place eaually 9^ &s where I was now situate ; if 
ppQsible, in tn^t pleasant fruitful part (^ the i8lan4- 
This thought ran long in my he^d ; and I was ex-

to remove. However, I was so enamoured of thia 
place, that I spent much <^ my time there .for the

of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a 
strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as I 
could reach, well staked, and filled between with 
brush-wood. Here I lay very secure, sometime» 
two or three nights togeUier ; always going over it 
widi a ladder, as before : so that I micied now I 
had my countrv and my sea-coast house* This work 
took me up till the beginning of August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, and began 
to enjoy my labour, when the rains came on, and 
made me stick dose to my first habitation: for 
though 1 had made a tent like the other, with a 
piece of sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not 
the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a 
cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were 
extraordinary* 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I hAd 
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 
3d of August, I found the grapes 1 had hung up 
were perfectly dried, and indeed wereexcellent good 
raisins of the sun : so I began to take them aewn 
from the trees ; and it was very happy thait I did soy 
as the rains which followed would have spmied them, 
and I should have lost the best part oi my winter 
food ; for I had above two hundred large bunches of 
them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and 
carried most of them home to my cave, but it began 
to rain : and from hence, which was the 14th of 
August, it rained, more or less, every day till the 
middle of October ; and sometimes so violently, that 
I could not stir out of my cave for several days. 

In this season, I was much surprised with the in- 
crease of my family. I had been concerned for the 
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or, 
as I thoii^t, had been dead ; and I heard no more 
of her, till, to my astonishment, ' she came home 
with three kittens. This was the more stirange to

tne, because, about the end of August, though I 
had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, 
yet I thought it was quite a different kind from our 
European' cats: yet the young cats were the same 
kind of house-breed as the old one ; and both of my 
cats being females, I thought it very strange. But 
irom these three, I afterwards came to be so pes- 
tered with cats, that I was forced to kill them like 
vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my 
house as much as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant 
rain ; so that I could not stir, and was now very 
careful not to be much wet. In this confinement, 
1 began to be straitened for food ; but venturing 
out twice, I one day killed a goat, and the last day, 
which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, 
which was a treat to me. My food was now regu- 
lated thus : I ate a bunch of raisins for my break- 
fast; a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, 
broiled, for my dinner (for, to my great misfortune, 
I had no vessel to boil or stew any thing) ; and two 
or three of the turtle's eggs for my supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, 
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my 
cave : and by aegrees worked it on towards one side, 
till I came to the outside of the hill; and made a 
door, or way out, which came beyond my fence or 
wall : and so I came in and out this way* But I 
was not perfectly easy at lying so open: for as I 
had managed myself before, 1 was in a perfect en- 
closure; whereas now, I thought I lay exposed; 
and yet I could not perceive that there was any 
living thing to fear, the biggest creature that 1 had 
yet seen upon the bland being a goat. 

September SO. I was now come to the unhappy 
anniversary of my landing. I cast up the notches on 
my post, and found I had been on shore three hms-

dred and sixty-five days. I kc^t this dajr as a soleinti 
tut; netting it apart cor reti^ious execcise, prostrate- 
ing mvself on the ^ound with the most serious ha- 
mSiation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledg- 
ing his righteous judgement upon me, and praying 
to him to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ ; 
and having not tasted the least refreshment for 
twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, 
I then ate a biscuit and a bunch of grapes, and went 
to bed, finishing the day as I began it. I had all 
this time observed no sabbath-day ; for as at first 1 
had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after 
some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks, by 
making a longer notch than ordinary for the sab- 
bathHUiy, and so did not really know what any of 
the days were r but now having cast up the di^s, as 
above, I found I had been there a year ; so I divided 
it into weeks, and set apart every sevendi day for a 
sabbath. : though I found, at the end of my account, 
Iihad lost a day or two in my reckonins. A little 
alter this, my ink beginning to fiul me, I contented 
myself to use it more sparingly ; and to write down 
omy the most remarkable events of my life, inthout 
continuing a daily memorandum of odiier things. 

The nuny season and the dry season began now 
to appear regular to me> and I learned to divide 
Ihem so as to provide for them accordingly; but.! 
bought all my experience before I had it; and what 
I am going to relate was one of the most discourag- 
ing fixperun^nts that I had made |tt all. 

I have mentbned that I had saved the few eacs of 
Parley, and rice, which I had so surprisingly found 
mprung up, as 1 thoi^t, of Sbemsidlves. I b^ve 
tnere were about thSty stalks of rice, and about 
twenty of barley ; and now I thought it a proj>er 
time to sow it aner the tains ; the sun beinff in its 
southern poeitiony going finun me. Accordingly I

dug a piece of ground, as well as I could, with iny 
wooden spade; and dividing it into two parts> I 
sowed my grain ; but, as I was sowing, it casually 
occured to my thoughts that I would not sow it all 
at first, because I did not know when was the pro- 
per time for it; so I sowed about two* thirds of the 
seed., leaving about a handful of each : and it was a 
great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for 
not one grain of what I sowed this tiipe came to any 
thing; for the dry month following, and the earth 
having thus had no rain after the seed was sown, it 
had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came 
up at all till the wet season had come again, and 
then it grew as if it had been but newly sown. Find- 
ing my first seed did not erow, which I easily ima- 
gined was from the drought, I sought for a moister 
piece of groimd to make another trial in ; and I 
dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and 
sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little be- 
fore the vernal equinox. This having the rainy 
month of March and April to water it, sprung up 
very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; bat 
havine only part of the seed left, and not daring to 
sow fdl that I had, I got but a small quantity at 
last, my whole crop not amounting to above haJf a 
peck of each kind. But by this experiment I was 
made master of my business, and knew exactly when 
was the proper time to sow ; and that I might ex- 
pect two seed-times, and two harvests, every year. 
While this com was growing, I made a little dis- 
covery, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon 
as the rains were over, and the weather began to 
settle, which was about the month of November, I 
made a visit up the country to my bower ; where, 
though I had not been some months, yet I found all 
things just as I left them. The circle or double 
hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire,

made a circle of about tweuty-five y^rds indiameter, 
yet the trees, for such I might now call themt soon 
covered it, ,and it was a complete shade, sufficient 
to lodge under all the dry season. This made me 
resolve to cut some more stakea, and maJce me a 
hedge like this, in a semicircle round vaj wall (I

I had found, bj experieBce> the iH consequences of 
benug abroad m the rain, I took care to furnish my- 
self with provisions beforehand, that I might not be 
obliged to go out : and I sat within doors as much as 
possible diking the wet months. This time 1 found 
much employment, and veiy suitable also to the 
ixtne ; for I round great occasion for many things 
which I had no way to furnish myself with but by 
hard labour and constant application : particularly, 
I tried many ways to make myself a basket : but all 
the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brit* 
tie, that they woiud do notfamg. k proved Of ex- 
cellent advanti^ to me now, that when I was a boy, 
I used to take great delight in stuading at a basket- 
makei^s in the town where my father lived, to see 
them make their wicker-ware ; and being, as boys 
uBiially ate, veiy officious to help, and a great ob« 
server of the manner how th^ worked those things, 
and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means 
full knowledge of the methods of it, so that I wanted 
n0tiikig but the materials ; when it came into my 
mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I 
cut my stakes that gtew might possibly be as tough 
as the sallows, willows, and osiers, in England ; and 
I resolved to tiy. Accordingly, the next day, I 
went to my c6antry-*hoase, as 1 called it; and cut- 
ting some of the smaller twigs, I found diem to my 
purpose as modi as I could desire : whereupon I 
catne the neatt time prepared with a hatchet to cut 
down a quaoti^, whidi I soon found, for there was 
^veiat pi^ty of them. " These I set up to dry within 
ttijr circle or hedge ; and when they were fit for us^ 
1 csarmd them to my cave : and here, durmg the 
next season, I employed myself in making, as wdl 
as I could, several baskets ; both to carry earth, or 
to carry or lay up any thing as I had occasien for. 
Though 1 did not finiui them very handsomely, y0t

I made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose : 
and thus, afterwards, 1 took care never to be witli- 
out them ; and as my wicker- ware decayed, I made 
more ; especially strong deep baskets, to place my 
corn in, instead of sacks, when 1 should come to 
have any quantity of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a 
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if 
possible, how to supply two other wants. I |iad no 
vessel to hold any thmg that was liquid, except two 
runlets, which were almost full of rum; and some 
glass bottles, some of the common size, and others 
(which were case-bottles) square, for the holding of 
waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to 
boil any thing : except a great kettle, which I saved 
put of the sh|p, and which was too big for such use 
as I desired it, viz/ to make broth, and stew a bit of 
meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have 
had, was a tobacco-pipe; but it was impossible for 
xne to make one ; however, I found a contrivance 
for that too at last. I employed myself in planting 
my second row of stakes or piles, and also in this 
wicker-working, all the summer or dry season; 
when another business took me up more time than 
it could be imagined I could spare. 

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to 
see the whole island ; and that I had travelled up 
the brook, and so on to where 1 had built my bower, 
and where 1 had an opening quite to the sea, on the 
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel 
quite across to the sea-shore, on that side : so tak- 
ing my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger 
quantity of powder and shot than usual ; with two 
biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my 
pouch, for my store ; I began my joumev. When I 
had passed the vale where my bower stooa, as abpve, 
I came within view of the sea, to the west ; and it

being a very clear day, I fairly descried land, whe- 
ther an island or continent I could not tell ; but it lay 
very high, extending from W. to W.S. W. at a very 
great distance ; by my guess it could not be less 
than fifteen or twenty leagues off! 

I could not tell what part of the world this might 
be ; otherwise than that I knew it must be part of 
America; and, as I concluded, bj all my observations, 
most be near the Spanish dommions ; and perhaps 
was all inhabited by savages, where, if I should have 
landed I had been in a worse condition than I was 
now. I therefore acquiesced in the dispositions of 
Providence, which I began now to own and to be- 
lieve ordered every thing for the best ; 1 say, I 
quieted my mind with this, and left off afflicting 
myself with fruitless wished of being there. 

Besides, after some pause upon Uds a£yr, I con- 
sidered that if this land was the Spanish coast, I 
diould certainly, one time or other, see some vessel 
pass or repass one way or other ; but if not, then it 
was the savage coast between the Spanish country 
and the Brazils, whose inhabitants are indeed the 
worst of savages; for they are cannibals, or men- 
eaters, and fafl not to murder and devour all human 
beings that fall into their hands. 

With these. considerations, walking very leisurely 
forward, I found this side of the island, where I now 
was, much pleasanter than mine ; the open or savan- 
nah fields sweetly adorned with flowers and grass, 
and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of 
parrots; and fain would have caught one, if possible, 
to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to 
me. 1 did, after taking some pains, catch a young 
parrot; for 1 knocked it down with a stick, and, 
naving recovered it, I brought it home : but it was 
some years before I could mt3ce him speak ; however,

lie a trifle, will be very diverting in its place. 

I was exceedingly aiaused with this journey. I 
found in the low grounds hares, as I thought them to 
be, and foxes ; but they differed greatly from all the 
ot^r kinds I had met with ; nor could I satisfy my- 
aelf to eat them, though I killed several. But I had 
no need to be venturous: for I had no want of food, 
andof that which was ven^good too ; especially these 
three sorts, viz. goats^ pigeons, and turtle, or tor- 
toise. With these, added to my grapes, Leadenhall 
aaarket could not have furnished a table better than 
I, in proportion to the company ; and though my 
case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause lor 
thankfulness; as I was not driven to any extremities 
for food, but had rather j^enty, even to dainties* 
. I never travelled on this journey above two miles 
outright in a day, or thereabout ; but I took so nxBf- 
ny turns and retinrns, to see what discoveries I could 
make, that I came weary enough to the place where 
I resolved to eh down for the night; and then I 
either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself 
with a row of stakes, set upright in the ground* 
either from one tree to another, or so as no wild 
creature could come at me without wakii^ me* 

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised 
to see that J had taken up tny lot on the worst aido 
of the island : for here* indeed the shore was covered 
with iniMmerable turtles i whereas, on the other 
side, I had found but three in a year and a hulfl 
Heve was aJso an infinite nundier of fowls of onnv 
kinds; some of which I had seen, and some of which 
I had not seen before, and manv of them very good 
meat ; but such as Ikiiew not the names of, ex€e|»t 
those called Pengums.

. had more mind to kill a sbe-goat, if I could, which I 
could better feed on. But UM>ugh there were man^ 
goats here, more than on my side the island, yet it 
was with much more difficulty that I could come near 
them; the country being flat and even, and they 
saw me much sooner than when 1 was upon a hill. 

I confess this side of the country was much plea- 
santer than mine; yet I had not the least inclination 
to remove ; for as I was fixed in my habitation, it 
became natural to me, and I seemed all the while 
I was here to be as it were upon a journey, and from 
home. However, I travelled almig the sea-shore to«< 
wards the east, I suppose about twelve miles; and 
then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a 
mark, I concluded I would go home again; and that 
the next journey I took should be on the other side 
of the island, east from my dwellung, and so round 
till I came to my post again: of which in its place. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, 
thinking I could eautw keep so much of the island ia 
my view, diat I could not miss my first dwelling by 
viewing the ooantry ; but 1 found mysetf mistaken; 
for betttg come about two or three miles, I {bund 
nqrself descended into a very large valley, but so sur- 
roimded with hills, and those hills covered with 
wood, that I could not see which was my way by any 
direction but that of the sun, nc^ even then, unless 
I knew very well the position of the sun at that time 
of die day. And it h^pened to my farther mislbr* 
tune, <diat llie weather proved hazy £br three or four 
iays while 1 was in this valley ; and not betng able 
to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfort- 
able, and at last was obliged to find out the sea-side*

went; and then by easy journeys i turned homeward^

In this journey^ my dog surprised a yoUng kid,' 
and seized upon it; and running to take hold of it,* 
I caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I had 
a great mind to bring it home if I could; for I had 
onen been musing whether it might not be possible^ 
to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame 
goats, which might supply me when my powder and 
shot should be all spent. I made a collar for this lit- 
tie creature, and with a string which I had madd 
of some rope yam, which I always carried about me^ 
I led him along, though with some difficulty, till I 
came to my bower, and there I enclosed him and left 
him; for I was very impatient to be at home, from 
whence I had been absent above a month. 

J[ cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me 
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my ham- 
mock-bed. This little wandering journey, without 
a settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to 
me, that my own house, as I called it to mjrself, 
was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that i 
and it rendered every thing about me so comfortable^ 
that I resolved I would never go a great way from it 
^gain, while it should be my lot to stay on the island; 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regaled 
mvself after my long journey : during which, mosi 
of the time was taken up in die weighty affisur of mak- 
ing a cage for my Poll, who began now to be more 
domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me; 
Then I began to think of the poor kid which I had 
penned vHthin my little circle, and resolved to fetch it 
tiome, or give it some food: accordingly I went, and 
found it where I left it (for indeed it could not get 
out), but was almost starved for want of food. I 
went and cut bouehs of trees, and branches of such 
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and havmg 
fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it awav ; but 
it was 80 tame with being hungry, that I had o^

tteed to htsfe tied it, for U followed me like a dog : 
mA vm It^oBtMMAaMy fed it, the creature became so 
lo¥iBg, fio gentle, and ^o fond, that it was from that 
4iime«fie «f mjcLometflics also, and would never 
leave me afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was 
now oomq, and I kept ^ 90th of September in the 
eame solenm manner as %eibre, being the annivser- 
aary'of my landing on tlie island; having now 
l>een there two years, and no more prospect of be<- 
«g deltvefed than ibe tinat day I came there. I 
apentthe whole day in^humbleand thankful acknow- 
ledgments ibr the many wonderful mercies which 
my solitary condition was attended with, and with- 
out which it might 'have been in^itely more miser* 
«ble. I gave humble and hearty thanks to God lor 
having been pleased to discover to me, tiuit it was 
-possible I might 'be more happy oven in ihis solitary 
condition, than I^ouklbave been in the enjoyment 
of society, and in «^ the pleasures of the world: that 
he could Adly make up to me the deficiencies of my 
oolHary state, and the want of human society, by his 
presence, and die communications of his grace to 
my soul ; supportmg, cohiforting, and encouraging 
me to depend upon his providence here, and to 
hope for his oteiiial presence hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much 
more happy ihe life I now led was, with all its miser- 
able circumstances, than the wicked, cursed, abo- 
minable life I led all the past part of my days: and 
now I changed both my sorrows and my joys : my very 
desires ak^ed, my affecticms cAianged tWrgusts, end 
my delights were perfectly new from what uiey were 
at my tot coming, or indeed for the two }'«ar8 past. 

'Before, as I wdked about, either on my hunting, 
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul 
at my condition would break out upon me ona^ sad-

den, and my very heart would die within md, to 
think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I wai^ 
in ; and how I was a prisoner, locked up with th^ 
eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited 
wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of th^ 
greatest composures of my mind, this would . break 
out upon me like a storm, knd^make me wring my 
hands, and weep like a child: sometimes it w<»uld 
take me in the middle of my work, and I would 
immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the 
ground for an hour or two together^ this was still 
worse to me ; but if I could burst into tears, or give 
vent to my feelings by words, it would go oiF; and 
my grief being exhausted, would abate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with new 
thoughts; I daily read the word of God, and applied 
all the comforts of it to my present state. One 
morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon 
these words, <* I will never leave thee, nor for- 
sake thee:" immediately it occurred diat these 
words were to me ; why else should they be direct- 
ed in such a manner, just at the moment when I 
was mourning over my condition,' as one forsaken 
of God and man ? Well then, said I, if God does 
not forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, 
or what matters it, though the wond should forsake 
me; seeing on the other nand, if I had all the world, 
and should lose the favour and blessing of God, 
there would be no comparison in the loss? 

From this moment I began to conclude in my 
mind, that it was possible tor me to be more happy 
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was pro- 
bable I should ever have been in any other particular 
state in the world; and with this thought I was 
going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this 
place. I know not what it was, but something 
shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not

spei^ thd Mortis. How cwast thoii be such ah3rpo- 
crite, said I, even audibly, to pretend to be 
thankful for a condition, which, however thou 
mayest endeavour to be contented with, thou would- 
est rather pray heartily to be delivered ftom ? Here 
I stopped : but though I could not say I thanked 
God for beinff here, yet I sincerely gave thanks to 
God for openmg my eyes, by whatever afflicting pro- 
vidences, to see the former condition of my life, and 
to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never 
opened the Bible, or shut it, but my very soul within 
me blessed God for directing my mend in England, 
without any order of mine, to pack it up among my 
goods ; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out 
of the wreck of the ship. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my 
third year; and though I have not given the reader 
the trouble of so paiticular an account of my works 
this year as the first, yet in general it may be ob- 
served, that I was very seldom idle ; but having re- 
gularly divided my time, according to the several 
daily employments that were before me ; such as, 
first. My duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, 
which I constantly set apart some time for, thrice 
every day : secondly, Gomg abroad with my gun for 
food, which generally took me up three hours every 
morning, when it did not rain : thirdly. Ordering, 
curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed 
or catched for my supply : these took up ereat part 
of the day ; also it is to be considered, that in the 
middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, 
the violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so 
that about four hours in the evening was all the time 
I could be supposed to work in; with this exception, 
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and 
working, and went to work in the morning, and 
abroad with my gun in the afteraooo.

128 ADVEKTiniES OV 

To this short time allowed for labour, I destpe may 
be added the exceeding laborioasness of my w&tk ; 
the many hours wfaiph, for want of tools, want of 
hdp, and want of skill, every thing I did took up 
out of my time : for example, I was full two aiid 
forty days making me a board for a long dhelf, which 
I wanted in my cave ; whereas, two Bawyers, with 
their tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them 
out of Ihevame tree m half a day. 

My case was this; it was a large tree whic4i was to 
be cut down, because my board was to be a broad 
one. This tree I was three days cutting down, and 
two more in cutting off the boughs, and reducing 
it to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible 
hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it 
into chips, till it was light enough to move ; then I 
turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat 
as a board, firom end to end ; then turning that side 
downward, cut the other side, till I brought the 
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on 
both aides. Any one may judge the labour of my^ 
hands in such a piece of work; but labour and pa* 
tience carried me through that, and many otner 
things : I only observe this in particular, to show the 
reason why so much of my time went away with so 
little work, vie. that what might be a little to be 
done with help and tools, was a vast labour, and re-

Notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I 
went through many things; and, indeed, every 
thing that my circumstances made necessary forme 
to do, as will appear by what follows. 

I was now in the months of November and Decem- 
ber, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The 
ground I had manured or dog up for them was not 
great ; for, as I observed, my sc^ of each was not 
above the quantity of hatf^a peck* having lost one

whole crop by sowing in the dry season : but now my 
crop promised very well ; when, on a sadden, I found 
I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of 
several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep 
from it ; as, first, the goats, and wild creatures whicn 
I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the 
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up^ 
and ate it so close, that it could get no time to shodt 
up into stalk. 

I saw no remedy for this, but by making an enclo- 
sure about it with a hedge, which I did with a great 
deal of toil ; and the more, because it required speed. 
However, as m^ arable land was but small, suited to 
my crop, I got it tolerably well fenced in about three 
weeks time ; and shooting some of the creatures iii 
the day-time, I set my dog to guard it in the night, 
tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would 
stand and bark all night long ; so in a little time the 
enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew very 
strong and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my 
corn was in the blade^ so the birds were as likely to 
ruin me now, when it was in the ear : for going 
along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my 
little crop surrounded with fowls, I know not of 
how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching 
till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among 
them (for I always had my gun with me); I had no 
«ooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, 
which I had not seen at all, from among the corn 
itself. 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in k 
few days they would devour all my hopes ; that I 
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop 
at all; and what to do I could not tell: however, 
I resolved not to lose my com, if possible, though 
I should watch it night and day. In the first place^

I went among it, to see what damage was already 
done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of it ; 
but that as it was yet too green for them, the loss 
was not BO great, but that the remainder was likely 
to be a good crop, if it could be saved. 

I fttaid by it to load my gun, and then coming 
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon aU 
the trees about m^, as if they only waited till I was 

f»ne away ; and the event proved it to be so ; for as 
walked off^ as if gone; I was no sooner out of 
their sight, than they dropt dpwn, one by one, into 
the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could 
not have patience to stay till more came on, know- 
ing that every grain they eat now was, as it might 
be said, a peck-loaf to me in the consequence ; so 
coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed 
three of them. This was what I wished for ; so I 
took them up, and served them as we serve notori-^ 
ous thieves in England, viz. hanged them in chains, 
for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine 
that thiB should have such an effect as it had ; for 
the fowls not only never came to the corn* but, in 
abort, they forsook all that part of the island, and I 
could never see a bird near the place as long as my 
scareK^rows hung there. This I was very glad of, 
you may be sure ; and about the latter end of De- 
cember, which waa our second harvest of the year, 
I reaped my com. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it 
down : and idl I could do was to make one as well 
as I could, out of one of the broad swords, or cut- 
lasses, which I saved among the arms out of the 
ship. However, as my fifst crop was but small, I 
had no freat difficulty to cut it down : in short, I 
neafted it my way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, 
And carried it away an a great badcet whidi I had 
madei, and so rubbed it out with my hands ; and at

the end of all my harveBting, I found that out of my 
balf peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice) and 
above tvro bushels and a half of barley ; that is to 
say, by my guess, for I had no measure. 

However, this was great encouragement to me ; 
and I foresaw that, in time, it would please God to 
supply me with bread; and yet here I was perplexjed 
again ; for I neither knew how to grind, or make 
meal 4>f my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part 
it; nor if made into meal, how to make bread of it ; 
and if how to make it, yet 1 knew not how to bake . 
it: these thiols being added to my desire of having 
a good quantity for store, and to secure a consttt|fe( 
aupply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but 
to preserve it all fer seed against the next seasoo i 
and, in the mean time, to employ all my study and 
hours of working to accomplish this great work <^ 
providii^ myself with com and bread. 

It might be truly said, that now I w(»ked for my 
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I beUevet 
&w people have thought much upon,vijs. the strange 
multitude of little things necessary in the providing,

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, 
found this to mv daily discouragement, and waa 
made nunre sensible of it every hour, ev^i after I 
had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I 
have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a 
guiprise. 

Tirst, I had no plougK to turn up the earthy 
no spacb'or shovel to dig it : well, this I conqueved* 
by makmg a wooden spade, as 1 observed before ; 
but this did my work in but a wooden manner.;-

foraied it much worse. However, this I bore with» 
and was content to work it out with patience, 
and bear with the badness of the performance. 
When the corn was sown, I had no harrow, but 
was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great 
heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it 
may be called, rather than rake or harrow it. 
When it was growing and grown, I have observed 
already how many things I wanted to fence it, se- 
cure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, 
thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it : then 
I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, 
▼east and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to 
bake it ; and yet all these things I did without, as 
shall be observed ; and the com was an inestimable 
corafbrt and advantage to me : all this, as I said, 
made every thing laborious and tedious to me, but 
that there was no help for ; neither was my time 
so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, 
a certain part of it was every day appointed to these 
works ; and as I resolved to use none of the com for 
bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had 
the next six months to apply myself wholly, by 
labour and invention, to furnish myself with uten- 
sils proper for the performing all the operations 
necessary for making corn fit for my use. 

But now I was to prepare more land ; for I 
had seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. 
Before I, did this, I had a week's work at least to 
make me a spade ; which, when it was done, was 
but a son^ one indeed, and very heavy, and re- 

?uired double labour to work witfi it : however, 
went through that, and sowed my seed in two 
large flat pieces of ground, as near my house as 
I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in 
with a good hedee ; the stakes of which were all cut 
off that wood which I had set before, and knew it

would grow ; so that, in one yearns time, I knew I 
should have a (juick or living hedge, that would want 
but little repair. This work took nie up full three 
months ; because a great part of the time was in the 
wet season, when I could not go abroad. Within 
doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go 
out, I found employment on the following occasions ; 
always observing, that while I was at work, I divert- 
ed myself with talking to my parrot, and teaching 
him to speak ; and I quickly learned him to know 
his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud. 
Poll ; which was the first word I ever heard spoken 
in the island by any mouth but my own. This, 
tiierefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my 
work ; for now, as I said, I had a sreat employment 
upon my handis, as follows: I had long studied^ by 
some means or other, to make myself some eardien 
vessels, which indeed I wanted much, but knew not 
where to come at them : however, considering the 
heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could 
find out any clay, I might botch up some such pot as 
might, being dried in the sun, be hard and strong 
enough to bear handling, and to hold any thin^ that 
was cury, and required to be kept so ; and as this was 
necessary in the preparing com, meal, &c. which was 
the thing I was upon, I resolved to make some as 
large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to 
hold what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh 
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise 
this pastil ; what odd, misshapen, ughr things I made ; 
how many of them fell in, aind how many fell 
out, the day not being stiff enough to bear its own 
weight ; how many cracked by the over violent heat 
of the sun, being set out too hastily ; and how many 
fell in pieces with only removing, as well before as 
after they were dried: and, in a word^hpWi after hav-

ing li^ured h$rd.to find the clay^ to dig k» to ten* 
per it, to bring it home, and work it, I could next 
make above two large eaorthen ugly things (I cannot 
call them jars) in about two months' kilK>ur. 

However, ag tbd sun baked these two very dry and 
hard, I lifted tli^n^very gently up, and set them down 
again in two great wicker baskets, which I had made 
on purpose for them, that they might not break ; 
and as betw^n the pot and the bae£et there was a 
little room to apace, I stuffed it full of the rice and 
barley*$traw ; and tfaese two pots being to stand al- 
ways dry, I thought would h<tld my dry com, and 
pf^haps the meal, wjben the com was bnused. 

Tbough I miscarried so much in my design for 
larg« pots, y€it I made several smaller things wink 
better success : such as little round pots, £at dishey^ 
pitdiers, and pipkins, and any thine my hand turned 
to ; and the heat of the sua baked tnem very hard. 

But all this would not answar m^ end, which was 
to get an earthea pot to hold liquids^ and bear the 
fire, which none of these could do. It happened 
some time after, making a pretty large fire for cook* 
ing my meat, i^ben I went to put it out after I had 
done with it, I found a bcoken piece of one of my 
earthen-ware vessels in the fire^ burnt as hard as a 
stone, and red as a tile. I wasagfeeably £^irprised 
to see it ; and said to myself, that certainly thery 
might be made to hum whole, if they would buim 
broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire, bo as 
to make it bum some pots. I had no notion of a 
kiln, sudb as the potters bum in, or of glaziiig theis 
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with ; 
but I placed three large pipkiAs and two or three 
pots in a pile, one upon another, and placed my fire- 
wood all .round it, with a gieat lieap of embers un-

let t^em stand in that heal ahewt five or m% beun, 
tiU I found one of them^ though it did not craek, 
did melt or run ; for the sand which was mixed with 
the clay melted by the vioienoe of the heat, and 
would have run into glass, if I had gone on ; so I 
slacked my fire gradually, till tlie potsbeganto abaite 
ef the red colour ; and watching them all night, 
that I might not \ei the fire abate too fast, in the 
moraisig I had three very ^od, I will not say hand- 
fiome, pipkins, and two o&et* earthen pots, as hard 
burnt as could be desired ; hnd one of them perlecV* 
ly glazed with the ruaninff of the sand. 

Aller this experiment, I need not say that I want- 
ed nb sort of earthen-ware for my use ; but I mu^t 
needs say, as to die shapes of them, they were very 
indifferent, as atiy one may suppose, as I had no way 
of making tliem but as the children make dirt pies» 
or as a womim woakl make pies that never learned 
to raise paste. 

No joy at a thing *of so mean a naiture was ever 
equal to mine, when I fouild I had made an earthen 
pbt that would bear the fire ; and i had hardly pa- 
lieDee to stay till they were told, before I set one on 
the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me 
some meat, which it did admirably well ; and with 
a piece of a kid I made some very good broth ; 
though I wanted oatmeal, add several other ingre- 
dients requisite tb make it so good as I would faavB 
had it been.

I was as perfectly unqualified for a stonecutter as 
for an^ whatever; neither had I any tools to go 
about It with. I spent many a day to find out a 
^eat stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit 
S>r a mortar ; but could find none at all, except 
what was in Uie solid rock, and which I had no way 
to dig or cut out : nor, indeed, were the rocks, in the 
island of sufficient hardness, as they were all of a 
sandy crumbling stone, which would neither bear 
the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the 
corn without filling it with sand : so, after a great 
deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it 
over, and resolved to look out a great block of hard 
wood, which I found indeed mudi easier ; and get^ 
ting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded 
it, and formed it on the outside with my axe and 
hatchet; and then, with the help of fire, and infi* 
nite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indi-^ 
ans in Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made 
a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called 
iron-wood ; and this I prepared and laid by against 
I had my next crop of com, when I propoened to 
myself to srind, or rather pound, my corn into 
meal, to make my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, 
to dress my meal» and to part.it from the bran and 
the husk, without which 1 did not s^e it possible I 
could have any bread. This was a most difficult 
thing, even but to think on ; for I had nothing like 
the necessary thing to make it ; I mean fine thin 
canvas or stuff, to search the meal through. Here 
I was at a full stop for many months ; nor did I 
redly know what to do ; linen I had none left, but 
what was mere rags ; I had ^oats'-hair, but neither 
knew how to weave it nor spm it ; and had I known 
how, here were no toob to work it with : all the 
remedy I found for this was, at last recollecting I

oat tof the wuep^ some neekcloths of calico or muslm, 
with some pieces 6f these I madethreestnallsievety 
proper enough for tiie work; and thus I made shift 
ror some years: how I did afterwards, i shall show 
in its place. 

The bdcing fmrt was Ihe next tlaiig to be consi- 
dered, and how I should make bread when I came 
to have com : for, first, I had no yeast: as to that 
part there was no suipplying the want, so I did not 
concern myself much about it; but for an oven I 
was hideed puzzled. At length I fomd out an ex- 
pedient for that also, which was this ; I made some 
earthem vessels, very brood, but not deep, ihat is to 
say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine 
inches deep : these I burned in the fire, as I had 
done the other, and laid them by ; and when I want- 
ed to bake, I made a great tire upon my hearth, 
which I had paved with some square tiles, of my 
own making and bumii]^ also ; but I should not 
call them square. 

When the ire-wood was burned into enribers, or 
irve coals, I drew them forward open the hearth, so 
as to cover it all over, and there let them lie till the 
hearth was very hot ; then sweeping away all the 
embers, I set down my loaf, or loaives, ilnd covering 
them with the earthem pot, drew the embers all 
round the outside of the pot, to kedp in and add to 
the heat ; and thus, as well as in the best oven in 
the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became, in 
a little time, a ffood pastry-cook into the bargain ; 
for I made mpelf several cakes and puddings of the 
rice : but made no pies, as I had nothing to put in- 
to them except the flesh of fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things 
took me up most part of the third year of my abode 
here s fori it b to be obsenTed, in die intervals of

these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry 
to manage : I reaped my com m its season, and car- 
ried it home asireU as I could, and laid it up in the 
ear, in my large baskets, till 1 had time to rub it 
out; for 1 had no floor to thresh it on, or instru- 
ment to thresh it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of com increasing, I 
really wanted to build my bams bigger: I wanted a 
place to lay it up in ; for the increase of the com 
now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley 
about twenty bushels, and of rice as much, or more, 
insomuch that now I resolved to begin to use it free- 
ly : for my bread had been quite ^one a great while: 
I resolved also to see what quantity would be suffi- 
cient for me a whole year, and to sow but once 
a-year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of 
barley and ride were much more than I could con- 
sume in a year ; so I resolved to sow iust the same 
Quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes- 
lat such a quantity would fully provide me with 
bread, &c» 

All the while these things were doing, you may b6 
sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect 
of land which I had seen from the other siae in die 
island ; and I was not without some secret wishes 
that I was on shore there; fancying, that seeing the 
main land, and an inhabited country, I might find 
some way or other to convey myself farther, and 
perhaps at last find some means of escape.^ 

But all this while I made no allowance' for the 
dangers of such a condition, and that I might fail 
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I 
miffht have reason to thmk far worse than the lions 
and tigers of Africa ; that if I once came in their 
power, I should run a hazaird of more than a thou- 
sand to one oC being killed, and perhaps of being

eaten; for I had heard that the people of the Ca* 
ribbean coast were cannibals, or man-eaters; and i 
knew, by the latitude, that I could not be far off 
from that shore. Then supposing they were not 
cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as they had 
many Europeans who had fallen into their hands, 
even when they have been ten or twenty together; 
much more I, who was but one, and could make lit- 
tle or no defence ; all these things, I say, which I 
ought to have considered well of, and did cast up in 
my thoughts afterwards, took up none of myi^ppre- 
hensionsat first; yet my head ran mightily upon 
the thought of getting over to the shore;. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat 
with the shoulder*of-mutton sail, with which I sailed 
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but 
this was in vain : then I thought I would goand look 
at our ship's boat, which as I have said, was blown 
up upon Uie shore a great way, in the storm, when 
we were first cast away. She lay neariy where she 
did at first, but not quite ; havin£p turned, by the 
force of the waves and the wmds, dmost bottom uih 
ward, against a high ridge of beachy roush sana ; 
but no water about her, as before. If I had had 
hands to have refitted her, and to have launched h^ 
into the water, the boat would have done very well, 
and I might have gone back, into the Brazils with 
her easily enough ; but I might have foreseen, that 
I could no more turn her and set her upright upon 
her bottom, than I could remove the island ; how- 
ever, I went to the woods, and cut levers and roll- 
ers, and brought them to the boat, resolving to try 
what I coidddo; suggesting to myself, that if I 
eould but turn her down, and repair the damage ^ 
had received, she would be a very good boat, audi 
might venture to sea in her.

toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks dbout 
it : at last, finding it impoissible to heave her up with 
hiy little strength, I feU tt) digging away the sand, 
to undermine her, and so as to make her fall down, 
setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide her right 
in the fall. 

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir 
her up again, or to get under her, much less to move 
her forward towards the water ; so I was forced to . 
give it over : and yet, though I gave over the ho^ 
of the boat, my desire to venture over the main in- 
creased, rather than diminished, as the means for it 
seemed impossible. 

At length, I began to diink whether it was not 
possible to make myself a canoe, orperiagua, such 
as the natives of tliose climates make, even without 
tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the trunk 
of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, 
but easy, and pleased myself extremely with the idea 
of making it, and with my having much more con* 
venience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians ; 
but not at all conssdenng tile particular inconveni- 
ences which I lay under more than the Indians did, 
viz. the want of hands to move it into the water 
<when it was made, a difficulty much harder for me 
to surmount than all the consequences of want oif 
tools could be to them t for what could it avail me, 
if, after I had chosen my tree, and wiA much twm- 
ble cut it down, and might be able with my'tocda to 
hew and dub the outside into the proper simfie of a 
boat, and bum or cut out the inside to make it hol- 
low, so as to make a boat of it ; if, ailer all this, I 
must leave it jtBt where I found it, and was notable 
to launch it into the water ? 

One would imagine, if I had had the least feflec- 
tion upon my mind of my circumstances while I was 
making this boat, I shouJdhave immediately thpugbt

how I was to get it into the sea : but my thoughts 
were so intent upon my voyage in it, that I never 
once considered how I should get it o£P the land; 
and it was really, iii its own nature, more easy for 
me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than the 
forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, ta set it 
afloat in the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the most Uke a fool 
that ever man did, who had any of his senses awakew 
I pleased myself with the design, without deter*- 
mininff whether I was able to undertake it; not but 
that the difficulty of launching my boat came oftea 
into my head ; but I put a stop to my own inouiries 
into it, by this foolish answer: Let us first make it ; 
I warrant I will find some way or other to get it along 
when it is done. 

This was a most preposterous method ; but the 
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and tawork I wenU 
I felled a cedar tree, and I question much whether 
Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the 
Temple at Jerusalem ; it was five feet ten inches 
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and 
four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of 
twenty-two feet, where it lessened, and then 
parted into branches. It was not without infinite 
labour that I felled this tree ; I was twenty-days 
hacking and hewing at the bottom, and fourteen 
more getting the branches and limbs, and the 
vast spreading head of it, cut o£P: after this, it 
cost me a month to shi^e it and dub it to a propor- 
tion, and to something lijce the bottom of a boat, 
that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It 
cost me near three months more to clear the inside, 
and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it: 
this I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and 
ehisel, and by the dint of hard labour, till I had 
brought it to be. a very handsome periaguai aad big

When I had gone through this work, I was ex- 
tremely delighted with it. The boat wa« realljr 
much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagi»y 
tiiat was made of one tree, in my life. Many 
a weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure; and 
there remained nothing but to get it into the water; 
which, had I accompUdied, I make no question but I 
should have begun ^e maddest voyage, and the 
inost unlikely to be performed, that ever was un* 
dertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed 
me ; though they cbst me inexpressible labour too. 
It lay about one hundred yards from the water, and 
not more ; but the first inconvenience was, it was 
up hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this 
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of 
the earth, and so make a declivity : this I beguii, 
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains ; (but irho 
grudge pains that have their deliverance in Tiew P) 
when this was worked through, and this difficult 
managed, it was still much the same> for I could no 
more stir the canoe than I could the other boat. 
Then I measured the distance ol'gtound, and resolved 
to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up to the 
canoe, seeing I could not brii^ the canoe down to 
the water. Well, I began this wbrk ; and when I 
began to enter upon it, and calculate how deep it 
was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be 
thrown out, 1 found by the number of hands I had, 
having none but my own, that it must have been 
ten or twelve years before I could have gone through 
with it ; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper 
end it must have been at least twenty feet deep ; 
this attempt, though with great reluctancy, I was 
at length obliged to give over also.

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though 
too kte, die foUy of beginning a work before we 
count; die cost, and before we judge rightly of our 
own strength to go through with it. 

In the nuddle of this work, I finiriied my fourth 
year in d&is place, and kept my anniversary with 
the same deTodon^ and with as much comfort as be- 
fore ; for, by a eofifitant study and serious applicatioA 
to the word of God, and by the assistance ofhis grace, I 
gained a difierent knowledge from what I had before ; 
I entertained different notions of diings ; I looked 
now upgm the world as a diing remote, which I had 
nothing to do with, no expectation from, and, in- 
deed, no desires about : in a word, J had nothing 
to do with it, nor was ever likely to have ; I thought 
it lodked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, 
viz. as a place I had lived in, but w^come out of 
it ; and well might I say, as father Abraham to 
Dives, <' Between me and diee is a great gulf fixed." 

In the first place, I was here removed from all 
the wickedness c£ the world ; I had neither the lust 
of the ftesh, ,the lust of the eye, nor the pride of 
life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I 
was now capable of enjoying : I was lord of the 
whole manor ; or, if I pleased, I might call myself • 
king or emperor over the whole country which I 
had possession of; diere were no rivals ; I had no 
competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or com- 
mand with me: lipight have raised ship-loadings of 
com, but I had M use for it ; so I let as little grow 
as I thought enough for my occasion. I had tortoise 
or turtle enough, but now and then one was as 
much as I could put to any use : I had timber enough 
to have built a fieet of ships ; and I had grapes 
enough to have made wine, or to have cured into '. 
raisins, to have loaded that fleet ^en it had been 
built.

: But all I could make use of was all that was va- 
luable; I had enough to eat and supply my wants, 
dud what was the rest to me ? If I killed more flesh ^ 
than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin.; 
if I sowed more com than I could eat, it must be 
spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to rot 
on the ground ; I could make no more use of them 
than for fuel, and that I had no other occasion for 
but to dress my food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things 
dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the 
good things of this world are of no futher good to 
us than for our use ; and that whatever we may 
heap up to give others, we enjoy only as much as 
we can use, and no more« The most covetobs 
griping miser in the world would have been cured 
of the vice of covetousness, if he had been in my 
case ; for I possessed infinitely more than I knew 
what to do with. I had no room for desire, except 
it was for things which I had not, and thev were 
'.comparatively but trifles, thoueh indeed of great 
use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of 
money, as well gold as silver, . about tnirty-six 
s pounds sterling. Alas J there the nasty, sorry, use- 
' less^tifi^ lay : I iiad no manner of business for it ; 
and I often thought within myself, that I would 
^jiave given ahandralof itfor a gross of tobacco-pipes, 
or for a hand-mill to grind my com ; nay, I would 
'have given it all for sixpenny-wo^ of turnip and 
« carrot seed from England, or for Aiandful oi peas 
and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had 
not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it ; 
but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with 
the damp of theca^e in the wet seasons ; and if I 
^ad had the drawer full of diam onds, it had been 
the same case,— -they had been of no manner of va- 
lue to me because of no use.

^ I had now brought my state of life to be much 
.more comfortable tn itselt than it was at first, and 
much easier to my mind, as well as to my body. I 
^equently sat down to meat with thankfulness, 
and admired the hand pf God's providence, which 
had thus spread my table in the wilderness: I 
learned to look more upon the bright side of my 
condition, and less upon tlie dark side, and to con- 
sider what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted : 
and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts^ 
that I cannot express them ; and which I take no- 
tice of here, to put those discontented people in 
mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God 
has given them, because they see and covet some- 
thing that he has not given them. All our discon- 
tents about what we want, appeared to me to spring 
from, the want of thapkfiilness for what we have. 

Another reflection was of great use to me, and 
doubtless would be so to any one that should 
fijl into such distress as mine was ; and this was^ 
to compare my present condition with what I at 
first expected it would be ; nay, with what it would 
certainly have been, if the good providence of God 
had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up 
near to the shore, where I not only couldxome at 
her, but could bring what I got out of her to the 
shore, for my relief and. comfort; without which, 
I had wanted for tools to work, weapons for de- 
fence, and gunpowder and shot for getting my food. 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in 
- representing to myself, in the most lively colours, 
how I must have acted if I had got nothing out of 
the ship. I could not have so much as got any 
food, except fish and turtles ; and that, as it was 
long before I found any of them, I must have pe- 
rished ; that I should have lived, if I had not pe- 
rished, like a mere savage; that if 1 had killed a

goat or a fowl, by any contrivance, I had -60 way 
to flay or open it, or part the flesh from the skin 
and the bowels, or to cut it up ; but must knaw it 
with my teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a 
beast. 

These reflections made me vesy sensible of the 
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful 
for my present condition, with all its hardships and 
misfortunes : and this part also I cannot but recom- 
mend to the reflection of those who are apt, in their 
misery, to say. Is any affliction like mine ? Let 
them consider how much worse the cases of some 
people are, and their case might have been, if Pro- 
vidence had thought fit. 

I had another reflection, which assisted me also 
to comfort my mind with hopes ; and this was, com- 
paring my present condition with what I had de- 
served, and had therefore reason to expect from the 
hand of Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, per- 
fectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of God. 
I had been well mstructed by my father and mother ; 
neither had they been wanting to me, in their en- 
deavours to infuse an early religious awe of God into 
my mind, a sense of my duty, and what the nature 
and end of my being required of me. But, alas ! 
falling early into the seafaring life, whidi, of all lives, 
is the most destitute of the fear of God, though his 
terrors are always before diem ; I say, falling eariy 
into the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, 
all that little sense of religion which I had enter* 
tained was laughed out of me by my messmates ; by 
a hardened despising of dangers, and the views of 
death, which grew habitual to me ; by my Imig 
absence from all manner of opportunities to coii- 
verse with any thing but what was like myself, 
or to hear any thing that was good, or tending 
. towards it*

So void was I of every Uiing that was good, or of 
the least sense of what I was, or was to be» ihat ift 
the greatest deliveraaces I enjoyed (such as my 
escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the Portu- 
guese master of a ship, my being planted so well ia 
the Brazils, my receiving the careo from England, 
and the like), I never had once tue words. Thank 
God, so much as on my mind, or in my mouth ; nor 
in the greatest distress had I so mui^ as a thought 
to pray to him, or so much as to say, Lord, have 
mercy upon me ! no, nor to mention tlie name of 
God» unless it was to swear by, and biaspheme it. 

I had terrible reflections upon my mtna for maof 
months, as I have already dl>served, on account of my 
wicked and hardened life past ; and when I looked 
about me, and considered what particular providences 
had attended me since my coining into this place* 
and how God had dealt bountifufiy with me,— *had 
not only punished me less than mv iniauity had de- 
served, but had so pdentilully provided ror me, — ^this- 
gave me great hopes that my repentance was ac- 
cepted* and that God hod yet mercies in store fcnr 
me. 

With these reflection^, I worked my mind up, 
not only to a resignation to the will of God in the 
present disposition of my circumstances, but even 
to a sincere thankfulness for my condition ; and 
that I, who waA yet a living man, ought not to 
complaij^ seeing I had not the due punishment of 
my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I 
had no reason to have expected in that place, that I 
ought never more to repine at my condition, but 
to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily 
bread, which nothiAg but a crowd of wonders could 
have brought ; that I ought to consider I had been 
fed by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding 
Elijah bj ravens ; nay, by a long series of miiticles i

and that I could> hardly have named a place in the 
uninhabitable part of the world where I could hare 
been cast more to my advantage ; a pliace where, as 
I* had no society, which was my affliction on one 
hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no furious 
wolves or tigers, to threaten my life ! no venemous 
or poisonous creatures, which I might feed on to 
my hurt ; no savages, to murder and devour me. 
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, 
so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted no- 
thing to make it a life of comfort, but to raskemy^ 
self sensible of God's goodness to me, and care over 
me in this condition ; and after I did make a just 
improvement of these things, I went away, and waff 
DO more sad. 

I had now been here so long, that many things 
which I brought on shore for my help were either 
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some- 
time, all but a very little, whidi I eked out with wa- 
ter, a little and a little, till it was so pale, it scarce^ 
left any appearance of black upon the paper. As 
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down' 
the days of the month on which any remarkable 
thing happened to me : and, first,, by casting up- 
times past, I remember that thiere was a strange 
concurrence of days in the various providences which- 
befel me, and which, if I had been superstitiously 
inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I 
might iiave had reason to have looked upon with a 
great deal of curiosity. 

First, I had observed, that the same day that I 
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran 
away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day 
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war^ 
and made a slave : the same day of the year that I 
escaped out of the wreck of the ship in Yannouth

Roada> that same day-year afterwards I raadjB my 
escape from Sallee in the boat: and the same diay of 
the year I waft bom on, viz. the SOth of September^ 
that same day I had my life fto miraculously saved 
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in 
this island : so that my wicked life and my solitary 
life began both on one day. 

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that 
of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I iMroueht 
out of the ship : this I had husb^ded to the last 
degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day 
for above a year; and yet I was quite without bread 
for near a year before I got any corn of my own ; 
and great reason I had to be thankful that I had 
any at all, the getting it being, as has been already 
observed, next to miraculous. 

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily : as to 
linen, I had none for a great while, except some 
chequered shirts which I round in the chests of the 
other seamen; and which I carefully preserved, be- 
cause many times I could bear no clothes on but a 
shirt; and it was a very sreat help to me that I had, 
among all the men's domes of the ship, almost three 
dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several 
thick watch-coats of the seamen's which were left^ 
but they were too hot to wear : and though it is 
true that the weather was sq violently hot that there 
was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite 
naked, no, though I had been inclined to it, which 
I was not, nor could I abide tl^e thought of it, 
though } was £^ ^one. Tt^e reason why I could 
^Qt go quite naked was, I CQuld not bear the heat of 
fhe sun so well when quite naked as with some 
^lothes on ; nay, the very heat frequently blistered 
my skin : where^, with a shirt on, the air itself

150 ADVENTURES OF 

I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the suif 
without a cap or hat; tne heat of the sun beating- 
with such violence as it does in that place, would 
give me the head-ach presently, by darting so direct- 
ly upon my head, without a cap or hat on, so that I 
could not bear it ; whereas, ir I put on my hat, it 
would presently go away. 

Upon these views, I began to consider about put- 
ting the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into 
some order: I had worn out all the waistcoats I 
had, and my business was now to try if I could not 
make jackets out of the great watch-coats that I had 
by ine, and with such other materials as I had ; so 
I set to work a tailoring, or rather, indeed, a botch- 
ing, for I made most piteous work of it. However, 
I made shift to make two or three new waiistcoats, 
which I hoped would serve me a great while : as for 
breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift 
indeed, till afterwards. 

I have mentioned, that I saved the skins of all the 
creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones ; 
and I had hung them up, stretched out with sticks^ 
in the sun, by which means some of them were so 
dry and hard that theywere fit for little, but other* 
I found very useful. The first thing I made of these 
was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the 
outside, to shoot off the rain; and this I performed 
so well, that after this I made me a suit of clothes 
wholly of the skins, that is to say, a waistcoat, and 
breeches, open at the knees, and both loose ; for 
they were rather wanting to keep me cool than 
warm. I must not omit to* acknowledge that they 
were wretchedly made ; for if I was a bad carpenter, 
I was a worse tailor. However, they were such as I 
made very good shift with ; and when I was abroad, 
if it happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and 
cap being uppermost, I was kept very dry.

After this, I spent a great deal of tjixre and pains' 

to make me an umbrella : I was indeed in grealf 

want of one, and had a great mind to make one ; I 

had seen them made in the Brazils, where they were 

tery useful in the great heats which are there ; anct 

I felt the heats every jot as great here, and greatei^ 

too, being nearer the equinox : besides, as I was 

obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful 

thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I 

took a world of pains at it, and was a great while 

before I could make any thing likely to hold ; nay, 

after I thought I had hit th^ way, I spoiled two or 

three before I made one to my mind ; but at last I 

made one that answered indifferently well ; the main 

difficulty I found was to make it to let down : I 

could make it spread, but if it did not let down too, 

and draw in, it was not portable for me any way but 

just over my head, which would not do. However, 

at last, as I said, I made one to answer, and covered 

it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the 

rain like a pent-house, and kept off the sun so ef* 

fectually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the 

weather with greater advantage than I could before 

in the coolest ; and when I had no need of it, could 

close it, and carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being 
entirely composed by resigning to the will of Goo, 
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his 
providence. This made my lire better than sociable ; 
for when I began to regret the want of conversa- 
tion, I would ask myself whether thus conversing 
mutually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I 
may say, with even God himself, by ejaculations, was 
not better than the utmost enjoyment of human so- 
ciety in the world ? 

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any ex- 
traordinary thing happened to me, but I lived on in

the same course, in the same posture and place, just 
as before ; the chief things I was employed in, be-> 
sides my yearly labour of planting my barley and 
rice^ and curing my raisins, of boSi which I always 
kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one 
year's provision beforehand; I say, besides this 
. yearly labour, and my daily pursuit of going out 
with my gun, I had one labour, to make me a canoe, 
which at last I finished : so that by digging a canal 
to it of six feet wide, and four feet deep, l brought 
it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the 
first, which was so vastly big, as I made it without 
considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I 
should be able to launch it, so, never being able to 
bring it into the water, or bring the water to it, I 
was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a memoran- 
dum to teach me to be wiser the next time ; iodeeds 
the next time, though I could not get a tree proper 
for it, and was in a place where I could not get the 
water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, 
n^ar half a mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at 
last, I never gave it over : and though I was near 
two years about it, yet I never grudged my la- 
bour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at 
last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, 
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the 
design which I had in view when I made the first; 
I mean, of venturing over to the terra Jirmoy where 
it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the 
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that 
design, and now I thought no more of it. As I had 
a boat, my next design was to make a cruise round 
the island; for as I luid been on the other side in 
one place, crossing, as I have already described it» 
over the land, so the discoveries 1 made in that little 
journey made me very eager to see other parte of

the coast; and now 1 had a boat, I thought of no- 
thmg but sailing round the island. 

For this purpose, that I might do every thing 
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a 
little mast in my boat, and made a sail to it out of 
some of the pieces of the ship's sails which lay in 
store, and of which I had a great stock by me. 
Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat^ 
I found she would sail very well : then I made little 
lockers, or boxes, at each end of my boat, to put 
provisions, necessaries, ammunition, &c. into, to be 
kept' dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea; 
and a little long hollow place 1 cut in the inside of 
the boat, where 1 could lay my gun, making a flap- 
to hang down over it, to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, 
like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the* 
heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus I 
every now and then took a little voyage upon the 
sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little 
creek. At last, bein^ eager to view the circumfer- 
ence of my little kingdom, 1 resolved upon my 
cruise ; and accordingly, I victualled my ship for 
the voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I 
should rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen 
pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a great deal 
of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder 
and shot for killing more, and two large watch- 
coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I had 
saved out of the seamen's chests ; these 1 took, one 
to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night. 

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of 
my reign, or my captivity, which you please, that I 
set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer 
than I expected ;* for though the island itself wa9 
not very large, yet when 1 came to the east side of 
It, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two

leagues into the sea, some above water, some under 
it ; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half 
a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great 
way out to sea to double the point. 

When first I discovered them, I was going to give 
over my enterprise, and come back again, not 
knowine how far it might oblige me to go out to 
sea, and, above all, doubting how I should get back 
again ; so I came to an anchor; for I had made me 
a jcind of an anchor with a piece of a broken grap- 
pling which I got out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, 1 took my gun and 
went on shore, climbing up on a hill, which seem- 
ed, to overlook that point, where I saw the full ex- 
tent of it, and resolved to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I 
stood, 1 perceived a strong, and indeed a most 
furious current, which ran to the east, and evea 
came close to the point ; and I took the more no- 
tice of it, because I saw there might be some 
danger, that when I came into it, I nught be carri- 
ed out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to 
make the island again : and, indeed, had 1 not got 
first upon this hill, 1 believe it would have been so ; 
for there was the same current on the other side the 
island, only that it set off at a farther distance, and 
I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore ; so I 
had nothing to do but to get out of the first cur- 
rent, and 1 should presenuy be in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind 
blowing pretty fresh at £. S. £. and that being just 
contrary to the said current, made a great breach 
of the sea upon the point ; so that it was not safe 
for me to keep too close to the dbore, for the breach> 
nor to go too far oS, because of the stream.

ed ; but I ttn a warning-piece again to all rai^ and 
ignorant pilots ; for no sooner was I come Co the 
point, when I was not even mv boat's length from 
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of 
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill ; it 
carried my boat along with it with such violence, 
that all I could do could not keep her so much as 
on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me farther 
and farther out from the eddy, which was on my left 
hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and 
all 1 could do with my piNldles signified nothing : 
and now I began to give myself over for lost ; for as 
the current was on both sides of the island, I knew 
in a few leagues distance they must join again, and 
then I was irrecoverably gone ; nor did I see any 
possibility of avoiding it ; so that I had no prospect 
before roe but of perishmff, not by the sea, for that 
was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I 
had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big al- 
most as 1 could lift, and had tossed it into the boat ; 
and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to say^ 
one of my earthen pots ; but what was all this to 
being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, 
there was no shore, no main land or island, for a 
thousand leagues at least ? 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence 
of God to make even the most miserable condition 
of mankind worse. Now I looked back upon my 
desolate solitary island, as the most pleasant place 
in the world ; and all the happiness my heart could 
wish for was to be but there again. I stretched out 
my hands to it, with eager wishes : O happy desert ! 
said I, I ^all never see thee more. O miserable 
creature! whither am I going ! Then I reproached 
myself with my unthankful temper, and how I had 
repined at my solitary condition; and now what 
would I give'to b^ on shore there again ! Thus wo

value what we enjoy, but bv the want of it. It is 
scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was 
now in, being driven fVom my beloved island (for so 
it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, 
almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of 
ever recovering it again. However, I worked hard, 
till indeed my strength was almost exhausted, and 
kept my boat as much to the northward, that is, to- 
wards the side of the current which the eddy lay on, 
as possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun 
passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze 
of wind in my face, springing up from S. S. £. This 
cheered mv heart a little, and especially when, in 
about half an. hour more, it blew a pretty gentle 
sale. By this time I was got at a frightful distance 
from the island, and had the least cloudy or hazy 
weather intervened, 1 had been undone another way 
too; for I had no compass on board, and should 
never have known how to have steered towards the 
island, if I had but once lost sight of it ; but the 
weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up 
my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away 
to the north as much as possible, to get out of the 
current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat 
began to stretch away, 1 saw even by the clearness 
of the water some alteration of the current was 
near ; for where the current was so strong, the water 
was foul ; but perceiving the Vrater clear, I found 
the current abate; and presently 1 found to the 
east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon 
some rocks : these rocks 1 found caused the current 
to part again, and as the. main stress of it ran away 
more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, 
so the other- returned by the repulse of the rocks,

and made a strong eddy, which ran back again to 
the north-west, with a very sharp stream. 

They who knew what it is to have a reprieve 
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued 
from thieves just going to murder them, or who 
have been in such-Iike extremities, may guess what 
my present surprise of joy was, and how ^adly I put 
my boat into ti)e stream of this eddy; and the wmd 
also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, 
running cheerfully before the wind, and with a 
strong tide or eddy under foot. 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way 
back again, directly towards the island, but about 
two leagues more to the northward than the current 
which carried me away at first : so that when I came 
near the island, I found myself open to the northern 
shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the island, 
opposite to that which I went out from. 

when I had made something more than a league 
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found 
it was spent, and served me no farther. However, 
I found that being between two great currents, viz. 
that on the south side, which had hurried me away, 
and that on the north, which lay about a league on 
the other side; I say, between these two, m the 
wake of the island, 1 found the water at least stUl, 
and running no way ; and having still a breeze of 
wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the 
island^ though not making such fresh way as I did 
before. 

About four o'clock in the #rening, being then 
williin a league of the island, I found the point of 
therocks which occasioned this disaster, stretching 
out, as is described before, to the southward, and 
casting' off the^ current more southerly^ had, of 
course, ifilide another eddy^to'the north; and this I 
found very strong, but not directly setting the way

my course ky, which iras due west, but abaoBt IM 
north. However, having a fresh gde, I sUetdted 
across this eddy, slanting north-west : and, in about 
an hour, came within about a mike of the shore^ 
where, it bemg smooth water, I soon got to land. 

When I was on shore, I fell <ttt my knees, and gave 
God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside 
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat ; and re» 
Ireshing myself with such things as I had, I brought 
my boat close to the shore, in a Httle cove that! had 
spied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, 
l^ing quite spent widi the labour and fatigue of die 
voyage* 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home 
with my boat : I had run so much hazard, and 
knew too much of tlie case, to think of attempting 
it by the way I went out ; and what might be at 
the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not, 
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I 
only resolved in the morning to make my way west- 
ward along the shore, and to see if there was no 
creek where I mi^ht lay up mv frigate in safety, so 
as to have her agam, if I wanted her. L:i about time 
miles, or thereabout, coasting the shore, I came to 
a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which 
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook, 
where I found a very convenient harbour for my 
boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little 
dock made on purpose for her. Here I put in^ and 
having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shorty 
to lo(d[ iidiout me, tad see where I was. 

I soon fonnd I had bat a little passed by die pfaMie 
where I had been before, when I travelled oti foot to 
that shore ; so taking nothing out of my boat but

fell asleep: but judge you, if you can, that read my 
story, what a surprise I must be in, when I was 
awaked out of my sleep by a wee, calling me by 
my name several times^obio, Robin, Robin Crusoe; 
•oov Robin Crusoe! Wluffe are you, Robin Crusoe? 
where are yon ? Where faaiye vou been ? 

J was so dead adeep at first, being fatigued with

not wjke thoroughly ; but dosnng between sleeping 
and waking, thought I dreamed that some-body 
^»oke to me ; but as the voice coutinued to repeat 
Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe» at last I began to 
wake more perfectly, and was at first dkeadfuUy 
frightened, and started up in the utmost constema* 
tion ; but no sooner were my eves open^ but I saw 
lay Pdl sitting on the top m the hedge ; and im* 
mediately knew it was he that spoke to me ; for just 
l» sndt bemoaning language I bad used to talk to

fectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his 
kill close to my face, and cry, Poor R<^n Crusoe I 
Wheveareyou? Where have you been? How came

out my hand, and calling him by his name, Poll, 
the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my 
thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to 
me» Poor Robin Crusoe !. and how did I come here ? 
and where had I been ? just as if he had been over- 
joyed to see me again : and so I carried him home 
along with me; 

I now had enough of rambling to sea for some 
time, and had enough to do for many days, to sit 
still, and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I 
would have been very glad to have had my boat 
again on my side of the island ; but I knew not 
how it was practicable to get it about. As to the 
east side of the island, which I ha^ ^one round, I 
knew well enough there was no venturmg that way; 
my very heart would shrink, and my very blood run 
chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side of 
the island, I did not know how it might be there ; 
but supposing the current ran with the same force 
against the shore at the east as it passed by it on 
the other, I might run the same risk of being driven 
down the stream, and carried by the island, as I had 
been before of being carried away from it ; so, with 
these thoughts, I contented myself to be without 
any boat, though it had been the product of so 
many months labour to make it, and of so many 
more to get it into the sea. 

In this government ofmy temper I remained near 
a year, lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may 
well suppose; and my thoughts beine very much 
composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted 
in resigning myself to the dispositions of Providence, 
I thought I lived really very happily in all things, 
except that of society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic 
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying 
myself to; and I believe I could, upon occasion, have

vad9 a very goo4 caipeoter^ especially cojosideriag 
hfm few tools I had. 

Besides thia, I arrived at an unexpected perfection 
in my earthen-ware, aod contrived well enough to / 
Biake them with a wheel, which I found infinitely 
caaier and better; because I made things round and 
[|hapable, which before were filthy things indeed to 
look on. But I think' I was never more vain of my 
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I 
found out, than for my being able to make a to- 
hacco-pipe ; and though it was a very ugly clumsy 
thing when it was done, and only burnt red, like 
0ther earthen-ware, yet as it was hard and firm, and 
would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly contforted 
with it, for 1 had been always used to smoke : and 
^re were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at 
first, not thimung that there was tobacco in the 
islacui ; and afterwards, when I searched the ship 
again, I could not come at any pipes at all. 

In my wicker-ware also I unproved much, smd 
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my 
invention showed me ; though not very handsome, 
yet they were such as were very handy and conve- 
nient for my laying things up in, or fetching things 
home. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I 
could hang it up in a tree, fiay it, dress it, and cut 
it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and the 
like by a turde: I comd cut it up, take out the eggs, 
and a piece oc^wo of the flesh, which was enough 
for me, and bring them home in a basket, and 
leave the rest behind me. Also large deep baskets 
were the receivers of my corn, which I always rub- 
bed out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept 
it in great baskets. 

i l^ffan now to perceive my powder abated con- 
siderably ; this was a want which it was impossible 
for me to supplyy and I began seriously to consider

162 ADVENTURES OF 

what I must do when I should have no more p&W" 
der ; that is to say, how I should do to kill any 
goats. I had, as is observed, in the third year of 
my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up 
tame, and I was in hopes of getting a he-goat : but 
I could not by any means bring it to pass, till my 
kid grew an old goat ; and as I could never find in 
my heart to kill her, she died at last of mere age. 

But being now in the eleventh year of my resi- 
dence, and, as I have said, my ammunition growing 
low, 1 set myself to study some art to trap and snare 
the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of 
them alive ; and particularly^ I wanted a she-goat 
great with young. For this purpose, I made snares 
to hamper them ; and I do believe they were more 
than once taken in them ; but ifny tackle was not 
good, for I had no wire, and I always found them 
broken, and my bait devoured. At length I resolved 
to try a pit-fall : so I dug several large pits in the 
earth, in places where I had observed the goats used 
to feed, and over those pits I placed hurdles, of my 
. own making too, with a great weight upon them ; 
and several times I put ears of barley and dry rice, 
without setting the trap ; and I could easily per- 
ceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the 
corn, for I icould see the marks of their feet. At 
length I set three traps in one night, and goin^ the 
next morning, I found them all standing, and yet 
the bait eaten and gone ; this was very discourag- 
ing. However, I altered my traps; and, not to 
trouble you with particulars, going one morning to 
see my traps, I found in one of them a large old 
he-goat, and in one of the others three kids, a male 
and two females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with 
him ; he was so fierce, I durst not go into the pit 
to him ; that is to say, to go about to bring him

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 163 

away alive, which was what I wanted : I could have 
killed him, but that was not my business, nor would 
it answer my .end; so I even let him out, and he 
ran away, as if he had been frightened out of his 
wits. But I had forgot then, what I had learned 
afterwards, that hunger will. tame a lion. If 1 had 
let him stay there three or four days witliout food, 
and then have carried him some water to drink, and 
then a little com, he would havd been as tame as 
one of the kids ; for they are mighty sagacious, trac- 
table creatures, where they are well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing 
no better at that time : then I went to the three 
kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them with 
strings togetiier, and with some difficulty brought 
them all home. 

It was a ffood while before they would feed ; but 
throwing them some sweet com, it tempted them, 
and they began to be tame. And now I found that 
if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh when 
I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame 
was my only way; when, perhaps, I might have 
them about my house like a flocK of sheep. But 
then it occurred to me, that I must keep the tame 
from the wild, or else they would always run wild 
when they grew up : and the only way fox this was^ 
to have some enclosed piece of ground, well fenced, 
either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so efiec- 
tually, that those within might not break out, or 
those without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of 
hands ; yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity 
for doing it, my first work was to find out a proper 
piece of ground, where there was likely to be herb- 
age for Uiem to eat, water for them to drink, and 
cover to keep them from the sun.

I h^d very little oQotrivancQ, when I pitcb^ upon 
1^ place very, proper for all tlieB^ (being a pl«^ <4>^o 
piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people 
pall it in the western colonies), which had iwo or 
three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end 
was very woody ; I say, they will smile at my fw©' 
oast, when 1 shall t^U them, I begao my enclosing 
this piec^ of ground in such a ma9n^r» ^at my 
hedge or pale must have been 9^% least two miles 
about. Nor iva^ the madnesa pf it so gr^t as to 
the compass, for if it was ten niiles al^ut, I was 
like to have time enough to do it in ; but 1 did not 
consider that my goats would be as wild in so much 
compass as if they had had the whole island* and 
I should have so much room to chase ihem in, that 
I should never catch them. 

My hedge ^9s begun and carried on, ( believe 
about fifty yards, wli^n this thouffht Qccured to me; 
i|o I presently stopped short, and, for the first be- 
ginnmg, I resolved to enclose a piece of about 1^ 
yards in length, and 100 yards in breadtJb^ ; whicthi 
a^ it would maint^n as msijuy as 1 shpuld have in 
a^y reasonablf^ time^ so, a# my stock increased, I 
could add more ground tQ niy enclosure. 

This was acting with soipe prudenoe, and I went 
tp work with courage. I was about three months 
hedging in the first piece ; and, till I had dpne it« 
1 te^ered the three k,id^ in the best part qf it* and 
i;ii^e4 them, tp ^ed as near me as ppssible, to make 
them familiar ; and very often J would go. and pafry 
them some ears of barley, or a handful ofnce% and 
feed them out of my hand : so that after my enelo« 
i^ure was finished, and I l^t them loose* they would 
follow me up s\nd dpwn^ bleating after me for a 
handful of corn. 

This answered my end:* and in about a year and

all ; and in two years more, I had three and forty, 
besides several that I took and killed for my food. 
After that I enclosed five several pieces of ground 
. to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, 
to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one 
piece of ground into another. 

But this was not all ; for now I not only had 
goat's flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk 
too ; a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I did 
not so much as think of, and which, when it came 
into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise : 
for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a 
gallon or two of milk in a day. And as nature, who 
gives supplies of food to every creature, dictates 
even naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had 
never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter 
or cheese made, only when I was a boy, afler a 
great many essays and miscarriages, made me both 
butter and cheese at last, and also salt (though I 
found it partly made to my hand by the heat of the 
sun upon some of the rocks of the sea), and never 
wanted it afterwards. How mercifully can our 
Creator treat his creatures, even in those conditions 
in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in de- 
struction ! How can he sweeten the bitterest pro- 
vidences, and give us cause to praise him for aun- 
geons and prisons ! What a table was here spread 
for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing, at first, 
but to perish for hunger ! 

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen 
me and my little family sit down to dinner : there 
was my majesty, the prmce and lord of the whole 
island ; I had the lives of all my subjects at my ab- 
solute command ; I could hang, draw, give liberty, 
and take it away ; and no rebels among all my sub- 
jects. Then to see how like a king I dined ioo, all

been my faTOurite* was the only person perRtttta4 
to talk to me. My dog, who was now grown very 
old and crazy^ and had found no species to multiply 
hia kind upon, sat always at my right hand ; and 
two cats, one on one side of the table, and one oq 
the other, expecting now and then a bit from my 
hand, as a mark of special favour. 

But these were not the two cats which I brought 
on shore at first, for they were both of them dead, 
and had been interred near my habitation by my 
^WD hand ; but one of them having multiplied by I 
know not what kind of creature, these were two 
which I had preserved tame ; whereas the rest nm 
wil4 in the woods, and became indeed troublesome 
to me at last ; for they would often come into my 
house, and* plunder me too, till at last I was obliged 
to shoot them, and did kill a great many ; at length 
they left me. — With this attendance, and in wis 
plentiful manner, I lived ; neither could I be said 
to want any thing but society : and of that» some 
lime after this, I was like to have too much* 

I was something impatient, as I have observedi

I could not but smile at the notion of my travelling 
through Yorkshire, with such an equipage, and in 
such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my 
figure, as follows : 

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's 
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to 
keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from 
running into my neck: nothing being so hurtful in 
these climates as the rain upon the flei^, under 
the clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts 
coming do#n to about the middle of the thighs, 
and a pair of open«kneed breeches of the same ; 
the breeches were made of the skin of an old he* 
goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either 
side, that Hke pantaloons, it reached to the middle 
of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none,- but 
had made me a pair of somethings, I scarce know 
what to cM them, like buskins, to flap over, my 
lep, and lace on either side like spatterdashes; but 
ot a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the 
rest of my clothes. 

I had on a broad beft of goat's skin dried, which 
I drew together with two thongs of the same, in- 
stead of buckles; and in a kind of a frog on either 
ride of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung 
a little saw and a hatchet ; one on one side, and 
^ne on the other. I had another belt, not so 
broad, and fastened in the same manner, which 
huttff over my shoulder ; and at the end of it, under 
my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of 
goat's skin too ; in one of which hung my powder, 
ni the other my shot. At my back I carried my 
basket, and on my shoulder my gun ; and over my 
head a great clumsy uglv goat's skin umbrella, 
but wMeh after all, was the most necessary thing 
1 had about me, next to my gun. As for my &ce»

the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like as one 
might expect from a man not at all careful of it, 
and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. 
My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was 
about a quarter of a yard long; but as I haU both 
scissars and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty 
short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I 
had trimmed into a Targe pair of Mahometan whis*- 
kers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at 
Sallee ; for the Moors did not wear such, though the 
Turks did: of these mustachios or whiskers, I- will 
not say they were long enough to hang my hat 
upon them, but they were of a length and shape 
monstrous enough, and such as, in^England, would 
have passed for frfghtful. 

But all this is by the bye ; for as to my figure, 
I had so few to observe me that it was of no manner 
of consequence, so I say no more to that part. In 
this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was 
out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea- 
shore, directly to the place where I first brought my 
boat to an achor, to get upon the rocks ; and having 
no boat now to take care of, I went over the land, 
a nearer way, to the same height that I was upon be- 
fore; when looking forward to the point of the rocks 
which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with 
my boat, as is said above, was surprised to see the 
flea all smooth and quiet; no* rippling, no motion, no 
current, any more there than m any other places. 
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and re- 
solved to' spend some time in the observing it, to 
see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occa- 
sioned it; but I was presently convinced how it was, 
viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and 
joining with the current of waters from some great 
river on the shore; must be the occasion of this cur- 
rent; and that according as the wind blew more fot«

cibly from the west, or from the north, this current 
came nearer, or went farther from the shore ; for 
waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the 
rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I 
plainly saw the current again as before, only that 
It ran farther off, being near half a league from the 
shore ; whereas, in my case, it set close upon the 
shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it ; 
which, at another time, it would not have done. 

This observation convinced me, that I had no* 
thing to do but to observe the ebbingimd the flow- 
ing of the tide, and I might very easily bring my 
boat about the island again : but when I began to 
think of putting it in practice, I had such a terror 
upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger 
I had been in, that I could not think of it again 
with any patience ; but, on the contrary, I took up 
another resolution, which was more safe, though 
more laborious; and ihis was, that I would build, 
or rather make me another periagua or canoe ; and 
so have one for one side of the islaAd, and one for 
the other. 

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may 
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little 
fortification or tent, with the wall about it, under the 
rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time, 
I had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one 
within another. One of these, which was the driest 
and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or 
fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall 
joined to the rock, was all filled up with the large 
earthen pots, of which I have given an account, 
and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which 
would hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up 
my stores of provision, especially my com, some in 
the ear, cut off short from the straw, and the other 
nibbed out with my hand.

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes 
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by 
this time grown so big, and spread so very much, 
that there was not the least appearance, to any one's 
view, of an^ habitation behina them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther 
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my 
two pieces of com land, which I kept duly cultiva- 
ted aod sowed, and which duly yielded me their bar* 
vest in its season; and whenever I had occasion for 
more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that. 

Besides this, I had my country seat; and 1 had 
now a tolerable plantation there also : for, first, I 
had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in 
repair ; that is to say, I kept the hedge which en^ 
circled it in constantly fitted up to its usual height, 
the ladder standing always in the inside : I kept the 
trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, 
but Were now grown very firm and tall, always cut 
so, that they might spread and grow thick and wild, 
and make the more agreeable shade; which they 
did efiectually to ray mmd. In the middle of this I 
had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail 
spread over poles, set up for that purpose, and which 
never wanted any repair cfr renewmg; and under 
this I had made me a squab or c^xrch, with the skins 
of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft 
things; and a blanket laid on them, such as be^ 
longed to our sea-bedding, which I had saved, and 
a great watch-coat to cover me ; and here, when- 
ever I had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, 
I took up my country habitation. 

Adjoining to l^is 1 had my enclosures for my cat- 
tle, that is to say, mv goats; and as I had taken an 
inconceivable deal' of pains to fence and encbse this 
gromMi, i was so am^ious to see it kept entire, lest 
the goats should break through^ that I never lefl

off, |ill, wHk infinite lidioiir, I had stock the out- 
side of the hedge so full of small stakes, and |o near 
to one another, that it was rather a [>ale than a 
hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hand 
through between them; which afterwards, when 
Uiose stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy 
seasonj made the enclosure strong like a wall» — in^ 
deed, stronger than any wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and 
that I spared no pains to bring |o pass whatever 
appeared necessary for my comfortable support; 
for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame 
creatures thus a( niy hand would be a living maga« 
sine of flesh, milk, hu|ter, and cheese for me as 
long as I lived in the place, if it were to b^ forty 
years; and that keeping ih&ai in my reach depended 
entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to such 
a d^ree, that I might be sure of keeping them to* 
getber; wliich, by this method) indeed, I so effi^c- 
toally secured) that when these Uttle stakes began 
to groW) I had planted ^m so very thick, that I 
was forced to pull some of them up again. 

In this place alao I had my grapes growing, which 
I principally depended on ^r my winter store of 
raisins, ai^d which I nevar failed to preserve very 
carefully* as th^ best and most agreeable dainty of 
my whole diet : and, indeed, they were not only 
agreeable, but medicinal^ wholesome, nourishing^ 
and refreshing to the last degree. ^ 

As this was also about half-way between my other 
habitation and the place where I had laid up m^ 
boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my way thi- 
ther ; for I used frequently to visit my bpat ; and I 
kept all things aboijit, or belonging to her, in vQi?y 
good order : sometimes I went out in her to divert 
myself, but no more hft7,ardoiis voyages weald YgQ»

172 ADVENTURES OF 

shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out 
of my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or 
any other accident. But now I come to a new scene 
of my life. 

It happened one day, about noon, going towards 
my boat, I was exceemngly surprised with the print 
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very 
plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thun- 
der-struck, or as if I had seen an apparition ; 1 list- 
ened, I looked round me, but I could hear nothing, 
nor see any thing ; I went up to a rising ground, 
to look farther; I went up the shore, and down 
the shore, but it was all one; I could see no other 
impression but that one. I went to it a^ain to see 
if Uiere were any more, and to observe if it might 
not be my fancy ; but there was no room for that, 
for there was exactly the print of a foot, toes, heel, 
and every part of a foot; how it came thither i 
knew not, nor could I in the least imagine ; but, 
after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man 
perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home 
to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the 
ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree : 
looking behind me at every two or three steps, mis- 
taking every bush and tree, and fancying every 
stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible 
to describe how many various shapes my attrighted 
imagination represented things to me in, how many 
wild ideas were found every moment in my fancy, 
and what strange unaccountable whimsies came 
into my thoughts by the way. 

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called 
it ever after this), I fled into it like one pursued ; 
whether T went over by the ladder, as first contrived, 
or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had 
called a door, I cannot remember ; no^ nor could I 
remember the next morning ; for never frightened

have fle4 to cover, or fox to quth, with more terror 
of mind that I to this retreat. 

I slept none that night ; the farther I was from 
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen- 
sions were ; which is something contrary to the na- 
ture of such things, and especially to the usual prac- 
tice of all creatures in fear; but I was so embar-. 
rassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing, 
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to 
myself, even though 1 was now a great way off, it. 
Sometimes I fancied it must be the Devil, and reason 
joined in with me upon this supposition ; for how 
should any other thing in human shape come into 
the place ? Where was the vessel that brought 
them ? What marks were there of any other foot- 
steps ? And how was it possible a man should come 
there ? But then to think that Satan should take 
human shape upon him in such a place, where there 
could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave 
the print of his foot behind him, and that even for 
no purpose too, for he could not be sure 1 should 
see it, — this was an amusement the other way. I 
considered that the Devil might have found out 
abundance of oth^r ways to have terrified me than 
this of the single print of a foot ; that as I lived 
quite on the other side of the island, he would never 
have been so simple a^ to leave a mark in a place 
where it was ten thousand to one whether I should 
ever see it or not, and in the, sand too, which the 
first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have 
defaced entirely : all this seemed inconsistent with the 
thing itself, and with all the notions we usually en- 
tertain of the subtilty of the Devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted to ar- 
gue me out of all apprehensions of its being the De- 
vil; and I presently concluded then, that it must be 
some more dangerous creature, viz. that it mqst be 
q3

174 ADVEKTURBS Of 

some of the savages of the main land over-against 
me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, 
and either driven by the' currents or by contrary 
winds, had made the island, and had been on shore, 
but were gone away again to sea ; beins as loth, 
perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as I 
would have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were rolling upon my 
mind, I was very thankful in my thoughts that i 
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, 
or that they did not see my boat, by which they 
' would have concluded that some inhabitants had 
been in the place, and perhaps have searched far- 
ther for me : then terrible tnoughts racked my 
imagination about their having found my boat, and 
that there were people here ; and that if so, I should 
certainly have them come again in greater num- 
bers, and devour me ; that if it should happen so 
that they should not find me, yet they would find 
mv enclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry away 
all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at 
last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all 
that former confidence in God, which was founded 
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of his 
goodness, as if he that nad fed me by miracle hi-^ 
therto could not preserve, by his power, the provi- 
sion which he had made for me by his goodness. I 
reproached myself with my laziness, that would 
not sow any more corn one year than would just 
serve me till the next season, as if no accident 
would intervene to prevent mv enjo3ring the crop 
that was upon the ground ; and this I thought so 
iust a reproof, that I resolved for the future to 
have two or three years com beforehand; so that 
whatevier might come, I might not perish for want 
of bread.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1^5 

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is 
the life of man ! and by what secret different sprii^ 
are the affections hurried about> as different cir- 
cumstances present I To-day we love what to-mor- 
row we hate ; to-day we seek what to-morrow we 
shun ; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear, 
nay, even tremble at the iipprehensions of; this was 
exemplified in me, at this time, in the most lively 
manner imaginable; for I, whose only a£9iction 
was that I seemed banished from human society^ 
that I was alone, circumscribed by the boundless 
ocean, cut off, from mankind, and condemned to 
what I called silent life ; that I was as one whom 
Heaven thought not worthy to be nwd[>ered among 
the living, or to appear among the rest of his crea- 
tures ; that to have seen one of my own species 
would liave seemed tome a raising me from death to 
life, and the greatest blessing mat Heaven itself, 
next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could be- 
stow ; I say, that I should now tremble at the very 
apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to 
tmk into the groimd at but the shadow or silent 
^pearance of a man's having set his foot in the 
island. 

Such is the uneven state of human life ; and it 
afforded me a great many cu^ous speculations afler- 
wards, when I had a little recovered my first surprise. 
I considered that this was the station of life the infi- 
nitely wise ai\d eopd providence of God had deter- 
mined fpt me ; that as I could not foresee what the 
^^^ (^divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was 
i^t to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his 
cirdature, had an undoubted right, by creation, to 

govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought 
t ; and who, as I was a creature that had offended 
him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn me 
to what punishment he thought fit ^ and, that it wa%

my part to submit to bear his indigoation, because 
I had sinned against him« I then reflected, that as 
God, who was not only righteous, but omnipotent, 
had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he 
was able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit 
to do so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign 
myself absolutely and entirely to his will, and, on 
the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, 

Sray to him, and quietly to attend the dictates and 
irections of his daily providence. 
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, 
nav, I may say, weeks and months ; and one parti- 
cular efiect of my cogitations on this occasion I 
cannot omit : One morning early, lying in my bed, 
and filled with thoughts about m^ danger from the 
appearances of savages, I found it discomposed me 
very much; upon which these words of the Scripture 
came into my thoughts, '^ Call upon me in the day 
of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shaft 

glorify me.'* Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my 
ed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was 
guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God 
for deliverance : when I had done praying, I took 
up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words 
that presented to me were, ** Wait on the Lord, 
and be of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy 
heart ; wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible 
to express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I 
thankfully laid down the book^ and was no more 
sad, at least on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehepsions^ 
and reflections^ it came into my thoughts one day, 
that all this might be a mere chimera of my own, 
and that lhi3 foot might be the print of my own foot, 
when I cam^ on shore from my boat : this cheered 
me up a little too, md I began to persuade myself 
it was all a delusiou ; that it was nothing else but

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 177 

my own foot: and why might I not come that way 
from the boat, as well as I was going that way to 
the boat? Again I considered also, that I coula by 
no means tell, for certain^ where I had trod, and 
where I had not ; and that if, at last, this was only 
the print of my own foot, I had played the part of 
those fools who try to make stories of spectres and 
apparitions, and then are frightened at them more 
than any body. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad 
again, for I had not stirred out of my castle for three 
days and nights, so that I began to starve for provi- 
sions; for I had little or nothing within doors but 
some barley-cakes and water : then I knew that my 
^oats wanted to be milked too, which usually was 
my evening diversion ; and the poor creatures were 
in great pain and inconvenience for want of it;' and, 
indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost 
dried up their milk. Encouraging myself, there- 
fore, with the belief that this was nothing; but the 
print of one of my own feet, and that I might be 
truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to go 
abroad again, and went to my country-house to mUk 
my flock : but to see with what fear I went forward, 
how often I looked behind me, how I was ready, 
every now and then, to lay down my basket, and 
run for my life, it would have made any one thought 
I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had 
been lately most terribly frightened; and so, in- 
deed, I had. However, as I went down thus two or 
three days, and having seen nothing, I began to be 
a little bolder, and to think there was really nothing 
in it but my own imagination; but I could not 
persuade myself fully of this till I should so down 
to the shore again, and see this print of a toot, and 
measure it by my own, and see if there was any 
similitude or fitness, that I might be assured it was

my ovn foot: but when I came to the place, first) 
it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my 
boat, I could not possibly be on shore any where 
thereabout : secondly, when I came to measure the 
mark with my own foot, I found my foot not so 
large by a great deal. Both these thmgs filled my 
head with new imaginations, and gave me the va- 
pours again to the highest degree, so that 1 shook 
with cold like one in an ague ; and I went home 
again, filled with the belief that some man or men 
had been on shore there; or, in short, that the 
island was inhabited, and I might be surprised be- 
fore I was aware; and what course to take for my 
security I knew not. 

O what ridiculous resolutions men take when 
possessed with fear! It deprives them of the use 
<^ those means which reason ofiers for their relief. 
The first thins I proposed to myself was, to throw 
down my endosures, and turn all my tame cattle 
wild into the woods, lest the enemy should find 
them, and then frequent the island in prospect of 
the same or the like booty ; then to the simple 
thine of digging up my two corn fields, lest they 
should find such a gram there, and still be prompt- 
ed to frequent the island: then to demolish my 
bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges 
of habitation, and be prompted to look rarther, in 
order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subject of the first night*8 cogita- 
tions after I was come home again, while the appre- 
hensions which had so overrun my mind were fresh 
upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above. 
Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more ter- 
rifying than danger itself, when apparent to the 
eyes ; and we find the burthen of anxiety greater, 
by much, than the evil which we are anxious about:

rdtef in this trouble from the resignation I used to 
practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, 
like Saul, who complained not only that the Philis* 
tines were upon him, but that God had forsaken 
him ; for I did not now take due ways to compose 
my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and rest- 
ing upon his providence, as I had done before, for 
my defence and deliverance ; which, if I had done» 
I had at least been more cheerfully supported under 
this new surprise, and perhaps carried tiirough it 
with more resolution. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake 
all night; but in the morning 1 fell asleep; and 
having, by the amusement of my mind, been, as it 
were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very 
soundly, and waked much better composed than I 
had ever been before. And now I began to think 
sedately ; and, upon the utmost debate with myself^ 
1 concluded that this island, which was so exceed- 
ing pleasant, fruitftil, and no farther from the nudn 
land than as I had seen, was not so entirely 'abandon- 
ed as I might imagine ; that although there were no 
stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that 
there might sometimes come .boats off from the 
shok-e, who, either with design, or perhaps never 
, but when they were driven by cross winds, might 
come to this place ; that I had lived here fifteen 
years now, and had not met with the least shadow 
or figure of any people yet ; and that if at any time 
they should be driven here, it was probable they 
went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing 
tiiey had never thought fit to fix here upon any oc- 
easion ; that the most I could suggest any danger 
from, w^s from anv casual at^cidental landing of 
strangling people from the main, who, as it was 
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against 
their wills, so they made no stay here^ but went off

a^ain wiih all possible speed ; seldom staying one 
night on shore, lest they should not have the help 
ef the tides and day-light back again ; and that, 
therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of 
some safe 'retreat, in case I should see any savages 
}and upon the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my 
cave so large as to bring a door through again, 
which door, as I said, came out beyond where my 
fortification joined to the rockz upon maturely con- 
sidering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a 
second fortiiicaiion, in the same manner of a semi- 
circle, at a distance from my ^wall, just where J had 
planted a double row of trees about twelve years be- 
fore, of which I made mention : ^these trees having 
been planted' so thick before, they wanted but few 

Eiles to be driven between them,*^ that they might 
e thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon 
finished : so that I had now a double wall ; and my 
outer wall was thickened with piepes of timber, old 
cables, and every thing I could think of, to make it 
strong ; having in it seven little holes, about as big 
as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of this, 
I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, with 
continually bringing earth out of .my cave, and lay- 
ing it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon it ; 
and through the seven holes I contrived to plant 
the muskets, of which J took notice that I had sot 
seven on shore out of the ship ; these I planted hke 
my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held 
them like a ^ carriage, so that I could fire all the 
seven guns in two minutes time : this wall I was 
many a weary month in finishing, and yet never 
thought myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground with-r 
4>ut my wall, for a ^eat length every way, as full 
with stakes, or sticks, 4>f the osier-like wood, whldf

I found SO apt to grow, as they could well stand ; 
insomuch, that I believe I might set in near twenty 
thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space be- 
tween them and my wall, that I mieht have room 
to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter 
from the young trees, if they attempted to approach 
my outer wall. 

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove ; 
and in five or six years' time I had a wood before my 
dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong, 
that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no 
men, of what kind soever, would ever imagine that 
there was any thing beyond it, much less a habita- 
tion. As for the way which I proposed to m3rself 
to go in and out (for I lefl no avenue), it was by 
setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which 
was low, and then broke in^ and left room to place 
uiother ladder upon that ; so when the two ladders 
were taken down, no man living could come down 
to me without doing himself mischief; and if they 
had come down, they were still on the outside 
of my outer wall. 

Thiis I took all the measures human prudence 
could suggest for my own preservation ; and it will 
be seen, at length,, that they were not altogether 
without just reason ; though I foresaw nothmg at 
that time more than my mere fear suggested to me. 

^Vhile this was doing, I was not altogether care- 
less of my other affidrs; for I had a great concern 
upon me for my little herd of goats i they were not 
only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and 
began to be sufficient for me, without the expense 
of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of 
hunting after the wild ones ; and I was loth to lose 
the advantage of them, and to have them all to 
nurse up over again.

think of but two ways to prjeserve them : one was, 
to fiod iM)Otjl)er convenieDt place to dig a cave under 

Som^i, and to drive then) into it every night ; and 
e other wa^, to enclose two or three little bits of 
land, reo^ote from one another, and as much con* 
Qeided 9S I could, where I might keep about half a 
dozen young goats in each place ; so that if any dis- 
aster }iappened to the flock in general, I might be 
a^le to raise them again with little trouble and 
t^ine: aud this, though it woul4 requiVje a great 
deal of tinpQ and labour, I thought was the most ra- 
tional design. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the 
most retired parts of the islapd ; and I pitched up- 
op ooe, i^icp was as private, indeed, as my heart 
c^uld wish for : it was a litUe damp piece of ground, 
io ^middle of thehoUow^and thick woods, where, 
as is observed) I almost lost myself once before, en- 
deavouring to come back that way from the eastern 
Et of tbe island. Here I found a clear piece of 
d, near three acres, so surrounded with woods, 
that it was almost an enclosure by nature ; at least, 
it did not want near so much labour to make it so as 
the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of 
eicound, and in less than a month's time I had so 
tepced it round, that my flock, or herd, call it which 
yjQU please, who were not so wild now as at first 
they might be supposed to be, were well enough ' 
s^cure^ in it : so, without any farther delay, I re- 
lO.ove^ ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this 
piece ; and when they were there, I continued to 
pjerfect the fence, till I had made it as secure as tlie 
other ; which, however, I did at more leisure, and 
it took me up more time by a great deal. AU this 
labour I was at the expense ofj purely from my ap-

foot which I had seen ; for, euk yet, 1 hevi^^ idy^ an^ 
human creature coihe neai^ the kleixid ; and t had 
now lived two years under this uneateitiei^s, which,* 
indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it 
was before, as may be well ima^med by any who 
knows what it is to live in the constant snare of the 
fear of man. And this I must observe, with grief' 
too, that the discomposUi^e of my mind had too 
great impressions also upon the religious part of m^ 
thoughts: for the dread and terror of felling into the 
hands of sava^ and cannibals lay so upon my sp^irits; 
that I seldom fbund myself in a dtife temper for ap- 
pKcation to my Maker, at least not with th6 s6date 
taiitaness' and resignation of soul which I was woifit 
to do: I rather prayed to God as under ^eat HSlo 
tron aiid presscfre of mind, surrounded With danger^ 
and iff e:3(]^ectation every night of bei^g murdered 
and devomr^d before Aioming ; aAd I must tei^f 
from my ex()er!ence, that a temper of p^ac^y thank^ 
fuhdeiBS, love, and affection, is much th^ mor6^^prope# 
fratiae for prayer than that of tetfof and discompo- 
sure ; and that under the dread 6f mi^ehlef i^pend- 
mg, a man* ia no more fit for a cbi&fortihg jf^erforni- 
imce of the duty of praying to God, ih&k he is' foi* ^ 
repentance on a sick bed ; for these dlscohipo^ure^ 
Aroct the mind, as the others do the body ; ah<lr the 
discomposure of the mni must necessadiy be M 
great a disability as that of the body, and! much 
greater ; praying to God being properly an adt of 
uke mind, not of the body. 

But to go on : after I hadthus secured one part o^ 
my little living stodc, I wei^t about thie whole islahd,' 
searching for another private place to make sucK 
another deposit ; when, wandering more to the west?

glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I 
saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me ; 
and this was so remote, that I could not tell what 
to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes 
were not able to hold to look any longer : whetner 
it was a boat or not, I do not know, but as I descend- 
'ed from the hill I could see no more of it ; so I gave 
it over; only I resolved to go no more out wi^out 
a perspective-glass in my pocket. When I was come 
down the hill to the end of the island, where, in- 
deed, I had never been before, I was presently con- 
vinced that the seeing the print of a man's foot was 
not such a strange tbmg in the island as I imagin- 
ed : and, but that it was a special providence that 
I was cast upon the side of the island where the 
savages never came, I should easily have known 
that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes 
from the main, when they happened to be a little 
too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the 
island for harbour : likewise, as they oilen met and 
fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any 
prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, 
where, according to their dreadful customs, being 
all cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of 
which hereafler. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore as I 
said above, being the S. W. point of the island, I was 
perfectly confounded and amazed ; nor is it possible 
for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing 
the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other 
bones of human bodies; and, particularly, I ob- 
served a place where there had been a fire made, and 
a circle dug in the earth,' like a cock-pit, where I 
supposed the savage wretches had $at down to their 
inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow- 
creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things^.

that I entertained no notions of any datl^er to n^y- 
self frotn it for a long while : all itiy apprehensions 
were buried in &e Sioughts of such a pitch of in- 
human, hellish brutality, and the horror of the de- 
gerieracr^ of human nature, Which, though I had. 
Sbard or it often, yet I never had so near a view of 
before : iil short, I turned away my face from the 
hbrrid spectacle ; my stomach grew sick, and I was 
jitst at- the point of fainting, when nature dis- 
charged the disorder from my stomach ; and hav- 
ing Vomited with uncommon violence, I was a 
little relieved, but could not bear to stay in thcf 
^ace a moment ; so I got me up the hill again with' 
all the speed I could, and walked on towards my' 
own habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the 
island, F stood still awhile, as amazed, and then re- 
(SoVerin^ myself, I looked up with the utmost afiec* 
tfoii of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my 
eyes; gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in 
a part of the world where I was distinguished from 
ifuch dreadful crieaiures as these ; and that, though' 
I had esteemed my present condition very miserable. 
Had yet given me so many comforts in it, that 1 
Had^ still more to give thanks ft)r than to complain 
of: and this, abovie all, that I had, even in this' 
ijiiserable condition, been comforted with the know- 
ledge of Himself, and the hope of His blessing ; 
which was a felicity more than sufficiently equiva- 
lent to'all the misery which I had suffered, or could' 
sbffer. 

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my 
durtle, and be^an to be much easier now, as to the 
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before : 
for 1 observed that these wretches never came to '

any thing here ; and having often, no doubt, been 
up in the covered, woody part of it, without finding 
any thing to their purpose. I knew I bad been here 
now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least 
footsteps of human creature there before ; and I 
might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed 
as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them, 
which I had no manner of occasion to do : it being 
my only business to keep myself entirely concealed 
where 1 was, unless I found a better sort of crea- 
tures than cannibals to make myself known to. 
yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage 
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of tbe 
wretched inhuman custom of then* devouring and 
eating one another up, that I continued pensive and 
sad, and kept close within my own circle, for almost 
two years after this ; when I say my own circle, I 
mean by it toy three plantations, viz. my castle, my 
country-seat, which J called my bower, and my en- 
closure in the woods: nor did I look after this for 
any other use than as an enclosure for my goats ; 
for the aversion which nature gave me to these 
hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of 
seeing 'them as of seeing the Devil himself. I did 
not so much as go to look after my boat all thii 
time, but began rather to think of making me an- 
other ; for I could not think of ever making any 
more attempts to bring the other boat round the 
island to me, lest I should meet with some of these 
creatures at sea ; in which if I had happened to 
have fallen into their hands, I knew what would 
have been my lot. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I 
was in no danger of being discovered by these peo- 
ple, began to wear off my uneasiness cu>out them ; 
and I began to live just in the same composed man- 
ner as before ; only with this difference, that I use4

more caution, and kept my eyes more about me, 
than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen 
by any of them ; and particularly, I was more cau- 
tious of firing my gun, lest any of them being on 
the island should happen to hear it. It was there- 
fore a very good providence to me that I had fur- 
nished myself with a tame breed of goats, and that 
I had no need to hunt any more about the woods^ 
or shoot at them ; and if I did catch any of them 
afler this, it was by traps aiid snares, as I had done 
before : so that for two years after this, I believe I 
never fired my gun once off, though I never went 
out without it; and, which was more, as I had 
saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried 
them out witli me, or at least two of them, sticking 
them in my goat's-skin belt. I also furbished up 
one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, 
aQd made me a belt to hang it on also ; so that I 
"vfaB now a most fortpidable fellow to look at when 
1 went abroad, if you add to the former description 
of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a great 
broad-s^i^prd hanging at my side in a belt, but with- 
out a scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some 
time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be re- 
duced to my former calm sedate way of living. All 
these things tended to show me, more and more, 
how far my condition was from being miserable^ 
compared to some others ; nay, to many other par- 
ticulars of life, which it might have pleased God to 
have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how 
httle repining tliere would be among mankind at 
any condition of life, if people would rather com- 
pare their condition with those that were worse, in 
order to be thankful, than be always comparing 
Uiem with those which are better^ to assist their 
murmurings and complainings.

As IB my present condition there were not really 
many diinas' which' I wanted, so, indeed^ I thought 
that the mghts I had been in about these savage 
wretches,' and the concern I had been iki for my 
own preservation, had taken off the edge Of my in« 
vention fbr my own conveniences'; and I had drop- 
ped' a good* design, which I had once bent my 
thoughts too much upon, and that wje», to try if I 
could' liot make some of my barley into malt, and 
then try to brew myself some beer. This was really 
a whimsical thought, and I reprov^ myself often 
for the simplicity of it ; for I presently saw there 
Would be the want of several thingd necessary to the 
making my beer, that it would be impossible forme 
to supply: as, first> Casks to preserve it in, which 
was a thing that, as I have observed already, I 
could never compass^; no*, tibough I s|)ent not only 
niany days, but weekB> nay, months, m attempting 
it, but to no purpose. In the next ^lace, I had no 
hops to wdke it keep, no yeast to make it work, no 
copper or kettle to make it boil ; and yet, with all 
these thinras wanting, I verily believe, had riot the 
frights and terrors I was in about the savage iirter^ 
vened, I had undertaken it^ and perhaps brought it 
to pass too ; for I seldom gave any thing oVer wilfth- 
out accomplishing it, w&n once I had it in my 
head to begin it. But my invention now rtm quite, 
another way ; for', night and day, I could think of 
nothing but how I might destroy some of these 
monsters in their cruel, bloody entertainment, and, 
if possible, save the victim they should bring hither 
to destroy. It wovdd take up a larger volume than 
this whole work is intended to be, to set down ail 
the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon, 
in my thoughts, for the destroying these dreaturesi 
or at least frightening them so as to preVIInt thdr 
coming hither any mor^t but all this Wai ai>ortive ;•

ROBINSON CRUSOE* 189 

nothing could be possible to take effect, unless I was 
to be mere to do it myself: and what could one 
man do among them, when perhaps there might be 
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts, 
or their bows and arrows, with which they could 
shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun ? 

Sometimes I thought of digging a hole under the 
place where they made their fire, and putting in five or 
six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled 
their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up 
all that was near it : but as, in the first place, I 
should be unwilling to waste so much powder upon 
them,' my store being now within the quantity of » 
one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off 
at any certain time, when it might smrprise them ; 
and, at best, that it would do little more than just 
blow the fire about their ears, and fright them, but 
not sufficient to make them forsake the place : so I 
laid it aside ; and then proposed that I would place 
myself in ambush in some convenient place, with 
my three guns all double-loaded, and, in the middle 
of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when £ 
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three 
at every shot ; and then falling in upon them with 
my three pistols, and my sword, I made no doubt 
but that if there were twenty I should kill them all. 
This fancy pleased mjr thoughts for some weeks ; 
and I was so full of it, that I oflen dreamed of it, 
and sometimes that I was just going to let fly at 
them in my sleep. I went so far with it in my 
imagination, that I employed myself several days to 
find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade, 
as I said, to watch for them ; and I went frequently, 
to the place itself, which was now grown more fa- 
miliar to me : but while my mind was thus filled 
with thoughts of revenge, and a bloody putting 
twenty or thirty of them to the sword, a^ I may c^

hf the horror 1 had ni the place, aod at the sighais 
of the barbarous wretches devouring one sinotiier, 
abetted mj malice. Well, at length, I found a 
plac6 in the side of the hill, where I was satisfied I 
might securely wait till I saw aoj of their boats 
coming : and might then, even before tivey would 
be ready to come on shore, convey myself, unseen, 
into some thickets of trees, iii one of which there 
was a hollow large enough to conceal me entirely ; 
and there I might sit and observe all their bloocfy 
doings, and take my full aun at their heads, when 
they were so close together as that it would be next 
to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that I 
could fail wounding three or four of them at the 
first shot. In this place, then, I resolved to fix my 
design ; and, according^, I prepared two muskets 
and my ordinary fowling-piece* The two mnskeiri 
I loaded whii a brace of slugs each, and four or five 
smaller ballets, about the size of pistol-buIletEr; and 
the fowling.piece I loaded with near a handful of 
swan-shoty of the largest size: I also loaded m 
pistois with about four bullets each ; and in th» 
posture, well provided with ammunition for a second 
and third charge, I prepared myselffor mv expedition 
After I had thtis laid the scheme of my dedgn, 
and, in my imagination, put it in practice, I conti- 
nually made my tour every rooming up to the top' 
of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it,* 
aSyout three miles, or more, to see if I could observe 
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, ot 
standing over towards it : but I began to tire of 
this hard duty, after I had, for two or three months, 
constandy kept my watch, but came always back 
widioutany discovery ; there having not, in all that 
time, been the lieast appearance, not onlv on or 
near the shore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my 
eycB or glasses could readi every way.

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look 
out, so long ^0 I kept up the vigour of my design, 
9nd my spirits seemed to be all the while m a suit- 
able form for so outrageous an execution sb the kill* 
ing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence 
which I had not at all entered into a discussion of 
in my thoughts, any farther than my passions were 
at first fired by the horror I conceived at the un- 
natural custom of the people of that country; who, 
it seems, had been suffisred by Providence, in his 
wise disposition of the world, to have no other 
guide than that of tlieir own abominable and vi^ed 
nassions; and, consequently, were left, and per- 
naps had been so for some ag^, to act such horrid 
things, and receive such dreadful (customs, as no^- 
thing but nature, entirely abandoned by Heaven, 
and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have 
run them into. But now, when, as 1 have said, I 
began to be weary of the fruitless excursion which 
I had made so Ions and so far every morning in vain, 
so my opinion of the action itself began to alter ; 
and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to 
consider what I was going to engage in ; what au- 
thority or call 1 had to pretend to be judge and 
executioner upon these men as criminals, whom 
Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, 
unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the 
executioners of his judgements one upon another. 
How far these people were offenders against me, and 
what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that 
blood which they shed promiscuously upon one an- 
other, I debated this very oflen with myself, thus : 
How do I know what God himself judges in this 
particular case? It is certain these people do not 
commit this as a crime ; it is not against their own 
consciences reproving, or their light reproaching 
them i they do not know it to be an OTOnce^ and

then commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we 
do in almost all the sins we commit. They think 
it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war, 
than we do to kill an ox ; nor to eat human flesh, 
than we do to eat mutton. 

When I considered this a little, it followed neces* 
sarily that I was certainly in the wrong in it ; that 
these people were not murderers in the sense that I 
had before condemned them in my thoughts, any 
more than those Christians were murderers who 
often put to death the prisoners taken in battle ; or 
more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole 
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, 
though they threw down their arms and submitted. 
In the next place, it occurred to me, that although 
the usage they gave one another was thus brutish 
and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me ; these, 
people had done me no injury: that if they at- 
tempted me, or I saw it necessary, for my imme- 
diate preservation, to fall upon them, something 
might be said for it ; but that I was yet out of their 
power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and 
consequently no design upon me ; and therefore it 
could not be just for me to fall upon them : that 
this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in 
all their barbarities practised in America, where 
they destroyed millions of these people : who, how- 
ever they were idolaters and barbarians, and had 
several bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, 
such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were 
yet, as to the S])aniards, verv innocent people ; and 
that the rooting them out of the country is spoken 
of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation by 
even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by 
all other Christian nations in Europe, as a mere 
butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, 
unjustifiable either to God or man ; and for which

the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be fVight- 
ful and terrible to all people of humanity, or of Christ- 
tian compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain were par<* 
ticularly eminent for the produce of a race of men 
who were without principles of tendeniess^ or the 
common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reck-* 
oned to be a mark of generous temper in the mind* 
These considerations really put me to a pause, 
and to a kind of a full stop ; and I began, by little 
and little, to be off my design, and to conclude I 
had taken wrong measures in my resolution to at- 
tack the sauages ; and that it was not my business 
to meddle with them, unless they first attacked me; 
and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent; 
but that if I were discovered and attacked by them, 
I knew my duty. On the other hand, I argued with 
myself, that this really was the way not to deliver 
myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for 
unless I was sure to kill every one that not only 
should be on shore at that time, but that should 
ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of them 
escape to tell their country-people what had hap* 
pened, they would come over again by tliousands to 
revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only 
bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at 
present, I had no manner of occasion for. Upon 
the whole, I concluded^ that neither in principle 
nor in policy, I ought, one way or other, to concern 
myself^ in tnis affair : tliat my business was, by all 
possible means, to conceal myself from them, and 
not to leave the least signal to them to guess by 
that there were any living creatures upon the 
island, I mean of human shape. Religion joined 
in widi this prudential resolution ; and I was con- 
vinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly out 
of my duty when I was laying all my bloody 
schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures>

from Heaven to do it, in def<»iGe of my own life* 

In this disposition I continued for near a year 
ai^er this; and so far was I from desiring an occasion 
for falling upon these wretches, that in all that time 
I never once went up the hill to see whether there 
were any of them in sight, or to know whether any cf 
them had been on shore there of not, that I might not

presence of mind enough to do what I might have 
done ; much less what now, after so much consi- 
deration and preparation, I might be able to do. 
Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I 
would be very melancholy, and sometimes it would 
last a great while ; but I resolved it all, at last, into 
thankmlness to that Providence which had deli<^ 
vered me from so many unseen dangers, and had 
kept me from those mischiefs which I could ^ave no 
way been the agent in delivering myself from, be- 
cause I had not the least notion of any such thing 
depending, or the least supposition of its being 
possible. This renewed a contemplation which oftea 
nad come to my thoughts in former time, when 
first I began to see the merciful dispositions of 
Heaven, in the dangers we run through in this life ; 
how wonderfully we are delivered when we know, 
nothing of it ; how, when we are in (a quandary, 
as we call it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to go 
this way, or that way, a secret hint shall direct ua 
this way, when we intended to go that way : nay, 
when sense, our own inclination and perhaps bu- 
siness, has called to go the other way, yet a strange 
impression upon the mind, from we know not what 
springs, and by we know not what power, shall 
overrule us to eo this way ; and it shall afterwards 
appear, that had we gone that way which we should 
have gone, and even to our imagination ouffht to 
have gone, we should have been ruined and lost* 
Upon these, and many like reflections, 1 afterwards, 
made it a certain rule with me, that whenever I 
found those secret hints or pressings of mmd, to 
doing or not doing any thing that presented, or go« 
ing this way or that way, I never failed to obey the 
secret dictate ; though I knew no other reason for 
it than that such a pressure, or such a hint, hung 
upon my mind. I could give many examples of the

in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, 
I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of 
it, would be so hardy as to venture in ; nor, indeed, 
would lany man else, but one who, like me, wanted 
nothing so much as a sate retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a 
ereat rock, where by mere accident (I would say, if I 
did not see abundant reason to ascribe all such things 
now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick 
branches of trees to make charcoal ; and, before I 
gp on, I must observe the reason of my making 
this charcoal, which was thus : 1 was afraid of ma- 
king a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; 
and yet Icbuld not live thef e without baking my breads 
cooking my meat, &c. ; so I contrived to bum some 
wood here, as I had seen done in England, under 
turf, till it became chark, or dry coal : and then 
putting the fire out» I preserve^ the coal to carry 
nome, and perform die other services for which fire 
was wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is 
by the by :— While I was cutting down some wood 
here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch 
of low brush-wood, or under-wood, there was a 
kind of hollow place : I was curious to look in it» 
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I 
found it wa^ pretty large : that is to say, sufficient 
for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another 
with me : but I must confess to you that I made 
more haste out than I did in, when, looking farther 
i^to the place, and which was perfectly dark, i saw 
two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether 
devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two 
stars ; the dim light from the cave's mouth shining 
directly in, and making the reflection. However, 
after some pause, I recovered myself, and began to 
call myself a thousand fools, and to think, that he 
that was afraid to see the devil was not fit to live

twenty years in an island all alone ; and that I might 
well think there was nothing in this cave that was 
more frightful than myself. Upon this, plucking 
up my courage, I took up a firebrand, and ip I rushed 
again, with the stick flaming in my hand : J had 
not gone three steps in, but I was almost as much 
frightened as I was before ; for I heard a very loud 
sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was fol- 
lowed by a broken noise, as of words half-expressed^ 
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and 
was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put 
^e into a cold sweat ; and if I had had a hat on my 
head, I will not answer for it, that my hair- might 
not have lifted it o£ But still j^lucking up my spirits 
as well asl could^and encouragmg myseli a little with 
considering that the power and presence of God 
was every where, and was able to protect me, upon 
this I stepped forward again, and by the light of 
the firebrand, holding it up a little over my. head, I 
saw lying on the ground a most monstrous, fright- 
ful, old he-goat, just making his will, as we say, 
and gasping for hfe ; and dving, indeed, of mere 
old age« I stirred him a little to see if I could get 
him out, and he essayed to set up, but was not able 
to raise himself; and I thought with myself he might 
even lie there ; for if he had frightened me, so he 
would certainly fright any of the savages, if any of 
them should be so hardy as to come in there while 
he had any life in him. 

I was now recovered firom my surprise, and began 
to look round me, when I found the cave was but 
very small, that is to say, it might be about twelve 
feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round 
nor square, no hands having ever been employed in 
ipaking it but those of mere Nature. I observed 
also that there was a place at the farther side of it 
that went in further^ but was so low that it required

I gave it over for that time ; but resolved to come 
again the next day, provide wtdi candles asid m 
tinder-box, which 1 had made of the lock of one of 
the muskets, with some wild-fire in the pan. 

Accordingly, the' next day I came provided wi^ 
six large candles of my own making (for I made verjr 

good candles now of goat's tallow, but was hai^ sel^ 
>r candle-wick, itting sometimes rags or rope-yalm»i 
and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like neft^ 
ties) ; and going into this low pkce, I was obliged 
to creep upon adl fours, as I have ^d, almost ten- 
yards ; which, by the way, I thought was a venture 
bold enough, eonsidering^ that I raiew not how fiHr 
it might go^ nor what was beyond it» When I had 
got through the strdit^ I found' the roof rose higher 
up, I believe near twenty feet ; but never was sudv 
a glorious sight seen in the island^ I dare sily, as itt 
wasy to look round liie sid^s and roof of this vault 
or eave; the wall reflected ita hundred tbiMisanA 
lights to me fifom my two candles. What itwas in^ 
tiie mdky whether diamonds, of any other precious* 
stoned, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be> T 
knew not. The place I was iii was a most delights 
ful cavity or grotto of its kind, as could be expeobed^ 
though perfectly dark ;. the floor was dry and teveV 
and had a sort of a small loose gravel upoii it, so' 
that there was no nauseous or yenomous creatiiire to' 
be seen, neither was there any damp or wet on the 
sides or roof: the only difficulty in it war the en*' 
trance ; which, however, as it was a piiacd of seou^ 
iiity, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thou^ that 
was a convenience ; so that I was really rejoiced at 
liie discovery, and resolved, without aofy dday» to 
bring some of. tiiose things^ which' I was mdsl ami-

bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my 
spare arms, viz. two fowling pieces, for I had three 
in all, and three muskets, for of them I had eight in 
alh: so I kept at my castle only five, which stood 
ready-mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my out- 
most fence ; and were ready also to take out upon 
any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing 
my ammunition, I happened to open the barrel of 

Sowder which I took up out of the sea, and which 
ad been wet ; and I found that the water had pe- 
netrated about three or four inches into the powder 
on every side, which, caking and growing hard, had 
preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell ; so 
that I had near sixty pounds of very good powder 
in the centre of the cask : this was a very agreeable 
discovery to me at that time ; so I carried all away 
thiiiier, never keeping above two or three pounds 
of powder with me in my castle, for fear of a sur- 
prise of any kind : I also carried thither all the lead 
1 had left for bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient gi- 
ants, which were said to live in caves %nd holes in 
the rocks, where none could come at them ; for I 
persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hun- 
dred savages were to hunt me, they could never find 
' me out ; or, if they did, they would not venture to 
attack me here. The old goat, whom I found expir- 
ing, died in the mouth of the cave the next day after 
I made this discovery : and I found it much easier 
to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover 
him with earth, than to drag him out ; so I interred 
him th(jre, to prevent ofience to my nose. 

X was now in the twenty-third year of my residence 
in this island ; and was so naturalized to the place, 
and the manner of living, that could I have but en- 
joyed the certainty that no savages would come to 
the place to disturb me, I could have been content

to hate G^pkulated fot spending the rest of ifiy tinie 
there, even to the last moment, till I had laad me 
down and died, like the old goat in the eave. i had 
also arrived to some little diversions and amusensentSt 
which made the time pass a great deal more plea-' 
aantly with me than it did before : as, first, I bad 
taugnt my Poll, as I noted before, to speak^ and he 
did it so familiarly, and talked so artici^tely and 
plain, that it was very pleasant to me ; for I believe 
no bird ever spoke plainer ; and he lived with me 
no less than six-and*twenty years: holv long he 
might have lived afterwards I know not, though 1 
know they have a notion in the Brazils that tiiey 
live a hundred years. My dog was a very pleasant 
and loving companion to me for no less than six* 
teen years of my thne, and then died of mere old age# 
As for my cats, they multiplied, asl have observed, to 
thatdegree, that f was obliged to shoot several of them 
&t first, to keep them from devouring me and -all I 
had; but at length, when the two old ones I brought 
with me were gone, and afler some time continuaUy 
driving fhem^om me, and letting them have no pro^ 
visiolti with me, they all ran wSd into the woo^ 
except tv^o or three favourites, which I kept tame, 
^d whose young, when they had any, I idways 
downed ; and these were part of my family. Be- 
sides these, I always kept two or three household 
kids about me, whom I fiaught to feed out of my 
hand ; and I had two more parrots, which talked 
pretty well, and would all cful Robin Crusoe, bat 
none like my first ; nor, indeed did I take the pains 
with any of them that I had done with him. . I had 
also several tame sea-fowls, whose names I knew 
not, that I catight upon the shore, and cut their 
wings ; and the little stakes which I had planted

trecsy und teod there, which was very agreeable to 
me ; ao ihat^ as I said above, I began to be very well 
coMtented with the life I led, if I could have been 
secured from the dread of the savages. But it was 
Olherwtae directed ; and it may not he amiss for all 
people who shall meet with my story, to make this 
just ohs^^atioQ froip it, viz. How frequently, in 
the caurse of our lives, the evil which in itseif we 
^»ek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen 
into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentinies the 
fery means or door of our deliverance, by which 
alone we eaa be raised again from the Affliction we 
•re fallen intia. I could give many examples of 
thja in the course of my imaccountable life ; but in 
nothing was it more partieularly remarkfdble than 
m the circuipstances pf my last years of sditary re* 
sjdoace in this isliM^d. 

It was DHOW the mondi of Dee^mbor, as I said 
above, in mv twenty^thkd year ; and this, being the 
«Mitbern aolUtiQ^ (for winter { cannot c^l it), was 
tbe particular time of my harvest, and required my 
bi^g pretty much abroad in the fields : when going 
e«it pretty early in the morning, even before it was 
thorough day-light, I was surprised with seeing a 
li^t of some fire upon the shore, at a distance mrni 
ipe of about two miles, towards the end of the island 
where 1 bad observed some savages had been, as be- 
fi>re, and not on the other side ; but, to my great 
i|ffliction, it was on my side of the island. 

1 wm indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and 
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out, 
lest I might be surprised ; and yet I had no more 
peace within* from the apprehensions I had that if 
these savages, in rambling over the island, should 
find my com standing or cut, or anjr of my works 
and improvements, they would immediately conclude 
that there were people in the phice, Bnd would (hen.

never give over till they had found me oat. In this 
extremity, I went back directly to my castle, pulled 
up the ladder afler me, and made all things without 
look as wild and natural as I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in 
a posture of defence : I loaded all my cannon, as I 
called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were 
mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pis- 
tols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp; 
not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the 
divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to 
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I 
continued in this posture about two hours; and 
beg^ to be mighty impatient for intelligence 
abroad, for I had no spies to send out. After sit; 
ting awhile longer, and musing what I should do in 
this, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any 
longer ; so setting up my ladder to the side of the 
hill, where there was a nat place, as I observed be- 
fore, and then pulling the ladder up after me, I set 
it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill ; and 
pulling out my perspective-glass, which I had taken 
on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the 
ground, and began to look for the place. I pre- 
sently found there was no less than nine naked sa- 
vages, sitting round a small fire they had made, not 
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the 
weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to 
dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh, 
which they had brought with them, whether alive 
or dead I could not tell. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had 
hauled up upon the shore ; and as it was then tide 
of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the return of 
the flood to go away again. It is not easy to ima- 
gine what confusion this sight put me into, espe- 
cially seeing them come on my side of the island, 

Digitized by CjOOgle 



ROBINSOlf CROSOE. 205 

and so near me too ; but when I considered their 
coining must be always with the current of the ebb, 
I began, aftei-wards, to be more sedate in my mind, 
being satisfied diat I might go abroad with safety 
ail the time of the tide of flood, if they were not 
on shore before ; and having made this observation, 
I went abroad about my harvest-work with the 
more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved ; for as soon as the 
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take boat, 
and row (or paddle, as we call it) away. 1 should 
have observed, that for an hour or more before they 
went off, they went a-dancing ; and I could easily 
discern their postures and gestures by my glass. I 
could not perceive, by my nicest observation, but 
that they were stark naked, and had not the least 
covering upon them ; but whether they were men 
or women, I could not distinguish. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took 
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my 
girdle, and my ^eat sword by my side, without a 
scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make, 
went away to the hill where I had discovered the 
first appearance of all ; and as soon as I got thither, 
which was not in less than two hours (for I could 
not go apace, being so loaden with arms as I was), 
I perceived there had been three canoes more of sa« 
vages at that place ; and looking out farther^ I saw 
thev were all at sea together, making over for the 
mam. This was a dreadful sight to me, especially 
as, going down to the shore, I could see the marks 
of horror, which the dismal work they had been 
about had lef); behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, 
and part of the flesh, of human bodies, eaten and 
devoured by those wretches with merriment and 

rrt. I was so filled with indignation at the sight,

ihe next that I saw there» ]et them be whom or hoir 
many soev^. It seemed e¥ident to me that tlie 
visits whidi they made thiis to this island were not 
very freq^ueat, tor it was above fifteen months be- 
€ore any more of them came on shore there again ; 
that is to say, X neither saw them, nor any footsteps 
or signals of them, in all thai time ; for, as to die 
rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come 
abroad, at l«ast not so fare yet all this while I 
lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant ap*- 
prehensions of their coming upon me by surprise : 
from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil 
is more bitter tiiaa the suffering, especially if tbere 
is no room to shake off that expectation, or those 
i^prehensions. ^ 

During all this time I was in the murdering hu- 
mour, and took up moal of m^ hours, which should 
have been better employed, in contriving how to 
circumvent and fall upon them, the very next time 
I ^ould see them ; especially if they, should be di- 
vided, as they were the last time, into two parties : 
nor did I consider at all, that if 1 killed one party, 
suppose ten or a dozen, I was still the next day, or 
week, or month, to kill another, and so another, 
even ad infinitum, till I diould be at length no less 
a murderer than they were in being man-eaters, and 
perhaps much more so. I spent my days now in 
great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that 
I should, one day or otJier, fall into the hands of 
these merciless creatures ; and if I did at any time 
ventmre abroad, it was not without looking round 
me with the greatest care and caution imaginable. 
And now I found, to my great comfort, how hanpy 
it was that I provided for a tame flock or herd of 
goats ; for I durst not, upon any account, fire my 
gun, especially near that side of the island where 
Aey usually came, lest I should alarm the savages ;

and if they had fled from me now, I was sore ttf 
bare them eome again, with perhaps two or threes 
hundred canoes with them, in a few days, and tfven 
I knew what to expect. However, I wore ou< n 
year and three months more before I ever saw any 
more of the savages, and then I found them agaiin^ 
as I shall soon observe. It it true, they might have 
heen there once or twice, but either they made nd 
stay, or at least I did not see them : but in the 
month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in 
my fbur-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange 
encotinter with them; of which in its place. 

'Fhe p«rtuvfoation of my mind, daring this fifteenf 
or sixteen months' interval, was very great ; I slept 
tnrquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often 
started out of my sleep in the night : m the day^ 
great troubles overwhelmed my mind ; and in the 
night, I dreamed often of killing the savag^es, and 
of the reasons why I might justify the doing of it.

but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up 
with very serious thoughts aibt)ut my present condi- 
tion, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I 
thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a sur- 
prise quite of a different nature from any I had 
net with before ; for the notions this put mto my 
thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up 
in the greatest haste imaginable, and, in a trice, 
clapped my ladder to the niiddlef pJace of the rock, 
and pulled it after me ; and mounting it the second

time) ^ot to the top of the hill the very moment 
that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun, 
which accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard ; 
and, by the sound, knew that it was from that part 
of the sea where 1 was driven down the current in 
my boat. I immediately considered that this must 
be some ship in distress, and that they had some 
comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired 
these guns for signals of distress, and to obtain 
help. I had the presence of mind, at that minute, 
to think, that though I could not help them, it 
might be they might help me : so I brought toge- 
ther all the dry wood I could get at hand, and mak- 
ing a good handsome pile, 1 set it on fire upon the 
hill. The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and 
though the wind blew ver^ hard, yet it burnt fairly 
out ; so that I was certain, if there was any sucn 
thing as a ship, they must needs see it; and no 
doubt they did ; for as soon as ever my fire blazed 
up I heard another gun, and after that several 
others, all from the same quarter. I plied my fire 
all night long, till day-break; and when it was 
broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw something 
at a great distance at sea, full east of the island, 
whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no, 
not with my glass ; the distance was so great, and 
the weather still something hazy also ; at least, it 
was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon 
perceived that it did not move ; so 1 presently con- 
cluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being 
cagei*) you may be sure, to be satisfied, 1 took my 
gun in my hand, and ran towards the south side of 
Sie island, to the rocks where 1 had formerly been 
carried away with the current; and gettmg up

SIO ADVBNTURE5 OF 

As all these were but conjectures at. best, so, in 
the condition I was in, I could do no more than 
look on upon the misery of the poor men, and pitjr 
them ; which had still this good effect on my side, 
that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks 
to God, who had so happily and comfortably pro- 
vided for me in my desolate condition; and that of 
two ships' companies who were now cast away upon 
this part of the .world, not one life should be spared 
but mine. I leaoied here again to observe, that it 
is very rare that the providence of God casts us into 
any condition of life so low, or any misery so great, 
but we may see something or other to be thankful 
for, and may see others in worse circumstances than 
our own. Such certainly was the case of these 
men, of whom I could not so much as see room to 
suppose any of them were saved: pothing could 
make it rational so much as to wish or expect that 
they did not all perish there, except the possibility 
only of their being taken up by another ship in com- 

fany; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for 
saw not the least sign pr appearance of any sqch 
thing. I cannot explain by any possible energy of 
words, what a strange longing or hankering of de- 
sires I felt in my soul upon this sight, breaking out 
sometimes thus— O that there had been but one or 
two, nay, or but one soul, saved out of this ship, to 
have escaped to me, that I might but have had one 
companion, one fellow-creature to have spoken to 
me, and to have conversed with ! In all the time of 
my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a 
desire after the society of my fellow-creatures^ or 
so deep a regret at the want of it. 

There are some secret moving springs in the af- 
fections, which, when they are set a-going by some 
object in view, or, though not in view, yet rendered 
present to the mind by the power of imagination^

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 211 

tiiat motion cames out the soul, by its impetuosity, 
to such violent, eager embracings of the object,* that 
the absence of it is insupportable. Such were these 
earnest wishings that but one man had been saved. 
I believe I repeated the words, O that it had been 
but one ! a thousand times ; and my desires were so 
moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands 
would clinch together, and my fingers would press 
the palms of my hands, so that if I had had any soft 
thing in my hand, it would have crushed it involun- 
tarily ; and the teeth in my head would strike toge- 
ther, and set against one another so strong, that 
for some time 1 could not part them again. Let 
the naturalists explain these things, and the reason 
and manner of them ; all I can say to them is, to 
describe the fact, which was even surprising to me, 
when I found it, thoueh I knew not from whence 
it proceeded : it was doubtless the effect of ardent 
wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, 
realising the comfort which the conversation of one 
of my fellow-Christians would have been to me. — 
But it was not to. be ; either their fate or mine, or 
both, forbade it : for, till the last year of my bein^ 
on this island, I never knew whether any were saved 
out of that ship or no ; and had onlv the affliction, 
some days afler, to see the corpse of a drowned boy 
come on shove at the end of the island which was 
next the shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a 
seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen 
drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to 
direct me so much as to guess what nation he was 
of: he had nothing in his pockets but two pieces- 
of-eight and a tobacco-pipe ; — the last was to me of 
ten times more value than the first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to ven« 
ture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but 
I might find something on board that might be use-

f ul to me: but that did act altogether pr^ss me to 
much as the possibility that there might be yet some 
living creature on board, whose life I might not only 
save, but might, by saving that Hie, comfort my 
own to the last degree ;. and this thought clung. soT 
1;o my heart, that I couHnot be quiet night or day»* 
but I must venture out in. my boat on board tm» 
wreck ; and committing the rest taGod's^ovidence, 
I thought the impression was so strong upon »^ 
mind that it could not be resisted^ that it must come 
from some invisible direction, and that I should be 
wanting to myself if I did no go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened- 
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my 
voyage, took a quuitity of bread,, a great pet o£ 
fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle m rum. 
(for I had still a- great deal of that left), and » 
basket of raisins : and thus, loading myself with 
every thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got 
the water out of her, put her afloat, loaaed all my 
cargo in her, and then went home again for nqret 
My second cargo was a- great bag of rice, the um- 
brell& to set up over my head for a shade, another 
large pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of 
my smtall loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before,, 
with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese: all which, 
with great labour and sweat, I canried to my boat;, 
and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out;. 
and rowing, or paddling, the canoe along the ^ore, 
came at last to the utmost point of the island on^ 
the north*east side. And now I waa to lauAch out 
into the ocean, and either to venture or not to veil* 
ture. I looked on the rapid currents, which ran. 
constantly on both sides of the island at a distance^ 
and which were very terrible to me, from the re- 
membrance of the hazard I had been in before, and 
my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw thai if 1'

was driven into either of those currents, I should 
be carried a great way out to sea^ and perhaps out 
of my reach, or sight of the island again ; and that 
then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale 
of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I be- 
gan to give over my enterprise ; and having hauled 
my boat into a little creek on the shore, 1 stepped 
out, and sat me down upon a rising bit of ground, 
very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire, 
about my voyage ; when, as I was musing, I could 
perceive tliat me tide was turned, and the flood 
come on ; upon which my going was impracticable 
for so many hours Upon this, presently it occur- 
red to me, that I should go up to the highest piece 
of ground I could find, and observe, if 1 could, how 
th^ sets of the tide, or currents, lay when the flood 
came in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven 
one way out, I might not expect to be driven an- 
other way home, with the same rapidness of the 
currents. This thought was no sooner in my head 
than I cast mv eye upon a little hill, which sufficient- 
ly overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence 
I had a clear view of the currents, or sets of the 
tide, and which way 1 was to guide myself in my 
return. Here I found, that as the current of the 
ebb set out close by the south point of the island, 
so the current of the flood set in close by the shore 
of the north side ; and that 1 had nothing to do but 
to keep to the north side of the island in my return, 
and I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the 
next morning, to set out with the first of the tide ; 
and reposing myself for the night in my canoe, 
under the great watch-coat 1 mentioned, I launched 
out. 1 first made a little out to sea, full north, till 
I began to feel the benefit of the current^ which set

fastward, and which carrbd me at a great rate^ 
and yet did not so humr me as the current on thtf 
south side had done before, so as to take from me 
all government of the boat ; but having a strong 
steerage with my paddle, 1 went at a great rate (M- 
rectly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I 
came up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at : 
the ship, which, by its building, was Spanish, stuck 
fast jammed m between two rocks ; all the stem 
and quarter of her were beaten to pieces with the 
sea : and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks^ 
had run on with great violence^ her mainmast and 
foren^st were brought by the board,, that i» to say, 
broken short off; but her bowsprit was sounds and 
the head and bow appeared firm. When I came 
close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me 
coming, yelped and cried ; ami as soon ajs I called 
him, jumped into the sea to come to me ; I took lam 
into the boat, but £»und him almost dead with bun- 

fer and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, and 
e devoured it like a ravenous wolf that bad been 
starving a fortnight in the snow s I then gave tfae 
poor creature some ireA water, witb winch^ if I 
would have let him, he would have burst himself. 
After this, 1 went en board ; but the fmt sight I 
met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, 
or forecastle of the ship, with their aitos fast about 
one another. 1 concluded, as is indeed probable^ 
that when the ship struck, it being in a stcMfm, the 
sea broke so high, and so continually over her, thai 
the men were not able to bear it, and were strsm- 
gkd with the constant rushing in ef the water, as 
much as if they had been under water. Besides the 
dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had Mfe ; 
nor any gQods» that I could see, but what were 
spoiled by the water. There were some casks of 
liquor, whether wine ov brandy I knew not, wUck

lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being 
ebbed out, I could see ; but they were too big to 
meddle with. J saw several chests, which 1 believed 
belonged to some of the seamen ; and I got two of 
them into the boat, without examining what was 
in them. Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and 
the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might 
have made a good voyage ; for, by what I found in 
these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship 
had a great deal of wealth on board ; and, if 1 may 
guess from the course she steered, she must have 
been bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la 
Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the 
Brazils, to the Havanna, in the Gulf of Mexico, 
and so periiaps to Spain. She had,, no doubt, a great 
treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to any 
body ; and what became of her crew, I then knew 
not, 

I feund, besides these chests, a little cask full of 
liquor, of ahout twenty gallons, which I got into 
my boat with much difficulty. There were several* 
iBuskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, 
with aboat four pounds of powder in it ; as for the 
musjcets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, 
but took the powder-horn. 1 took a fire-shovel and 
toags, which I wanted extremely; as also two little 
brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and 
a gridiron: and with this cargo, and the dog, ( 
eame away, the tide beginning to make home again; 
and the same evening, about an hour within night, 
I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to 
the last degree. I reposed that night in the boat; 
and in the morning 1 resolved to harbour what I 
had got in my new cave, and not carry it home to 
ray castle. After refreshing myself, 1 got all my 
cargo on shore, and began to examine the particu- 
lars. The cask of liquor I foand to be a kind of

rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils, and» 
in a word, not at all good ; but when I came to 
open the chests, I found several things of great use 
to me : for example, I found in one a fine case of 
bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with 
cordial waters, fine and very good ; the bottles held 
about three pints each, and were tipped with silver. 
I found two pots of very good succades, or sweet- 
meats, so fastened also on the top, that the salt water 
had not hurt them ; and two more of the same, 
which the water had spoiled. I found some very 
good shirts, which were very welcome to me ; and 
about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs 
and coloured neckcloths; the former were also very 
welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe my 
face in a hot day. Besides this, when I came to the 
till in the chest, I found there three great bags of 
pieces-of-eight, which held about eleven hundred 
pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapped ujp in a 
paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars 
.or wedges of gold ; I suppose they might all weigh 
near a pound. In the other chest were some clothes^ 
but of little value ; but, by the circumstances, it . 
must have belonged to iJie gunner's mate ; though 
there was no powder in it, except two pounds of 
fine glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I 
suppose, for charging their fowling-pieces on occa- 
sion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this 
voyage that was of any use to me ; for, as to the 
money, 1 had no manner of occasion for it ; it was 
to me as the dirt under my feet; and I would have 
given it all for three or four pair of English shoes 
and stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, 
but had none on my feet for many years. I had in- 
deed got two pair of shoes now, which I took off 
the feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the 
wreck, and I found two pair more in one of the 

Digitized by CjOOgle 



BOBIHSOK CEDSOE. 217 

chests, which were veij welcome tp me; but they 
were not like our English shoes, eiUier for ease Or 
service, bein^ rather what we call pumps than shoes. 
I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces-of- 
eight in rials, but no gold : I suppose this belonged 
to a poorer man than the other, which seemed to 
belong to some officer. WeU, however, I lugged 
this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I 
had done that before which I brought from our 
own ship : but it was a great pity, as I said, that 
the other part of the uiip had not come to my 
dhare; for 1 am satisfied 1 might have loaded my 
canoe several times over with money; and, thought 
I> if I ever escape to England, it might lie here safe 
enough till I may come again and fetch it. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and 
secured Uiem, I went back to my boat, and rowed 
or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, 
where 1 laid her up, and made the best of my way 
to my old habitation, where I found every thing 
safe and quiet. I began now to repose myself, live 
. after my old fiishion, and take care of my family 
afBiirs ; and, for a while, I lived easy enough, only 
that I was more viplant than I used to be, looked 
out oflener, and did not go abroad so much ; and 
if at any time I did stir with any fireedom, it was 
always to the east part of the island, where 1 was 
pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and 
where I could go without so man3r precautions, and 
such a load of anris and ammunition as I always 
carried with me if I went the other way. I lived 
in this condition near two years ,more ; but my un- 
lucky head, that was always to let me know it was 
bom to make my body miserable, was all these two 
years filled with projects and designs, how, if it 
were possible, I might get away from this island : 
lor, sometimes I was for midciag another voyage to

the wreck, though my reason told me that there 
was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voy- 
age; sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes 
another; and I believe verily, if I had had the boat 
that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured 
to sea, bound any where, I knew not whither. I 
have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to 
those who are touched with the general plague of 
mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of 
their miseries flow ; I mean that of not being satis^ 
fied with the station wherein God and nature hath 
placed them : for, not to look back upon my pri- 
mitive condition, and the- excellent advice of my fa- 
ther, the opi>08ition to which was, as I may call it, 
my original siriy my subsequent mistakes of the same 
kind had been the means of my coming into this 
miserable condition; for had that Providence, which 
so happily seated me at the Brazils, as a planter, 
blessed me with confined desires, and I could have 
been contented to have gone on gradually, 1 might 
have been, by this time, I mean in the time of my 
being in this island, one of the most considerable 
planters in the Brazils; nay, I am persuaded, that 
by the improvements I had niade in that little time 
I lived there, and the increase I should probably 
have made if I had' remained, I might have been 
worth a hundred thousand moidores: and what 
business had I to leave a settled fortune, a well- 
stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to 
turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch negroes, when 
patience and time would have so increased our stock 
at home, that we could have bought them at our 
own door from those whose business it was to fetch 
them ; and though it had cost us something mo 
yet the difference of that price was by no means 
worth savinff at so great a hazard? But as this is 
usually the tate of young heads, so reflection upon

the folly of it is as commonly the exercise of more 
yeacs, or of the dear-bought experience of time : 
so it was with me now ; and yet so deep had the 
mistake taken root in my temper, that T could not 
satisfy myself in my station^ but was continually 
poring upon the means and possibiUty of my escape 
from this place : and that 1 may, with the greater 
pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part 
of my story, it may not be improper to give some 
account ot my first conceptions on the subject of 
this foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and 
upon what foundation, I acted. 

I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, 
after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid . 
up and secured under water, as usual, and my con- 
dition restored to what it was before ; I had more 
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at 
all the richer ; for I had no more use for it than the 
Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came 
there. , 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in 
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first set- 
ting foot in this island of solitude, I was lying in 
my bed, or hammock, awake ; very well in health, 
had no pain, no distemper^ no uneasiness of body, 
n<Mr any uneasiness of mind, more than ordinary, 
but could by no means close m^ eyes, that, is, so as 
to sleep ; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise 
than as follows :— It is impossible to set down the 
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled through 
that great thorough-fare of the brain, the memory, 
in this night's time : I ran over the whole history 
of my life in miniature, or by abridgement, as I may 
call it, to my coming to this island, and also of 
that part of my life since I came to this island. In 
my reflections upon the state of my case since i came 
on shore on this island, I was comparing the happy 
u2

^20 ADVEITTURIS OF 

posture of my B^Mn in the fint y^^oK of my habitat 
tlon here, compared to the life or aiudety> fear, and 
care, which I had lived in, ever since I had seen tlie 
print of a foot in the sand ; not that I did not be* 
lieve the savages had frequented the island even all 
the while, and might have been several hundreds of 
them at times on shore there ; but I had never known 
it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about 
it : my satisfaction was p^ect, though my danger 
wite the same, and I was as happy in not knowmg 
my dan^r as if I had never really been exposed to 
it. This furnished my thoughts with many very 
profitable reflections^ andparticularly this one : How 
infinitely good that Providence is, which has pro- 
vided, in its government of mankind, such narrow 
beiUnds to his sight and knowledge of things ; and 
though he walks ill the midst of so many thousand 
duigers, the sight of which, if discovered to him, 
womd distract his mind and iKnk his spirits, he is 
kiept serene and calm, by having the events of things 
Md from his eyes, and knowing nothing of tibe dan- 
gers which surround him. 

After these thoughts had for some time enter- 
tained me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real 
danger I had been in for so many years in this very 
island, and how I had walked about in the greatest 
security, and with all possible tranquillity, even 
when perhaps nothing but the brow of a hill, a great 
tree, or the casual approach of night, had been be- 
tween me and the worst kind of destruction, viz. 
that of falling into the hands of cannibals and sa- 
vages, who would have seized on me with the same 
view as I would on a goat or a turtle, and have 
thought it no more a crime to kill and devour iHe, 
than I did of a pigeon 6r curlew. I would tmjustly 
i^ftfider myself, if I should say I was not sincerely 
diAidkfttl to my great Preserveri to whose singular 

Digitized by CjOOgle 



BOBIMSOK CRUSOE. 221 

protection I acknowledged, with great humility, all 
these unknown deliverances were due, and without 
which I must inevitably have fallen into their mer- 
ciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for 
some time taken up in considering the nature of 
thes^ wretched creatures, I mean the savages, and 
how it came to pass in the world, that the wise Go- 
vernor of all things should give up any of his crea- 
tures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so 
much below even brutality itself, as to devour its 
own kind : but as this ended in some (at that time) 
fruitless speculations, it occurred to me to inquire, 
what part of the world these wretches lived in ? 
how far off the coast was, from whence they came? 
what they ventured over so far from home for ? 
what kin^ of boats they had ? and why I might 
not order myself and my business so, that I might 
be as able to go over thither as they were to come 
to me? 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider 
what I should do with myself when I went thither; 
what would become of me, if I fell into the hands 
of the savages ; or how I should escape from them, 
if they attacked me ; no, nor so much as how it 
was possible for me to reach the coast, and not b6 
attacKed by some or other of them, without any 
possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not 
* fall into Uieir hands, what I should do for provision, 
or whither I should bend my course : none of these 
thoughts, I say,* so much as came in my way ; but 
my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my 
passing over in my boat to the main .and. I looked 
upon my present condition as the most miserable 
that could possibly be ; that I was not able to throw 
myself into any thing, but death, that could be 
called worse ; and if I reached the shore of the 

Digitized by LaOOgle 



22S ADTBHTUEBS OV 

ntatn, I might perhaiM meet with relief, ot I nuht 
coast along, as I did on the African shore, tul I 
came to some inhabited country, and where I might 
find some relief; and after all, perhaps, I might 
fall in with some Christian ship ^at might take me 
in ; and if the worst came to the worst, I could 
but die, which would put an end to all these mise- 
ries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a 
disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made despe- 
rate, as it were, bj die long continuance of my 
troubles, and the dissappointments I had met in the 
wreck I had been on board of, and where I had been 
so near obtaining what I so earnestly longed for, 
viz. somebody to speak to, and to learn some know- 
ledge from them of the place where I was, and of 
the probable means of my deliverance, I was agi- 
tated wholly by these thoughts : all my calm of 
mind, in my resignation to Providence, and waiting 
the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to 
be suspended ; and 1 had, as it were, no power to 
turn my thoughts to any thins but to the project 
of a voyage to the main ; which came upon me with 
such force, and such an impetuosity of desire^ thai 
it was not to be resisted. 

When this had i^tated my thoughts for two 
hours or more, with such vic^ence that it set mj 
very blood into a fermient, and my pulse beat, as if 
I had been in a fever, merely with die extraordi- 
narv fervour of my mind about it, nbture, as if I 
had been fotigued and exhausted with die very 
thought of it» direw me into a so&nd sleep. One 
wv)ttld have thought I should have dreamed of it» 
but I did not, nor of any thing relating to it : but 
I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning, 
an usual, from my casde, I saw upon the shore two 
canoes and eleven savages coming to land, and that 
they brought with them another savage, whom

ROBimoil emoaoE. 295 

diey i^ere going to kill, in order to eat him ; when, 
on a sudden, the savage that the j were going to kill 
jumped away» and ran for his Ine; and I thought, 
m my sleep, that he came running into my little 
thick grove before my fortification, to hide himself; 
and that I, seeing him alone, and not perceiving 
that the others sought him that way, ^ewed myself 
to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged himt 
that he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me 
to assist him; upon which I shewed him my ladder,, 
made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and 
he became my servant: and that as soon^as I had 
got this man, I said to myself. Now I may certainly 
venture to the main land ; for this fellow will serve 
me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and- 
whither to go for provisions, and whither not to go 
fw fear of being devoured; what places to venture 
into, and what to shun. I waked with this thought; 
and was under such inexpressible impressions of joy 
at the prospect of my escape in my oream, that the. 
disappointments which I felt upon coming to my* 
self, and findingthat it was no more than a dream, 
were equally extravagant the other way, and threw- 
me into a very ereat dejection of spirits. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion; 
that my only way to go about to attempt an escape 
was, if possible, to get a savage into my possession; 
and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners 
whom tney had condemned to be eaten, and should 
bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were 
attended with this difficulty, that it was impossMe 
to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of 
diem, and killing them ail ; and this was not only 
a very desperate attempt, and might miscarry, bot^ 
on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the law* 
luhiess of it to mvself; and my heart trembled at 
the thoughts of sheddhig so much bloody Aeogfa it

was for my deliverance. I need not repeat the ar- 
guments which occurred to me against this, they 
being the same mentioned before: but though [ 
had other reasons to offer now, viz. that those men 
were enemies to my life, and would devour me if 
thev could; that it was self-preservation, in the 
hignest degree; to deliver myself from this death of 
a me, and was actine in my own defence as much 
as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; 
I say, though these things argued for it, yet the 
thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliver- 
ance were very terrible to me, and such as I could 
5r no means reconcile myself to for a great while, 
owever, at last, after many secret disputes with 
myself, and afler^great perplexities about it (for all 
these arguments, one way and another, struggled 
in my head along time), the eager prevailing desire 
of deliverance at length mastered all the rest ; and 
I resolved, if possible, to get one of those savages 
into my hands, cost what it would. My next thmg 
was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed was 
very difficult to resolve on : but as I could pitch 
upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put 
myself upon the watch, to see them when they 
came on shore, and leave the rest to the event; 
taking such measures as the opportunity sould pre* 
sent, let what would be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set my* 
self upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed 
so often, that I was heartily tired of it ; for it was 
above a year and a half that I waited; and for 
great part of that time went out to the west end, 
and to the south-west comer, of the island^ almost 
•very day, to look for canoes, but none appeared* 
Ttaa was very discouraging, and began to trouble 
me much ; though 1 cannot say that it did in this 
case (as it had done some time before) were off the

ROBINSON CRUflOI. 2SS 

edge of my desire to flbe thing ; but the longer it 
seemed to oe delayed, the more eager I was for it: 
in a word I was not at first so careful to shun the 
sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by 
them, as I was now eager to be upon them. Be- 
sides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, 
tw6 or three savages, if I had them, so as to make 
them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should 
direct them, and to prevent their being able at any 
time to do me any hurt. It was a great while that I 
pleased myself with this afiair ; but nothing still pre- 
sented; all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, 
for BO savages came near me for a great while. 

About a year and a half after 1 entertained these 
notions (and by long musing had, as it were, re- 
solved them all into nothing, for want df an occa- 
sion to put them into execution), I was surprised, 
one morning early, with seeing no less than five 
canoes all on shore together on my side the island, 
and the people who belonged to them all landed, 
and out of my sight. The number of them broke all 
my measulres; for seeing so many, and knowing that 
they always came four or six, or sometimes more, in 
a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how 
to take my measures, to attack twenty or thirty 
men single-handed; so lay still in my castle, per- 
plexed and discomforted: however, I put myself 
mto all the same postures for an attack that I had 
formerly provided, and was just ready for action, 
if any thing had presented. Having waited a good 
while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at 
length, being very impatient, J set my guns at the 
foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of 
the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, 
however, that my head did not appear above the hill,

that they were no less than thirty in number; that 
they had a fire kindled, and that they had meat 
dressed. How they had cooked it 1 knew not, or 
what it was ; but they were all dancing, in I know 
not how many barbarous gestures and figures, their 
own way, round the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by 
my perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from • 
the boats, where it seems, they were laid by, and 
were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived 
one of them immediately fall, being knocked down^ 
1 suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for that was 
their way, and two or three others were at work im- 
mediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while 
the other victim was lefl standing by himself, till 
they should be ready for him. In that very moment, 
this poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, 
and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes of li&/ 
and he started away from them, and ran with incre- 
dible swiftness along the sands, directly towards me, 
I mean towards that part of the coast where my ha^ 
bitation was. I was dreadfully frightened, 1 must 
acknowledge, when I perceived him run my way, 
and especially when, as 1 thought, I saw him pur- 
sued by the whole body : and now 1 expected that 
part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he 
would certainly take shelter in my grove : but I 
could not depend by any means upon my dream ' 
for the rest of it, viz. that the. other savages would 
not pursue him thither, and find him there. How- 
ever, 1 kept my station, and my spirits began to re- 
cover, When I found that there was not above three 
men that followed him; and still more was I encou- 
raged when 1 found that he outstripped them ex- 
ceedingly in running, and gained ground of them ; 
BO that if he could but hold it for half an hour, I 
saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 227 

There was between them and my castle the creek, 
which I mentioned often in the first part of my story, 
where I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this 
I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the 
poor wretch would he taken there : but when the 
savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of 
it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in, 
swam through in about thirty strokes, or there- 
abouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength 
and swiftness. When the three persons came to the 
creek, I found that two of them could swim, but 
the third could not, and that standing on the other 
side, he looked at the others, but went no farther, 
and soon after went sofUy back a^ain ; which, as it 
happened, was very well for him in the end. I ob« 
served, that the two who swam were yet more tlian 
twice as long swimming over the creek as the fellow 
was that fled from them. It came now very warmly 
upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that 
now was the time to get me a servant, and perhaps 
a companion or assistant, and that I was called 
plainly by Providence to save this poor creature's 
life. I immediately ran down the ladders with all 
possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they 
were both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed 
above, and getting up again, with the same haste, 
to the top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and 
having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed 
myself in the way between the pursuers and the pur- 
sued, holloing aloud to him that fled, who, look- 
ing back, was at first, j>erhaps, as much frightened 
at me as at them; but i beckoned with my hand to 
him to come back; and, in the mean time, I slowly 
advanced towards the two that followed ; then rush- 
ing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down 
with the stock of my piece. I was loth to fire, 
because I would not have the rest hear ; though, at

that distance, it would not have been easily heard» 
and being out of sight of the smoke too, they would 
not have easily known what to make of it. Having 
knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued 
him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and t 
advanced apace towards him ; but as I came nearer, 
I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and 
was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then neces* 
aitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and kill- 
ed him at the first shot. Tlie poor savage who fled 
but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies 
fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was so fright- 
ened with the fire and noise of my piece, that he 
stood stock-still, and neitlier came forward nor went 
back-ward, though he seemed rather inclined still 
to fly, than to ceme on. I holloed again to him, 
and made signs to come forward, which he easily 
understood, and came a little way ; then stopped 
again, and then a little farther, and stopped again; 
and I could then perceive that he stooa trembling, 
as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been 
to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned 
to him again to come to me, and gave him all the 
signs of encouragement that I could think of; and 
he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten 
or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgement for sav- 
ing his life. I smiled at him, and looKed 'pleasantly, 
and beckoned to him to come still nearer: at length 
he came close to me ; and then he kneeled down 
again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon 
the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my 
foot upon his head ; this, it seems, was in token of 
sweanng to be my slave for ever. I took him up, 
and made much of him, and encouraged him all I 
could. But there was more work to do yet ; for I 
perceived die savage whom I knocked down was not 
Killed, but stonnM with the blow, and began to

come to himself: so I pointed to him, and shewed 
him the savage, that he was not dead; upon this 
he spoke some words to me, and though I could 
not understand them, yet I thought they were plea^ 
sant to hear; for they were the first sound of a 
man's voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for 
ahove twenty-five years. But there was no time for 
such reflections now ; the savage who was knocked 
down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the 
ground, and I perceived that my savage began to 
be afiraid ; but, when I saw that, I presented my 
4>ther piece at the man, as if I would shoot him : 
upon tnis my savage, for so I call him now, made 
a. motion to me to lend him my sword, whidi hung 
naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He no 
sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at 
one blow, cut ofP his head so cleverly, no execu- 
lioner in Germany could have done it sooner or bet* 
ier ; which I thought very strange for one who, I 
had reason to believe, never saiw a sword in his life 
before, except their own wooden swords : however, 
it seems, as I learned afterwards, they make their 
wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is 
$o hard> that they will cut off heads even with them, 
aye and arms, and that at one blow too. When 
he had done this, he comes laughing- to me, in sign 
of triumph, and broueht me the sword asain, 
and with abundance of gestures, which I did not 
understand, laid it down with the head of the sa« 
vage that he had killed, just before me. But that 
which astonished him most, was to know how I 
killed the other Indian so fur off: so pointing to 
him, he made signs to me to let him go to mm ; 
so 1 bade him go, as well as I could. When be 
came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at 
him, turning him first on one side, then on the 
other, looked at the wound the bullet had made,

which, It seems, was just in his breast, where it had 
made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had 
followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was 
quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and 
came back ; so I turned to go away, and beckoned 
him to follow me, making signs to him that more 
might come after them. Upon this, he made signs 
to me that he should bury them with sand, that 
they might not be seen by the rest, if they foll<»wed; 
ana so i made signs to him again to do so. He fell 
to work; and, in an instant, he had scraped a hole 
in the sand with his hands, big enough to bury the 
first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered 
him; and did so by the other also : I believe he had 
buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then 
calling him away, I carried him, not to my castle, 
but quite away to my cave, on the farther part of 
the island : so I did not let my dream come to pass 
in that part, viz. that he came into my grove for 
shelter. Here I gave him bre&d and a bunch of rai- 
sins to eat, and a draught of water, which I found 
he. was indeed in great distress for, by his running; 
and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go 
and lie down to sleep, showing him a place where 
I had laid some rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, 
which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so 
the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep. 

He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well 
made, with straight strong limbs, not too large, 
tall, and well shaped; and, as 1 reckon, about 
twenty-six years of age. He bad a very good coun- 
tenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed 
to have something very manly in his face i and yet 
he had all the sweetness and softness of an European 
in his countenance too, especially when he smiled. 
His hair was long and black, not curled like wool ; 
his forehead very high and large ; and a great viva-

cifyand sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour 
of bis skin was not quite black, but very tawny ; 
and yet not an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, a» 
the Brazilians and Virginians, and other natives of 
America are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive co- * 
lour, tliat had in it something very agreeable, though 
not very easy to describe. His face was round 
and plump ; his nose small, not flat like the Negroes ; 
a ver}' good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth weU 
set, and as white as ivory. 

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about 
half an hour, he awoke again, and came out of the 
cave to me^ for I had t>een milking my goats, which 
I had in the enclosure just by : when he espied me, 
he came running to me, laying himself down again 
upon the ground, with all the possible signs 
of an humble thankful disposition, making a 
great many antic gestures to show it. At last, 
he lays his head flat upon the ground, close to my 
foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he 
had done before ; and after this, made all the signs 
to me of subjection, servitude, and submission, ima* 
ginable, to let me know how he would serve me so 
long as he lived. I understood him in many things, 
and let him know I was very well pleased with him. 
In a little time I began to speak to him, and teach 
him to speak to me ; and, first, I let him know his 
name should be Friday, which was the day I saved 
his life: I called him so for the memory of the 
time. I likewise taught him to say. Master ; and 
then let him know that was to be my name : I like- 
wise taught him to say Yes and No, and to know the 
meaning of them. 1 gave him some milk in an 
eartlien pot, and let him see me drink it before him, 
and sop my bread in it ; and gave him a cake of 
bread to do the like, which he quickly complied 
with| and made signs that it was very good for him. '

I kept there with him all that night; but as soon 
88 it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, 
and let him know I would give him some clothes ; 
at which he seemed very glad>for he was stark naked. 
As we went by the place where he had buried the 
two men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed 
me the marks that he had made to find them again^ 
making sisns to me that we should dig them up 
again, and eat them. At this I aroeared v^y an- 
gry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I 
would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned 
with mv hand to him to come away ; which he did 
immediately, with great submission. I then led 
him up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies 
were gone ; and pulling out my glass, I looked, 
and saw plainly the place where they had been, but 
no appearance of them or their canoes ; so Chat it 
was plain they were gone, and had left their two 
comrades behind them, without any search after them* 
But I was not content with this discovery ; but 
having now more courage, and consequently more 
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving 
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows 
at his back, which I found he could use very dexter- 
ously, making him carry one gun for m6, and I two 
for mjTself ; and away we marched to the place where 
these creatures had been ; for I had a mind now to 
get some fuller intelligence of them. When I came 
to the place, my very blobd ran chill in jaj veinsy 
and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the 
spectacle ; indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least 
it was so to me, thoush Friday made nothing of it. 
The place was covered with human bones, the ground 
dyed with their blood, and great pieces of flosh left 
here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched; 
and, in short, all the tokens of Uie triumphant feast 
they had been making there, after a victory over

their enemies. I saw three sculls, five hands, and 
the bones of three or four legs and feet, and 
abundance of other parts of the bodies ; and Fri-> 
day, by his signs, made me understand tliat they 
brought over four prisoners to feast upon;* that 
three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing 
to himself, was the fourth ; that there had been a 
great battle between them and their next king, 
whose subjects, it seems, he bad been one of^ and 
that they had taken a great number of prisoners ; all 
which were carried to several places by those who 
had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon 
them, as was done here by these wretches upon those 
they brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the sculls, bones, 
flesh, and whatever remained, and4ay them together 
' in a heap, and make a great fire upon it, and bum 
them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hanker- 
ing stomach after some of the desh, and was still a 
cannibal in his nature ; but I discovered so much ab- 
horrence at the very thoughts of it; and at the 
least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it : 
for 1 had, by some means, let him know, that I 
would kill him if he offered it. 

When he had done this, we came back to our 
castle ; and there I fell to work for my man JPriday : 
and, first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers, 
which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I men- 
tioned, which I found m the wreck ; and which, 
with a little alteration, fitted him very well: and 
then I made him a jerkin of goat's-skin, as well as 
my skill would allow (for 1 was now grown a toler- 
able good tailor) ; and I gave him a cap, which I 
made of hare's-skin, very convenient and fashionable 
enough : and thus he was clothed for the present, 
tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see 
himself almost as well clothed as his master* It is

true, he went awkwttPklj in these clothes at first ; 
wearing the drawers was very awkward to him, and 
the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders, and 
the inside of his arms; but a little easing them 
where he complained they hurt him, and using him- 
self to them, he took to dbem at length very well. 

The next day after I came home to my hutch with 
him, I began to consider where I should logde him i 
and that I might do well for him»and ^et be perfectly 
easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacant 
place between my two fortification8,in the inside ofthe 
hist and in the outside of the firet. As there was a 
door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal 
framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, and 
set it up in the passage, a little within the ^itrance ; 
and causing the door to open in the inude, I barred 
it up in the night, taking in my ladders too ; so 
that Friday could no way come at me in the inside 
ef my innermost wall, without making so much 
noise in getting over that it must needs waken me ; 
for my first wm had now a com{^ete roof over it of 
kmg poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to 
die side of the hill; which was again laid across with 
smisdler sticks, instead of laths, and then thatched 
over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which 
' was strongs like reeds ; and at the hole or place 
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, 1 had 
placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been at» 
tempted on the outside, would not have opened at 
all, but would kave fallen down, and imke a great 
noise : as to weapons, I took them all into my side 
every night. But I needed none of all this |M!ecau * 
tion; for never man had a more faithful, loving, sin- 
cere servant, than Friday was to me ; without pas- 
sions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and 
engaged ; his very affections were tied to me, like 
those of a child to a fitther ; and I dare say, he would

fasre sacrificed hfis life for the saving mhie, upon any 
occasion whatsoever : the many testimonies he gave 
me of this put it out of doubt, and- soon convinced 
me that I needed to use no precautions, as to my 
safety on his account. 

Tliis frequently gave me occasion to observe, and 
diat ^th wonder]! Uiat however it had pleased God, 
in his providence, and in the government of the 
works of his hands, to take from so great a part of 
the world of his creatures the best uses to which 
their faculties and the powers of their souls are 
adapted, yet that he has bestowed upon them the 
same powers, the same reason, the same affections, 
ftbe same sentiments of kindness and obligation, the 
same passions andnreseDtments of wrcmgs, the same 
aense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the ca-^ 
pacities of doing good) andreceivinggood,diathe has 
given to us; and that when he pleases to offer them oc- 
casioDs of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more 
ready, to apply them to the nght uses for which Uiey 
were bestowed, than we are. This made me very me- 
k&choly sometimes, in r^ecting, as the several oc* 
casions presented, how mean a use we make of aH 
these, even though we ha^e these powers enlightened 
by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God» 
md by the loiowledge of his word added to our un- 
derstanding ; and why it has pleased God to hide 
the Hke saving knowledge from so many ttiiUi<Mis of 
souls, whoy if I mieht judge by this poor savage, 
would make a much better use of it than we £d. 
From hence^ I sometimes was led too far, to invade 
flhe sovereignty of Providence, and as it were arraign 
ihe justice of so arbitrary a di4>08ition of things, that 
should hide that light from some, and reveal it to 
others, and yet expect a like duty from both ; but 
I «hut it up, and checked my thoughts with this 
oondusicm: first, That we ^iid not know by what

light and law these should be condemned ; but that 
as God was necessarily, and, by the nature of his 
being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be, 
but if these creatures were all sentenced to ab- 
sence from himself, it was on account of sinning 
against that light, which, as tlie Scripture says, 
was a law to themselves, and byisuch rules as their 
consciences would acknowledge to be just, though 
the foundation was not discovered to us ; and, 
secondly, That still, as we all are the clay in the hand 
of the potter, no vessel could say to him, Why hast 
thou formed me thus ? 

But to return to my new companion: — I was 
greatly delighted with him, and made it my business 
to teach him every thing that i«as proper to make 
him useful, handy, and helpful ; but especially to make 
him speak, and understand me when I spoke: and 
he was the aptest scholar that ever waJB; and par- 
ticularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and 
• so pleased when he could but understand me, or make 
me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to 
talk to him. Now my life began to be so easy, that 
I began to say to myself, that could I but have been 
safe from more savages, I cared not if I was never 
to remove from the place where I lived. 
' After I had been two or three days returned to 
my castle, I thought that, in order to brinff Friday 
off iVom his horrid way of feeding, and n'om the 
relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him 
taste other flesh ; so I took him out with me one 
morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intend- 
ing to kill a kid out of my own flock, and brine it 
home and dress it; but as I wiis going, I saw a she- 
goat lying down in the shade, Hind two young kids sit- 
ting by her. I catched hold of Friday ;— Hold, said I; 
stand still ; and made signs tb him not to stir : im- 
mediately I presented iny pieqe, shot/ and lulled one

of the kids. The poor cre8ture» who had, at a dis** 
tance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, 
but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was 
done, was sensibly surprised, trembled and shook, 
and looked so amassed, that I thought he would 
have sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, 
or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waist- 
coat, to feel whether he was not wounded ; and, as 
I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill 
him : for he came and kneeled down to me, and 
embracing my knees, said a great many things I did 
not understand ; but 1 could easily see the meaning 
was, to pray me not to kill him. ^ 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would 
do him no harm ; and taking him up by the hand, 
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had 
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which 
be did : and while he was wondering, and looking to 
see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun 
a^ain. By and by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, 
sitting upon a tree, within Snot ; so, to let Friday 
understand a little what I would do, I called him to 
me again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a 
parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I 
say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to 
Uie ground under the parrot, to let him see I would 
make it fall, I made him understand that I would 
shoot and kill that bird ; accordingly, I fired, and 
bade him look, and immediately be saw the parrot 
fiedb He stood like one frightened again, notwith- 
standing all I had said to him ; and I found he was 
the more amazed, because he did not see me put 
any thing into the gun, but thought that there 
must be some wondenul fund of death and destruc- 
tion in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or 
any thing near or far off; and the astonishment 
this created in him was such, as could not wear off

ibr a long time ; and I believe, if I would have let 
him, he would have worshipped me and my gun* 
As for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch 
it for several days afler ; but he would speak to it, 
and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he 
was by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of 
him, was to desire it not to kill him. Well, after 
his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed 
to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which 
he did, but staid some time ; for the parrot, not be- 
ing quite dead, had fluttered away a good distance 
from the place where she fell : however, he found 
her, took her up, and brought her to me ; and as I 
had perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I 
took this advantage to charge the gun again, and 
not to let him see me do it, Siat I might be ready 
for any other mark thaf might present: but n^ 
thine more offered at that time : so I brought home 
the kid, and the same evening I took the skin off, 
and cut it out as well as I could ; and having a pot 
£t for that purpose, 1 boiled or stewed some of the 
flesh, and made some very good broth. Afler I had 
begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who 
seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well ; but 
that which was strangest to him, was to see me eat 
bait with it. He maae a sign to me that the salt 
was not good to eat ; and putting a little into his 
own mouth, be seemed to nauseate it, and would' 
spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh 
water after it : on the other hand, I took some meat 
into my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit 
and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done 
at the salt ; but it would not do ; he would never 
eare for salt with his meat or in his broth ; at 
least, not for a great while, and then but a very little* 
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and brothi

ing a piece of the kid : this I ^d, by hanging it be- 
fore the fire on a string, as I had seen many people 
do in ]g)ngland, setting two pples up, one on each 
side of the fire, and one across on the top, and ty- 
ing the string to the cross stick, letting the meat 
turn continumly. This Friday admired very much ; 
but when he came to taste the flesh, he took so 
many ways to tell me how well he liked iti, that I 
could not but understand him : and at last he told 
me, as well as he could, he would never eat 
man's flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day, I set him to work to beating some 
com out, suid sifting it in the manner I used to do, 
as I observed before ; and he soon understood how 
to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen 
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make 
bread of it j for after that 1 let him see me make 
my bread, and bake it too; and in a little time Fri- 
day was able to do all the work for me, as well as 
I could do it myself. 

I began now to consider, that having two mouths 
to feed instead of one, 1 must provide more ground 
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn 
than I .used to do ; so I marked out a larger piece 
of land, and began the fence in the same manner as 
before, in which Friday worked not only very will- 
ingly and very hard, but did it venr cheerfully : and 
I told him what it was for ; that it was for corn to 
make more bread, because he was now with ;ne, 
and that I might have enough for him and myself 
too. He appeared very sensible of that party and 
let me know that he thought I had much more la- 
bour upon me on his account, than I had for my- 
self; and that he would work the harder for me, if 
I would tell him what to do.

in this place ; Friday begaii to talk pretty well, and

undentand the names of almost einery thing I had 
occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send 
him to, and talked a ereat deal to me ; so t(hat, in 
short, 1 began now to have some use for my tongue 
again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for 
before, that is to say, about speech. « Besides the 
pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular satis- 
faction in the fellow himself: his simple unfeigned 
honesty appeared to me more and more every day, 
and I began really to love the creature; and, on his 
side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible 
for him ever to love any thing before* 

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering 
inclination to his own country again ; and having 
taught him English so well that he could answer 
me almost any question, I asked him whether the 
nation that he belonged to never conquered in 
battle ? At which he smiled, and said> Yes, yes, we 
always fight the better : that is, he meant» always 
get the better in fight ; and so we began the follow* 
ing discourse : 

Master, You always fight the better; how came 
you to be taken prisoner then, Friday ? 

Friday, My nation beat much, for all that. 

Master, How beat? If your nation beat them, 
how came you to be taken ? 

Friday, They more many than my nation in the 

place where me was; they take one, two, three, 

and me ; my nation over-beat them in the yonder 

> place, where me no was ; there my nation tase one, 

two, great thousand. 

Master, But why did not ^our side recover you 
from the hands of your enemies then ? 

Friday, They run one, two, three, and me, and 
make go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe 
that time. 

Master, Well, Friday, and what does your na-

tioQ do with the men they take ? Do they carry 
them away and eat them, as these did ? 

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up. 

Master. Where do they carry them ? 

Friday. Go to other place, where they think. 

Master. Do they come hither ? 

Friday, Yes, yes, diey come hither ; come other 
else place. 

Master. Have you been here with them ? 

Friday. Yes, I have been here ; (points to the 
N. W. side of the island, which, it seems, was their 
side.) 

By this I understood that my man Friday had for- 
merly been among the savaees who used to come on 
shore on the farther part of the. island, on the same 
man-eating occasions he was now brought for ; and, 
some time after, when I took the courage to carry 
him to that side, being the same I formerly men- 
tioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he 
was there once when they eat up twenty men, two 
women, and one child : he could not tell twenty in 
English, but he numbered them, by laying so many 
stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them 
over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces 
what follows ; that after I had this discourse with 
him, I asked him how far it was from our island to 
the shore, and whether the canoes«were not often 
lost. He told me there was no danger, no canoes 
ever lost ; but that, after a little way out to sea, 
there was a current and wind, always one way in 
the morning, the other in the aft;emoon. This I 
understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, 
as going out or coming in ; but I aft;erwards tinder- 
stood it was occasioned by the great draft and re- 
flux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or 
golf of which nver, as I found afterwards, our

island lay; and' that this land which I perceived to 
the W. and N. W. was the great island Trinidad, on 
the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked 
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the 
inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations 
were near : he told me all he knew with the grieat- 
est openness imaginable. I asked him the names of 
the several nations of his sort of people, but could 
get no other name than Caribs : from whence I 
easily understood, that these were the Caribbees, 
which our maps place on the part of America which 
reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to 
Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told me 
that up a great way beyond the- moon, that was, 
beyond the setting of the moon, which must be west 
from their country, there dwelt white bearded men, 
like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I 
mentioned before ; and that they had killed much 
liians, that was his word: by all which I under- 
stood, he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in 
America had been spread over the whole country, 
and were remembered by all the nations from 
father to son. ' 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go 
from this island and get among those white men : 
he told me. Yes, yes, you may go in two canoe. I 
could not understand what he meant, or make him 
describe to me what he meant by two canoe ; till, 
at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant it 
must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This 
part of Friday 8 discourse began to relish with me 
very well ; and from this time I entertained some 
hopes that, one time or other, I might find an op- 
portunity to make my escape from this place, and 
that this poor savage might be a means to help me* 

During the long time that Friday had now been 
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and

understand me, I was not wanting to lay a founda- , 
tion of religious knowledge in his mind : particular- 
ly J asked him one time, who made him ? The poor 
creature did not understand me at all, but thought 
I had asked him who was his father : but I took it 
up by another handle, and asked him who made the 
sea, the ground we walked on, and the hills and 
woods ? He told me, it was one old Benamuckee, 
that lived beyond all ; he could describe nothing of 
this great person, but that he was very old, much 
older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the 
moon or the stars. I asked him then, if this old 
person had made all things, why did not all things 
worship him ? He looked very grave, and with a 
perfect look of innocence said, All things say O to 
him. I asked him if the people who die in his 
country went away any where ? He said. Yes ; they 
all went to Benamuckee : then I asked him whether 
these they eat up went thither too ? He said. Yes. 
From these things I began to instruct him in the 
knowledge of the true God : I told him that the 
great Maker of all things lived up there, pointing 
up towards heaven ; that he governed the world by 
the same power and providence by which he made 
it; that he was omnipotent, and could do every 
thing for us, give every thing to us, take every thing 
from us ; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. 
He listened with great attention, and received with 
pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to 
redeem us, and of the manner of making our prayers 
to God, and his being able to hear us, even in heaven. 
He told me one day, that if our God could hear us 
up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater God 
than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way 
off, and yet could not hear till they went up to the 

feat mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. 
asked him if ever he went thither to speak to

244 ADVENTURES OF 

him ? ile said, No ; they never went that were 
young men ; none went thither but the old men, 
whom he called their Oowokakee; that is, as I 
made him explain it to me, their religious, or 
clergy ; and that they went to say O (so ne oalled 
saying prayers), and tnen came back, and told them 
what Benamuckee said. By this I observed, that 
there is priestcraft even among the most blinded, 
ignorant pagans in the /world ; and the policy of 
making a secret of religion, in order to preserve the 
veneration of the people to the clerey, is not only 
to be found in the Roman, but peraaps among all 
religions in the world, even among the most brutish 
and barbarous savages. 

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man 
Friday ; and told him, that the pretence of their old 
men going up to the mountains to say O to their 
god Benamuckee was a cheat ; and their bringing 
word from thence what he said was much more bo ; 
that if they met with any answer, or spake with any 
one there, it must be with an evil spirit : and then 
I entered into a long discourse with him about the 
devil, the original of him, his rebellion against 
God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting 
himself up in the dark parts of the world to be 
worshipped instead of 6od, and as God, and the 
many strataj^ems he made use of to delude mankind 
to their ruin ; how he had a secret access to our 
passions and to our affections, and to adapt his 
snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to 
be our own tempters, and to run upon our destruc- 
tion by our own choice. 

I found it was not so easy to imprint right no- 
tions in his mind about the devil, as it was about 
the being of a God : nature assisted all my argu- 
ments to evidence to him even the necessity of a. 
great First Cause, and overruling, governing rower*

ROBINSON CRUSOE. %i5 

a secret, directing Providence, and of the equity and 
justice of paying homage to him that made us, and 
the like ; but there appeared nothing of this kind 
in the notion of an evil spirit ; of his original, his 
being, his nature, and, above all, of his inclinatioa 
to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too : and the 

Eoor creature puzzled me once in such a manner, 
y a question merely natural and innocent, that I 
scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talk- 
ing a great deal to hiip of the power of God, his 
omnipotence, his aversion to sin, his being a con- 
suming fire to the workers of iniquity ; how, as he 
had made us all, he could destroy us and all the 
world in a moment; and he listened with great 
seriousness to me all the while^ After this, I had 
been telling him how the devil was God's enemy in 
the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill 
to defeat the good designs of Providence, and to 
ruin the kingdom of Christ in the world, and the 
like. Well, says Friday, but you say God is so 
strong, so great; is he not much strong, much 
might as the devil ? — Yes, yes, says I, Friday, God 
is stronger than the devil : God is above the 
devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him 
down under our feet, and enable us to resist his 
temptations, and quench his fiery darts. — But, says 
he again, if God much stronger, much might as the 
devil, why God no kill the devil, so make him no 
more do wicked ? I "Vf as strangely surprised at this 
question ; and, after all, though 1 was now an old 
man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill qualified 
for a casuist, or a solver of difBculties ; and, at first, 
I could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to 
hear him, and asked him what he said ; but he was 
too earnest for an answer, to forget his question, so 
that he repeated it in the very same broken words as 
Above. By this time I had recovered myself a little,

and I satd, Grod will at last puiuflh him severely ; 
he is reserved for the judgment, and is ta be cast 
into the bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting 
fire. This did not satisfy Friday ; but he returns 
upon me, repeating my words, Reserve at last: me 
no undeiBtand ; but why not kill the devil bow ; 
not kill great ago ? — You may as well adc me, said 
I, why Grod does not kill you and me, when we do 
wicked things here that offend him ? We are pre- 
served to repent and be pard(med. He mused some 
time on this : Well, well, says he, mighty affec- 
tionately, diat well : so you, L, devil, all wicked, 
all preserve, repent, God pardon alL Here I w«s 
run down again by him to ^e last degree ; and it 
was a testimony to me, how the mere notions of na- 
ture, though they will guide reasonable creatures to 
the knowledge of a Gcd^andof a worship or homage 
due to the supreme being ofGod,asthe consequence 
of our nature, yet nodiing but divine revelation can 
form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of redemp- 
tion purchased for us, of a Mediator of the new co- 
venant, and of an Intercessor at the footstool of 
God's tlurone; I say, nothing but a revelation from 
Heaven caA form these in the soul ; and that, there* 
fore, the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus 
Christ, I mean the Wo>d of God, and the Spirit of 
G^d, promised for the guide and sanctifier of his 
people, are the absolutely necessary instructors of 
the souls of men in liie saving knowledge of Grod, 
and the means of salvation. 

I therefore diverted the present discourse between 
me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some 
sudden occasion of going out ; then sending him for 
something a good way off, I seriously prayed to Gad 
that he would enable me to instruct aaving^ tUs 
poor sava^ ; asasting, by his Spirit, tke heart of 
the poor ignorant creatme to receivie the light «f

|he knowledge of God in Christ, reeoncilii^ him to 
hioaselfy ^4 would guide me to speak so to him from 
the word of God, as his conscience might be con- 
vinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When 
he came again to me, I entered into a lon^ discourse 
with him upon the subject of the redemption of man 
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of 
the gospel preached from heaven, viz. of repentance 
towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I 
then explained to him, as well as I could, why our 
blessed Redeemer took not on him the nature of 
aagds, but the seed of Abraham ; and how, for that 
reason, the fallen angds had no share in the redemp- 
tion ; that he came only to the lost sheep of the 
house of Israel, and the like. 

I had, God knows, more sincerity than know- 
ledge is all the methods I took for tnis poor crea- 
ture's instruction, and mu^ acknowledge, what I 
believe all that act upon the same principle will 
find» that in laying thu^s open to him, I really in- 
formed and instructed myself in many things that 
either I did not know, or had not fully considered 
before, but which occurred naturally to my mind 
upon searching into them, for the information of 
this poor savage ; and I had more affection in my 
inquury after mings upon this occasion than ever I 
&lt before : so that, whether this poor wild wretch. 
was the better for me or no, I had great reason to 
be thankful that ever he came to me ; my grief sat 
lighter upon me ; my habitation grew comfortable 
to me beyond measure : and when I reflected, that 
in this solitary life which I had been confined to, I 
had not only been moved to look up to Heaven my- 
self, and to seek to the hand that had brought me 
kere, but was now to be made an instrument, under 
IVovidence, to save the life, and, for aught I knew, 
the sOfd, of« poor savage, and bring him to die true

knowledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine^ 
that he might know Christ Jesus, in whom is life 
eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all these 
things, a secret joy ran through every part of my 
soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I was 
brought to this place, which I had so often thought 
the most dreadml of all afflictions that could possi- 
bly have befallen me. 

I continued in this thankful frame all the re- 
mainder of my time ; and the conversation which 
employed the hours between Friday and me was 
such, as made the three years which we lived there 
together perfectly and completely happy, if any such 
thing as complete happiness can be formed in a 
sublunary state. This savage was now a cood 
Christian, a much better than I ; though I have 
reason to hope, and bless God for it, tliat we were 
equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. 
We had here the word of God to read, and no farther 
off from his Spirit to instruct, than if we had been 
in England. I always applied myself, in reading the 
Scriptures, to let him know, as well as I could, the 
meaning of what I read ; and he again, by his 
serious mquiries and questioning, made me, as I 
said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture- 
knowledge than I should ever have been by my 
own mere private reading. Another thing I can- 
not refrain from observmg here also, from ex- 
perience in this retired part of my life, viz. how 
infinite and inexpressible a blessmg it is that the 
knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation 
by Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word 
of God, so easy to be received and understood, that 
as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable 
of understanding enough of my duty to carry me 
directly on to the great work of sincere repentance 
for iny sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life

and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice, 
and obediende to all God's commands, and this 
without any teacher or instructor, I mean human ; 
so, the same plain instruction sufficiently served to 
the enlightemng fliis savappe creatvure, and bringing 
him to be such a Christian, as I have known few 
equal to him in my life. 

As to all the disputes, wrangling, strife, and con* 
t^tition, which have happened in the world about 
religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes 
of church-govemm@[it, they were all perfectly use- 
less to us, and, for aught I can yet see, tliey have 
been so to the rest of the world. We had the sure 
guide to heaven, viz. the word of God; and we had« 
blessed be God, comfortable views of the Spirit of 
God teaching and instructing us by his wora, lead* 
ing us into all truth, and making us both willing 
and obedient to the instruction of his word. And I 
cannot see the least use that the greatest knowledge 
of the disputed {>oints of religion, which have made 
such contusions in the world, would have been to 
us, if we could have obtained it.— But I must go on 
with the historical part of things, and take every 
part in its order. 

After Friday and I became more intimately ac- 
quainted, and that he could understand almost all I 
said to him, and speak pretty fluently, though in 
broken English, to me, I acquainted liim widi my 
own history, or at least so much of it as related to 
my coming to this place; how I had lived here, and 
how l<mg : I let him into the mystery, for such it 
was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught 
him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he 
was wonderfully delighted with ; and I made him a 
belt, with a frog hanging to it, such as in England 
we wear hangers in ; and in the frog, instead of ^ 
lianger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only aa

sooA a weapon, in some cases/but much more use* 
fill upon otner occasions. 

I described to him the country of Europe, parti- 
cularly England, which I came from ; how we livedo 
how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one 
another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of 
the world. I gave him an account of the wreck 
which 1 had been on board of, and showed him, as 
near as I could, the place wiiere she lay ; but she 
was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. I show- 
ed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when 
we escaped, and which I could not stir with my 
whole strength then ; but was now fallen almost mi 
to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood 
musing a great while, and said nothing, i asked 
him what it was he studied upon ? At last, says he. 
Me see such boat like come to place at my nation. 
I did not understand him a good while : but, at last, 
when I had examined farther into it, I understood 
by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on 
ahore upon the country where he lived ; that is, as 
he explained it, was driven thither by stress of wea- 
ther. I presently imagined that sdme European 
ship must have been cast away upon their coast, 
ana the boat might get loose, and drive ashore ; but 
was so dull, that I never once thought of men mak- 
ing their escape from a wreck thither, much less 
whence they might come : so I only inquired after a 
description of the boat.' 

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; 
but brought me better to understand him when he 
added, with some warmth. We save the white mans 
from drown. Then I presently asked him, if there 
were any white mans, as he called them, in the 
boat ? Yes, he said ; the boat frill of white mans. 
I asked him how many ? He told upon his fingers 
seventeen. I asked him then what became of

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 251 

them ? He told me^ They live, they dwell at my 
nation. 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for 1 pre- 
sently imagined that these might be the men belong- 
ing to the ship that was cast away in the sight of 
my island ; as I now called it ; and who, after the 
ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her in- 
evitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, 
and were landed upon that wild shore among the 
savages. Upon this, I enquired of him more critic- 
ally what was become of them ; he assured me they 
lived still there ; that they had been there about 
four years ; that the savages let them alone, and 
gave them victuals to live on. I asked him how it 
came to pass they did not kill them, and eat them? 
He said, No, they make brother witii them; that is, 
as I understood him, a truce ; and then he added, 
They eat no mans but when make the war fight ; 
that is to say, they never eat any men but such as 
come to fight with them, and are taken in battle* 
^ It was after this some considerable time, that be^ 
ing upon the top of the hill, at the east side of the 
island,.from whence, as I have said, J had, in a clear 
day, discovered the main, or continent of America, 
Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very 
earnestly towards the main land, and, in a kind of 
surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out 
to me, for I was at some distance from him. 1 ask- 
ed him what was the matter ? O joy ! says he ; O 
glad ! there see my country, Uiere my nation ! £ 
observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appefu*- 
ed in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his coun- 
tenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had 
a mind to be in his own country again. This ob- 
servation of mine put a great many thoughts into 
me, which made me at first not so easy about my 
new man Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt

S52 ADVKKTURES Of 

but that if Friday could get back to hid own nation 
again, he would not only forget all his religion, but 
afi his obli^tion to me, and would be forward 
enough to give his countrymen an account of me, 
and come back perhaps with a hundred or two of 
them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might 
be as merry as he used to be with those of his ene- 
mies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged 
the poor honest creature very much, for which I 
was very sorry afterwards* However, as my jealousy 
increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little 
more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to 
him as before : in which I was certainly in the wrong 
too; the honest, grateful creature, having no 
thought about it, but what consisted with the best 
principles, both as a religious Christian, and as a 
grateud friend ; as appeared afterwards, to my full 
satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you maybe sure 
I was every dav pumping him, to see if he would 
discover any or the new thoughts which I suspected 
-were in him : but I found every thing he said was 
so honest and so innocent, that I could find nothing 
to nourish my suspicion ; and, in spite of all my 
uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own 
again ; nor did he, in the least, perceive that I was 
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspeqt him of 
deceit. 

One day walking up the same hill, but the weather 
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con- 
tinent, I called to him, and said, Friday, do not 
you wish yourself in your own country, your own 
nation ? — Yes, he said, I be much O glad to be at 
my own nation. — What would you do there ? said I : 
would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh again, 
and be a savage, as you were before ? He looked 
fuU of concern, and shaking his bead, said, No,

po ; Friday tellthem to live good, tell them to pray 
God, tell them to eat corn-bread, ^cattle-flesh, milk; 
no eat man again, — Why then, said I to him, they 
will kill you. He looked grave 'at that, and then 
said. No, no ; they no kill me, they willing love 
learn. He meant by this, they would be willing 
to learn. He added, they learned much of the 
bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I asked 
him if he would go back to them. He smiled at 
that, and told me that he could not swim so far. I 
told him, I would make a canoe for him. He told 
me he would so, if I would go with him. I go! 
says I ; why, mey will eat me, if I come there.-— 
No, no, says he ; me make they no eat you ; me 
make diey much love you. He meant, he would 
tell them how I had killed his enemies, and saved 
his life, and so he would make them love me. Then 
he told me, as well as he could, how kind they were 
to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called 
them, who came on shore there in distress. 

From this time, I confess I had a mind to venture 
over, and see if I could possibly join with those 
bearded men, who I made no doubt, were Spaniards 
and Portuguese : not doubting but if I could, we 
might find some method to escape from thence, 
being upon the continent, and a good company to- 
gether, better than I could from an island forty 
miles off the shore, and alone, without help. So, 
after some days, I took Friday to work again, by 
way of discourse ; and told him I would give him a 
boat to go back to his own nation; and accordingly 
I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other 
side of the island, and having cleared it of water 
(for 1 always kept it sunk in water) I brought it 
out, showed it him, and we both went into it. I 
found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing 
it, and would make it go almost as swift again a& I

couldL So when he was in» I said to him, Wel]| 
now, Friday, shall we go to your nation? He 
looked very dull at my saying so ; which it seems^ 
was because he thought the boat too small to go so 
far : I then told him I had a bigger ; so the next 
day I went to the place where the first boat lay 
which I had made, but which [ could not get into 
the water* He said that was big enough : but then, 
as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or 
three and twenty years there, the sun had split and 
dried it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday 
told me such a boat would do very well, and would 
carry much enough vittle, drink, bread ; that Was 
his way of talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon 
my design of going over with him to the continent, 
that I told him we would go and make one as big 
as tliat, and he should go home in it. He answered 
not one word, but^ looked very grave and sad.' I 
asked him what was the matter with him? He 
asked me again, Why you an^y mad with Friday? 
What me done ? I asked him what he meant : I 
told him I was not angry with him at all. No an- 
gry ! says he, repeating the words several 'times ; 
Wny send Friday home away to my nation. — Why, 
says I, Friday, did not you say, you wished you 
were there ?— Yes, yes, says he, wish be both there; 
no wish Friday there, no master there. In a word, 
he would not think of going there without me. I 
go there, Friday ! says 1 ; what shall I do there ? 
He returned very quick upon me at this: You do 
great deal much good, says he ; you teach wild mans 
be good, sober, tame mans ; you tell them know 
God, pray God, and live new life.— Alas ! Friday, 
says 1, thou knowe^t not what thou sayest ; I am 
but an ignorant man myself.— Yes, yes, says he» you 
teachee me gocd, you teachee them good. — No, no.

Friday, says I, you shall go without me ; leave me 
here to live by myself, as I did before* He looked 
confused again at that word ; and running to one 
of the hatchets which he used to wear, he teikea it 
up hastily, and gives it to me. What must I do 
with this ? says I to him. You take kill. Friday, 
says he. What must I kill you for ? said I again. 
He returns very quick, What you send Friday 
away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday 
. away, lliis he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears 
stand in his eyes : in a word, I so plainly discovered 
the utmost affection in him to me, and a firm reso- 
lution in him, that I told him then, and often after, 
that I would never send him away from me, if he 
was willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, 
a settled affection to me, and that nothing should 
part, him from me, so I found all the foundation of 
his desire to go to his own country was laid in his 
ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my 
doing them good : a thing, which, as I had no no* 
tion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or 
intention, or desire of undertaking it. But still I 
found a strong inclination to my attempting an 
escape, as above, founded on the supposition ga- 
thered from the discourse, viz. that there were se- 
venteen bearded men there : and, therefore, without 
any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to find 
out a great tree proper to fell, and make a largo 
periagua, or ciEinoe, to undertake the voyage. There 
were trees enough in the island to have built a little 
Heet, not of penaguas, or canoes, but even of good 
large vessels : but the main thing I looked at was, * 
to get one so near the water that we might launch 
it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I com* 
mitted at first. At last, Friday pitched upon a 
treej for I found he knew much better than 1 what

kind of wood was fittest for it ; nor can I tell, to 
this day, what wood to call the tree we cut dowo, 
except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, 
or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it waa 
much of the same colour and smell. Friday was 
for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, 
to make it for a boat, but I showed him how to cut 
it with tools; which, after 1 had showed him how- 
to use, he did very handily : and in about a month's 
hard labour we finished it, and made it very hand- 
some; especially when, with our axes, which I 
showed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the 
outside into the true shape of a boat. After this> 
however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her 
along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers 
into the water; but when she was in, she would 
have carried twenty men with great ease. 

When she was in the water, and though she was 
so big, it amazed me. to see with what dexterity, 
and how swift my man Friday would manage her, 
turn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if 
he would, and if we might, venture over in her. 
Yes, he said ; we venture over in her very well, 
though great blow wind. However, I had a far- 
ther design, that he knew noting of, and that was 
to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her with an . 
anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy 
enough to get ; so I pitched upon a strait young 
cedar tree, which I found near the place, and which 
there were great plenty of in the island : and I set 
Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him direc- 
tions how to shape and order it. But as to the sail, 
that was my particular care. I knew I had old sails 
or rather pieces of old sails enough ; but as I had 
had them now six and twenty years by me, and had 
not been very careful to preserve them, not imagin- 
ing that I should ever have this kind of use for them.

I did tkot doubt but th6y were all rotten> aad, in- 
deed, most of them were so. However, I found two 
pieces, which appeared pretty good, and with the^ 
I went to work ; and with a great deal of pains, and 
awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of 
needles, I, at length, made a three-cornered ugly 
thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-of- 
mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a 
little short sprit at the top, such as usually our 
ships' long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew 
how to manage, as it was such a one I had to the 
boat in which I made my escape from fiarbary, as 
related in the first part of my story* 

I was near two months performing this last work, 
viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for [ 
finished them very complete, making a small stay, 
and a sail, or fore-sail, to it, to assist, if we should 
turn to windward ; and, which was more than all, . 
I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with. I 
was but a bungling ship-wright, yet, as I knew the 
usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I ap^' 
plied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last 
I brought it to pass; though, considering the many 
dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it 
cost me almost as much labour as making the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to 
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my 
boat ; for, though he knew very well how to paddle 
a canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail 
and a rudder ; and was the most amazed when he 
saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by 
the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled this 
way, or that way, as the course we sailed changed; 
I say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished 
and amazed. However^ with a little use, I made 
all these things fisuniliar to him, and he became an 
expert sailor, es^cept that as to the compass ; I could

make him understand very little of that/ On the 
other hand, as there was very little cloudy-weather, 
and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there 
was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars 
were always to be seen by night,. and the shore by 
day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody 
cared to stir abroad,, either by land or sea. 

I was now entered on the seven and twentieth 
year of my captivity in this place ; though the three 
last years diat I had this creature with me ou^ht 
rather to be left out of the account, my habitation 
being quite of another kind than in all the rest of 
the time. I kept the anniversary of my landing 
here with the same thankfulness to God for his mer- 
cies as at first ; and if I had such cause of acknow- 
iQjdgement at first, I had much more so now, having 
such additional testimoniesof the care of Providence 
over me, and the great hopes I had of being effec- 
tually and speedily delivered ; for I had an invinci- 
ble impression upon my thoughts that my deliver^ 
ance was at hand, and mat I should not be another 
year in this place. I went on, however, with my 
husbandry ; digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. 
I gathered and cured my grapes, and did every ne- 
cessary thing as before. 

The rainy season was, in the mean time, upon me, 
when I kept more within doors than at oUier times. 
We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we 
could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I 
said in the beginning, 1 landed my rafls from the 
ship ; and hauling her up. to the shore, at high-water 
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just 
big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to 
give her water enough to float in ; and then, when 
the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the 
end of it, to keep the water out ; and so she lay dry, 
as to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain

off, we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick, 
that she was as w^l thatched as a house ; and thus 
we waited for the months of November and Decem- 
ber, in which 1 designed to make my: adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as 
the thought of my desfgn returned with the fair 
weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage : and 
the first thing 1 did was to lay by a certain quantity 
of provisions, being the stores for our voyage: and 
intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open 
the dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one 
morning upon something of this kind, when I called 
to Friday, and bid him go to the sea-shore, and see 
if he could find a turtle, or tortoise, a thing which 
we generally got once a week, for the sake of the 
eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long 
gone, when he came running back, and flew Over 
my outer-wall, or fence, like one that felt not the 
ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and before 
I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me,* O 

master ! O master ! O sorrow ! O bad ! ^What's 

the matter, Friday ? says I. O yonder, there, says 
he, one, two, three canoe ; one, two, three ! By 
this way of speaking, I concluded there were six ; 
but, on inquiry, I found it was but three. Well, 
Friday, says I, do not be frightened ! So I heart* 
ened him up as well as I could : however, I saw 
the poor fellow was most terribly scared ; for no- 
thing ran in his head but that they were come to 
look for him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat 
him ; and the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce 
knew what to do with him. I comforted him as 
well as I could, and told him I was in as much 
danger as he, and that they would eat me as well 
as him; But, says I, Friday, we must resolve to 
fight themr Can you fight, Friday ? — Me shoot, 
says he ; but there come many great number.—-*^

No matter for that, said I, aeain ; our guns will 
fright them that we do not kill. So I asked him 
whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would de- 
fend me, and stand by me, and do juBt as I bid him. 
He said. Me die, when you bid die, master. So I 
went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave 
him ; for 1 had been so good a husband of -my 
rum, that I had a great deal left. When he drank 
it, I made him take the two fowling^-pieces, which 
we always carried, and loaded them with lai*ge 
swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets : then I 
took four muskets, and loadea them with two slugs, 
and five small bullets each ; and vAy two pistols £ 
loaded with a brace of bullets each : I hung my 
great sword, as usual, naked by mv side, and gave 
Friday his hatchet. When I had thus prepared 
myself, I took my perspective glass, and went up 
to the side of the hill, to ^jee what I could discover ; 
and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were 
one and twenty savages, three prisoners, and three 
canoes ; and that their whole business seemed to 
be the triumphant banquet upon these three human 
bodies; a barbarous^ feast, indeed! but nothing 
more than, as I had observed, was usual with them. 
I observed also, that they were landed, not where 
they had done when Friday made his escape, but 
nearer to my creek : where the shore was low, and 
where a thick wood came almost close down to the 
sea. This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman 
errand these wretches came about, filled me with 
such indignation, that I came down again to Friday, 
and told him I was resolved to go down to them, 
and kill them all ; and asked him if he would stand 
by me. He had now got over his fright, and his 
spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given 
bun, he was very cheerful, and tbld me, at hSlmbp 
he would die when I bid (Ue.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^61 

In this fit of furv, I took and divided the arms 
which 1 had charged, as before, between us : I gave 
Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three' 
guns upon his shoulder ; and I took one pistol, and 
the other three guns myself; and in this posture 
we marched out. I tooK a small bottle of rum in 
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more 
powder and bullets ; and, as to orders, 1 charged 
him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or 
shoot, or do any thing, till I bid him ; and, in the 
mean time, not to speak a word. In this posture, 
I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a 
mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into 
the wood, so that I might come within shot of them 
before I should be discovered, which I had seen, 
by my glass, it was easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former 
thoughts returning, 1 began to abate my resolu- 
tion : I do not mean that I entertained any fear of 
their number; for, as they wete naked, unarmed 
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them ; nay, 
though I had been alone. But it occurred to my 
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what 
necessity I was in, to go and dip my hands in blood, 
to attack people who had neither done or intended 
me any wrong ? Who, as to me, were innocent, and 
whose barbarous customs were their own disaster ; 
being, in them, a token indeed of God's having lefl 
them, with the other nations of that part of the 
world, to such stupidity, and to such inhuman 
courses; but did not call me to take upon me to 
be a judge of their actions, much less an execu- 
tioner of his justice ; that, whenever he thought fit, 
he would take the cause into his own hands, and, 
by national vengeance, punish them, as a people, 
for national crimes ; but that, in the mean time, it 
was none of my business ; tliat, it was true, Friday

miftbt justify it, because he was a declared enemy, 

ana in a state of war with those very particular peo- 

ile, and it was lawful for him to attack them ; but 

could not say the same with respect to myself. 
These things were so warmly pressed upon my 
thoughts aU the way as I went, that I resolved I 
would only go and place myself near them, that I 
might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would 
act then as God should direct; but that, unless 
something offered that was more a call to me than 
yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them. 

With this, resolution I entered the wood ; and, 
with all possible wt^iness and silence, Friday fol- 
lowing close at my heels, I marched till I came to 
the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next 
to them, only that one corner of the wood lay be- 
tween nie and them. Here I called softly to Friday, 
and showing him a great tree, which was just at the 
corner of tne wood, 1 bade him go the tree, and 
bring me word if he could see there plainly what 
they were doing. He did so ; and came immediately 
back to me, and told me they might be plainly 
viewed there ; that they were all about their fire, 
eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that 
another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them^ 
which, he said, they would kill next, and which fired 
all the very soul within me. He told me it was not 
one of their nation, but one of the bearded men he 
had told me of, that came to their country in the 
boat. I was filled with horror at the very namine 
the white bearded man ; and, going to the tree, I 
saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who la}^ upon 
the beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet 
tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that he 
was an European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket he* 
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the

place where I waS) which, by goin^ a little way 
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and 
that then I should be within half a shot of them : 
so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed en- 
raged to the highest degree ; and going back about 
twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held 
all the way till 1 came to the other tree ; and then 
came to a little rising ground, which gave me a 
full view of them, at the distanc^ of about eighty 
yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of 
the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all close 
huddled together, and had just sent the other two 
to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, per- 
haps, limb by limb, to their fire ; and they were 
stooping down to untie the bands at his ^et. I 
turned to Friday — Now Friday, said I, do as I bid 
thee. Friday said he would. Then, Friday, says 
I, do exactly as you see me do ; fail in nothing. So 
I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece 
upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his ; 
and with the other musket I took my aim at the 
savages, bidding him to do the like: then' asking 
him if he was ready, he said, Yes. Then fire at 
them, said I ; and the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that 
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them, and 
wounded three more; and, on my side, I killed one, 
and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, 
in a dreadful consternation ; and all of them who 
were not hurt jumped upon their feet, but did not 
immediately know which way to run, or which way 
to look, for they knew not rrom whence their de- 
struction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me 
that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I 
did ; so, as soon as the first shot was made, I threw 
down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and

264f ADVENTURES OF ■ 

Friday did the like : he bow me cock and present ; 
he did the same again. Are you ready, Friday ? 
said I. — Yes, says he. Let fly,*then, says I, in the 
name of God ! and with that, I fired again among 
the amazed wretches, and so did Friday ; and as 
our pieces were now loaden with what I called 
swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only 
two drop, but so many were wounded, that they 
ran about yelling ^nd screaming like mad creatures, 
all bloody, and most of them miserably wounded, 
whereof three more fell quickly after, though not 
quite dead. 

Now, Friday, says I, laying down the discharged 
pieces, and taking up the musket which was yet 
loaden, follow me ; which he did, with a great deal 
of courage ; upon which I rushed out of the wood, 
and showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. 
As soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as 
loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too ; and 
running as fast as I could, which, by the way, was 
not very fast^ being loaded with arms as I was, I 
made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as 
I said, lying upon the beach, or shore, between the 
place where they sat and the sea. The two butchers, 
who were just going to work with him, had left him 
at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in a terrible 
fright to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, 
and three more of the rest made the same way. I 
turned to Friday, and bade him step forwards, and 
fire at them ; he understood me immediately, and 
running about forty yards, to be nearer them, he 
shot at them, and I thought he had killed them all, 
for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat, though 
I saw two of them up again quickly : however, he 
killed two of them, and wounded the third so, that 
he lay down in the bottom of t he bo at as if he had 
been dead. 




ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^265 

While my man Friday fired at them, T pulled out 
my knife and cut the flags that hound the poor vic- 
tim ; and loosing his hands and feet, 1 liHed him 
tip, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he 
was. He answered in Latin, Christianus ; but was so 
weak and faint that he could scarce stand or speak. 
I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him, 
making signs that he should drink, which he did ; 
and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat. 
Then I asked him what countryman he was : and 
he said, Espagniole ; and being a little recovered, 
let me know, by all the signs he could possibly make, 
how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. 
Seignior, said I, with as much Spanish as I could 
make up, we will talk afterwards, but we must 
fight now : if you have any strength left, take this 
pistol and sword, and lay about you. He took them 
very thankfully ; and no sooner had he the arms in 
his hands, but, as if they had put new vigour into 
him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and 
had cut two of them in pieces in an instant ; for 
the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, 
so the poor creatures were so much fnghtened with 
the noise of our pieces, that they fell down for mere 
amazement and fear, and had no more power to at- 
tempt their own escape, than their flesh had to re- 
sist our shot : and that was the case of those five 
that Friday shot at in the boat : for as three of them 
fell with the hurt they received, so the other two 
fell with the fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, 
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I 
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword : so I 
called to Friday^ and bade him run up to the tree 
from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which 
lay there that had been discharged, which he did 
with great swiftness ; and then giving him my mus-

k^, I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and 
bade them come to me when they wanted* While I 
was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce 
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the 
savases, who made at him with one of their great 
wooden swords, the same-like weapon that was to 
have killed him before, if I had not prevented it. 
The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could 
be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian 
a good while, and had cut him two great wounds 
on his head; but the savage being a stout, lusty fel- 
low, "closing in with him, had thrown him down, 
being faint, and was wringing my sword out of his 
hand; when the Spaniard, though undermost, 
wisely quitting the sword, drew the pistol from his 
girdle, shot the savage through the body, and kill- 
ed him upon the spot, before I, who was running 
to help him, could come near him. 

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the 
flying wretches, with no weapon in his nand but his 
hatchet ; and with that he oispatched those three, 
who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and 
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with : and 
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him 
one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued 
two of the savages, and wounded them both ; but, 
as he was not able to run, they both got from^ him 
into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and 
killed one of them, but the other was too nimble 
for him; and though he was wounded, yet had 
plunged himself into the sea, and swam, with all 
his might, off to those two who were left in the ca- 
noe, which three in the canoe, with one wounded, 
that we knew not whether he died or no, were all 
that escaped our hands of one and twenty ; the ac- 
count of the whole is as follows: three killed at our 
first shot from the tree; two killed at the next shot;

two killed by Friday in the boat ; two killed by Fri- 
day of those at first wounded ; one killed by Friday 
in the wood; three killed by the Spaniard; four 
killed, being found dropj^ed here and there, of their 
wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them ; 
four escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if 
not dead. — Twenty-one in all. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get 
out of gun-shot, and though Friday made two or 
three shots at them, I did not find mat he hit any 
of them. Friday would fain have had me take one 
of their canoes, and pursue them ; and, indeed, I 
was very anxious about their escape, lest carrying 
the news home to their people, they should come 
back perhaps with two or three hundred of the ca- 
noes, and devour us by mere multitude ; so 1 con- 
sented to pursue them by sea, and running to one 
of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday fol- 
low me ; but when I was in the canoe, I was sur- 
prised to find another poor creature lie there, bound 
hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaugh- 
ter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what 
was the matter; for he had not been able to look up 
over the side of the boat, he was tied so haid neck 
and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had 
really but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, 
which they had bound him with, and would have 
helped him up ; but he could not stand or speak, 
but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, 
that he was only unbound in order to be killed. 
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to 
him, and tell him of his deliverance ; and, pulling 
' out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a 
dram ; which, with the news of his being delivered, 
revived him, and he sat up in the boat. But when 
Friday came to hear him speak, and look In his

face, it would have moved any one to tears to have 
seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hug- 
ged him, cried, laughed, hollowed, jumped about, 
danced, sung ; then cried again, wrung his hands, 
beat his own face and head ; and then sung and 
jumped about again, like a distracted creature. It 
was a good while before I could make him speak to 
me, or tell me what was the matter ; but when he 
came a little to himself, he told me that it was his 
father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me 
to see what ecstasy and filial affection had worked 
in this poor savage at the sight of his father, and 
of his being delivered from death ; nor, indeed, can 
I describe half the extravagancies of his affection 
after this ; for he went into the boat, and out of 
the boat, a great many times : when he went into 
him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, 
and hold his father's head close to his bosom for 
many minutes together, to nourish it; then he 
took his arms and ancles, which were numbed and 
stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them 
with his hands ; and I, perceiving what the case 
was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub 
them with, which did them a great (leal of good.' 

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe 
with the other savages, who were now got almost 
out of sight ; and it was happy for us that we did 
not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and 
before they could be got a quarter of their way, and 
continued blowing so hard all night, and that from 
the north-west, which was against them, that I 
could not suppose their boat could live, or that they 
ever reached their own coast. 

But, to return to Friday ; he was so busy about 
his' father, that I could not find in my heart to take, 
him off for some time : but after I thought he could

lea^e him a little, I called him to me, and he came 
jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest 
extreme; then I asked him if he had given his 
father any bread. He shook his head, and said^ 
None ; ugly doff eat all up self. 1 then gave him 
a cake of bread, out of a little pouch 1 carried 
on purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself, 
but he would not taste it, but carried it to his fa- 
ther. I had in my pocket two or three bunches of 
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his fa- 
ther. He had no sooner given his father these 
raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and 
run away, as if he had been bewitched, he ran at 
such a rate ; for he was the swiftest fellow on his 
feet that ever I saw : I say, he ran at such a rate, 
that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant ; 
and though I called, and hollowed out too, after 
him, it was all one, away he went ; and in a quar« 
ter of an hour I saw liim come back again, though 
not so fast as he went ; and as he came nearer, I 
found his pace slacker, because he had something 
in his hand. When he came up to me, I found he 
had been quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to 
bring his father some fresh water, and Uiat he had 
two more cakes or loaves of bread ; the bread he 

fave me, but the water he carried to his father ; 
owever, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little 
sup of it. The water revived his fkther more than 
all the rum or spirits I had given him, for he was 
just fainting with thirst. 

When his father had drank, I called to him to 
know if there was any water left: he said, Yes ; and 
I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was 
in as much want of it as his father ; and I sent one 
of the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard 
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing 
himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree ;

and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very mudi 
swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied 
with. When I saw that, upon Friday's coming to 
him witli the water, he sat up and drank, and took 
the bread, and began to eat, I went to him and 
gave him a handful of raisins : he looked up in my 
face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankful- 
ness that could appear in any countenance ; but 
was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted 
himself in the fight, that he could not stand up 
upon his feet ; he tried to do it two or three times, 
but was really not able, his ancles were so swelled 
and so painful to him ; so I bade him sit still, and 
caused Friday to rub his ancles, and bathe them 
with rum, as he had done his father s. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every 
two minutes, or perhaps less^ all the while he was 
here, turn his head about, to see if his father was 
in the same place and posture as he left him sitting ; 
and at last he found he was not to be seen ; at which 
he started up, and, without speaking a word, flew 
with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce 
perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went : 
but when he came, he only found he had laid him- 
self down to ease his limbs, so Friday came back to 
me presently ; and then I spoke to the Spaniard to 
let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead him 
to the boat, and then he should carry him to our 
dwelling, where I would take care of him : but Fri- 
day, a lust}^ strone fellow, took the Spaniard quite 
up upon his back, and ' carried him away to the 
boat, and set him down softly upon the side or ffun- 
nel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it ; 
and then lifting him quite in, he set him close to 
his father; and presently stepping out again, launch- 
ed the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster 
than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty

hard too : bo he brought them both safe into our 
creek, and leaving them in the boat, ran away to 
fetch the other canoe As he passed me, I spoke 
to him, and asked him whither he went. He told 
me. Go fetch more boat: so away he went like 
the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him ; 

'and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as 
soon as I got to it by land ; so he wailed me over, 
and then went to help our new guests out of the 
boat, which he did ; but they were neither of them 
able to walk, so that poor Friday knew not what to. 
do. 

To remedy tliis, I went to work in my thought, 
apd calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the 
bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of 
a hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I 
carried them both up together upon it, between us. 
But when we got them to the outside of our wall, 
or fortification^ we werei at a worse loss than be- 
fore> for it was impossible to get them over, and I 
was resolved not to break it down : so I set to work 
again ; and Friday and I, in about two hours* time, 
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, 
and above that with boughs of trees, being in the 
space without our outward fence, and between that 
and the grove of young wood which I had planted ; 
•and here we made them two beds of such things as 
I had, viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid 
upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on 
each bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought my- 

. self very rich in subjects ; and it was a merry re- 
flection, which I frequently made, how like a king 
I looked. First of all, the whole country was my 
(ywn mere property, so that I had an undoubted 
right of dominion. Secondly, my people were pe- 
fectly subjected; I was absolutely lord and law-

giver ; they all owed their lives to me, and were 
ready to lay down their lives, if there had been oc- 
casion for itf for me. It was remarkable, too, I 
had but three subjects, and they were of three dif- 
ferent religions : my man Friday was a Protestant, 
his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the Spa- 
niard was a Papist : however, I allowed liberty of 
conscience throughout my dominions : — But this is 
by the way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued 
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to 
rest them upon, I began to think of making some 
provision for diem ; and the first thing 1 did, I or- 
dered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid 
and a goat, out of my particular fiock, to be killed ; 
when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it 
into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boilins 
and stewing, and make them a very good dish, I 
assure you, of flesh and broth, having put soi^e 
barley and rice also into the broth : and as I cooked 
it without-doors, for I made no fire ^thin my inner 
wall, so I carried it all into the new tent, and hav- 
ing set a table there for them, I sat down, and eat 
my dinner also with them, and, as well as I could, 
cheered them, and encouraged them. Friday was 
my interpreter, especially to his father, and, indeed 
to the Spaniard too ; for the Spaniard spoke the 
language of the savages pretty well. « 

Afler we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered 
Friday to take one of the canoes, arid go and fetch 
our muskets and other fire-arms, which, for want of 
time, we had left upon the place of battle : and, 
the next day, I ordered him to go and bury the 
dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the 
sun, and would presently be offensive. I also or- 
dered him to bury the horrid remains of their bar« 
'^arous feast, which I knew were pretty much, and

which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I 
could not bear to see them, if I went that way ; all 
which he punctually performed, and effaced the very 
appearance of the savages being there ; so that 
when I went again, I could scarce know where it 
was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood 
pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation 
with my two new subjects : and first, I set Fri- 
day to inquire of his father what he thought of 
the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whe- 
ther we might expect a return of them, with a 
power too great for us to resist. His first opinion 
was, that the savages in the boat never could live 
out the storm which blew that night they went off, 
but must, of necessity, be drowned, or driven south 
to those other shores, where they were as sure to 
be devoured as they were to be drowned, if thejr 
were cast away i but, as to what they would do, if 
they came safe on shore, he said he knew not ; but 
it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully 
frightened with the manner of their being attacked, 
the noise, and the fire, that he believed they would 
tell the people they were all killed by thunder and 
lightning, not by the hand of man ; and that the 
two which appeared, viz. Friday and I, were two 
heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy 
them, and not men with weapons. This, he said, 
he knew ; because he heard them all cry out so, 
in their language, one to another ; for it was im- 
possible for them to conceive that a man could dart 
fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance, with- 
out lifting up the hand, as was done how : and this 
old savage was in the right; for, as I understood 
since, by other hands, the savages never attempted 
to so over to the island afterwards, they were so 
ternfied with the accounts given by those four men 

Digitized by CjOOgle 



274 ADVENTURES OF 

(for, it seems, they did escape the sea), that they 
believed whoever went to tnat enchanted island 
would be destroyed with fire from the gods. This^ , 
however, I knew not ; and therefore was under coo- 
tinual apprehensions for a good while, and kept 
always upon my guard, with all mv army : for, as 
there were now four of us, I would have ventured 
upon a hundred of them, fairly in' the open field, 
at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes ap- 
pearing, the fear of their coming wore off; and I 
began to take m^ former thoughts of a voyage to 
the main into consideration ; being likewise assured, 
by Friday's father, that I might depend upon good 
usage from their nation, on his account, if I would 
go. But m}r thoughts were a little suspended when 
I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and 
when I understood that there were sixteen more of 
his countrymen and Portuguese,, who, having been 
cast away, and made their escape to that tide, lived 
there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were 
very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for 
life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, 
and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from 
the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna, being directed 
to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides 
and silver, and to bring back what European goods 
they could meet with there ; that they had five Por- 
tuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of 
another wreck ; that five of their own men were 
drowned, when first the ship was lost, and that these 
escaped, through infinite dangers and hazards, and 
arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where 
they expected to have been devoured every moment. 
He told me they had some arms with them, but they 
were perfectly useless, for that they had neither 
powder or ball, the washing of the sea having spoil- 

DigitizedbyCjOOgle 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 275 

ed all their powder, but a little, which they lued, 
at their first landing, to provide themselves some 
food. 

I ^sked him what he thought would become of 
them there, aod if they had formed no design of 
making any escape. He said they had many con- 
sultations about It ; but that having neither vessel, 
nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind, 
their councils always ended in tears and despair. I 
asked him how he thought they would receive ^ 
proposal from me, which might tend towards an 
escape ; and whether, if they were all here, it might 
tnot be done. I told him with freedom, I feared 
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put 
my life in their hands ; for that gratitude was no 
inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men 
always square their dealings by the obligations they 
had received, so much as thej did by the advantages 
they expected. I told him it would be very hard 
that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, 
and. that they should afterwards make me their pri- 
soner in New Spain, where an Englishman was cer- 
tain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what 
accident soever brought him thither; and that I 
had rather be delivered up to the savi^es, and be 
devoured alive ; than fall into the merciless claws of 
the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition. I 
added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were 
all here, we might, with so many hands, build a 
bark large enough to carry us all away, either to 
the Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or Spa- 
nish coast, northward; but that if, in requital, 
they should, when I had put weapons into their 
hands, carry me by force among their own people, 
I might be ill used for my kindness to diem, and 
make my case worse than it was before. 

He answered, with a great deal of candour and

ineenuousnessy that their condition was so miser- 
able, and that thev were so sensible of it, that, he 
believed, they would abhor the thought of using an^ 
man unkindly that should contribute to their deli- 
verance ; and that if I pleased, he would go to them 
with the old man, and discourse with them about it 
and return again, and bring me their answer ; that 
he would make conditions with them upon their so- 
lemn oath, that they should be absolutely under jtny 
leading, as their commander and captain-; and that 
they should swear upon the holy sacraments and 
gospel, to be true to me, and go to such Christian 
country as that I should agree to, and no other, 
and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my or- 
ders, till they were landed safely in such country as 
I intended ; and that he would bring a contract 
from them, under their hands, for that purpose. 
Tlien he told me he would first swear to me him- 
self, that he would never stir from me as long as 
he lived, till I gave him orders ; and that he would 
take my side to the last drop of his blood, if there 
should happen the least breach of faith among his 
countrymen. .He told me they were all of them very 
civil, honest men, and they were under the greatest 
distress imaginable, having neither weapons or 
. clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discre- 
tion of the savages ; oufof all hopes of ever .return- 
ing to their own country ; and that he was sure» if 
J would undertake their relief, they would live and 
die by me. • 

Upon these assurances, J resolved to venture to 
relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage 
and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But when 
we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spa- 
niard himself started, an objection, vmich had so 
much prudence in it,, on one hand, and so much 
sincerity, on the other band, that I could not. but 

Digitized by CjOOgle 



ROBINSON CAUSOE. 277 

be. very well satisfied in it ; and, by his advice, put 
off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half 
a year.- The case was thus : He had been with us 
now about a month, during which time I had let 
him see in what manner I had provided, with the 
assistance of Providence, for my support ; and he 
saw evidently what stock of corn and rice 1 had laid 
up ; which, though it was more than sufficient for 
myself, yet it was not sufficient, without good hus- 
bandry, for my family, now it was increased to 
four ; but much less would it be sufficient if his 
countrymen, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, 
should come over ; and, least of all, would it be 
sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build 
onie, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of 
America ; so he told me he thought it would be 
more adviseable to let him and the ouier two dig and 
cultivate some more land, as much as I could spare 
seed to sow, and that we should wait another har- 
vest, that we might have a supply of corn for his 
countrymen, when they should come; for want 
might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not 
to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out 
of one difficulty into another. You know, says 
he, the children of Israel, though they rejoiced 
at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet 
rebelled even against God himself, that oelivered 
them, when they came to want bread in the wil- 
derness. 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so 
good, that I could not but be ver3r well pleased with 
his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fide- 
lity : so we fell to digging all four of us, as well 
as the wooden tools we were furnished with permit- 
ted ; and in about a month's time, by the end of 
which it was seed-time, we had got as much land 
cured and trimmed up as we sowed two and twenty 
2b

278 ADVBNTURVS OV 

bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice ; which 
was, in short, all die seed we had to spare ; nor, 
indeed) did we leave ourselves barley sdHcient for 
our own food, for the six months that we had to 
expect our crop; that is to say, reckoning from the 
time we set our seed aside for sowing ; for it is not 
to be supposed it is six months in the gi'ound in that 
country. 

Having now society enough, and our number be- 
ing sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if 
they had come, unless their number had been very 
great, we went freely all over the island, whenever 
we found occasion ; and as here we had our escape 
or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, 
At least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. 
For this purpose, I marked out several trees which 
I thought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his 
father to cutting them down ; and then I caused the 
Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thought on that 
affair, to oversee and direct their work. 1 showed 
them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a 
large tree into single planks, and I caused them to 
do the like, till they had made about a dozen large 
planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five 
feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick : 
what prodigious labour it took up, any one may 
imagine. 

At thesame time, I contrived to increase my little 
flock of tame goats as much as I could ; and, for 
this purpose, 1 made Friday and the Spaniard go out 
one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for 
we took our turns), and by this means we got about 
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest ; for 
whenever weshot the dam, we saved the kids, and 
added them to our flock. But, above all, the sea- 
son for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such 
a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sim,

that, I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the 
raidins of the sun are cured, we could have filled 
sixty or eighty barrels t and these, with our bread, 
was a great part of our food, and was very good 
living too, I assure you, for it is exceeding nourish- 
ing. 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order : 
it was not the ^lost plentiful increase I had seen in 
the island, but, however, it was enough to answer 
our end ; for from twenty*two bushels of barley we 
brought in and threshed out above two hundred and 
twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the 
rice ; which was store enough for our food to the 
next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had 
been on shore with me ; or if we had been ready 
for a voyage, it would veiy plentifully have victual- 
led our ship to have carried- us to any part of the 
world, that is to say, any part of America. When 
we had thus housed and secured our magazine of 
corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, 
viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the 
Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, 
and oflen blamed me that 1 did not make some 
things for defence of this kind of work ; but I saw 
no need of it. 

And now haying a full supply of food for all the 
guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go 
over to the main, to see what he could do with 
those he had left behind them there. I gave him a 
strict charge not to bring any man with bim who 
would not first swear, in the presence of himself 
and the old savage, that he would no way injure, 
fight with, or attack the person he should find in 
the island, who was so kind as to send for them in 
order to their deliverance; but that they would 
stand by him, and defend him against all such at- 
tempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely

under and siAjected to his command ; and that this 
should be put in writing, and signed with their 
hands. How they were to have done this, when I 
knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question 
which we never asked. Under these instructions, 
the Spaniard and the old savage, the father of 
Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they 
might be said to come in, or rather were brought 
in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured by 
the savages. I gave each of them a musket, with 
a firelock on it, and about eight charges of powder 
and ball, charging them to be very good husbands 
of both, and not to use either of Uiem but upon 
urgent occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first mea- 
sures used by me, in view of my deliverance, for 
now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave 
them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, 
sufiicient for themselves for many days, and suffi- 
cient for all the Spaniards for about eight days' 
time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw 
them go ; agreeing with them about a signal they 
should hang out at their, return, by which I should 
know them again, when they came back, at a dis- 
tance, before they came on shore. They went away 
with a fair gale^ on the day that the moon was at 
full, by my account in the month of October ; but 
as for an exact reckoning of days, after I had once 
lost it, I could never recover it again ; nor had . I 
kept even the number of years so punctually as to 
be sure I was ri^ht ; though, as it proved, when I 
afterwards examined my account, I found I had 
kept a true reckoning ot years. 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for 
them, when a strange and unforeseen accident in- 
tervened, of which the like has not perhaps been 
heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch

ROBINSON CR(780E. 281 

one morning, when my man FHdajr came running 
in to me, and called aloud, Master, master, they are 
come, they are come ! I jumped up, and, regard-^ 
less of danger, I went out as soon as I could get my 
clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the 
way, was by» this time grown to be a very thick 
wood ; I say, regardless of danger, I went without 
my arms, which was not my custom to do ; but I 
was surprised, when turning my eyes to the sea, I 
presently saw a boat at about a league and a half 
distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder- 
of mutton sail, as t^y call it, and the wind blow- 
ing pretty fair to bring them in : also I observed 
presently that they did not come from that side 
which tne shore lay on, but from the southernmost 
end of the island. Upon this I called Friday in, and 
bade him lie close, for these were not the people we 
looked for, and that we might not know yet whe- 
ther they were friends or enemies. In the next 
place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass, to see 
what I could make of them; and having taken the 
ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I 
used to do when I was apprehensive of any thing, 
and to take my view the plainer, without bemg dis- 
covered. I had scarce set my foot upon the hill, 
when my eye plainly discoviered a ship lying at an 
anchor, at about two leagues and a half distance 
from me, S. S.£. but not above a league and a half 
from the shore. By my observation it 'appeared 
plainly to be an English uiip, and the boat appeared 
to be an English long-boat. 

1 cannot express the confusion I was in ; though 
the joy of seeing a ship, and one that I had reason 
to believe was manned by my own countr3rmen, and 
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe; 
but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I 
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me 
2b3

282 ADVENTURES OF 

keep upon my ^ard. In the first place it occurred 
to me to consider what business an English ship 
could have in that part of the world, since it was 
not the way to or from any part of the world where 
the English had any traffic ; and I knew there had 
been no storms to drive them in there, as in distress ; 
and that if they were really English, it was most 
probable that they, were here upon no good design ; 
and that I had better continue as I was, than fall 
into the hands of thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices 
of danger, which sometimes ar%given liim when he 
may think there is no possibility of its being real. 
That such hints and notices are given us, I believe 
few that have made any observations of things can 
deny; that thet are certain discoveries of an invisir 
ble world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot 
doubt ; and if the tendency of them seems to be to 
warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they 
are from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or 
inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and 
that they are given for our good ? 

The present question abundantly confirms me in 
the justice of this reasoning ; for had I not been 
made cautious by this secret admonition, come it 
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably* 
and in a far worse condition than before, as you will 
see presently. I had not kept myself long in this 
posture, but I saw the boat draw near the shore, as 
if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the 
convenience of landing ; however, as they did not 
come quit6 far enough, they did not see the little 
inlet where I formerly landed my rafls, but run their 
boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile 
from me, which was very happy for me ; for other- 
wise they would have landed just at my door, as I 
may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my

castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had. 
When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they 
were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two 
I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; 
there were in all eleven men, whereof three of them 
I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, bound; 
* and when the first four or five of them were jumped 
on shore, they took those three out of the boat, as 
prisoners: one of the three I could perceive using 
the most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, 
and despair, even to a kind of extravagance ; the 
other two, 1 could perceive, lifted up Uieir hands 
sometimesv and appeared concerned, indeed, but not 
to such a degree as the first. I was perfectly con- 
founded at the sight, and knew not what the mean- 
ing of it should be. Friday called out to me in 
English, as well as he could, O master! you see 
English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans.-^ 
Why, Friday, says I, do you think they are going to 
eat them, then ? — Yes, says Friday, they will eat 
them. — No, no, says I, Friday ; I am afraid they 
will murder them, mdeed, but you may be sure they 
will not eat them. 

All this while I had no thought of what the mat- 
ter really was, but^stood trembling with the horror 
of the sight, expecting every moment when the 
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw 
one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cut- 
lass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of 
the poor men ; and I expected to see him fall every 
moment ; at which all the blood in niy body seemed 
to run chill in my veiiis. I wished heartily now for 
my Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with 
him, or that I had any way to have come un disco** 
vered within shot of them, &at I might have rescued 
the. three men, for I saw no fire-arras they had 
among them ; but it fell out to my mind another

way. After I had oJbserved the outrageous usage of 
the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed 
the fellows run scattering about the island, as if 
they wanted to see the country. I observed that th^ 
three other men had liberty to go also where they 
pleased; but they sat down all three upon the 
ground, very pensive, and looked like men in des- 
pair. This put me in mind of the first time when I 
came on shore, and began to look about me ; how 
I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I looked 
round me; what dreadful apprehensions 1 had; and 
how I lodged in the tree all night, for fear of being 
devoured by wild beasts. As I knew nothing, that 
night, of the supply I was to receive by the provi- 
dential driving of^the ship nearer the land by the 
storms and tide, by which I have since been so long 
nourished and supported ; so these three poor de- 
solate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance 
and supply they were, how near it was to them, and 
how effectually and really they were in a condition 
of safety, at the same time that they thought them- 
selves lost, and their case desperate. So little do we 
see before us in the world, and so much reason have 
we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of 
the world, that be does not leave his creatures so 
absolutely destitute, but that in the worst circum- 
stances, they have always something to be thankful 
for, and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than 
they imagine ; nay, are even brought to their de- 
liverance by the means by which Uiey seem to be 
brought to their destruction. 

It was just at the top of high-water when these 
people came on shore; and partly while they rambled 
about to see what kind of a place they were in, they 
had carelessly staid till the tide was spent, and the 
water . was ebbed considerably away, leaving their 
boat aground. They had left two men in the boat»

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 285 

who, as I found afterwards, having drank a little too 
much brandy, fell asleep ; however, one of them 
waking a little sooner than the other, and finding 
the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hollow- 
ed out for the rest, who were straggling about ; 
upon which they all soon came to the boat : but it 
was past all their strength to launch her, the boat 
being! very heavy, and Uie shore on that side being a 
soft oozy sand, almost like a quick-sand. In this 
condition, like true seamen, who are perhaps the 
least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave 
it over, and away they strolled about the country 
again ; and I heard one of them say aloud to an- 
other, calling them off from the boat. Why, let her 
alone, Jack,* can't you? she'll float next tide ; by 
which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry <h 
what countrymen they were. All this while I kept 
myself very close, not once daring to stir out of my 
castle, any farther than to my place of observation, 
near the top of the hill ; and very glad I was to 
think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no 
less than ten hours before the boat could float again, 
and by that time it would be dark, and I might be 
at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear 
their discourse, if they had any. In the mean time, 
I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though 
with more caution, knowing I had to do with an- 
other kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered 
Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marks- 
man with his gun, to load himself with arms. I 
took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him 
three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce; 
I had my formidable goats' skin coat on, with the 
great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, 
two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder. 
It was my design, as I said above, not to have 
made any attempt till it was dark : but about two

o'clock, being the heat of the d&y, I found that, in 
short, they were all ^nestragghng* into the woods, 
and, as I thought, laid down to sleep. The three 
poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition 
to get any sleep, were, however, sat down under 
the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a 
mile from me, and as, I thought, out of sight of any 
of the rest. Upon this I resolved to discover my- 
self to them, and learn something of their condi- 
tion ; immediately I marched in the figure as above, 
my man Friday at a good distance behind me, as 
formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite 
so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came a& 
near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before 
any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in 
Spanish, What are ye, gentlemen ? They started 
up at the noise; but were ten times more con- 
founded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure 
that I made. They made no answer at ail, but I 
thought I perceived them just going to fly from me, 
when I spoke to them in English : Gentlemen, said 
I, do not be surprised at me ; perhaps you may have 
a friend near, when you did not expect it. — ^He 
must be sent directly from Heaven, Uien, said one of 
them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at 
the same time to me; for our condition is past the 
help of man — All help is from Heaven, sir, said I : 
But can you put a stranger in the way how to help 

ou ? for you seem to be in some great distress. 

saw you when you landed ; and when you seem- 
ed to make application to the brutes that came 
with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to 
kill you. 

The poor man with tears running down his &ce, 
and trembling, looking like one astonished, return-^ 
ed, Am' I talkmg to God or maa? Is it a real man 
or an angel ?— Be in no fear about that, sir, said 1 ;

if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would 
have come better clothed* and armed a^er another 
manner than you see>me: pray lay aside your fears; 
I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist 
you: you see I have one servant only; we have 
arms and ammunition ; tell us freely, can we serve 
you ? What is your case ? — Our case said, he, sir, 
IS too long to tell you, while our murderers are so 
near us : but, in short, sir, I was commander of that 
ship, my men have mutinied against me ; they have 
been hardly prevailed on not to murder me ; afid at 
last have set me on shore in this desolate place, 
with these two men with me, one my mate, the 
other a passenger, where we expected to perish, 
believing the place to be uninhabited, and know not 
yet what to think of it. — ^Where are these brutes, 
your enemies i said I : Do you know where they 
are gone? — There they lie, sir, said he, pointing to 
a tliicket of trees ; ihy heart trembles for fear they 
have seen us, and heard you speak ; if they have^ 
they will certainly murder us all.— -Have they any 
fire-arms ? said I. He answered they had only two 
pieces, one of which they lefb in the boat. Well 
then, said I, leave the rest to me ; I see they are all 
asleep, it is an easy thing to kill them all; but shall 
we rather take them prisoners ? He told me there 
were two desperate villains among them, that it was 
scarce safe to shew anv mercy to ; but if they were 
secured, he believed all the rest would return to their 
duty. I asked him which they were ? He told me 
he could not at that distance distinguish them, but 
be would obey my orders in any thing I would 
direct. Well, savs I, let us retreat out of their 
view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will re- 
solve further. So they willingly went back with 
me, till the woods covered us from them. 

Look you, sir, said I, if 1 venture upon your de-

liyerance, are you willing to make two conditions 
with me? He anticipatect my proposals, by telling 
me, that both he and the ship) if recovered, should 
be wholly directed and commanded by me in every 
thing ; and, if the ship was not recovered, he would 
live and die with me in what part of the world so- 
ever I would send him; and the two other men said 
the same. Well, says I, my conditions are but two: 
first, That while you stay in this island with me, you 
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I 
put arms in your hands, you will, upon all occa- 
sions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to 
me or mine upon this island; and in the mean time, 
be governed by my orders: secondly, That if the 
ship is, or may be recovered, you will carry me 
and my man to England passage free. 

He gave me all the assurances that the invention 
or faith of man could devise, that he would comply 
with these most reasonable demands; and, besides, 
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon 
all occasions as long as he lived. Well 3)en, said 
I, here are three muskets for you, with powder and 
ball: tell me next what you think is proper to be 
done. He showed all the testimonies of his grati- 
tude .that he was able, but offered to be wholly 
guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard 
venturing any thing; but the best method I could 
think of was to fire upon them at once, as they lay, 
and if any was not killed at the first volley, and of- 
fered to submit, we might save them, and so put it 
wholly upon God*s providence to direct the shot. 
b[e said ver^ modestly, that he was loath to kill 
them, if he could help it: but that those two were 
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of 
all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we 
should be undone still ; for they would- ^ on board 
and bring the whole ship's coiiipany, and cbstroy us

M* Well then, says I, necessity legitimates my ad-* 
vice, for it is the only way to save our lives. How- 
ever, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I 
told him they should go themselves, and manage as 
they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of 
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on 
their feet. I asked him if either of them were the 
heads of the mutiny? He said no. Well then, said 
I, you may let them escape ; and Providence seems 
to have awakened them on purpose to save them- 
selves. Now, says I, if the rest escape you, it is your 
fault. Animated with this, he took the musKet I 
had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, 
and his two comrades with him, with each a piece 
in his hand ; the two men who were with him going 
first, made some noise, at which one of the seamen 
who was awake turned about, and seeing them com- 
ing, cried out to the rest ; but it was too late then, 
for the moment he cried out they fired ; I mean the 
two men, the captain wisely reserving his own piece. 
They had so well aimed their shot at the men they 
knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and 
the other very much wounded; but not being dead, 
he started up on his feet, and called eagerly for help 
to the other ; but th^ captain stepping to him, told 
him it was too late to cry for help, he should call 
upon God to forgive his villainy ; and with that word 
knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so 
that he never spoke more : there were three more in 
the company, and one oi them was also slightly 
wounded. By this time I was come; and when they 
saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, 
they begged for mercy. The captain told them he 
would spare their lives, if they would give him any 
assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery they 
had been guilty of, ^nd would swear to be faitjvful to

him in recoveHhg the ship, and afterwards in carry'* 
ing her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. 
They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity 
that could be desired, and he was willing to beliere 
them, and spare their lives, which I was not against, 
onlv that I obliged him to keep them bound hand 
and foot while 3iey were on the island. 

While tliis was doing, I sent Friday with the 
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure 
her, and bring away the oars and sails, which they 
did: and by mid by three straggling men, thai 
were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came 
back upon hearing the guns fired, and seeing the 
captain, who before was their prisoner, now their 
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also ; and 
80 our victory was complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should 
inquire into one another's circumstances : I began 
first, and told him my whole history, whidi be 
heard with en attention even to amazement ; and 
narticulariy at the wonderfiil manner of my being 
tumished with provisions and ammunition ; and, in- 
deed, as my story i» a whole collection of wonder*^ 
it a&cted dim deeply. But when he reflected from 
thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have 
been preserved there on purpose to save his lifie, 
the tears ran down his face, and he could not 
speak a word more. After this commumcation 
was at an end, I carried him^and his two men into 
my apartment, leading them in just where I came 
out, viz. at the top of the house, where I refireshed 
them with such provisions as I had, and showed 
them all the contrivances I had made, during my 
long, long inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all i said to them, was per« 
fectly amazing ; but, above idl, the captain admir*

sealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, 
having been now planted near twenty years, and the 
trees growing much faster than in England, was be-^ 
eome a little wood, and so thick, that it was im- 
passable in any part of it, but at that one side where 
I had reserved my little winding passage into it. £ 
told him this was my castle and my residence, but 
that I had a seat in the country, as most princes 
have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I 
would show him that too another time : but at pre-* 
sent our business was to consider how to recover the 
«hip« He agreed with me as to that ; but told me, 
he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, 
- for that there were still six and twenty hands on 
board, who having entered into a cursed conspiracy, 
by which they had all forfeited their lives to the 
law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, 
and would carry it on, knowing that, if they were 
tttbdued, they would be brought to Uie gallows, as 
soon as they came to England, or to any of the 
English colonies ; and that, therefore, there would 
be no attacking them with so small a number as we 
were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, 
and found it was a very rational conclusion, and 
that, therefore, something 'was to be resolved on 
speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some 
snare for their surprise, as to prevent their landing 
upon us, and destroying us. Upon this, it present- 
ly occurred to me, that in a little while the ship's 
cnsw, wondering nt^hat was become of their com- 
rades, and of the boat, would certainly come on 
shore in their other boat, to look for them ; and 
that then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be 
too strong for us : this he allowed to be rationsd. 
Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do 
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, 
2c2

2&2 ADVEKTURES OV 

80 that they might not carry her off:, and taking 
e^ery thing out of her, leave her so far Bselew 
as not to be fit to swim : accordingly we went on 
board, took the arms which were left on board out 
of her, and whatever else we found there, which was 
a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few bis* 
cuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of 
sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar was five or 
six pounds) ; all which was very welcome to me, 
especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had 
none lefl for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore^ 
(the oars, mast, sail and rudder of the boat were 
carried away before, as above,) we knocked a great 
hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong 
enough to niaster us, yet they could not Carry off 
the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thou^ts 
that we could be able to recover the ship ; but my 
view was, that if they went away without the boat, 
I did not much question to make her fit again to 
carry us to the Leeward Islands, and call upon ouir 
friends the Spaniards in my way ; for I had them 
still in my thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and 
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat upon 
the beach so high, that the tide would not float 
her off at high water mark, and besides, had broke 
a hole in her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, 
and were set down musing what we should do, we 
heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft 
with her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on 
board : but no boat stirred ; and they fired several 
times, making other signals for the boat. At last,, 
when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, 
and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, 
by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and 
row towards the i^ore ; and we found, as they ap<«

proached, that there were up less than ten men in 
her, and that they had fire-arms with them. 

As the ship lay ahnost two leagues from the shore* 
we had a full view of then as they came, and a 

Elain sight even of their &ces ; because the tidie 
aving set them a little to the east of the other 
boat, they rowed up under shore, to come to the 
same place where the other had landed, and where 
the boat lay ; by this means, 1 say, we had a full 
view of them, and the captain knew the persons and 
characters of all the men in the boat, of whom, he 
said, there were three very honest fellows, who, he 
was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, 
being overpowered and frightened ; but that as for 
the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief officer 
among them, andall the rest, they were as outrageous 
as any of the ship's crew^ and were no doubt made 
desperate in their new enterprise ; and terribly appre- 
hensive he was that they would be too powerful torus, 
I smiled at him, and told him that men in our cir- 
cumstances were past the operation of fear ; that 
seeing almost every condition that could be was 
better than that which we were supposed to be in^ 
we ought to expect that the consequence, wh^her 
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. 
I asked him what he diought of the circumstances 
of my life, and whether a deliverance were not 
worth venturing for ? And where, sir, said I, is 
your belief of my being preserved here on purpose 
to save your life^ which elevated you a little while 
ago ; for my part, said I, there seems to me but 
pne thing amiss in all the prospect q£ it. What is 
that? says he. Why, said I, it is, that as you say 
there are Uiree or four honest fellows among them, 
which cdiQuld be spared, liad they been all of the 
^cked part of the crew i should have thought

them into your hands ; for depend upon it, every 
man that comes ashore are our own, and shall die 
or live as they behave to us. As J spoke this- with 
a raised voice and che erful countenance, I found it 
greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to 
our business. 

We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's 
coming from the shif , considered of separating our 
prisoners ; and we had, indeed, secured them effect- 
ually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less 
assured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one 
of the three delivered men, to my cave, where they 
were remote enough, and out of danger of being 
heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of 
the woods if they could have delivered themselves : 
here they left tKem bound, but gave them provi- 
sions ; and promised them, if they continued there 
quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two ; 
but that if they attempted their escape, they should 
be put to deatli without mercy. Thev promised 
faithfully to bear their confinement witli patience, 
and were very thankful that they had such good 
usage as to have provisions and light left them ; 
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made our- 
selves) for their comfort ; and they did not know 
but that he stood sentinel over them at the en« 
trance.. 

The other prisoners had better usage ; two of 
them were kept pinioned, indeed, because the cap- 
tain was not free to trust them ; but the othec two 
were taken into my service, upon the captam's re-* 
commendation, and upon their solemnly engaging 
to live and die with us ; so with them and the three 
honest men we were seven men well armed ; and 
I made no doubt we should be able to deal well 
enough with the ten that were coming, considering 
that the ci^tam had tISad there were three or four

hodest men among them also. As soon as they got 
to the place where their other boat lay, they ran 
their boat into the beach, and came all on shore, 
hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to 
8ee ; for I was afraid they would rather have left the 
boat at an anchor, some distance from the shore, 
with some hands in her, to guard her, and so we 
should not be able to seize the boat. Being on 
shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to their 
other boat ; and it was easy to see they were under 
a great surprise to find hetiAripped, as above, of all 
that was in her, and a gpeat hole in her bottom. 
After they had mused a while upon this, they set up 
two or three great shouts, hollowing with all their 
might, to try if they could make their companions 
hear; but all was to no purpose: then they came 
all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small 
arms, which, indeed, we heard, and the echoes made 
the woods ring ; but it was all one ; those in the 
cave we were sure could not hear, and those in our 
keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet 
durst give no answer to them. They were so asto- 
nished at the surprise of this, that, as they told us 
afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again, 
to their ship, and let them know that the men were 
all murdered, and the long-boat staved ; according-^ 
ly, they immediately launched their boat again, and 
got all of them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even con- 
founded at this, believing they would go on board 
the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades 
over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, 
which he was in hopes we should have recovered t 
but he was quickly as much frightened the other 
way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, but 
we perceived them all coming on shore again; but

with this new measure id their coaduct, which it 
$eemB they consulted together upon, viz, to leave 
(hree men in the boat, and the rest to eo on shore, 

' and go up into the country to look for £eir fellows. 
This was a great disappointment to us, for now we 
were at a loss what to do; as our seising those 
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us, 
if we let the boat escape ; because they would then 
row away to the ship, and then the rest of them 
would be siire to weigh and set sail, and »o our re- 
covering the ship would be lost. However, we had 
no remedy but to wait a#d see what the issue of 
things might present. The seven men came, on 
shore, and the three who remained in the boat put 
her off to a good distance from the shore, and came 
to an anchor to wait for them ; so that it was im- 
possible for us to come at them in the boat. Those 

. that came on shore, kept close together, marching 
towards the top of the little hill under which my ha- 
bitation lay ; and we could see them plainly, though 
they coula not perceive us. We could have been 
very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that 
we might have fired at them, or that they would 
have gone farther off, that we might have come 
abroad. But when they were come to the brow of the 

' hill, where they could see a great way into the valleys 
and woods, which lay towards die north-east part, 
and where the island lay lowest, they shoutea and 
hollowed till they were weary ; and not cartne, it 
seems, to venture far from the shore, nor foir from 
one another, they sat down together under a tree^ 
to' consider of it. Had they thought fit to have mowm 
to sleep there, as the other part of them had done, 
they had done the Job for us ; but they were too full 
of apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, 
though they could not tell what the dmger waa they 
bad ^0 fear neither.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon 
this consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they 
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make 
their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon 
them, just at the juncture when their pieces were 
all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and 
we should have been without bloodshed. I liked this 
proposal, provided it was done while we were near 
enough to come up to them before they could load 
their pieces again. But this event did not happen ; 
and we lay still a long time, very irresolute what 
course to take. At length I told them there would 
be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; and 
then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps 
we might find a way to get between them and the 
shore, and so might use some stratagem with them 
in the boat to get them on shore. We waited a 
great while, though very impatient for their remov- 
ing ; and were very uneasy, when, after long con- 
sultations, we saw them all start up, and march down 
towards the sea: it seems they had such dreadful 
apprehensions upon them of the danger of the place, 
that they resolved to go on board the ship again, 
give their companions over for lost, and so go on 
with their intended voyage with the ^ip. 

.As soon as I perceived them to go towards the 
shore, I imagined it to be, as it really was, that 
they had given over their search, and were for go- 
ing back again ; and the captain, as soon as I told 
him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the appre- 
hensions of it: but I presently thought of a stratagem 
to fetch them back again, and which answered my 
end to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain's 
mate to go over the little creek westward, towards 
the place where the savages came on shore when 
Friday was rescued, and as soon as th^y came to a 
little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I 
bade them hollow out, as loud as they could, and waii

till they found the seamen heard them ; that as soon 
as ever they* heard the seamen answer them, they 
should return it again; and then keepins out of 
tight, take a round, always answering n^en the 
others hollowed, to draw them as far into the island, 
and amonj^ the woods, as possibly, and then wheel 
about again to me, by such ways as I directed them. 
They were just going into the boat when Friday 
and tlie mate hollowed: and they presently heard 
them, and answering, run along the shore west- 
ward, towards the voice they heard, when they 
were presently stopped by the creek, where the wa- 
ter being up, they could not get over, and called 
for the boat to come up and set them over ; as, in- 
deed, 1 expected. When they had set themselves 
over, I observed that the boat being gone a good 
way into the creek, and, as it were^ in a harbour 
within the land, they took one of the three men out 
of her, to go ^ong with them, and left only two in 
the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little 
tree on the shore. This was what I wished for ; 
and immediately leaving Friday and the captain's 
mate to their business, 1 took the rest with me, and 
crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised 
the two men before they were aware ; one of them 
lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat. 
The fellow on shore was between sleeping and 
waking, and going to start up ; the captain, who, 
was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him 
down; and Uien called out to him in Uie boat to 
yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very 
few arguments to persuade a single man to yield, 
when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade 
knocked down ; besides, this was, it seems, one of 
the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as 
the rest of the crew, and therefore was easily per- 
suaded not only to yield, but afterwards to join very 
sincerely.with us. In the mean time, FViday and

the c^tun's mate so well managed thar bu^inesa 
with uie re&t, that they drew them> by hollowing 
and answering, from one hill to another, and from 
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired 
them, but left them where they were very sure they 
could not reach back to the boat before it was dark; 
and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves 
also, by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them 
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make 
sure work with them. It was several hours after 
Friday came back to me before they came back to 
their boat ; and we could hear the foremost of them, 
long before they came quite up, calling to those be^ 
hind to come along ; and could also hear them answer, 
and complain how lame and tired they w^e, and not 
able to comeany faster; which was very welcomenews 
to us. At length they came up to the boat: but it 
is impossible to express their confusion when they 
found the boat fkst aground in the creek, the tide 
ebbed out, and their two men gone. We could hear 
them call to one another in a molt lamentable man- 
ner, telling one another they were got into an en- 
chanted island ; that either there were inhabitants 
in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there 
were devils and spirits in it, and they should be all 
carried away and devoured, Thev hollowed again, 
and called tneir two comrades by their names a great 
many times ; but no answer. After some time, we 
could see them, by the little light there was, run 
about, wringing their hands like men ih despair; 
and that sometimes they would go and sit down in the 
boat, to rest themselves ; then cornea shore again, and 
walk about affain, and so the same thinjr over again«

them, and kill as few of them as I could ; and espe* 
cially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of 
our men, knowing the others were very well armed. 
I resolved to wait, to see if they did not separate ; 
and, therefore, to make sure of them, I d^rew my 
ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday add the cap- 
tain to creep upon their hands and feet, as close to 
the ground as they could, that they might not be 
discovered, and get as near them as they could pos- 
sibly, before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, when 
the boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of 
the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most 
dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking 
towards them, with two more of the crew : the cap- 
tain was so eager at having this principal rogue so 
much in his power, that he could hardly have pa- 
tience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, 
for they only heard his tongue before : but when 
they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting 
up on their feet, let fly at them. The boatswain 
was killed upon the spot ; the next man was shot 
into the body, and fell just by him, though he did 
not die till an hour or two after ; and the third run 
for it. At the noise of the fire, I immediately ad- 
vanced with my whole ^my, which was now eight 
men, viz. myself, generalissimo ; Friday, my lieu- 
tenant-general ; the captain and his two men, and 
the three prisoners of war, whom we had trusted 
with arms. We came upon them, indeed, in the 
dark, so that they could not see our number ; and 
I made the man they had left in the boat, who was 
now one of us, to call them by name, to try if I 
could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps 
reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we 
desired : for, indeed it was easy to think, as their 
condition then was^ they would be very, willing to

ettpitulate. So he calls out, as loud as he could, to 
one of them, Tom Smith ! Tom Smith ! Tom Smith 
answered immediately, Is that Robinson ? For it 
seems, he knew the voice. The other answered, 
Aye, aye ; for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down 
your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this 
moment. — Who must we yield to? Where are they? 
says Smith again. Here they are, sdys he ; here's 
Our captain and fifty men with him, have been 
hunting you these two hours : the boatswain is kill- 
ed. Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and 
if you do not yield, you are all lost. — Will they give 
us quarter then ? says Tom Smith, and we will yield. 
— I will go ask, if you promise to yield, says Robin- 
son : so he asked the captain ; and the captain him- 
self then calls out, You, Smith, you know my voice; 
if you lay down your arms immediately, and submit, 
you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins. 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, For God's sake, 
captain, give me quarter ; what have I done ? They 
have all been as bad as I : which, by the way, was 
not true neither; for, it se^ems, this Will Atkins 
was the first man that laid hold of the captain, 
when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, 
in tying his hands, and giving him injurious lan- 
guage. However, the captain told him he must 
lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the 
governor's mercy : by which he meant me, for they 
all called me governor. In a word, they all laid 
down their arms, and begged their lives ; and I 
sent the man that had parlied with them, and two 
more, who bound them all; and then my great 
army of fifty men, which, particularly with those 
three, were in all but eight, came up and seized 
upon them, and upon their boat ; only that I kept 
myself and one more out of sight for reasons of 
state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think 
of seizing the ship : and as for the captain, now he 
had leisure to parley with them, he expostiilirted 
with them upon the villainy of their practices with 
him, and at length upon the further wickedness of 
their design, and how certainly it must bring them 
to misery and distress in the end, and perhdips to 
the gallows, ^hey all appeared very penitent, and 
begged hard for their lives* As for that, he told 
them they were none of his prisoners, but the com^ 
mander*s of the island; that they thought they had 
set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island ; 
but it had pleased God so to direct them, that it 
was inhabited, and that the governor was an Eng- 
lishman ; that he might hang them all there, if he 
pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, he 
supposed he would send them to England, to be 
dealt ¥rith there as justice required, except Atkins, 
whom he was commanded by the governor to ad- 
vise to prepare for death, tor that he would be> 
hanged m the morning. 

'niough this was all but a fiction of his own, yet 
it had its desired effect : Atkins fell i:q)on his knees, 
to beg the captain to intercede with the governor 
for his life ; and all the rest be^ed of him, for God's 
sake, that they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me, ihat the time of oar de- 
liverance was come, and that it would be i| most 
easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in 
getting possession of the ship ; so I retired in the 
durk from them, that they might not see what kind 
of a governor thev had, and* called the captain to 
me : wh&k 1 called, as at a good dbtance, one of 
tlie men was ordered to speak again, and say to 
the captain, Captain, the commander ealls for you; 
and [Hresently the captain replied, Tell his ezcdlency 
I am just a-coming. This more perfectly amused

them, and Uiey all believed that the commander 
was Just by wiUi his fifty men. Upon the captain's 
Gommg to me, I told him my project for seizdng the 
ship, which he liked wondemilly well, and resohred 
to put it in execution the next morning. But, in 
oraer to execute it with more art, and to be secure 
of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, 
and that he should go and take Atkins, and two 
more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned 
to the cave where the others lay. This was com- 
mitted to Friday, and the two men who came on 
shore with the captain. They conveyed them to 
the cave, as to a prison : and it was, indeed, a dis- 
mal place, especially to men in their condition. The 
others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which 
I have given a full description; and as it was fenced 
in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough, 
considering they were upon their behaviour. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who 
was to enter into a parley with diem ; in a word, to 
try them, and tell me whether he thought they might 
be trusted or no to go on board and surprise the ship. 
He talked to them of the injury done him, of the 
condition they were brought to, and that though 
the governor had given them quarter for their lives 
as to the present action, yet that if they were sent 
to England, they would all be hanged in chains, to 
he sure ; but that if they would join in so just an 
attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the 
governor's engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal 
would be accepted hymen in their condition ; they 
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro- 
mised, with the deepest imprecations, that they 
would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that 
they should owe their lives to him, and would go 
wiw him all over the world ; that they would own

him as a father as long as they lived. Well, ssy% 
the captain, I must go and tell the governor what 
you say, and see what I can do to bring him to con- 
sent to it. So he brought me an account of the 
temper he found them in, and that he verily believed 
they would be faithful. However, that we might 
be very secure, I told him he should go back again 
and choose out those five, and tell them, that they 
might see he did not want men, that he would take 
out those five to be his o^ssistants, and that the go- 
vernor would keep the other two, and the three that 
were sent prisoners to the castle (my cave) as hos- 
tages for the fidelity of those five ; and that if they 
proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostage* 
should be hanged in chains alive on the shore. This 
looked severe, and convinced them that the governor 
was in earnest: however, they had no way left 
them but to accept it ; and it was' now the business 
of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to per- 
suade the other five to do their duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expe- 
dition : first, The captain, his mate and passenger : 
second, Then the two prisoners of the first gang, 
to whom, having their character from the captain, 
I had given their liberty, and trusted them with 
arms : third. The other two that I had kept till now 
in my bower pinioned, but, on the captain's motion, 
had now released: fourth, These five released at 
last ; so that they were twelve in ail, besides five 
we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture 
with these hands on board the ship : but as for me 
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper 
for us to stir, having seven men left behind ; and it 
was employment enough for us to keep them asun- 
der, and supply them with victuals. As to the five 
in die cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Fridaj

.went in twice a-day to them, to supply them with 
necessaries ; and I made the other two carry provi-^ 
sions to a certain distance, where Friday was to 
take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostage, it 
was with the captain, who told them I was the per<- 
son the governor had ordered to look after them ; 
and th^ it was the governor's pleasure they should 
not stir any where but by m^ direction ; that if they 
did, they would be fetched into the casUe, and be 
laid in irons : so that as we never suffered them to 
see me as a governor, I now appeared as another 
person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, 
the castle, and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but 
to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, 
and man them. He made his passenger captain of 
one, with four of the men ; ana himself, his mate, 
and five more, went in the other ; and they con- 
trived their business very well, for they came up to the 
shin about midnight. As soon 4is they came within 
call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and 
tell them the^ had brought off the men and the boat, 
but that it was a long time before they had found 
them, and the like, holding them in a chat till they 
came to the ship's side ; when the captain and the 
mate entering nrst, with their arms, immediately 
knocked down the second mate and carpenter with 
the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully 
seconded by their men ; they secured all the rest 
that were upon t)ie main and quarter-decks, and 
began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down 
that were below ; when the other boat and their 
men entering at the fore-chains, secured the fore- 
castle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down 
into the cook-room, making three men thr^ found 
there prisoners. When this was done, and all safe

upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three 
men, to break into the round-house, where the new 
rebel captain lav, who having taken the alarm, had 
got up, and with two men and a boy had got fire- 
arms in their hands ; and when the mate, with a 
crow, split open the door, the new captain and 
his men fired boldly among them, and wounded 
the mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm 
and wounded two more of the men, but killed no- 
body. The mate calling for help, rushed, however 
into the round-house, wounded as he was, and with 
his pistol shot the new captain through the head 
the bullet entering at his mouth, and came out 
again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke, 
a word more ; upon which the rest yielded, and the 
ship was taken effectually, without any more live* 
lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain 
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the sLnal 
agreed upon with me to give me notice of his suc- 
cess, which you may be sure I was very glad to hear 
having sat watching upon the shore for it till near 
two o clock m the morning. Having thus heard the 
si^al plainly, I laid me down; and it having been 
a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till 
1 Was something surprised with the noise of a eun • 
and presently starting up, I heard a man call me by 
the name of Governor, Governor, and presently I 
knew the captain's voice ; when climbing up to the 
top of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the

Inrouglit her to an anchor just against the mouth of 
the little creek ; and the tide being up» the captain 
had brought the pinnace in near the place where I 
at first landed my rafbs, and so landed just at my 
door. I was at first ready to sink down with the 
surprise ; for 1 saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly 
put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship 
just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. 
At first, for some time, I was not able to answer 
bim one word ; but as he had taken me in his arm8> 
I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the 
ground. He perceived the surprise, and immedi* 
ately pulls a bottle out of his pocket, and gave 
me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on 
purpose for me. After I had drank it, I sat down 
upon the ground ; and though it brought me to 
myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak 
8 word to him. All this time the poor man was in 
as great an ecstacy as I, only not under any sur- 
prise, as I was ; and he said a thousand kind and 
tender things to me, to compose and bring me to 
myself: but such was the flood of joy in my breast, 
that it put all my spirits into confusion ; at last it 
broke out into tears ; and in a little while after I re- 
covered my speech. I then took my turn, and em- 
braced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced to- 
gether. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent • 
from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole trans- 
action seemed to be a chain of wonders ; that such 
things as these were the testimonies we had of a se- 
cret hand of Providence governing the world, and 
an evidence that the eye of an infinite power could 
search into the remotest corner of the world, and 
send help to the miserable whenever he pleased* I 
forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to 
Heaven ; and what heart could forbear to bless him,

for me in tuch a wilderness, and in such a desolate 
condition, but from whom every deliverance must 
alwavB be acknowledged to proceed ? 

V^ hen we had talked a while, the captain told me 
he had brought me some little refreshment, such as 
the ship a£Porded, and such as the wretches that had 
been so long his masters had not plundered him of« 
Upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bade his 
men bring the thinj^s ashore that were for the gover- 
nor ; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been 
one that was not to be carried awav with them, but 
as if I had been to dwell upon the island still. First, 
he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent 
cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine 
(the bottles held two quarts each) two pounds of 
excellent sood tobacco, twelve good pieces of the 
ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of 
pea«, and about an hundred weight of biscuit : he 
also brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a 
bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice, 
and abundance of other things. But, besides these, 
and what was a thousand times more useful to me, 
he brought me six new clean shirts, six very good 
neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a 
hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good 
suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but 
very little ; in a word, he clothed me from bead to 
foot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as 
any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances ; 
but never was any thing in the world of that kind so 
unpleasant, awkward, and unoasy, as it was to me 
to wear such cloches at first. 

After these ceremonies were past, aiid after all 
his good things were brought into my little apart- 
ment, we began to consult what was to be done with 
the prisoners we had ; for it was worth considering 
. whether we . might venture' to take them away

wfth US or no, especially two of them, whom he 
knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last 
degree ; and the captain said he knew they were 
such rogues, that there was no obliging them ; and 
if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as 
malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the 
first English colony he could come at ; and I found 
that the captain himself was very anxious about it. 
Upon this I told him, that if he desired it, I would 
undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make 
it their own request that he should leave them upon 
the island. I should be very glad of that, says the 
captain, with all my heart. — Well, says I, I will send 
ibr them up, and talk with them for you. So I caused 
Priday and the two hostages, for they were now dis- 
charged, their comrades having performed their pro- 
mise; I'say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring 
up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, 
and keep them there till I came. After some time, I 
came thither dressed in my new habit ; and now I 
was called governor again. Being all met,' and the 
captain with me, I caused the men to be brought 
bdbre me, and I told them I had got a full account 
of their villainous behaviour to the captain, and how 
they had run away with the sliip, and were prepar- 
ing to commit farther robberies, but that Providence 
iiad ensnared them in their own ways, and that they 
were fallen into the pit which they had dug for others. 
I let them know that by my direction the ship had 
been seized; that she lay now in the road; and 
they might see, by and by, that their new captain 
had received the reward of his villainy, and that they 
would see him hanging at the yard-arm : that as to 
them, I wanted to know what they had to say why I 
should not execute them as pirates, taken in the 
fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but 
I had authority so to do.

One of them answered in the name of the raat, 
that they had Qothing to say but this^ that when 
they were taken, the captain promised them their 
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy. But I 
told them I Knew not what mercy to show them ; 
for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island 
with all my men, and had taken passage with the 
captain to go for England ; and as for £e captain, 
he could not carry them to England other than as 
prisoners, in irons, to be tried ror mutiny* and nm- 
ning away with the ship ; the consequeaee of which, 
they must needs know, would foe the gallows ; so 
that I could not tdl what was best for £em, unieas 
thqr had a mind to take their fate in the island ; ii 
they desired that, as I had lib^ty to leave the island, 
1 had some inclination to give them their lives, if 
they thought thev could shift on shore. They 
seemed very thankful for it, and said they would 
much rather venture to stay there than be carried to 
England to be hanged : so I left it on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some diffi- 
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there. 
Upon thi$ I seemed a little angry with the captain, 
and told him that they were my prisoners, not his ; 
■and that seeing I had offered them so much favour, 
I would be as good as my word ; and that if he did 
not think fit to consent to it I would set them at 
libertj, as I found them ; and if he did not like it, 
he might take them again if he could catch them. 
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I ac- 
cordingly set them at liberty, and bade ihem retire 
into the woods to the place whence they came, and 
I would leave them some fire-arms, some ammuni- 
tion, and some directions how they should live very 
well, if they thousht fit. Upon this I prepared to

cause the new captain, who was killed, to be hang-

When the captain was gone, 1 sent for the men 
up to me to my apartment, and entered seriously into 
discourse with them on their circumstances. I told 
them 1 thought they had made a right choice ; that 
if the captain had carried them away, they would 
certainly be hanged. - I showed them the new cap-

them they had nothing less to expect. 

When tliey had all declared their willingness to 
stay, I then told them I would let them into the 
story of my living there, and put them into the way 
of making it easy to them : accordingly, I gave them 
the whole history of the place, and ofmy coming to 
it ; showed them my fortifications, the way I made 
my bread, planted my com, cured my grapes ; and, 
in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. 
I told them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards 
timt were to be expected, for whom I left a letter, 
and made them promise to treat them in common 
with themselves. Here it may be noted, that the 
oaptain had ink on board, who was ^eatly surprised 
that 1 never hit upon a way of making ink of char- 
coal and water, or of something else, as I had done 
things much more difficult. 

I left them my fire-arms, viz. five muskets, three 
fowling-pieces, and three swords. I had above a 
barrel and a half of powder left ; fdr after the first 
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I 
gave them a description of the wajr I managed the 
goats, and directions to milk and mteii them, and 
to make both hotter and cheese : in a word, I eove 
-Ihem every part e£mj own story;, and told mem

I should prevail with the captain to leave them two 
barrels or gunpowder more» and some garden-seeds, 
which 1 told them I would have been very glad of: 
also I gave them the bag of peas which the captain 
had brought m^ to eat, and bade them be sure to 
sow and increase them. 

Having done all thii^ I left them the next day, 
and went on board the ship. We prepared immedi- 
ately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The 
next morning early, two of the five men came 
swimming to the ship*s side, and making a most la- 
mentable complaint of the other three, begged to 
be taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they 
should be murdered, and begged the captain to take 
them on board, though he hanged them immedi- 
ately. Upon this, the captain pretended to have no 
power without me ; but after some difficulty, and 
after their solemn promises of amendment, they 
were taken on board, and were some time after 
soundly whipped and pickled: after which they 
proved very honest and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on 
inhere, the tide being up, with the things promised 
to the men ; to which the captain, at my interces- 
sion, caused tlieir chests and clothes to be added, 
which they took, and were very thankful for. I 
also encouraged them, by telling them that if it lay 
in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I 
would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this island, I carried on 
boiM^d, for reliques, the great goat-skin cap I had 
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots ; also I 
forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, 
ifhich had lain by me so long useless, that it wag 
grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass for 
silver, till it had been a little rubbed and handled ; 
HS also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish

ship. And thus I leflt the island, the 19th of De« 
cember, as I found by the ship's account, in the 
year 1686, after I had been upon it eight and twenty 
years, two months, and nineteen days ; being deli-t 
vered from this second captivity the same day of th^ 
month that I first made my escape in the long-boat, 
from among the Moors of Sallee. In this vessel, after 
a long voyage, I arrived in England the 1 1th of June, 
in the year 1687, having been thirty-five years absent. 

When I came to England, 1 was as perfect a stran-^ 
ger to all the world ?is if 1 had never been known 
there. My benefactor and faithful steward, whom 
i had4eft my money in trust with, was alive, but 
(lad had great misfortunes in the world ; was be- 
come a widow the second tiipe, and very low in the 
world. I made her very easy as to what she owed 
me, assuring her I would give her no trouble ; but, 
on the contrary, in gratitude for her former care 
and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little 
stock would afford ; which, at that tipie, would in- 
deed allow me to do but little for her ; but I as-i 
sured her I would never forget her former kindness 
\o me ; nor did I forget her when 1 had su^cient 
to help her, as shall be observed in its proper place. 
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire ; but my fa- 
ther was dead, and my mother and all the family 
extinct, except that 1 found two sisters, and two of 
the children of one of my brothers ; and as I had 
beeq long ^go given over for dead, there had been 
no provision made for me : so that, in a word, £ 
found nothing to relieve or assist me ; and that die 
little money 1 had would not do much for me as to 
settling iii the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which 
I did not expect ; and this was, that the master of 
the ship whom I had so happily delivered, and by 
ihe same means saved the ship and cargo, having

S14 ADVSKTVKBi OF 

given a very handsome account to the owners of the 
manner how I had saved the lives of the men, and 
the ship, thej invited me to meet them, and some 
other merchants concerned, and all together made 
me a very handsome compliment upon the subject, 
and a present of almost 2001. sterling. 

But after making several reflections upon the cir- 
cumstances of my life, and how little way this would 
go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to 
eo to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some 
mformation of the state of my plantation in the 
Brazils, and of what was become of my partner, 
who, I had reason to suppose, had some years past 
given me over for dead. With this view I took 
uiipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April fol* 
lowing; my man Friday accompanying me very 
honestly in all these ramblings, and provmg a most 
fiuthful servant upon all occasions. When I came 
to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my par- 
ticular satisfaction, my old friend the captain or the 
riiip who first took me up at sea, off the shore of 
Africa. He was now grown old, and had left off 
going to sea, having put his son, who was far from 
a young man, into his ship, and who still used the 
Brazil trade. The old man did not know me ; and, 
indeed, i hardly knew him : but I soon brought him 
to my remembrance, and as soon brought myself to 
his remembrance, when I told him who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old ac- 
quaintance between us, I inquired, you may be sure, 
uter my plantation and my partner. The old man 
told me he had not been in the Brazils for about 
nine years ; but that he could assure me, that when 
he came away my partner was living ; but the trus- 
tees, whom 1 had joined with him to take cogniz- 
ance of my paft, were both dead: that, however, 
he believea I would have a very good account of ^

KOBIKSOM CRUSOE. SI 5 

improvement of the plantation ; for that upon the 
general belief of my beinp; cast away and drowned, 
my trustees had given in the account of the produce 
of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, 
who had appropriated it, in case I never came to 
claim it, one-third to the king, and two-thirds to 
the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for 
the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of 
the Indians to the Catholic faith ; but that if I ap- 
peared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance. 
It would be restored ; only that the improvement, 
or annual production, being distributed to charita- 
ble uses, could not be restored : but he assured me 
that the steward of the king's revenue from lands, 
and the proviedore, or steward of the momiterjr, 
had tiMLOD gieat care all along that die ncwidbeBt, 
that is to say, my partner, gave every year a faith- 
ful account of the produce, of which they had duly 
received my moiety* I asked him if he knew to 
what height of improvement he had brought the 
plantation, and whether he thought it might be 
worth lookine after ; or whether^ on my going thi- 
ther, I should meet with any obstruction to my pos- 
sessing my just right in the moiety. He told me he 
could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation 
was improved, but this he knew, that my partner 
was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying hb 
part of it ; and that, to the best of his remembrance, 
he had heard that the king's third of my part, which 
was, it seems,^ granted away to some otner monas- 
tery or religious house, amounted to above two 
hundred moidores a-year : that as to my being re- 
stored to a quiet possession of it, there was no ques- 
tion to be made of that, my partn^ being alive to 
witness my title, and my name being also enrolled 
in the register of the country : also he told me, 
that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair 
^ s <7

'316 AdVBNTURES OS* 

honest people, and very wealthy ; and he believed I 
would not only have their assistance for putting me 
in possession, but would find a very considerable 
sum of money in their hands for my account, being 
the produce of the farm while their fathers held the 
trust, and before it was given up, as above ; which, 
as he remembered, was for about twelve years. 

I showed myself a httle concerned ana uneasy at 
this account, and enquired of the old captain how 
it came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose 
of my effects, when he knew that I had made my 
will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, 
jny universal heir, &c. 

He told me that was true; but that as there was 
no proof of my Being dead, he could not act as ex- 
ecutor, until some certain account should come of 
my death ; and, besides, he was not willing to in- 
termeddle with a thing so remote : that it was true 
he had registered my will, and put in his claim ; 
and could he have given any account of my being 
dead or alive, he would have acted by procuration, 
and taken possession of the ingeino (so they called 
the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was 
now at the Brazils, orders to do it. But, says the 
old man, 1 have one piece of news to tell you, which 
perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest ; 
and that is, believing you were lost, and all the 
world believing so also, your partner and trustees 
did offer to account with me, in your name, for six 
or eight of the first years* profits, which I received. 
There being at that time great disbursements for 
increasing the works, building an ingeino, and buy- 
ing slaves, it did not amount to near so much as 
afterwards it produced : however, says the old man, 
I shall give you a true account of what 1 have re- 
. ceived in all, and how I have disposed ot it. 

After a few days farther conference with this an-

ROBINSON CRUAOE. 817 

cient friend, he brought me an account of the 
first six years' income of my plantation, signed 
by my partner and the merchant trustees, l^ng 
always delivered in goods, viz. tobacco in roll, and 
9ugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c. whidi 
is the consequence of a sugar-work ; and I found, 
by this account, that every year the income consi- 
derably increased ; but, as above, the disbursements 
being large, the sum at first was small : however, 
the old man let me see that he was debtor to me 
four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, besides 
sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of to- 
bacco, which were lost in his ship ; he having been 
shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven 
years after my leaving the place. The good man 
then began to complain of his misfortunes, and how 
he had been obliged to make use of my money to 
recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new 
ship. However, my old friend, says he, you shall 
not want a supply in your necessity ; and as soon 
as my son returns, you shall be fully satisfied. 
Upon this, he pulls out an old pouch, and ^ives me 
•one hundred and sixty Portugiu moidores in gold ; 
and giving the writings of his title to the ship, 
which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which 
he was a quarter-part owner, and his son another, 
he puts them both into my hands, for security of 
the rest. 

I was too much moved with the honesty and kind- 
ness of the po(H* man to be able to bear this ; and 
remembering what he had done for me, bow he had 
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had 
used me on all occasions« and particularly how sin- 
cere a friend he was now to me, I cocdd hardly re- 
frain weeping at what he had said to me ; therefore 
I asked him if his circumstances adnutted him to 
spare so muc^ money at that time, and if it would

318 ADVENTURES OF 

fiot Straiten him ? He told me he could not i^&y but 
it might straiten hini a little ; but, however, it was 
my money, and I might want it more than he. 

Every thing the good man said was full of afiec- 
tion, and I could hardly refrain from tears while he 

rke ; in short, I took one hundred of the nroi'- 
es, and called for a pen and ink to give him a 
receipt for them : then I returned him the rest^ 
and told him if ever I had possession of the planta* 
tion, I would return the otlier to him also (as, in« 
deed, I afterwards did) ; and that as to the bill of 
sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not take 
it by any means ; but that if I wanted the money, I 
found he was honest enough to pay me ; and if I 
did not, but came to receive what he gave me rea> 
son to expect, I would never have a penny more 
from him. 

When this was past, the old man asked me if he 
should put me into a method to make my claim to 
my plantation ? 1 told him 1 thought to go over to 
it myself. He said I might do so, if I pleased ; but 
that if I did not, there were ways enough to secure 
my right, and immediately to appropriate the pro« 
fits to my use : and as there were ships in the river 
of Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made 
me enter my name in a public register, with his af- 
fidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was alive, and 
that I was the same person who took up the land 
for the planting the said plantation at first. This 
being regularly attested by a notary, and a procura- 
tion affixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter 
of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at 
the place ; and then proposed my staymg with him 
till an account came of the return. 

Never was any thing more honourable than the 
proceedings upon this procuration ; for in less than 
seven months I received a large packet from th» 

Digitized by CjOOgle 



ROBINSOK CRUSOE. 519 

survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose 
account I went to sea, in which were the following 
particular letters and papers enclosed. 

First, there was the account-current of the pro- 
duce of my farm or plantation, from the year when 
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal 
captain, being for six years ; the balance appeared 
to be one thousand one hundred and seventy-four 
moidores in my favour. 

Secondly, There was the account of four years 
more, while they kept the estate in their hands» 
before the government claimed the administration, 
as being the effects of a person not to be found, 
which tney called civil death ; and the balance of 
this, the value of the plantation increasing, amount- 
ed to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six 
crusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred 
and forty moidores. 

Thirdly, There was the prior of Augustine's ac- 
count, who had received the profits for above, four- 
teen years ; but not being to account for what was 
disposed of bv the hospital, very honestly declared 
he had eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not 
distributed, which he acknowledged to my account:^ 
as to the king's part, that refunded nothing. 

There was a letter of my partner's, congratula- 
ting me very affectionately upon my being alive, 
giving me an account how the estate was improved, 
and what it produced a year ; with a particular of 
the number of squares or acres that it contained, 
how planted, how many slaves there were upon it, 
and making two and twenty crosses for blessings, 
told me he had said so many Ave- Marias to thank 
the blessed Virgin that I was alive ; inviting me very 
passionately to come over and take possession of my 
own ; and, in the mean time, to give him orders 
to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did not

come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of 
his friendship, and that of his family ; and sent me, 
as a present, seven fine leopards' skins, which h« 
bad, it seems, received from Africa, by some other 
ship that he had sent thither, and who, it seems, 
bad made a better voyage than I. He sent me also 
five chests of excellent sweatmeats, and a hundred 
pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moi«> 
dores. By the same fleet, my two merchant trus* 
tees shipped roe one thousand two hundred chests of 
sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest 
of tl^e whole account in ^old. 

I might well say now, mdeed, that the latter end 
of Job was better than die begmning. It is impoa- 
sible to express the flutterings of "my very heart, 
when I found all mv wealth about me t for as the 
Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same ships which 
brought my letters brought my goods : and the ef- 
fects were safe in the river before the letters came 
to my hand. In a word, I turned pale and grew 
sick ; and had not the old man rui) and fetched me 
acordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had over- 
set nature, and I had died upon the spot : nay, after 
that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours, till 
a physician being sent for, and something of the real 
cause of my illness bein|^ known, he ordered me to 
be let blood ; afler which I had relief, and grew 
well s but I verily believe, if I had not been eased 
by a vent given in that manner to the spirits, I 
should have died. 

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five 
thousand pounds sterling in money, and had an 
estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of 
above a thousand pounds a-year, ais sure as an estate 
of lands in England ; and, in a word, I was in a 
condition which I scarce Imew how to understand, 
or how to compose myself for the rajoyment of it.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. S21 

The first thing I did was to recompense my original 
benefactor, my good old captain, who had been first 
charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in my 
beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed 
him all that was sent to me ; I told him, that next 
to the providence of Heaven, which disposed all 
things, it was owing to him ; and that it now lay 
on me to reward him, which 1 would do a hundred- 
fold : so I first returned to him the hundred moidores 
I had received of him; thenl sent for a notary, 
and caused him to draw up a general release or dis- 
charge from the four hundred and seventy moidores, 
which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the 
fullest and firmest manner possible. After which 
I caused a procuration to be drawn, empowering 
him to be my receiver of the annual profits of my 
plantation, and appointing my partner to account 
with him, and make the returns by the usual fleets 
to him in my name ; and a clause m the end, being 
a grant of one hundred moidores a-year to him 
during his life, out of the effects, and fifty moidores 
a-year to his son after him, for his life : and thus I 
requited my old man. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my 
course next, and what to do with the estate that 
Providence had thus put into my hands ; and, in- 
deed, I had more care upon my head now than I had 
in my silent state of life in the island, where I 
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing 
but what I wanted ; whereas I had now a great 
charge upon me, and* my business was how to se- 
cure it. I had never a cave now to hide my money 
in, or a place where it might lie without lock or 
key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any 
body would meddle with it : on the contrary, I knew 
not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My 
4>ld patron, the captain, indeed^ was honest, and that

S2S ADVBNTURIBS OF 

was the onlv refuge I had. In the next place* my 
interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me thither ; 
but now I could not tell how to think of goin^ 
thither till 1 had settled my affiEiirs, and left my ef- 
fects in some safe hands behmd me. At first I thought 
of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, 
and would be just to me ; but then she was in years, 
and but poor, and, for ought I knew, might be in 
debt ; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go 
back to England myself, and take my effects witb 
me. 

It waa some months, howerer, before I resolved 
upon this; and therefore, as I had rewarded the old 
captain fuJlv, and to his satisfaction, who hsA been 
my former bene&ctor, so I. began to think of my 
poor widow, whose husband had been my firrit 
Denefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my 
fiuthful steward and instructor. So the first thing 
I did, I eot a merchant in Lisbon to write to h£ 
correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill, 
but to ffo find her out, and carry her in money a 
hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, and 
comfort tier in her poverty, by telling her she 
should, if I lived, have a further supply : at the same 
time I sent my two sisters in the country a hundred 
pounds each, they being, though not in want, yet 
not in very good circumstances ; one having been 
married and left a widow ; and the other having a 
husband not so kind to her as he should be. But 
among all my relations or acquaintances, I could 
not yet pitch upon one to whom I diirst commit the 

gross of my stock, that I might go away to the 
razils, and leave things safe behiira me ; and this 
greatly perplexed me. 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, 
and have settled myself there ; mr I was, as it were, 
naturalized to the place ; but I had some little 

Digitized by CjOOgle 



ROBINSON CRUSOfc. S23 

scruple in my mind about religion^ which insensibly 
drew me back. Howerer, it was not religion that 
kept me from going there for the present ; and as 
I had made no scruple of being openly of the reli- 
gion of the country all the while I was among them, 
so neither did I yet ; only that, now and then, hav- 
ing of late thought more of it than formerly, when 
I began to think of living and dying among them, 
I began to regret my having professed myself a 
papist, and thought it might not be the l>est re- 
ligion to die with. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing 
that kept me from going to the Brazils, but that 
really I did not know with whom to l^ve my effects 
behind me ; so I resolved, at last, to go to England 
with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should 
make some acquaintance, or find some relations that 
would be faithful to me ; and, ac<;ordingly, I pre* 
pared to go to England with all my wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, 
I first, the Brazil fleet being just going away, re- 
solved to give answers suitable to the just and faith^ 
ful account of things I had from thence ; and, first, 
to the prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of 
thanks for their just dealings, and the offer of the 
eight hundred fuold seventy-two moidores which were 
undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five 
hundred to the monastery, and t£u'ee hundred and 
seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should direct; 
desiring the good padre'« prayers for me, and the 
like. I wrote next a letter i^ thanks to my two 
trustees, with all the acknowledgement that so 
much justice and honesty called for ; as for sending 
them any present, they were far above having any 
occasion for it. Lastly, I wrote to my partner, ac- 
knowledging his mdusU|y in the improving the 
plantation, and Ins iategnty in increasing the stock

ef the works ; giving him instructions for his future 
government of my part, according to the powers J 
had left with my old patron, to whom I desired him 
to send whatever became due to me, till he should 
hear from me more particularly ; assuring him that 
it was my intention not only to come to him, but 
to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. 
To this I added a very handsome present of some 
Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for such 
the captaip's spn informed me he had ; with two 
pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I qould 

fet in Lisbon, five piepes of black baize, and some 
landers lace of a good value. 
Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, 
and turned all my effects into good bills of exchangei 
my next difficulty was, which way to go to England : 
I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and ye^ 
I had a strange aversion to go to England by sea a| 
that time ; and though I could give no reason fo^ 
it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, 
that though I ha4 pnce shipped my baggage, in 
order to go^, yet I altered my piinc)? ^nd that not 
once, but two or three times. 

It is true, I had been very unfortunnte by sea« 
and this might be some of the reasons ; but let no 
man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts 
in ca^es of such moment : twp of the ships which I 
had singled out to go in, I mean more particularly 
singled out than any other, having put my things on 
board one of them, and in the other to haye agreed 
with the captain; 1 say, two of these ships miscarried, 
viz. one was taken by the Algerines, sMsd the other was 
cast away on the Start, near Tprbay, an(l all the 
people drowned, ei^cept three ; so that in either of 
those vessels I had been made miserable. 

Haying been thus harassed in my thoughts, my 
old pilot, to whom I coBiaaimicated every thing^

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 325 

pressed me earnestly not to goby sea, but either to 
go by land tp the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of 
Biscay to Rochelle, n>oin whence it was but an easy 
and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais 
and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the 
way by land through France. In a word, I was so 
prepossessed against my going by sea at all, except 
from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel all 
the way by land : which, as I was not in haste, and 
did not value the charge, was by much the pleasant- 
er way: and to make it more so, my old captain 
brought an English gentleman, the son of a mer* 
chant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; 
after which we picked up two more English mer- 
cbauts also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, 
the last going t6 Paris only; so that in all there 
were six of us, and five servants; the two merchants 
and the two Portuguese contenting themselves with 
one servant between two, to save the charge; and 
as for me, I got an English sailor to travel ^ith me 
as a servant, besides my man Friday, who was too 
much a stranger to be capable of supplying the 
place of a servant on the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our 
company being very well mounted and armed, we 
made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour

As I have troubled you with none of my sea jour-

to us in this tedious and difficult journey. I must not 
omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us 
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time 
to see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth

dbservins ; but it being the latter part of the sum- 
mer, we iiastened away, and set out from Madrid 
about the middle of October: but when we came 
to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several 
towns on the way, with an account that so much 
«now was fallen on the French side of the moun- 
tains, that several travellers were obliged to come 
back to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an 
extreme hazard, to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it 
so, indeed: and to me, that had been always used 
to a hot climate, and to countries where I could 
scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufierable: 
nor, indeed, was it more painful than surprising, to 
come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where 
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and 
immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean moun- 
tains so very keen, so severely cold, as to be into- 
lerable, and to endianger benumbing and perishing 
of our fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw 
the mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold 
weather, which he had never seen or felt before in 
his life. To mend the matter, when we came to 
Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so much 
violence, and so long, that the people said winter 
was come before its time; and the roads, which 
were difficult before, were now quite impassable; 
for, in a word, the snow lay in some places too thick 
for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is 
the case in the northern countries, there was no 
going without being in danger of being buried alive 
every step. We staid no less than twenty days at 
Pampeluna; when seeing the winter coming on, 
and no likelihood of iu being better, for it was the 
severest winter all over Europe that had been known 
in the memory of man, I proposed that we should

all go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping 
for Bourdeaux, which was a very little Toyage. But 
while I was considering this, there came in four 
French gentlemen, who having been stopped on the 
French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, 
had found out a guide, who, traversing the country 
near the head of Languedoc, had brought them 
over the mountains by such ways, that they were 
not much incommoded with the snow< for where 
they met with snow in any quantity, they said it was 
frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses. 
We sent for this guide, who told us he would under- 
take to carry us the same way with no hazard from 
the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to 
protect ourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, 
upon these great snows it was frequent for some 
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the moun- 
tains, being made ravenous for want of food, the 
ground being covered with snow. We told him we 
werewellenough prepared for such creatures as they 
were, if he would insure us from a kind of two- 
legged wolves, which we were told, we were in most 
danger from, especially on the French side of the 
mountains. He satisfied us that there was no dan^ 
ger of that kind in the way that we were to go: so 
we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve 
other gentlemen, with their servants, some French, 
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go> 
and were obliged to come back again. 

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna, with 
our guide, on the 15th of November; and, indeed, 
I was surpised, when, instead of going forward, he 
came directly back with us on the same road that 
we came from Madrid, about twenty miles ; whea 
having passed two rivers, and come into the p^ain 
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate 
again, where the country was pleasant, and no snow

to be seen ; but on a sudden turning to his left, he 
approached the mountains another way: and though 
it IS true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, 
yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led 
us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed 
the height of the mountains without being much 
incumbered with the snow; and, all on a sudden, 
he showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of 
Languedoc and Gascony, dl green and flourishing, 
though, indeed, at a great distance, and we bmi 
some rough way to pass still. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found 
it snowed one whole day and night so fast that 
we could not travel ; but he bid us be easy ; we 
should soon be past it all : we found, indeed, that 
we began to descend every day, and to come more 
north than before; and so depending upon our guide, 
we went on. 

It was about two hours before night, when our 
guide being something before us, and not just in 
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after 
them a bear, out of a hollow way adjoining to a 
thick wood; two of the wolves made at the guide, 
and had he been far before us, he would have been 
devoured before we could have helped him; one of 
them fastened upon his horse, and the other at- 
tacked the man with that violence, that he had not 
Ume, or presence of mind enough, to draw his pis- 
tol, but holloed and cried out to us most lustily. 
My man Friday being next me, I bade him ride up, 
and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday 
came in sight of the man, he holloed out as loud as 
the other, O master! O master! but, like a bold fel- 
low, rode directly up to the poor man, and with his 
pistol shot the wolf that attacked him in the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my 
Boan Friday; for he having been used to such crea- 

DigilizedbyLaOOgle 



ROBIKSOK CRUSOE. 329 

tUres in his country, he had no fear upon him, but 
went close up to him and shot him, as above; 
whereas, any other of us would have fired at a far- 
ther distance, and have perhaps either missed the 
wolf, or endangered shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man 
than I ; and, indeed, it alarmed all our company, 
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on 
both sides the most dismal howling of wolves i and 
the noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains, 
appeared to us as if there had been a prodigious 
number of them ; and perhaps there was not such 
a few as that we had no cause of apprehensions ; 
however, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other 
that had fastened upop the horse lefl him immedi- 
ately, and fled, without doing him any damage, hav- 
ing happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses 
of the bridle had stuck in his teedi. But the man 
was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him 
twice, once in the arm, and the other time a little 
above his knee ; and though he had made some de- 
fence, he was just as it were tumbling down by the 
disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot 
the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's 
pistol we all mended our pace, and rode up as fast 
as the way which was very difficult, would give us 
leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we 
came clear of the trees which blinded us before, we 
saw clearly what had been the case, and how Friday 
had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not 
presently discern what kind of creature it was he 
had killed. 

But never was n fight managed so hardily, and in 

such a surprising manner, as that which followed, 

between Friday aud the bear, which gave us all, 

though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, 

2f3

330 ADV£MTURES OF 

the greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is 
a heavy clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the 
wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two par- 
ticular qualities, which generally are the rule of his 
actions: first, as to mei), who are not his proper 
prey (he does not usually attempt them, except they 
first attack him, unless he be excessive hungry, 
which it is probable might now be the case, the 
ground being covered with snow), if you do not 
meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; but 
then you must take care to be very civil to him, 
and give him the road, for he is a very nice gentle- 
man ; he will not go a step out of his way for a 
prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way 
is to look another way, and keep going on ; for 
sometimes if you stop, and standstill, and look stead- 
fastly at him, betakes it for an afiront; but if you 
throw or toss any thing at him, and it hits him, 
though it were but a bit of stick as big as your 
finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all other 
business aside to pursue his revenge, and will have 
satisfaction in point of honour ; — this is his first 
quality: the next is, if he be once affronted, he will 
never leave vou, night nor day, till he has his re- 
venge, but follows, at a good round rate, till he 
overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, aad when 
we came up to him, he was helping him off from 
his horse, for the man was both hurt and frightened, 
when, on a sudden, we ei^pied the bear come out of 
the wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the big- 
gest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little sur« 
prised when we saw him ; but when Friday saw him, 
it was easy to see joy and courage in toe fellow's* 
countenance : O, O, O ! says Friday, three times, 
pointing to him; O master! you give me te leave, me 
shakee te hand widihim; me mi&de you good kuigh.

RaSINSON CRUSOE. 331 

I was surprised to see the fellow so weO pleased : 
You fool, says I, he will eat you up. — Eatee me up ! 
eatee me up! says Friday, twice over ag£un; me 
eatee him up; me maJcee you good laugh; you all 
stay here, me skew you good laugh. So down 
be sits, and gets off his boots in a moment, and puts 
on a pair of pumps {as we call the flat shoes they 
wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives my 
other servaat his horse, and with his gun away he 
flew, swift like the wiud. 

The bear was walking softly on, and ofSered to 
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, 
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him. 
Hark ye, hark ye. Bays Friday^ me speakee with you. 
We followed at a distance; for now being come 
down on the Gascony side of the mountains, we were 
entered a vast great forest, where the country was 
plain and pretty open, though it had many trees in 
it scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we 
say, the heels of the bear, came up with him quickly, 
and takes up a great stone and throws it at lum, and 
hit him just on the head, but did him no more harm 
than if he had thrown it against a wall; but it 
answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void <^ 
fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow 
him, and show us some laugh, as he called it. As 
soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he 
turns about, and comes after him, taking devilish 
long strides, and shuffling on at a strange rate, so 
as would haveput a horse to a middling gallop ; away 
runs Friday, and takes his course as if he run to- 
wards us for help ; so we all resolved to fire at once 
upon the bear, and deliver my man ; though I was 
angry at him heartily for bringing the bear back 
upon us, when he was going about his own busi- 
ness another way; and especially I was angry that he 
had turned the bear upon us, and then run away; and 
5

I called out, You dog, is this your making us laugh ? 
Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot 
the creature. He heard me, and cried out, No shoot, 
no shoot; stand still, and you get much laugh; and 
as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear's 
one, he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and 
seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose, he bec- 
koned to us to follow ; and doubhng his pace, he 
gets nimbly up the tree, la3ring his gun down upon 
the ground, at about five or six yards from the 
bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to the tree, 
and we followed at a distance: the first thing he 
did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let it 
lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like 
a cat, though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed 
at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could 
not for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till see- 
ing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him. 
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got 
out to the small end of a large branch, and the bear 
got about half way to him. As soon as the bear got 
out to that part where the limb of the tree was 
weaker.— Ha! says he to us, now you see me teachee 
the bear dance: so he falls a jumping and shaking 
the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but 
stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how 
he should get back; then, indeed, we did laugh 
heartily. But Friday bad not done with him by a 
great deal; when seemg him stand still, he calls out 
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could 
speak English, What, you come no farther ? pray 
you come farther: so he left jumping and shaking 
the tree; and the bear, just as if he understood what 
he said, did come a little farther; then he fell a-jump- 
ing again, and the bear stopped again. We thought 
now was a good time to knock him in the head, and 
called to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot

the bear: but he cried out earnestly, Opray ! Opray ! 
no shoot, me shoot by and then: he would have 
said by and by. However to shorten the storv, 
Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so tick- 
lish, that we had laughing enough, but still could 
not imagine what the fellow would do : for first we 
thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and 
we found the bear was too cunning for that too : 
for he would not go out far enough to be thrown 
down, but clings fast with his great broad claws and 
feet, so that we could not imagine what would be 
the end of it, and what the jest would be at last. 
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing 
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that be would 
not be persuaded to come any farther. Well, well, 
says Friday, you no come farther, me go : you no 
come to me, me come to you ; and upon this, he 
goes out to the smaller end of the bough, where it 
would bend with his weight, and gently lets himself 
down, by it, sliding down the bough, till he came 
near enough to jump down on his feet, and away he 
runs to his gun, takes it up, and stands still. Well, 
said I to him, Friday, what will you do now? Why 
dmi't you shoot him? — No shoot, says Friday, no 
yet; me shoot now, me no kill; me stay, give you 
one more laugh; and, indeed so he did, as you will 
see presently; for when the bear saw his enemy gone, 
he comes back from the bough where he stood, but 
did it mighty cautiously, looking behind him every 
step, and coming backward till he got into the body 
of the tree; then with the same hinder-end foremost, 
he came down the tree, grasping it with his claws, 
and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely. At 
this juncture, and just before he could set his hind- 
foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, 
clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and 
shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about* to

see if we did not laugh ; and when he saw we were 
pleased, by our looks, he falls a laughing himself 
very loud. So we kill bear in my country, says 
Friday. So you kill them? says I : why, you have 
no guns. — No,' says he» no gun, but shoot great 
much long arrow. This was a good diversion to us ; 
but we were still in a wild place, and our guide very 
much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew : the 
howling of wolves run much in my head ; and, in^ 
deed except the noise I once heard on the shore 
of Africa, of which I have said something already, 
I never heard any thing that filled me with so 
much horror. 

These things, an^ the approach of night, called 
us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we 
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon- 
strous creature off, which was worth saving; but 
we had near three leagues to go, and our guide 
hastened us; so we left him, and went forward on 
our journey. 

The ground was still covered with snow, though 
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains ; 
and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards^ 
were come down into the forest and plain country^ 
pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done 
a great deal of mischief in the villages, where they 
surprised the country people, killed a great many of 
their sheep and horses, and some people too. We 
had one dangerous place to pass, which our guide 
told us, if there were more wolves in the country 
we should find them there ; and this was a small . 
plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a 
long narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass 
to get through the wood, and then we should come 
to the village where we were to lodge. It was 
within half an hour of sun-set when we entered the 
first wood,, and a little after sun-set when we came

ROBINSON COIUSOE. 335 

into the plain: we met with nothing in the first 
wood, except that, in a little plain wimin the wood, 
which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five 
g^eat wolves cross the road, full speed, one after 
another, as if they had been in cha^ of some prey, 
and had it in view; they took no notice of us, and 
were gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon 
this our guide, who, by the way, was but a faint- 
hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for 
he believed there were more wolves a coming. We 
kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we 
saw no more wolves till we came through that wood, 
which was near half a league, and entered the plain. 
As soon as we came into the plain, we had occasion 
enough to look about us: the first object we met 
with was a dead horse, that is to say, a poor horse 
which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of 
them at work, we could not say eating of him, but 
picking of his bones rather: for they had eaten up 
all the flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb 
them at their feast; neither did they take much no- 
tice of us. Friday would have let fly at them, but I 
would not sufier him by any means; for I found we 
were like to have more business upon our hands than 
we were aware of. We were not gone half over the 
plain, when we began to hear the wolves howl in. the 
wood on our left in a frightful manner, and pre- 
sently afber we saw about a hundred coming on di- 
rectly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in 
a line, as regularlv as an army drawn up by experi- 
enced officers. I scarce knew in what manner to 
receive them, but found, to draw ourselves in a close 
line was the only way: so we formed in a moment : 
but that we might not have too much interval, I or- 
dered that only every other man should fire, and 
that the others who had not fired should stand ready 
to give them a second volley immediately, if they

continued to advance upon us; and then thi^ those 
who had fired at first i^hould not pretend to load 
their fusees again^ but stand ready every one with a 
pistol, for we were all armed with a fusee and a pair 
of pistols each man ; so we were, by this method, 
able to fire six volleys, half of us at a time : however, 
at present we had no necessity ; f(»: upon firing the 
first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terri- 
fied as well with the noise as witli the fire; four of 
them being shot in the head, dropped; several others 
were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could 
see by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not 
immediately retreat; whereupon, remembering that 
I had been told that the fiercest creatures were ter- 
rified at the voice of a man, I caused all the com- 
pany to hollow as loud as we could; and I found the 
notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout, 
they began to retire, and turn about. I then or- 
dered a second volley to be fired in their rear, which 
put them to the gallop, and away they went to the 
woods. This gave us leisure to charge our pieces 
again ; and that we might lose no time, we kept 
going : but we had but little more than loaded our 
fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when we 
heard a terrible noise in the same wood, on our 
left, only that it was farther onward, the same way 
we were to go. 

The night was coming on, and the light began to 
be dusky, which made it worse on our side; but the 
noise increasing, we could easily perceive that it was 
the howUDg and yelling of those hellish creatures ; 
and on a sudden, we perceived two or three troops 
of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one 
in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded 
with them : however, as they did not fall upon us, 
we kept our way forward, as fast as we could make 
our horses go, which the way being very rough was

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 337 

only a good hard trot. In this manner we came in 
view of the entrance of a wood, through which we 
were to pass, at the farther side of the plain; but 
we were greatly surprised, when coming nearer the 
lane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves 
standing just at the entrance. On a sudden, at 
another openins of the wood, we heai'd the noise of 
a gun, and loolung that way, out rushed a horse, 
with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the 
wind, and sixteen or seventeen wonres after him, 
full speed; indeed the horse had the heels of them, 
but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that 
rate^ we doubted not but they would get up with 
him at last; no question but they did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding 
up to the entrance where the horse came out, we 
found the carcases of another horse and of two men, 
devoured by the ravenous creatures ; and one of the 
men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the 
gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but 
as to the man, his head and the upper part of his 
bodv were eaten up. This filled us with horror, and 
we knew not what course to take; but the creatures 
resolved us soon; for they gathered about us pre- 
sently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there 
were three hundred of them. It happened very 
much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the 
wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large 
timber-trees, which had been cut down the summer 
before, and I suppose lay there for carriage. I drew 
my little troop in among those trees, and placing 
ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised 
them all to alight, and keeping that tree before us 
for a breast- work, to stand in a triangle or three 
fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre. We did 
so, and it was well we did; for never was a more fu- 
rious charge than the creatures made upon us in

this place. They came on with a growling kind of 
noise, and mounted the piece of timber, wmch, as I 
said, was our breast- work, as if they were only rush-^ 
,ing upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, itseems^ 
was pricipally occasioned by their seeing our horses 
behind us. I ordered our men to fire as before, 
every other man ; and they took their aim so sure, 
that they killed several of the wolves at the first vol- 
ley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual 
firing, for they came on like devils, those behind 
pushing on those before. 

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees^ 
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they 
would have gone off; but it was but a moment, for 
others came forward asain; so we fired two volleys 
of our pistols; and I believe in these four firinga we 
had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed 
twice as many, yet they came on again. I was loath 
to spend our shot too hastily; so I called my ser- 
vant, not my man Friday, for he was better em* 
E loved, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, 
e had charged my fusee and his own while we were 
engaged; but, as 1 said, I called my other man, 
and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a 
train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a 
large train. He did so; and had but just time to 
get away, when the wolves came up to it, and 
some got upon it, when I, snapping an uncharged 
pistol close to tlie powder, set it on fire:' those that 
were upon the timber were scorched with it; and 
six or seven of them fell, or rather jumped in among 
us, with the force and fright of the fire, we dis* 
patched these in an instant, and the rest were so 
frightened with the light, which the night, for it 
was now very near dark, made more terrible, that 
they drew back a little; upon which I ordered our 
last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and after

that we gave a shout: upon this the wolves turned 
tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty 
lame ones, that we found struggling on the ground, 
ond fell a cutting them with our swords, which an- 
swered our expectation; for the crying and howling 
they made was better understood by their fellows ; 
so that they all fled and left us. 

We had first and last, killed about threescore of 
them ; and had it been day-light, we had killed many 
more. The field of battle being thus cleared, we made 
forward again, for we had still near a league to go. 
We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the 
woods as we went, several times, and sometimes we 
fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling 
our eyes, we were not certain: in about an hour 
more we came to the town where we were to lodge, 
which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms; 
for, it seems, the night before, the wolves and some 
bears had broke into the village, and put them in 
«uch terror, that they were obliged to keep guard 
night and day, but especially in the night, to pre- 
serve their cattle, and, indeed, their people. 

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his 
limbs swelled so much with the rankling of his two 
wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were 
obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Thou- 
louse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful 
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor any 
thing like them: but when we told our story at 
Thoulouse, they told us it was nothing but what 
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the 
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the 
ground; but they enquired much what kind of a 
guide we had got, who would venture to bring us 
that way in such a severe season; and told us it was 
surprising we were not all devoured. When we told 
them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in

the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us 
it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed; 
for it was the sight of the horses which made the 
wolves so furious, seeing their prey ; and that, at 
oUier times, they are really afraid of a gun; but be- 
ing excessive hungry, and racing on that account, 
the eagerness to come at the horses had made them 
senseless of danger; and that if we had not, by the 
continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the 
train of powder, mastered them, Jt had been great 
odds but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, 
had we been content to have sat still on horseback, 
and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken 
the horses so much for their own, when men were 
on their backs, as otherwise; and withal they told 
us, that at last, if we had stood altogether, and lefl 
our horses, they would have been so eager to have 
devoured them, that we might have come off safe, 
especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and 
bemg so many in number. For my part, I was never 
so sensible of danger in my life; for seeing above 
three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed 
to devour us, and having,nothing to shelter us, or 
retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it 
was, I believe I shall never care to cross those moun- 
tains again; I think I would much rather go a thou- 
sand leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet 
with a storm once a- week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my 
passage through France, nothing but what other 
travellers have given an account of, with much more 
advantage than I can. I travelled from Thoulouse 
to Paris, and without any considerable stay came to 
Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the Hth of Janua- 
r} , after having a severe cold season to travel in« 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and 
had in a little time all my new discovered estate safe

about me; the bills of exchange which I brought 
with me having been very currently paid. 

My principal guide and privy counsellor was my 
good ancient widow; who in gratitude for the mo- 
ney I had sent her, thought no pains too much, 
nor citre too great to employ for me; and I trusted 
her so entirely with every thing, that I was perfectly 
easy as to the security of my elects; and, indeed, I 
was very happy from the beginning, and now to 
the end, in the unspotted integrity of this good 
gentlewcnnan. 

I now resolved to dispose of my plantation in the 
Brazils, if I could find means. For this purpose,, I 
wrote to my old friend at Lisbon ; who havmg of- 
fered it to the two merchants, the survivors of my 
trustees who lived in the Brazils, they accepted 
the offer, and remitted thirty-three thousand pieces 
of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to 
pay for it. Having signed the mstrument of sale, 
and sent it to my old frien'd, he remitted me bills of 
exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred 
pieces of eight for the estate, reserving the payment 
of a hundred moidores a-year to himself during his 
life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for life, 
which I had promised them. 

Though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I 
could not keep the country out of my head: nor 
could I resist the strong inclination 1 had to see my 
island. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dis- 
suaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me, 
that for almost seven years, she prevented my run- 
ning abroad; during which time I took my two ne- 
phews, the children of one of my brothers into my 
care: the eldest having something of his own, I bred 
up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of 
,some addition to his estate, after my decease. The 
other I put out to a captain of a ship: and afler five

years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising 
young fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent 
him to sea: and this young fellow afterwards drew 
me in, as old as I was, to farther adventures myself. 

In the mean time, I in part settled myself here ; 
for, first of all, I married, and that not either to 
my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had three 
children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife 
dying, and my nephew coming home with good 
success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to 
go abroad, and his importunity prevailed, and en- 
gaged to go in his ship as a private trader to the 
East Indies : this was in the year 1694. 

But these things, with some very surprising inci- 
dents in some new adventures of my own, for ten 
years more, I shall give a farther account of in 
another volume.
