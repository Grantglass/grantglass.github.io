THE
ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I was born of a good family in the city of York,
where my father, who was a native of Bremen,
settled, after his having got a handsome estate by
merchandise. My heart was very early filled
with rambling thoughts, and though, when I grew
up, my father persuaded me to settle to some
business, while my mother used the tenderest en-
treaties, yet nothing could prevail upon me to lay
aside my desire of going to sea. I at length re-
solved to gratify my roving disposition, notwith-
standing the uneasiness my father and mother
showed at my leaving them.
On the 1st of September, 1651,1 went onboard
a ship for London, and, without letting my father
know the route I had taken, set sail; but no sooner
was the ship out of the Humber, than the wind
began to blow, and the sea to rise in a most ter-
rible manner. Having never been at sea before,
6 ROBINSON CKUSOE.
I was extremely sick, and my mind was filled
with terror. The next day the wind abated, and
my companions laughed at my fears, and with a
bowl of punch made me half drunk, and thus
drowned my repentance and reflections. The
weather continued calm for several days, and we
went into Yarmouth roads, where we cast anchor.
After riding here four or five days, the wind blew
very hard till the eighth day in the morning, when
it still increased, and we had all hands at work to
strike our topmasts, and at last cast our sheet*
anchor.
It now blew a terrible storm; I began to see
terror in the faces even of the seamen themselves;
and as the master passed by me, I heard him say
softly to himself, ''- Lord be merciful to us, we
shall all be lost."
I cannot express the horror of mind with which
I was seized; I was in ten times more tremour
on account of slighting my former convictions
than even at death itself. The storm still in-
creased, and I saw the master, the boatswain,
and seyeral others, at prayers, expecting every
moment the ship would go to the bottom. One
of the men cried out we had sprung a leak, upon
which all hands were called to the pump, but
the water gained upon us, and it was apparent
that the ship would founder. The storm, however,
beginning' to abate, the master fired guns for help,
and a ship, which had rode it out just a-hcad of us,
came near with the utmost hazard, venturing
their lives to save ours; our men casting a rope
over the stern, they, after much hazard, got hold
of it, and we with great difficulty got to land, and
walked to Yarmouth. On my arrival in that

town, I contracted an acquaintance with the mas-
ter of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea,
and was resolved to go again; he taking a fancy te
me, told me I should hare liberty of trading for
myself. Encouraged by this offer, and the assist-
ance of some of my relations, with whom I still
corresponded, I raised £40, which I laid out in
such toys and trifles as my friend the captain
recommended. I got a competent knowledge of
mathematics, navigation, and how to take an ob-
servation. In a word, this voyage made me both
a sailor and a merchant, for my adventure yielded
me in LondoD, at my return, £300.
I now set up for a Guinea trader, and my friend
dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the
same voyage again in the same vessel, with one
who was his mate in the former voyage, and had
now the command of the ship. This was one of
the most unhappy voyages ever made, for as we
were steering about the Canary Islands and the
African shore, we were surprised in the morning
by a rover of Salee, who gave chase to us with all
the sail she could make. We, finding that the
pirate gained upon us, and would come up with
us, prepared to fight; our ship having twelve
guns, and the pirate eighteen. About three in
the afternoon she came up with us, and a very
smart engagement ensued; but we were obliged
to submit, and were all carried prisoners into
Salee, a port belonging to the Moors.
My master, having the long-boat of our English
ship, had a little cabin built in the middle of it
like a barge. In this pleasure-boat he frequently
went a-fishing; and as I was dexterous at catching
fish, he never went without me. One day he ap-
pointed to go out with two or three Moors of dis-
tinction, and he had sent over-night a larger store
of provisions than usual, and ordered me to get
ready two or three fusils of powder and shot, for
that they designed to have sport at the fowling as
well as fishing. At this moment the hopes of de-
liverance darted into my thoughts, and I resolved
to furnish myself for a voyage.
Every thing being prepared, we sailed out of
the port to fish; but purposley catching none, I
told Muley that we must stand further off, which
he agreed to, and I having the helm, ran the boat
a league out further, and then brought to, as if
I would fish, when, giving the boy the helm, I
stepped forward, and stooping behind the Moor,
took him by surprise, and tossed him overboard;
he rose immediately, and called me to take him
a2
in; but fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I pre-
scnted it, and told him that if he came near I
would shoot him, and as the sea was calm, he

might easily reach the shore. So he turned about,
and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease.
I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury,
and said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to
me, I will make you a great man; but if you
will not, I must throw you into the sea too. The
boy smiled, and spoke so innocently, that I could
not mistrust him.
About ten days after, as I was steering out to
sea, in order to double a cape, on a sudden Xury
called out in a fright, Master, Master, a ship! I
jumped out of the cabin, and saw that it was a
Portuguese vessel. On my coming near, they
asked me what I was, in Portuguese, Spanish, and
French; but I understood none of them; at last
a Scotch sailor called to me, and I answered I was
an Englishman, and had made my escape from
the Moors of Salee. I offered all that I possessed
to the captain of the ship, but he would take no-
thing from me, and told me that all I had should
be delivered to me when we came to the Brazils.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and
the good captain recommended me to an honest
man who had a plantation and a sugar-house, with
whom I lived, and learned the planting and mak-
ing of sugar; after which I took a piece of land,
and became a planter myself. Had I continued
in the station I was now in, I might have been
happy, but my fellow-planters prevailed on me to
make a trial of purchasing negroes on the coast
of Guinea. We fitted out a ship, and made sail,
with the hopes of purchasing slaves to assist in
our plantations. We had very good weather for
twelve days, but after we crossed the Line, a vio-
lent hurricane drove us quite out of our reckoning.
In this distress one of our men called out " Land V
but the ship struck against a sand-bank. We
took to the boat, and after we had rowed a league
and a half, a wave came rolling a-stern of us, and
overset the. boat at once, so that out of fifteen
none escaped but myself. I got upon my feet, and
made towards the shore, and got to land, clambering
up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon
the grass. Being much fatigued, I got up into a
tree, and slept comfortably till the morning.
When I awoke it was broad day, and the storm
abated; but what surprised me most was, that in
the night the ship had been lifted from the land
by the swelling of the tide, and driven almost as
far as the place where I landed, and I saw that
if we had all remained on board we had been safe.
I swam to the ship and found she was bulged, and
had a great deal of water in the hold; but to my
great joy, saw that all the provisions were dry;
and being well disposed to eat, I filled my pock-
ets, and ate as I went about other things. I found
several spare yards and planks, with which I made
a raft. I emptied three of the seamen's chests,
and let them down upon the raft, and filled
them with bread, some dried goats'flesh, and three
Dutch cheeses. I also let down the carpenter's
chest, two fowling-pieces, two pistols, with some
powder, and two rusty swords, all which I placed
on my raft, and after much labour got it safely
landed. My first raft being too unwieldy, I swam
to the ship and made another; on which I placed

three bags of nails and pikes, some hatchets, a
grindstone, two iron crows, several muskets, and
another fowling-piece, two barrels of musket bul-
lets, a large bag of small shot, all the men's clothes
I could find, a hammock and some bedding, and
to my great comfort brought all to land. After
I had made five or six of these voyages, and though
a 3
I had nothing more to expect from the ship worth
taking, I found a great hogshead of bread, three
large runlets of rum, a box of fine sugar, a barrel
of fine flour, three dozen of good knives and forks.
I then went in search of a place where to fix my
dwelling
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle
before a hollow place, which extended about twen-
ty yards, and drove large piles into the ground,
sharpened at the top, and the entrance I made by
a short ladder to go over the top, and when I was
in, I lifted it over after me, so that 1 was perfectly
secure.
In themidst of my labours, when I was rummag-
ing amongst my things, I found a little bag with
a few husks of corn in it, and shook it by the side
of my fortification; but how great was my aston-
ishment when I saw ten or twelve ears of barley
springing up! With this barley there came up a
few stalks of rice, and these were of more worth
to me than all the gold in the world.
I then took a view of the island, and at about
two miles distant from my habitation, found some
fine savannahs, and a little farther a variety of
fruit, melons upon the ground, and the trees
spread over, and covered with clusters of grapes.
I was so enamoured with this place, that I built
a bower, fenced by a double hedge; and this coun-
try house, as I called it, cost me two months la-
bour ; but the rainy season coming on, I was ob-
liged to retreat to my old one, taking with me
a quantity of the grapes, which were now become
fine raisins in the sun.
When my corn was ripe, I made a scythe
with a sword, and cut off the ears, which I rub-
bed out with my hands. At the end of the har-
vest, I guessed that I had a bushel of rice and
two bushels of barley. I kept all this for seed,
and bore the want of bread with patience.
When I came to make bread I had innumer-
able wants. I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to
dross it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an
oven to bake it. However, I hadsix months to con-
trive all these things in. I made some misshapen
pots of clay, that all broke in the sun except two,
which I cased in wicker work; but I succeeded
better in little pans, flat dishes, and pitchers,
which the sun baked surprisingly hard; but they
would not bear the fire so as to hold any liquid,
and I wanted one to boil my meat.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Certainly a stoic would have smiled to have
seen me at dinner; there was my royal majesty,
an absolute prince and ruler of my kingdom, at-
tended by my dutiful subjects, whom, if I pleased,
I could either hang, draw, quarter, give liberty,
or take it away- When I dined, I seemed a king,
eating alone, none daring presume to do so till I

had done. Poll was the only person permitted to
talk with me. My old, but faithful dog, now
growing exceedingly crazy, continually sat at my
right hand; while my two cats sat on each side
of the table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a
principal mark of my royal favour. Yet these
were not the cats I Lad brought from the ship;
they had been dead long before, and interred near
my habitation by my own hands; but one of
them, as I suppose, generating with a wild cat,
these were a couple I had made tame; whereas
the rest ran into the woods, and grew so impudent
as to return and plunder me of my stores, till such
time as I shot a great many, and the rest left me
with this attendance, One thing more indeed
concerned me,—the want of my boat. I knew not
which way to get round the island. I resolved
one time to go along the shore by land to her;
but had any one in England met such a figure, it
would either have affrighted him, or made him
burst into laughter.
One day, after I had dressed my dinner, I went
to put out my fire, and found a piece of one of
my earthen-ware vessels burnt as hard as a stone,
and as red as a tile; this taught me to burn my
pipkins, and I soon wanted for no sort of earthen-
ware; but when I found that I had made a pot
which would bear the fire, I had hardly patience
to stay till it was cold, before I set it on with a
piece of a kid, in order to make some broth,
which answered tolerably well.
a4
I used to burn my earthen-ware in a cave which
I found in a wood, and which I made convenient
for that purpose; but tlie principal cause that
first brought me here, was to make charcoal, so
that I might bake and dress my bread and meat
without any danger. While I was cutting down
gome wood for this purpose, I perceived a cavity
behind a very thick branch of underwood. Cu-
rious to look into it, I got to its mouth, and found
it sufficient for me to stand upright in it. But
when I entered and took a further view, two roll-
ing shining eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to
dart themselves at me, so that I made all the
haste out that I could, not knowing whether it
was a savage, or a monster, that had taken his
residence in that place. On recovering a little
from my surprise, I resumed- all the courage I
had, and taking up a flaming firebrand, in I
rushed again; when not having proceeded above
three steps, I was more affrighted than before;
for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a human
creature in the greatest agony, succeeded by a
broken noise, resembling words half expressed,
and then a broken sigh again. Stepping back,
thought I to myself, am I got into some enchant-
19
ed place, such as are reported to contain miser-
able captives, till death puts an end to their sor-
row? It struck me with a cold sweat; but again
trusting to God's protection, I proceeded forward,
and, by the light of my firebrand, perceived it
to be a monstrous he-goat lying on the ground,
gasping for life, and dying for mere old age.

When at first I stirred him, thinking to drive
him out, he strove to get upon his feet, but was
not able; so I left him there to fright any one
from venturing into the cave.
At the furthermost part of the cave I observed
a sort of entrance, but so low as to oblige me to
creep upou my hands and knees to get through;
but on advancing, I found that it rose in height,
about twenty feet, and appeared, from the reflec-
tion of the light I carried with me, to be a grotto
adorned with diamonds and other precious stones.
I found it dry and comfortable, and therefore de-
termined to make it my principal magazine. -
While these things were doing, my thoughts
ran many times upon the land I had seen, and I
began to make myself a canoe, the most prepos-
terous enterprise that ever man in his senses un-
dertook. I felled a great cedar, about five feet
in diameter next the root; but when the impossi-
bility of launching this heavy thing came into my
mind, I gave myself this foolish answer: Let me
but once make it, and I'll warrant I'll get it along
when it is done. I made it big enough to carry
twenty-five men; but all my devices to get it in-
to the water failed me, for I could no more stir it
than I could the island. I then determined, since
I could not bring my canoe to the water, that I
would bring the water to the canoe, and began
to dig; but when I calculated the time this ca-
nal would take in making, I found that I could
not accomplish it in less than twelve years, and
therefore gave it over, determining to enjoy what
I had, without repining for what I could not get.
I had at length a great mind to go to the point
of the island to see how the shore lay, and resolv-
ed to travel thither by land. And now, reader,
I will give you a short sketch of the figure I made.
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's
skin, a jacket, with the skirts coming down to the
middle of my thighs, and a pair of open-knee'd
breeches of the same, with the goat's hair hanging
to the middle of my leg. Stockings and shoes I
had none; but I had a pair of somethings, I
scarce know what to call them, to slip over my
legs like spatterdashes. Under my arm hung
two pouches for shot and powder; on my back
I carried a basket, on my shoulder a gun, and
over my head a great clumsy goat's-skin umbrel-
la. My beard was cut short, except what grew
on my upper-lip; but as for my figure, as I had
few to observe me, it was a matter of no conse-
quence.
In this figure I went on my new journey, and
was out five or six days. In one of my excur-
sions I was exceedingly surprised with the print
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was

plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like one
thunderstruck; I listened, I looked around, but
I could hear nothing, nor see any thing. I went
upon a rising ground to look farther; I walked
backwards and forwards on the shore, but I could
see only that one impression. I went to look at
it again; how it came there I knew not; but I
hurried home to my fortifications, looking behind
me every two or three steps, and fancied every
tree, bush, and stump, to be a man. I had no
sleep that night; but my terror gradually
wore of, and I ventured down to tale mea-
sure of the foot by my own, but I found it much
larger. This filled me again with ridiculous
whimsies, and when I went home, I began to
double my fortifications, planted my seven
muskets on carriages, in the manner of cannon,
and was at the expense of an infinite deal of labour
purely from my apprehensions of this print of a
foot.
Rambling more to the western point one day
than ever I had done before, I was presently con-
vinced that the seeing of the print of a man's foot
was not such a strange thing in the island as I
had imagined; for, on approaching the shore, I
was perfectly confounded and amazed, nor is it
possible to express the horror I felt, at seeing the
shore spread with the skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human bodies, and particularly a place
where, as I supposed, there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth for the savage
wretches to sit down to their inhuman feasts on
the bodies of their fellow-creatures.
I had now been twenty-two years in the is-
land, and was so naturalized to the place, that
had I been secure as to the savages, I then fancied
I could have been contented to have staid in it
till I had died of mere old age.
One morning very early, I saw five canoes of
the savages on shore. I clambered up the hill,
and, by the help of my perspective, discovered no
less than thirty dancing round a fire. I soon
after saw two miserable wretches dragged out of
the boats, one of whom was immediately knocked
down, but the other starting from them, ran with
incredible swiftness along the sands towards me.
I confess I was horribly frightened when I saw
him come my way, imagining he would be pur-
sued by the whole body; however, I kept my
station, and quite lost my apprehension when I
found but three followed him. He greatly out-
ran them, and was in a fair way of escaping them
all, when, coming to a creek, he plunged into it,
landed, and ran as swift as before. Of the three
that followed, but two entered the water, the
other returning back. I hastily fetched my guns
from the foot of my ladder, and, taking a short
cut down the hill, I clapped myself in the way
betwixt the pursued and the pursuers ; then rush-
ing at once on the foremost, knocked him down
with the stock of my piece; the other stopped as
if frightened, but when I advanced towards him,
I perceived he was fitting his bow to shoot me.
25
upon which I shot him dead directly. The poor
savage who had fled was so terrified at the noise
of my piece, though he saw his enemy fallen,
that he stood stock still, but seemed rather inclin-
ed to fly than come forward. However, when I
gave him signs of encouragement, he came nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps. I then

.^-ass*

took him away to my cave at the farther part of
the island. Here I gave him bread and a bunch
of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which
he wanted much; and having refreshed him, I
made signs for him to lie down on some rice-straw,
which the poor creature did, and soon went to
sleep. After he had slept about half an hour, he
waked again, and came running to me in the en-
closure just by. Then kneeling down again, he
made all possible signs of thankfulness, subjec-
tion, and submission. I began to speak to him,
and to teach him to speak to me; and first made
him know that his name should be Friday, which
was the day whereon I saved his life. I taught
him to say Master, and let him know that was to
be my name. The next day I gave him clothes,
at which he seemed pleased.
Having now more courage, and consequently
more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me,
and marched to the place where his enemies had
been. When we came there, my blood ran cold
in my veins; the place was covered with human
bones, and the ground dyed with blood; great
pieces of flesh were left here and there half eaten,
mangled, and scorched. We saw three skulls, five
hands, and the bones of three or four legs and
feet; and Friday, by his signs, made nie under-
stand that they brought over four prisoners to
feast upon, and that three of them were eaten up;
that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth, and
that they had been conquered and taken in war.
I caused Friday to collect the remains of this hor-
rid carnage, then to light a fire, and burn them
to ashes. When this was done, we returned to
our castle.
I was now entered into the 27th year of my
captivity, and intended soon to set sail, when one
morning I bade Friday go to the sea shore to see
if he could find a turtle; but he had not long
been gone, when he came running back like one
who felt not the ground on which he trod, and
before I had time to speak, cried, O Master! 0
Master! 0 sorrow! O bad! What's the matter,
Friday? said I. 0 yonder they're, said he, one,
two, three! Well, Friday, said I, do not be fright-
ened; he was however terribly scared, imagining
that they were come to look for him, and would
cut him in pieces and eat him.
I then took my perspective-glass, and went up
to the side of the hill, when I saw twenty-one
savages, three prisoners, and three canoes. I bid
him softly bring me word what they were doing;
he did so, and coming back immediately, told me
they were all about the fire, eating the flesh of one
of their prisoners, and that a bearded man lay
bound upon the sand, whom he said they would
kill next. The news fired my soul, and filled me
with horror, and going to the tree, I plainly saw
a white man clothed, lying on the beach with his
hands and feet tied with flags. I had not a mo-
ment to lose, for nineteen of the horrid wretches
sat huddled together on the ground, and the
other two were stooping down to untie the
Christian in order to murder him. Now, Friday,
said I, do as you see me do. I laid the muskets
down and took up one, and then we both fired;
we then fired again, till seventeen of them were
killed; and four of them getting into a canoe got
out to sea.
I resolved to pursue them, lest they should re-
turn with a greater force to destroy us, and ran
to a canoe, calling to Friday to follow me; but
I was no sooner in the canoe than I found another
poor creature lying there alive, bound hand and
foot. I immediately cut the twisted flags, and
seeing that he had been bound so tight that he
was almost dead, I gave him a dram, and ordered
Friday to tell him of his deliverance ; but when
the poor fellow looked in his face, and heard him
speak, it would have moved any one to tears to
have seen how he kissed, embraced, hugged him,
cried, danced, sung, and then cried again. It was
some time before I could make him tell what was
the matter; but when he came a little to himself,
he said it was his own dear father. He then sat
down by him, held the old man's head close to his
bosom, and chafed his arms and ancles, which
were stiff with binding.
The white man, who was a Spaniard, express-
ed the utmost gratitude for his deliverance, gave
me an account of his shipwreck, and the situation

of his companions; when we resolved that Friday's
father and the Spaniard should go in the boat to
fetch them over.
About eight days after they were gone, Friday
wakened me one morning by crying out. Master,
they are come! I dressed, and hastened to the
top of the hill, and plainly discovered an English
ship lying at anchor. At first I felt in my mind
a tumult of joy, which was soon turned into fear;
for, though I knew them to be my countrymen,
I had reason to dread them as enemies.
They ran the boat ashore on the beach, and
eleven men landed, three of them unarmed, who,
by their gestures, seemed to be prisoners; and
one of them I could perceive using the most pas-
sionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and de-
spair, while the two others, though their grief
seemed less extravagant, appeared pleading for
mercy. At this instant I saw a villain lift up
his arms to kill one of- the prisoners, but he did
not strike him. The men having left the prison-
ers and gone into the woods, I went up to them
with my man Friday, and said to them in Spa-
nish, What are you, gentlemen? They started at
the noise, but prepared to fly. I then said in
English, Gentlemen, perhaps you may have a
friend near you whom you woukl little expect.
Tell me your case. I was commander of that
ship, replied one of the prisoners; my men have
mutinied against me; and if they do not murder
me, they intend to leave me and these two gentle-
men ashore in this desolate place; they are but
in that thicket, and I tremble for fear they may
have seen you, and heard us speak. Having con-
certed matters with the captain, and armed our-
selves, we went to the sailors; and the captain
reserving his own piece, the two men shot one of
the villains dead, and wounded another. He who
was wounded cried out for help, and I coming up,
gave orders for sparing their lives, on condition of
their being bound hand and foot while they staid
in the island.
A little after, another boat with ten men and
fire-arms approached the shore. We had a full
view of them as they came; the captain told me
three of them were peaceable fellows, but the rest
were desperate wretches. Having formed an am-
buscade, I ordered Friday and the captain to
creep upon their hands and feet, that they might
not be seen, and to get very near them before they
fired; but one of the principal ringleaders of the
mutiny, with two of the crew, came towards us,
and the captain was so eager of having him in his
power, that he let fly, killed him and another
on the spot; the third ran for it. I immediately
advanced with my whole army, upon which Will
Atkins, one of the ringleaders, called out, For
God's sake, captain, spare my life, the rest are as
bad as I. The captain told him he must lay down
his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's
mercy, upon which they all submitted.
It was now determined to seize the ship, which,
with the assistance of the faithful part of the crew,
the captain effected thus: I sent* the captain
to tamper with them in the governor's name, of-
fering them pardon, if they would assist him in
recovering the ship. Upon which they all agreed
to stand by him till their last drop of blood.
They were all released on these assurances; and
then the captain repaired the other boat; making
his passenger captain, with four men well armed;
while his mate, himself, and five men more, went
in the other. By midnight they came within
call of the ship, when the captain ordered Robin-
son to hale her, and tell them, that with great
difficulty they had found the men at last. But
while they were discoursing, the captain, his mate,
and the rest entered, and knocked down the se«
cond mate and carpenter, secured those that were
upon deck by putting them under hatches, while
the other boat's crew entered, and securing the
forecastle, broke into the round house, where the
mate, after some resistance, shot the pirate captain

through the head ; upon which all the rest yield-
ed themselves prisoners.
When I saw my deliverance thus put into my
hands, I was ready to sink with surprise ; but a
flood of tears soon brought me to myself. I then
in my turn embraced him as my deliverer, and
we rejoiced together. Having brought the prison-
ers before me, I asked them what they had to say
in their own defence, telling them I had power
to execute them there.
They pleaded the captain's promise of mercy.
I then told them that I intended to go a passen-
ger in the ship, with all my men ; but that they,
if they went, could only go as prisoners; observ-
ing, however, that they might, if they chose it,
stay in the island This they gladly accepted, and
I prepared to go on board the next day. The
captain returning to the ship, got every thing
ready for my reception.
When he was gone, I talked to the men, told
them my story, how I managed my household
business; instructed them in all I knew, and gave
them my best advice with regard to their beha-
viour to one another.
I divided the tools among them in this man-
ner. To every man I gave a digging spade, a
shovel, and a rake, as having no harrows or
ploughs; and to every separate place a pickaxe,
a crow, a broad axe, and a saw, with a store for
a general supply, should any be broken or worn
out. I left them also nails, staples, hinges, ham-
mers, chisels, knives, scissors, and all sorts of tools
and iron-work ; and for the use of the smith, I
gave him three tons of unwrought iron for a sup-
ply: and as to arms and ammunition, I stored
them sufficiently to equip a little army. The
next day I went on board the ship, taking Friday
with me.
The next morning two of the men came swim-
mingto the ship's side, desiring the captain to take
them on board, though he hanged them after-
wards, complaining mightily how barbarously the
others used them. Upon which I prevailed with
the captain to take them in, and being severely
whipped and pickled, they proved more honest
for the future. And so I bade farewell to the is-
land, carrying along with me my money, parrot,
umbrella, and goat-skin cap, setting sail Decem-
ber 12, 1686, after twenty-eight years, two
months, and nineteen days residence, the same
day and month that I escaped from Salee, land-
ing in England, June 11, 1687, after thirty-five
years absence from my native country, which ren-
dered me altogether a stranger to it. Some time
after I went to Lisbon, to see after my effects in
the Brazils, and found the generous captain, who
had been so much my friend, still alive, and he
put me in the way of recovering the produce of
my plantations. And a few months after, there
arrived ships in the Tagus, with effects for my

use, to the amount of £5000, besides £1000
a-year, which I expected to receive annually for
my plantation.
Having now lived 72 years, chequered with in-
finite variety, and been taught the value of retire-
ment, I resolved to harass myself no more, but to
look forward to the blessing of ending my days in
peace, and in the true worship of that God who
has protected and delivered me in all my troubles.

ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I was born of a good family in the city of York,
where my father, who was a native of Bremen,
settled, after his having got a handsome estate by
merchandise. My heart was very early filled
with rambling thoughts, and though, when I grew
up, my father persuaded me to settle to some
business, while my mother used the tenderest en-
treaties, yet nothing could prevail upon me to lay
aside my desire of going to sea. I at length re-
solved to gratify my roving disposition, notwith-
standing the uneasiness my father and mother
showed at my leaving them.
On the 1st of September, 1651,1 went onboard
a ship for London, and, without letting my father
know the route I had taken, set sail; but no sooner
was the ship out of the Humber, than the wind
began to blow, and the sea to rise in a most ter-
rible manner. Having never been at sea before,
I was extremely sick, and my mind was filled
with terror. The next day the wind abated, and
my companions laughed at my fears, and with a
bowl of punch made me half drunk, and thus
drowned my repentance and reflections. The
weather continued calm for several days, and we
went into Yarmouth roads, where we cast anchor.
After riding here four or five days, the wind blew
very hard till the eighth day in the morning, when
it still increased, and we had all hands at work to
strike our topmasts, and at last cast our sheet*
anchor.
It now blew a terrible storm; I began to see
terror in the faces even of the seamen themselves;
and as the master passed by me, I heard him say
softly to himself, ''- Lord be merciful to us, we
shall all be lost."
I cannot express the horror of mind with which
I was seized; I was in ten times more tremour
on account of slighting my former convictions
than even at death itself. The storm still in-
creased, and I saw the master, the boatswain,
and seyeral others, at prayers, expecting every
moment the ship would go to the bottom. One
of the men cried out we had sprung a leak, upon
which all hands were called to the pump, but
the water gained upon us, and it was apparent
that the ship would founder. The storm, however,
beginning' to abate, the master fired guns for help,
and a ship, which had rode it out just a-hcad of us,
came near with the utmost hazard, venturing
their lives to save ours; our men casting a rope
over the stern, they, after much hazard, got hold
of it, and we with great difficulty got to land, and
walked to Yarmouth. On my arrival in that

town, I contracted an acquaintance with the mas-
ter of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea,
and was resolved to go again; he taking a fancy te
me, told me I should hare liberty of trading for
myself. Encouraged by this offer, and the assist-
ance of some of my relations, with whom I still
corresponded, I raised £40, which I laid out in
such toys and trifles as my friend the captain
recommended. I got a competent knowledge of
mathematics, navigation, and how to take an ob-
servation. In a word, this voyage made me both
a sailor and a merchant, for my adventure yielded
me in LondoD, at my return, £300.
I now set up for a Guinea trader, and my friend
dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the
same voyage again in the same vessel, with one
who was his mate in the former voyage, and had
now the command of the ship. This was one of
the most unhappy voyages ever made, for as we
were steering about the Canary Islands and the
African shore, we were surprised in the morning
by a rover of Salee, who gave chase to us with all
the sail she could make. We, finding that the
pirate gained upon us, and would come up with
us, prepared to fight; our ship having twelve
guns, and the pirate eighteen. About three in
the afternoon she came up with us, and a very
smart engagement ensued; but we were obliged
to submit, and were all carried prisoners into
Salee, a port belonging to the Moors.
My master, having the long-boat of our English
ship, had a little cabin built in the middle of it
like a barge. In this pleasure-boat he frequently
went a-fishing; and as I was dexterous at catching
fish, he never went without me. One day he ap-
pointed to go out with two or three Moors of dis-
tinction, and he had sent over-night a larger store
of provisions than usual, and ordered me to get
ready two or three fusils of powder and shot, for
that they designed to have sport at the fowling as
well as fishing. At this moment the hopes of de-
liverance darted into my thoughts, and I resolved
to furnish myself for a voyage.
Every thing being prepared, we sailed out of
the port to fish; but purposley catching none, I
told Muley that we must stand further off, which
he agreed to, and I having the helm, ran the boat
a league out further, and then brought to, as if
I would fish, when, giving the boy the helm, I
stepped forward, and stooping behind the Moor,
took him by surprise, and tossed him overboard;
he rose immediately, and called me to take him
a2
in; but fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I pre-
scnted it, and told him that if he came near I
would shoot him, and as the sea was calm, he

might easily reach the shore. So he turned about,
and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease.
I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury,
and said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to
me, I will make you a great man; but if you
will not, I must throw you into the sea too. The
boy smiled, and spoke so innocently, that I could
not mistrust him.
About ten days after, as I was steering out to
sea, in order to double a cape, on a sudden Xury
called out in a fright, Master, Master, a ship! I
jumped out of the cabin, and saw that it was a
Portuguese vessel. On my coming near, they
asked me what I was, in Portuguese, Spanish, and
French; but I understood none of them; at last
a Scotch sailor called to me, and I answered I was
an Englishman, and had made my escape from
the Moors of Salee. I offered all that I possessed
to the captain of the ship, but he would take no-
thing from me, and told me that all I had should
be delivered to me when we came to the Brazils.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and
the good captain recommended me to an honest
man who had a plantation and a sugar-house, with
whom I lived, and learned the planting and mak-
ing of sugar; after which I took a piece of land,
and became a planter myself. Had I continued
in the station I was now in, I might have been
happy, but my fellow-planters prevailed on me to
make a trial of purchasing negroes on the coast
of Guinea. We fitted out a ship, and made sail,
with the hopes of purchasing slaves to assist in
our plantations. We had very good weather for
twelve days, but after we crossed the Line, a vio-
lent hurricane drove us quite out of our reckoning.
In this distress one of our men called out " Land V
but the ship struck against a sand-bank. We
took to the boat, and after we had rowed a league
and a half, a wave came rolling a-stern of us, and
overset the. boat at once, so that out of fifteen
none escaped but myself. I got upon my feet, and
made towards the shore, and got to land, clambering
up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon
the grass. Being much fatigued, I got up into a
tree, and slept comfortably till the morning.
When I awoke it was broad day, and the storm
abated; but what surprised me most was, that in
the night the ship had been lifted from the land
by the swelling of the tide, and driven almost as
far as the place where I landed, and I saw that
if we had all remained on board we had been safe.
I swam to the ship and found she was bulged, and
had a great deal of water in the hold; but to my
great joy, saw that all the provisions were dry;
and being well disposed to eat, I filled my pock-
ets, and ate as I went about other things. I found
several spare yards and planks, with which I made
a raft. I emptied three of the seamen's chests,
and let them down upon the raft, and filled
them with bread, some dried goats'flesh, and three
Dutch cheeses. I also let down the carpenter's
chest, two fowling-pieces, two pistols, with some
powder, and two rusty swords, all which I placed
on my raft, and after much labour got it safely
landed. My first raft being too unwieldy, I swam
to the ship and made another; on which I placed

three bags of nails and pikes, some hatchets, a
grindstone, two iron crows, several muskets, and
another fowling-piece, two barrels of musket bul-
lets, a large bag of small shot, all the men's clothes
I could find, a hammock and some bedding, and
to my great comfort brought all to land. After
I had made five or six of these voyages, and though
a 3
I had nothing more to expect from the ship worth
taking, I found a great hogshead of bread, three
large runlets of rum, a box of fine sugar, a barrel
of fine flour, three dozen of good knives and forks.
I then went in search of a place where to fix my
dwelling
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle
before a hollow place, which extended about twen-
ty yards, and drove large piles into the ground,
sharpened at the top, and the entrance I made by
a short ladder to go over the top, and when I was
in, I lifted it over after me, so that 1 was perfectly
secure.
In themidst of my labours, when I was rummag-
ing amongst my things, I found a little bag with
a few husks of corn in it, and shook it by the side
of my fortification; but how great was my aston-
ishment when I saw ten or twelve ears of barley
springing up! With this barley there came up a
few stalks of rice, and these were of more worth
to me than all the gold in the world.
I then took a view of the island, and at about
two miles distant from my habitation, found some
fine savannahs, and a little farther a variety of
fruit, melons upon the ground, and the trees
spread over, and covered with clusters of grapes.
I was so enamoured with this place, that I built
a bower, fenced by a double hedge; and this coun-
try house, as I called it, cost me two months la-
bour ; but the rainy season coming on, I was ob-
liged to retreat to my old one, taking with me
a quantity of the grapes, which were now become
fine raisins in the sun.
When my corn was ripe, I made a scythe
with a sword, and cut off the ears, which I rub-
bed out with my hands. At the end of the har-
vest, I guessed that I had a bushel of rice and
two bushels of barley. I kept all this for seed,
and bore the want of bread with patience.
When I came to make bread I had innumer-
able wants. I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to
dross it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an
oven to bake it. However, I hadsix months to con-
trive all these things in. I made some misshapen
pots of clay, that all broke in the sun except two,
which I cased in wicker work; but I succeeded
better in little pans, flat dishes, and pitchers,
which the sun baked surprisingly hard; but they
would not bear the fire so as to hold any liquid,
and I wanted one to boil my meat.
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Certainly a stoic would have smiled to have
seen me at dinner; there was my royal majesty,
an absolute prince and ruler of my kingdom, at-
tended by my dutiful subjects, whom, if I pleased,
I could either hang, draw, quarter, give liberty,
or take it away- When I dined, I seemed a king,
eating alone, none daring presume to do so till I

had done. Poll was the only person permitted to
talk with me. My old, but faithful dog, now
growing exceedingly crazy, continually sat at my
right hand; while my two cats sat on each side
of the table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a
principal mark of my royal favour. Yet these
were not the cats I Lad brought from the ship;
they had been dead long before, and interred near
my habitation by my own hands; but one of
them, as I suppose, generating with a wild cat,
these were a couple I had made tame; whereas
the rest ran into the woods, and grew so impudent
as to return and plunder me of my stores, till such
time as I shot a great many, and the rest left me
with this attendance, One thing more indeed
concerned me,—the want of my boat. I knew not
which way to get round the island. I resolved
one time to go along the shore by land to her;
but had any one in England met such a figure, it
would either have affrighted him, or made him
burst into laughter.
One day, after I had dressed my dinner, I went
to put out my fire, and found a piece of one of
my earthen-ware vessels burnt as hard as a stone,
and as red as a tile; this taught me to burn my
pipkins, and I soon wanted for no sort of earthen-
ware; but when I found that I had made a pot
which would bear the fire, I had hardly patience
to stay till it was cold, before I set it on with a
piece of a kid, in order to make some broth,
which answered tolerably well.
a4
I used to burn my earthen-ware in a cave which
I found in a wood, and which I made convenient
for that purpose; but tlie principal cause that
first brought me here, was to make charcoal, so
that I might bake and dress my bread and meat
without any danger. While I was cutting down
gome wood for this purpose, I perceived a cavity
behind a very thick branch of underwood. Cu-
rious to look into it, I got to its mouth, and found
it sufficient for me to stand upright in it. But
when I entered and took a further view, two roll-
ing shining eyes, like flaming stars, seemed to
dart themselves at me, so that I made all the
haste out that I could, not knowing whether it
was a savage, or a monster, that had taken his
residence in that place. On recovering a little
from my surprise, I resumed- all the courage I
had, and taking up a flaming firebrand, in I
rushed again; when not having proceeded above
three steps, I was more affrighted than before;
for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a human
creature in the greatest agony, succeeded by a
broken noise, resembling words half expressed,
and then a broken sigh again. Stepping back,
thought I to myself, am I got into some enchant-
19
ed place, such as are reported to contain miser-
able captives, till death puts an end to their sor-
row? It struck me with a cold sweat; but again
trusting to God's protection, I proceeded forward,
and, by the light of my firebrand, perceived it
to be a monstrous he-goat lying on the ground,
gasping for life, and dying for mere old age.

When at first I stirred him, thinking to drive
him out, he strove to get upon his feet, but was
not able; so I left him there to fright any one
from venturing into the cave.
At the furthermost part of the cave I observed
a sort of entrance, but so low as to oblige me to
creep upou my hands and knees to get through;
but on advancing, I found that it rose in height,
about twenty feet, and appeared, from the reflec-
tion of the light I carried with me, to be a grotto
adorned with diamonds and other precious stones.
I found it dry and comfortable, and therefore de-
termined to make it my principal magazine. -
While these things were doing, my thoughts
ran many times upon the land I had seen, and I
began to make myself a canoe, the most prepos-
terous enterprise that ever man in his senses un-
dertook. I felled a great cedar, about five feet
in diameter next the root; but when the impossi-
bility of launching this heavy thing came into my
mind, I gave myself this foolish answer: Let me
but once make it, and I'll warrant I'll get it along
when it is done. I made it big enough to carry
twenty-five men; but all my devices to get it in-
to the water failed me, for I could no more stir it
than I could the island. I then determined, since
I could not bring my canoe to the water, that I
would bring the water to the canoe, and began
to dig; but when I calculated the time this ca-
nal would take in making, I found that I could
not accomplish it in less than twelve years, and
therefore gave it over, determining to enjoy what
I had, without repining for what I could not get.
I had at length a great mind to go to the point
of the island to see how the shore lay, and resolv-
ed to travel thither by land. And now, reader,
I will give you a short sketch of the figure I made.
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's
skin, a jacket, with the skirts coming down to the
middle of my thighs, and a pair of open-knee'd
breeches of the same, with the goat's hair hanging
to the middle of my leg. Stockings and shoes I
had none; but I had a pair of somethings, I
scarce know what to call them, to slip over my
legs like spatterdashes. Under my arm hung
two pouches for shot and powder; on my back
I carried a basket, on my shoulder a gun, and
over my head a great clumsy goat's-skin umbrel-
la. My beard was cut short, except what grew
on my upper-lip; but as for my figure, as I had
few to observe me, it was a matter of no conse-
quence.
In this figure I went on my new journey, and
was out five or six days. In one of my excur-
sions I was exceedingly surprised with the print
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was

plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like one
thunderstruck; I listened, I looked around, but
I could hear nothing, nor see any thing. I went
upon a rising ground to look farther; I walked
backwards and forwards on the shore, but I could
see only that one impression. I went to look at
it again; how it came there I knew not; but I
hurried home to my fortifications, looking behind
me every two or three steps, and fancied every
tree, bush, and stump, to be a man. I had no
sleep that night; but my terror gradually
wore of, and I ventured down to tale mea-
sure of the foot by my own, but I found it much
larger. This filled me again with ridiculous
whimsies, and when I went home, I began to
double my fortifications, planted my seven
muskets on carriages, in the manner of cannon,
and was at the expense of an infinite deal of labour
purely from my apprehensions of this print of a
foot.
Rambling more to the western point one day
than ever I had done before, I was presently con-
vinced that the seeing of the print of a man's foot
was not such a strange thing in the island as I
had imagined; for, on approaching the shore, I
was perfectly confounded and amazed, nor is it
possible to express the horror I felt, at seeing the
shore spread with the skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human bodies, and particularly a place
where, as I supposed, there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth for the savage
wretches to sit down to their inhuman feasts on
the bodies of their fellow-creatures.
I had now been twenty-two years in the is-
land, and was so naturalized to the place, that
had I been secure as to the savages, I then fancied
I could have been contented to have staid in it
till I had died of mere old age.
One morning very early, I saw five canoes of
the savages on shore. I clambered up the hill,
and, by the help of my perspective, discovered no
less than thirty dancing round a fire. I soon
after saw two miserable wretches dragged out of
the boats, one of whom was immediately knocked
down, but the other starting from them, ran with
incredible swiftness along the sands towards me.
I confess I was horribly frightened when I saw
him come my way, imagining he would be pur-
sued by the whole body; however, I kept my
station, and quite lost my apprehension when I
found but three followed him. He greatly out-
ran them, and was in a fair way of escaping them
all, when, coming to a creek, he plunged into it,
landed, and ran as swift as before. Of the three
that followed, but two entered the water, the
other returning back. I hastily fetched my guns
from the foot of my ladder, and, taking a short
cut down the hill, I clapped myself in the way
betwixt the pursued and the pursuers ; then rush-
ing at once on the foremost, knocked him down
with the stock of my piece; the other stopped as
if frightened, but when I advanced towards him,
I perceived he was fitting his bow to shoot me.
25
upon which I shot him dead directly. The poor
savage who had fled was so terrified at the noise
of my piece, though he saw his enemy fallen,
that he stood stock still, but seemed rather inclin-
ed to fly than come forward. However, when I
gave him signs of encouragement, he came nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps. I then

.^-ass*

took him away to my cave at the farther part of
the island. Here I gave him bread and a bunch
of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which
he wanted much; and having refreshed him, I
made signs for him to lie down on some rice-straw,
which the poor creature did, and soon went to
sleep. After he had slept about half an hour, he
waked again, and came running to me in the en-
closure just by. Then kneeling down again, he
made all possible signs of thankfulness, subjec-
tion, and submission. I began to speak to him,
and to teach him to speak to me; and first made
him know that his name should be Friday, which
was the day whereon I saved his life. I taught
him to say Master, and let him know that was to
be my name. The next day I gave him clothes,
at which he seemed pleased.
Having now more courage, and consequently
more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me,
and marched to the place where his enemies had
been. When we came there, my blood ran cold
in my veins; the place was covered with human
bones, and the ground dyed with blood; great
pieces of flesh were left here and there half eaten,
mangled, and scorched. We saw three skulls, five
hands, and the bones of three or four legs and
feet; and Friday, by his signs, made nie under-
stand that they brought over four prisoners to
feast upon, and that three of them were eaten up;
that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth, and
that they had been conquered and taken in war.
I caused Friday to collect the remains of this hor-
rid carnage, then to light a fire, and burn them
to ashes. When this was done, we returned to
our castle.
I was now entered into the 27th year of my
captivity, and intended soon to set sail, when one
morning I bade Friday go to the sea shore to see
if he could find a turtle; but he had not long
been gone, when he came running back like one
who felt not the ground on which he trod, and
before I had time to speak, cried, O Master! 0
Master! 0 sorrow! O bad! What's the matter,
Friday? said I. 0 yonder they're, said he, one,
two, three! Well, Friday, said I, do not be fright-
ened; he was however terribly scared, imagining
that they were come to look for him, and would
cut him in pieces and eat him.
I then took my perspective-glass, and went up
to the side of the hill, when I saw twenty-one
savages, three prisoners, and three canoes. I bid
him softly bring me word what they were doing;
he did so, and coming back immediately, told me
they were all about the fire, eating the flesh of one
of their prisoners, and that a bearded man lay
bound upon the sand, whom he said they would
kill next. The news fired my soul, and filled me
with horror, and going to the tree, I plainly saw
a white man clothed, lying on the beach with his
hands and feet tied with flags. I had not a mo-
ment to lose, for nineteen of the horrid wretches
sat huddled together on the ground, and the
other two were stooping down to untie the
Christian in order to murder him. Now, Friday,
said I, do as you see me do. I laid the muskets
down and took up one, and then we both fired;
we then fired again, till seventeen of them were
killed; and four of them getting into a canoe got
out to sea.
I resolved to pursue them, lest they should re-
turn with a greater force to destroy us, and ran
to a canoe, calling to Friday to follow me; but
I was no sooner in the canoe than I found another
poor creature lying there alive, bound hand and
foot. I immediately cut the twisted flags, and
seeing that he had been bound so tight that he
was almost dead, I gave him a dram, and ordered
Friday to tell him of his deliverance ; but when
the poor fellow looked in his face, and heard him
speak, it would have moved any one to tears to
have seen how he kissed, embraced, hugged him,
cried, danced, sung, and then cried again. It was
some time before I could make him tell what was
the matter; but when he came a little to himself,
he said it was his own dear father. He then sat
down by him, held the old man's head close to his
bosom, and chafed his arms and ancles, which
were stiff with binding.
The white man, who was a Spaniard, express-
ed the utmost gratitude for his deliverance, gave
me an account of his shipwreck, and the situation

of his companions; when we resolved that Friday's
father and the Spaniard should go in the boat to
fetch them over.
About eight days after they were gone, Friday
wakened me one morning by crying out. Master,
they are come! I dressed, and hastened to the
top of the hill, and plainly discovered an English
ship lying at anchor. At first I felt in my mind
a tumult of joy, which was soon turned into fear;
for, though I knew them to be my countrymen,
I had reason to dread them as enemies.
They ran the boat ashore on the beach, and
eleven men landed, three of them unarmed, who,
by their gestures, seemed to be prisoners; and
one of them I could perceive using the most pas-
sionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and de-
spair, while the two others, though their grief
seemed less extravagant, appeared pleading for
mercy. At this instant I saw a villain lift up
his arms to kill one of- the prisoners, but he did
not strike him. The men having left the prison-
ers and gone into the woods, I went up to them
with my man Friday, and said to them in Spa-
nish, What are you, gentlemen? They started at
the noise, but prepared to fly. I then said in
English, Gentlemen, perhaps you may have a
friend near you whom you woukl little expect.
Tell me your case. I was commander of that
ship, replied one of the prisoners; my men have
mutinied against me; and if they do not murder
me, they intend to leave me and these two gentle-
men ashore in this desolate place; they are but
in that thicket, and I tremble for fear they may
have seen you, and heard us speak. Having con-
certed matters with the captain, and armed our-
selves, we went to the sailors; and the captain
reserving his own piece, the two men shot one of
the villains dead, and wounded another. He who
was wounded cried out for help, and I coming up,
gave orders for sparing their lives, on condition of
their being bound hand and foot while they staid
in the island.
A little after, another boat with ten men and
fire-arms approached the shore. We had a full
view of them as they came; the captain told me
three of them were peaceable fellows, but the rest
were desperate wretches. Having formed an am-
buscade, I ordered Friday and the captain to
creep upon their hands and feet, that they might
not be seen, and to get very near them before they
fired; but one of the principal ringleaders of the
mutiny, with two of the crew, came towards us,
and the captain was so eager of having him in his
power, that he let fly, killed him and another
on the spot; the third ran for it. I immediately
advanced with my whole army, upon which Will
Atkins, one of the ringleaders, called out, For
God's sake, captain, spare my life, the rest are as
bad as I. The captain told him he must lay down
his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's
mercy, upon which they all submitted.
It was now determined to seize the ship, which,
with the assistance of the faithful part of the crew,
the captain effected thus: I sent* the captain
to tamper with them in the governor's name, of-
fering them pardon, if they would assist him in
recovering the ship. Upon which they all agreed
to stand by him till their last drop of blood.
They were all released on these assurances; and
then the captain repaired the other boat; making
his passenger captain, with four men well armed;
while his mate, himself, and five men more, went
in the other. By midnight they came within
call of the ship, when the captain ordered Robin-
son to hale her, and tell them, that with great
difficulty they had found the men at last. But
while they were discoursing, the captain, his mate,
and the rest entered, and knocked down the se«
cond mate and carpenter, secured those that were
upon deck by putting them under hatches, while
the other boat's crew entered, and securing the
forecastle, broke into the round house, where the
mate, after some resistance, shot the pirate captain

through the head ; upon which all the rest yield-
ed themselves prisoners.
When I saw my deliverance thus put into my
hands, I was ready to sink with surprise ; but a
flood of tears soon brought me to myself. I then
in my turn embraced him as my deliverer, and
we rejoiced together. Having brought the prison-
ers before me, I asked them what they had to say
in their own defence, telling them I had power
to execute them there.
They pleaded the captain's promise of mercy.
I then told them that I intended to go a passen-
ger in the ship, with all my men ; but that they,
if they went, could only go as prisoners; observ-
ing, however, that they might, if they chose it,
stay in the island This they gladly accepted, and
I prepared to go on board the next day. The
captain returning to the ship, got every thing
ready for my reception.
When he was gone, I talked to the men, told
them my story, how I managed my household
business; instructed them in all I knew, and gave
them my best advice with regard to their beha-
viour to one another.
I divided the tools among them in this man-
ner. To every man I gave a digging spade, a
shovel, and a rake, as having no harrows or
ploughs; and to every separate place a pickaxe,
a crow, a broad axe, and a saw, with a store for
a general supply, should any be broken or worn
out. I left them also nails, staples, hinges, ham-
mers, chisels, knives, scissors, and all sorts of tools
and iron-work ; and for the use of the smith, I
gave him three tons of unwrought iron for a sup-
ply: and as to arms and ammunition, I stored
them sufficiently to equip a little army. The
next day I went on board the ship, taking Friday
with me.
The next morning two of the men came swim-
mingto the ship's side, desiring the captain to take
them on board, though he hanged them after-
wards, complaining mightily how barbarously the
others used them. Upon which I prevailed with
the captain to take them in, and being severely
whipped and pickled, they proved more honest
for the future. And so I bade farewell to the is-
land, carrying along with me my money, parrot,
umbrella, and goat-skin cap, setting sail Decem-
ber 12, 1686, after twenty-eight years, two
months, and nineteen days residence, the same
day and month that I escaped from Salee, land-
ing in England, June 11, 1687, after thirty-five
years absence from my native country, which ren-
dered me altogether a stranger to it. Some time
after I went to Lisbon, to see after my effects in
the Brazils, and found the generous captain, who
had been so much my friend, still alive, and he
put me in the way of recovering the produce of
my plantations. And a few months after, there
arrived ships in the Tagus, with effects for my

use, to the amount of £5000, besides £1000
a-year, which I expected to receive annually for
my plantation.
Having now lived 72 years, chequered with in-
finite variety, and been taught the value of retire-
ment, I resolved to harass myself no more, but to
look forward to the blessing of ending my days in
peace, and in the true worship of that God who
has protected and delivered me in all my troubles.
