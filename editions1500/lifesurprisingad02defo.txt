ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



That homely proverb used on so many occasions 
in England, viz. " That what is bred in the bone, 
will not go out of the flesh,'' was never more veri- 
fied than in the story of my life. Any one would 
think, that after thirty-five years' affliction, and a 
variety of unhappy circumstances, whi,ch few men, 
if any, ever went through before, and after near 
seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness of 
all things, grown old, and when, if ever, it might 
be allowed me to have had experience of every state 
of middle life, and to know which was most adapted 
to make a man completely happy ; I say, after all 
this, any one would have thought that the native 
propensity to rambling, which I gave an account of 
in mv first setting out in the world to have been so 
predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, 
the volatile part be fully evacuated, or at least con- 
densed, and I might, at sixty-one years of age, have 
been a little inclined to stay at home, and have done 
venturing life and fortune any more. 

Nay, farther, tlie common motive of foreign ad-

ventures was taken away in me: for I had no for- 
tune to make ; I had nothing to seek: if I had gain- 
ed ten thousand pounds, I had been no richer ; for 
I liad already sufficient for me, and for those I had 
to leave it to; and that I had was visibly increasing; 
for having no great family, I could not spend the 
income of what I had, unless I would set up for an 
expensive way of living, such as a great family, ser- 
vants, equipage, gaity, and the like, which were 
things I had no notion of, or inclination to ; so that 
I had nothing indeed to do but to sit still, and fully 
enjoy what 1 had got, and see it increase daily upon 
my hands Yet all these things had no effect upon 
me. or at least not enough to resist the strong in- 
clination I had to go abroad again, vv hich hung about 
me like a chronical distemper. In particular, the 
desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, and 
the colony I left there, ran in my head continually. 
I dreamed of it all night, and my imagination ran 
upon it all day; it was uppermost in all my thoughts; 
and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon 
it, that I talked of it in my sleep; in short, nothing 
could remove it out of my mind: it even broke so 
violently into all my discourses, that it made my 
conversation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing 
else ; all my discourse ran into it, even to imperti- 
nence; and I saw it in myself. 

I have often heard persons of good judgement say, 
that all the stir people make in the world about 
ghosts and apparitions, is owing to the strength of 
imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy in 
their minds; that there is no such thing as a spirit ap- 
pearing, or a ghost walking, and the like: that peo- 
ple's })oring affectionately upon the past conversa- 
tion of their deceased friends, so realises it to them, 
that they are capable of fancying, upon some extra- 
ordinary circumstances, that ihey see them, talk to

them, and are answered by them, when, in truth, 
there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing, 
and they I'eally know nothing of the matter. 

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there 
are any such things as real apparitions, spectres, or 
walking of people after they are dead; or whether 
there is any thing in the stories they tell us of that 
kind, more than the product of vapours, sick minds, 
and wandering fancies : but this 1 know, that my ima- 
gination worked up to such a height, and brought 
me into such excess of vapours, or what else I may 
call it, that I actually supposed myself often upon 
the spot at my old castle behind the trees; saw my 
old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the reprobate 
sailors I left upon the island; nay, I fancied I talked 
with them, and looked at them steadily, though I 
was broad awake, as at persons just before me ; and 
this I did till 1 often frightened myself with the 
images my fancy represented to me. One time, in 
my sleep, I had the villainy of the three pirate sail- 
ors, so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and 
Friday's father, that it was surprising ; they told me 
how they barbarously attempted to murder all the 
Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provisions they 
had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve them; 
things that 1 had never heard of, and that indeed were 
never all of them true in fact; but it was so warm 
in my imagination, and so realised to me, that, 
to the hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded 
but that it was or would be, true ; also how I re- 
. seated it, when the Spaniard complained to me, and 
how I brought them to justice, ti*ied them before 
me, and ordered them all three to be hanged. What 
there was really in this, shall be seen in its place : 
for however I came to form such things in my dream, 
and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet 
there was, I say, much of it true. I own, that this 

b2 



* ADVENTURES OF 

dream had nothing in it hterally and specifically 
true ; but the general part was so true, the base 
villanous behaviour of these three hardened rogues 
was such, and had been so much worse than all I can 
describe., that the dream had too much similitude of 
the fact: and as 1 would afterwards have punished 
them severely, so, if I had hanged them ail, I had 
been much in the right, and even should have been 
justified both by the laws of God and man. But to 
return to my story: In this kind of temper I lived 
some years; 1 had no enjoyment of my life, no plea- 
sant hours, no agreeable diversion, but what had 
something or other of this in it, so that my wife, 
who saw my mind wholl}' bent upon it, told me very 
seriously one night, that she believed there was sonic 
secret powerful impulse of Providence upon me, 
which had determined me to go thither again ; and 
that she found nothing hindered my going, but my 
being engaged to a wife and children. She told me, 
that it was true she could not think of parting with 
me; but as she was assured, that if she was dead it 
would be the first thing 1 would do; so, as it seem- 
ed to her that the thing was determined above, she 
would not be the only obstruction; for, if I thought 

fit, and resolved to go- Here she found me very 

intent upon her words, and that i looked very earn- 
estly at her, so that it a little disordered her, and 
she stopped. I asked her, why she did not go ort, 
and say out what she was going to say ? But I per- 
ceive d that her heart was too full, and some tears 
stood in her eyes. Speak out, my dear, said I; are 
you willing I should go? No, says she, very affec- 
tionately, 1 am far from willing; but if you are re- 
solved to go, says she, and rather than 1 would be 
the only hmdrance, ] will go with you: for though 
I think it a most preposterous thing for one of your 
years, and in your condition, yet, if it must be, said 



HOBINSON CRUSOE. 5 

ske, again weeping, I would not leave you; for, if it 
be of Heaven, you must do it; there is no resisting 
it ; and if Heaven make it your duty to go, he will 
also make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dis- 
pose of me, that I may not obstruct it. 

This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought 
me a little out of the vapours, and I began to con- 
sider what I was doing ; I corrected my wandering 
fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately, 
what business 1 had, after threescore years, and af- 
ter such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and 
closed in so happy and easy a manner; 1 say, what 
business had i to rush into new hazards, and put 
myself upon adventures fit only for youth and po- 
verty to run into ? 

With those tl)oughts I considered my new en- 
gagement ; that I had a wife, one child born, and 
my wife then great with child of another ; that I 
had all the v/orkl could give me, and had no need 
to seek hazard for gain ; that I was declining in 
years, and ought to think rather of leaving what I 
had gained, than of seeking to increase it ; that as 
to what my wife had said of its being an impulse 
from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, 
I had no notion of that : so, after many of these 
cogitations, 1 struggled with the power of my ima- 
gination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe 
people may always do in like cases if they will : and, 
in a word I conquered it; composed myself with 
such arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and 
which my present condition furnished me plentifully 
with ; and particularly, as the most effectual me- 
thod, 1 resolved to divert myself with other tilings, 
and to engage in some business that might effectu- 
ally tie me up from any more excursions of this kind ; 
for 1 found that thing return upon me chiefly when 
I was idle, and had nothino; to do, uor any thing o*

moment immediately before lue. To this purpose 
I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, 
and resolved to remove myself thither. I had a 
little convenient house upon it ; and the land about 
it, I found, was capable of great improvement; and 
it was many ways suited to my inclination, which 
delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, and 
improving of land ; and particularly being an inland 
country, I was removed from conversing among 
sailors, and things relating to the remote parts of 
the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my 
family, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, wag- 
gon, horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting seriously 
to work, became, in one half-year, a mere country 
gentleman : my thoughts were entirely taken up in 
managing my servants, cultivating the ground, en- 
closing, planting, &c. ; and I lived, as 1 thought, 
the most agreeable life that nature was capable of 
directing, or that a man always bred to misfortunes 
was capable of retreating to. 

I farmed upon my own land ; I had no rent to 
pay, was limited by no articles ; I could pull up or 
cut down as I pleased : what I planted was for my- 
self, and what I improved was for my family ; and 
liaving thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had 
not the least discomfort in any part of life as to this 
world. Now I thought indeed that I enjoyed the 
middle state of life which my father so earnestly re- 
commended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, 
something like what is described by the poet, upon 
the subject of a country life — 

" Free from vices, free from care, 

" Age has no paiii, and youth do snare." 

But, in the middle of all this felicity, one blow 
from unseen Providence unhinged me at once ; and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 7 

not only made a breach upon me inevitable and in- 
curable, but drove me, by its consequences, into a 
deep relapse of the wandering disposition, which, as 
1 may say, being born in my very blood, soon re- 
covered its hold of me. and like the returns of a 
violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force 
upon me, so that nothing could make any more 
impi'ession upon me. This blow was the loss of my 
wife. It is not my business here to write an elegy 
upon my wife, give a character of her particular 
virtues, and make my court to the sex by the flat- 
tery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, 
the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my enter- 
prises, the engine that, by her prudence, reduced 
me to that happy compass I was in, from the most 
extravagant and ruinous project that fluttered in my 
head, as above, and did more to guide my rambling 
genius than a mother's tears, a father's instructions, 
a friend's counsel, or all my own resoning powers, 
could do- I was happy in listening to her tears, and 
in being moved by her entreaties ; and to the last 
degree desolate and dislocated in the world by the 
loss of her. 

When she was gone, the woi'ld looked awkwardly 
round me. I was as much a stranger in it, in my 
thoughts, as I was in the Brazils, when I first went 
on shore thei'e; and as much alone, except as to the 
assistance of servants, as 1 was in my island. I knew 
neither what to think nor what to do. I saw the 
world busy around me; one part labouring for bread, 
another part squandering in vile excesses or empty 
pleasures, equally miserable, because the end they 
proposed still fled from them; for the men of plea- 
sure every day surfeited of their vice, and heaped up 
work for sorrow and repentance; and the men of 
labour spent their strength in daily struggling for 
bread to maintain the vital strength they ii^boured 



S ADVENTURES OF 

with: so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, liv- 
ing but to work, and working but to live, as if daily 
bread were the only end of wearisome life, and a 
wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life 1 lived in my 
kingdom, the island ; where 1 suffered no more corn 
to grow, because 1 did not want it : and bred no 
more goats, because I had no more use for them; 
where the money lay in the drawer till it grew moul- 
dy, and had scarce the favour to be looked upon 
in twenty years. 

All these things, had I improved them, as [ ought 
to have done, and as reason and religion had dic- 
tated to me, would have taught me to search farther 
than human 'enjoyments for a full felicity ; and that 
there was something which certainly was the reason 
andend of life, superior to all these things, and which 
was either to be possessed, or at least hoped for, 
on this side the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone ; I was like a 
ship without a pilot, that could only run afore the 
wind : my thoughts ran all away again into the old 
affair; my head was quite turned with the whimsies 
of foreign adventures; and all the pleasant, innocent 
amusements of my farm, my garden, my caitle, and 
my family, which before entirely possessed me, were 
nothing to me, had no relish, and were like music 
to one that has no ear, or food to one that has no 
taste: in a word I resolved to leave off housekeep- 
ing, let my farm, and return to London ; and in a 
few months after, I did so. 

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as 
I was before ; 1 had no relish for the place, no em- 
ployment in it, nothing to do but to saunter about 
like an idle person, of whom it may be said he is 
perfectly useless in (iod's creation, and it is not one 
farthing's matter to the rest of his kind whether he

he dead or alive. This also was the thing which, 
of all circumstances of life, was the most my aver- 
sion, who had been all my davs used to an active 
life ; and I would often say to myself, A state of 
idleness is the very dregs of life : and indeed I 
thought 1 was much more suitably employed when 
I was twenty-six days making me a deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when 
my nephew, whom as I have observed before, 1 had 
brought up to the sea, and had made him comman- 
der of a ship, was come home from a short voyage 
to Bilboa, being the first he had made. He came 
to me, and toid me that some merchants of his ac- 
quaintance had been proposing to him to go a voyage 
for them to the East Indies and to China, as private 
traders. — And now, uncle, says he, if you will go to 
sea with me, I will engage to land you upon your 
old habitation in the island ; for we are to touch at 
the Brazils. 

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a fu- 
ture state, and of the existence of an invisible world, 
than the concurrence of second causes with the ideas 
of things which we form in our minds, perfectly I'e-* 
served, and not communicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper 
of wandering was returned upon me, and I knew 
nothing of what he had in his thought to say, vi'hen 
that very morning, before he came to me, 1 had, in 
a great deal of coni'usion of thought, ana revolving 
every part of my circumstances in my mind, come 
to this resolution, viz. that 1 would go to Lisbon, 
and consult with my old sea-captain ; and so, if it 
was rational and practicdble, 1 would go and see 
the island again, and see what was become of my 
people there. I had pleased myself with the 
thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying in- 
habitants from hence, getting a patent for the pes- 



10 ADVENTURES OT 

session, and I knew not what; when, in the middle 
of all this, in conies my nei)hew, as 1 have said, 
with his project of carrying me thither in his way 
to the East Indies. 

I paused awhile at his words, and, looking stead- 
ily at him, What devil, said 1, sent you on this un- 
lucky errand? My nephew stared, as if he had 
been frightened, at first : but perceiving that I was 
not nuich displeased with the proposal, he reco- 
vered himself. I hope it may not be an unlucky pro- 
posal, sir, says he ; 1 dare say you would be pleased 
to see your new colony there, where you once 
reigned with more felicity than most of your bro- 
ther-monarchs in the world. 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my 
temper, that is to say, the prepossession I was 
under, and of which I have said so much, that I told 
him, in a few words, if he agreed with the merchants 
I would go with him : but I told him I would not 
promise to go any farther than my own island. 
Why, sir, says he, you don't want to be left there 
again, I hope? Why, said I, can you not take me 
up again on your return ? He told me it would not 
be possible to do so ; that the merchants would never 
allow him to come tliat way with a laden ship of 
such value, it being a month's sail out of his way, 
and might be three or four. Besides, sir, if I 
should miscarry, said he, and not return at all, 
then you would be just reduced to tlie condition 
you were in before. 

This was very rational; but we both found out a 
remedy for it ; which was, to carry a framed sloop 
on board the ship, which being taken in pieces, and 
shipijcd on board the ship, might, by the help of 
KOine carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, 
be set up again in the island, and finished, fit to go 
to sea, in a few days. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. II 

I was not long resolving ; for indeed the impor- 
tunities of my nephew joined so etfectuahy with my 
inclination, that nothing could oppose me ; on the 
other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody con- 
cerned themselves so much for me as to persuade me 
to one way or the other, except my ancient good 
friend the widow, who earnestly struggled with me 
to consider my years, my easy circumstances, and 
the needless hazards of a long voyage ; and, above 
all, my young children. But it was all to no pur- 
pose;— I had an irresistible desire to the voyage; 
and I told her 1 thought there was something so 
uncommon in the impressions I had upon my mind 
for the voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting 
Providence if I should attempt to stay at home : after 
which she ceased her expostulations, and joined with 
me, not only in making provision for my voyage 
but also in settling my family-affairs for my absence, 
and providing for the education of my children. 

In order to this, 1 made my will, and settled the 
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and 
placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and 
satisfied they would have justice done them, what- 
ever might befall me: and for their education, I left 
it wholly to the widow, with a sufficient maintenance 
to herself for her care : all which she richly deserved, 
for no mother could have taken more care in their 
education, or understood it better : and as she lived 
till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning 
of January 1691-5; and I, with my man Friday, 
went on board in the Downs the 8th : having, be- 
sides that sloop which I mentioned above, a very 
considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things 
for my colony; which, if I did not find in good con- 
dition, I resolved to leave so. 

First, 1 carried with me some servants, whom I 



12 ADVENTURES OP 

purposed to place there as inhabitants, or at least to 
set on work there, upon my account, while I staid, 
and either to leave them there, or carry them for- 
ward, as they would a})pear willing; particularly, I 
carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy 
ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and 
was also a general mech:mic ; for he vvas dexterous 
at making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, was 
a good turner, and a good pot maker ; he also made 
any thing that was proper to make of earth, or of 
wood; in a word, we called him our Jack of all 
trades. With these 1 carried a tailor, who hud offered 
himself to go a passenger to the East Indies with my 
nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our 
new plantation; and proved a most necessary, handy 
fellow, as could be desired, in many other businesses 
besides that of his trade : for, as I observed formerly, 
Necessity arms us for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as i can recollect, for I have 
not kept account of the particulars, consisted of a 
sufficient quantity of linen, and some English thin 
stuft's, for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to 
find there; and enough of then), as. by my calcula- 
tion, might comfortably .supply them for seven years: 
if 1 remember right, the materials I carried for cloth- 
ing them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all 
such things as they could want for wearing, amount- 
ed to above two hundred pounds, including some 
beds, bedding, and household stuff, particularly 
kitchen-utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, 
&c. and near a hundred pounds more in iron-work, 
nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and 
every necessary thing I could think of. 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and 
fusees; besides some pistols, a considerable quantity 
of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and 
two pieces of brass cannon ; and because I knew not 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13 

what time and what extremities I was providing 
for, I carried a hundred barrels of powder, besides 
swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes 
and halberds : so that, in short, we had a large ma- 
gazine of all sorts of stores : and I made my nephew 
carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he 
wanted for his ship, to leave behind if there was oc- 
casion ; that, when we came there, we might build 
a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies : 
and, indeed, I at first thought there v/ould be need 
enough for all, and much more, if we hoped to 
maintain our possession of the island ; as shall be 
seen in the course of that story, 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had 
been used to meet with ; and therefore shall have the 
less occasion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps 
may be impatient to hear how matters went with my 
colony : yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad 
weather, happened on this first setting out, which 
made the voyage longer than I expected it at first: 
and I, who had never made but one voyage, viz. my 
first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said to 
come back again as the voyage was at first designed, 
began to think the same ill fate attended me ; and 
that I was born to be never contented with being on 
shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at sea. 

Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and 
we were obliged to put in at Galway iu Ireland, v,'here 
we lay windbound two-and-twenty days; but we 
had this satisfaction with the disaster, that pro- 
visions were here exceeding cheap, and in the ut- 
most plenty ; so that while we lay here, we never 
touched the ship's stores, but rather added to them. 
Here, also, I took in several live hogs, and two 
cows, with their calves ; which I resolved, if I had 
a good passage, to put on shore in my island ; but 
we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them.

14' ADVENTURES OF 

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, 
and had a very fair gale of wind for some days. As 
I remember, it might be about the 20th of Febru- 
ary, in the evening late, when the mate, having the 
watch, came into the round-house, and told us he 
saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and while 
he was telling us of it, a boy came in, and told us 
the boatswain heard another. This made us all run 
out upon the quarter-deck, where, for a while, we 
heard nothing ; but in a i'ew minutes we saw a very 
great light, and found that there was some very 
terrible fire at a distance : immediately we had re- 
course to our reckonings, in which we all agreed, 
that there could be no land that way in which the 
fire showed itself, no, not for five hundred leagues, 
for it appeared at W. N . \V. Upon this we concluded 
it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by our 
hearing the noise of guns just before, we cenicluded 
that it could not be far off, we stood directly towai'ds 
it, and were presently satisfied we should discover it, 
because, the farther we sailed, the greater the light 
appeared; though, the weather being hazy, we could 
not perceive any thing but the light for a while. In 
about half an hour's sailing, the wind being fair for 
us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing 
up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a 
great ship on fire, in the middle of the sea. 

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, 
though not at all acquainted with the persons en- 
gaged in it: I presently recollected my former cir- 
cumstances, and in what condition 1 was in, when 
taken up by the Portuguese captain ; and how nmch 
more deplorable the cwcumstances of the poor crea- 
tures belonging to that ship must be, if they had 
no other ship in company with them. Upon this, I 
immediately ordered that five guns should be fired, 
one soon alter another ; that, if possible, we might

ffive notice to tliem that (here wns heln for them at 
hand, and that they uiight endeavour to save them- 
selves in their boat ; for though we could see the 
flames of the ship, yet they, it being night, could 
see nothing of us. 

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as 
tlie burning ship drove, waiting for day-light; when, 
on a sudden, to our great terror, though we had 
reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air; and 
immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all 
the fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the ship 
sunk. This was a terrible and indeed an afllicting 
sight, for the sake of the poor men ; who, I con- 
cluded, must be either all destroyed in'the ship, or 
be in the utnwst distress in their boat, in the middle 
of the ocean: which, at present, by reason it was 
dark, I could not see. However, to direct them as 
well as 1 could, I caused lights to be hung out in all 
the parts of the ship where we could, and which we 
had lanthorns for, and kept firing guns all the night 
long ; letting them know, by this, that there was a 
ship not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning, we disco- 
vered the ship's boats bj'the help of our perspective- 
glasses; found there were two of them, both throng- 
ed with people, and deep in the water. We per- 
ceived they rowed, the wind being against them ; 
that they saw our ship, and did their utmost to make 
OS see them. 

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them 
know we saw them, and hung a wafc out, as a signal 
for them to co.ne on board ; and then made more 
sail, standing directly to them. In little more than 
half an hour, we came up with them ; and, in a word, 
took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men. 
women, and children ; for there were a great many 
passengers.

16 ADVENTURES OF 

Upon the wholc,vve found it was a French merchant- 
ship ol'threehundrcdtons, home-bound from Quebec, 
in the river of Canada. The master gave us a long ac- 
count of the distress of his ship; how the fire began in 
the steerage, by the negHgence of the steerman ; but 
on his crying out for help, was, as every body thought, 
entirely put out ; but they soon found that some sparks 
of the first fire had gotten into some part of the ship 
so difficult to come at, that they could not etfectu- 
ally quench it ; and afterwards getting in between 
the timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it 
proceeded into the hold, and mastered all the skill 
and all the application they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then, but to get into 
their boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty 
large; being their long-boat, and a great, shalop, 
besides a small skiff, which was of no great service 
to them, other than to get some fresh water and pro- 
visions into her, after they had secured their lives 
from the fire. They had, indeed, small hope of 
their lives by getting into these boats, at that dis- 
tance from any land ; only, as they said well, that 
they were escaped from the fire, and a possibility 
that some sliip might happen to be at sea, and might 
take them in. They had sails, oars, and a compass ; 
and were preparing to make the best of their way 
back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing pretty 
fair, for it blew an easy gale at S. E. by E. They 
had as much provision and water, as, with sparing 
it so as to be next door to starving, might support 
them about twelve days; in which, if they had no 
bad weather, and no contrary winds, the captain 
said he hoped he n)ight get to the Banks of New- 
foundland, and might perhaps take some fish, to 
sustain them till they might go on shore. But there 
were so many chances against them in all these cases, 
such as storms, to overset and founder them ; rains 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 17 

and cold, to benumb and perish their Hmbs ; con- 
trary winds, to keep them out and starve them ; 
that it must have been next to miraculous if they 
had escaped. 

In the midst of their consternation, every one be- 
ing hopeless and ready to despair, the captain, with 
tears in his eyes, told me they were on a sudden sur- 
prised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after 
that four more ; these were the five guns which I 
caused to be fired at first seeing the light. This re- 
vived their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, 
as above, I desired it sliould, viz. that there was a 
ship at hand for their help. It was upon the hearing 
of these guns, that they took down their masts and 
sails : the sound coming from the windward, they 
resolved to lie-by till niorning. Some time after 
this, hearing no more guns, they fired three mus- 
kets, one a considerable while after another ; but 
these, the Avind being contrary, we never heard. 

Some tiuie after that again, they were still more 
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and hear- 
ing the guns which, as I have said, 1 caused to be 
fired all the rest of the night : this set them to work 
with their oars, to keep their boats ahead, at least, 
that we might the sooner come up with them ; and, 
at last, to their inexpi"essible joy, they found we 
saw them. 

It is imposible for me to express the several ges- 
tures, the strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, 
which these poor delivered people ran into, to ex- 
press the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deli- 
verance. Grief and fear are easily described; sighs, 
tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head 
and hands, make up the sum of its variety; but an 
excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand ex- 
travagancies in it : there vyere some in tears ; some 
raging and tearing themselves, as if they had beeu 

c3 



18 ADVENTURES OF 

in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving, 
and downright lunatic; some ran about the ship 
stamping with their feet, others wringing their hands; 
some were dancing, some singing, some laughing, 
more crying ; many quite dumb, not able to speak 
a word ; others sick and vomiting ; several swoon- 
ing, and ready to faint; and a few were crossing 
themselves, and giving God thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither ; there might be 
many that were thankful afterwards, but the passion 
was too strong for them at first, and they were not 
able to master it : they were thrown into ecstasies, 
and a kind of phrensy ; and it was but a very few 
that were composed and serious in their joy. 

Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition 
to it from tlie particular circumstance of that nation 
they belonged to; I mean the French, whose temper 
is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and 
more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than in 
other nations. I am not philosopher enough to 
determine the cause ; but nothing I had ever seen 
before -came up to it. The ecstasies poor Friday, 
my trusty savage, was in, when he found his father 
in the boat, came the nearest to it ; and the surprise 
of the master and his two companions, whom 1 de- 
livered froin the villains that set them on shore in 
the island, came a little way towards it; but no- 
thing was to compare to this, either that I saw in 
Friday, or any where else in my life. 

It is further observable, that these extravagances 
did not shov/ themselves, in that different manner I 
have mentioned, in different persons only ; but all 
the variety would appear, in a short succession of 
moments, in one and the same person. A man that 
we saw this minute dumb, and as it were stupid and 
confounded, would the next minute be dancing and 
hollowing like an antic; and the next moment be 



UOBINSON cnusoE. 19 

tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, 
and stamping them under his feet, like a madman ; 
in a few nioraents after that, we would have him all 
in tears, then sick, swooning, and, had not innnedi- 
ate help been had, he would in a few moments have 
been dead ; and thus it was, not with one or two, 
or ten or twenty, but with the greatest part of them : 
and, if I remember right, our surgeon was obhged 
to let blood of about thirty «)f them. 

There were two priests among tliem, one an old 
man, and the other a young man ; and that which 
was strangest was, the oldest man was the worst. 
As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and 
saw himself safe, he dropt down stone-dead, to aU 
appearance; not the least sign of life could be per- 
ceived in him : our surgeon immediately applied pro- 
per remedies to recover him, and was the only man 
in the ship that believed he was not dead. At length 
he opened a vein in his arm, having first cluafcd and 
rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much as possi- 
ble : upon this the blood, which only dropped at 
first, flowing freely, in three minutes after the man 
opened his eyes ; and a quarter of an hour after 
that he s))oke, grew better, and in a little time quite 
well. After the blood was stopped, he walked about; 
told us he v/as perfectly well; took a dram of cordial 
which the surgeon gave him, and was what we called 
come to himself. About a quarter of an hour after 
this, they came running into the cabin to the sur- 
geon, who was bleeding a French woman that had 
fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark mad. 
It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his 
circumstances in his mind, and again this put him 
into an ecstasy of joy ; his spirits whirled about faster 
than the vessels could convey them, the blood grew 
hot and feverish, and the man was as fit for Bedlam 
as any creature that ever was in it: the surgeon 



20 ADVENTURES OF 

would not bleed him again in that condition, but 
gave him something to doze and put him to sleep, 
which, after some time, operated upon him, and he 
awoke next morning perfectly composed and well. 

The younger priest behaved with great command 
of his passions, and was really an example of a serious, 
well-governed mind : at his first coming on board 
the ship, he threw himself flat on his face, prostrat- 
ing himself in thankfulness for his deliverance, in 
which I unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him, 
really thinking he had been in a swoon ; but he spoke 
calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving God 
thanks for his deliverance ; begged me to leave him 
a few moments, and that, next to his Maker, he 
would give me thanks also. 

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not 
only left him, but kept others from interrupting him 
also. He continued in that posture about three mi- 
nutes, or little more, after 1 left him; then came 
to me, as he had said he would, and, with a great 
deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in 
his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given 
him, and so many miserable creatures, their lives. 
I told him 1 had no room to move him to thank God 
for it, rather than me, for I had seen that he had 
done that already ; but, I added, that it was nothing- 
hut what reason and humanity dictated to all men, 
and that we had as much reason as h j to give thanks 
to God, who had blessed us so far, as to make us the 
instruments of his mercy to so many of his creatures. 

After this, the young priest applied himself to his 
country-folks ; laboured to compose them ; persuad- 
ed, entreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did 
his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their 
reason ; and with some he had success, though others 
were for a time out uf all government of themselves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as per- 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 21 

haps it may be useful to those into whose hands it 
may fall, for the guiding themselves in all the extra- 
vagances of their passions ; for if an excess of joy 
can carry men out to such a length beyond the reach 
of their reason, what will not the extravagances of 
anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to ? 
And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an ex- 
ceeding watch over our passions of every kind, as 
well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of sorrow 
and anger. 

We were something disordered, by these extrava- 
gances among our new guests, for the first day ; but 
when they had been retired, lodgings provided for 
them as well as our ship would allow, and they had 
slept heartily — as most of them did, being fatigued 
and frightened — they were quite another sort of peo- 
ple the next day. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledg- 
ments for the kindness shown them, was wanting ; 
the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough 
to exceed that way. The captain and one of the 
priests came to me the next day, and desired to speak 
w'th me and my nephew : the commander began ta 
consult with us what should be done with them ; 
and, first, they told us that we had saved their lives, 
so ail they had was little enough for a return to us 
for that kindness I'eceived. The captain said they 
had saved some money, and some things of value, 
in their boats, catched hastily out of the flames, and 
if we would accept it, they were ordered to make an 
offer of it all to us ; they only desired to be set on 
shore somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they 
might get a passage to France. My nephew was 
for accepting their money at first word, and to con- 
sider what to do with them afterwards ; but I over- 
ruled him in tliat part, for I knew what it was to be 
set on shore in a strange country : and if the Portu- 



22 ADVENTURES OF 

guese captain that took me up at sea had served me 
so, and took all 1 had for my deliverance, I must 
have starved, or have been as much a slave at the 
Brazils as I had been at Barbary, the mere being 
sold to a Mahometan excepted : and perhaps a Por- 
tuguese is not a much better master than a Turk, if 
not, in some cases, much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had 
taken them up in their distress, it was true, but 
that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow-crea- 
tures ; and we would desire to be so delivered, if we 
were in the like, or any other extremity ; that we 
had done nothing for them but what we believed 
they would have done for us, if we had been in 
their case, and they in ours; but that we took 
them up to save them, not to plunder them; and it 
would be a most barbarous thing to take that little 
from them which they had saved out of the fire, and 
then set them on shore and leave them ; that this 
would be first to save them from death, and then 
kill them ourselves ; save them from drowning, and 
abandon them to starving ; and therefore I would 
not let the least thing be taken from them. As 
to setting them on shore, 1 told them, indeed, that 
was an exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship 
was bound to the East Indies ; and though we were 
driven out of our course to the westward a very great 
way, and perhaps v/ere directed by Heavoi on j)ur- 
pose for their deliverance, yet it was impossible ibr 
us wilfully to change our voyage on their particular 
account; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer 
it to the freighters, with whom he was under char- 
ter-party to pursue his voyage by the way of Brazil: 
and all I knew we could do for them, was to put 
ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships 
houjcward-bound from the West Indies, and get 
them a ])assage, if possible, to England or France. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and 
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; 
but they were in avery great consternation, especially 
the passengers, at the notion of being carried away 
to the East Indies : they then entreated me, that 
seeing I was driven so far to the westward before I 
met with them, I would at least keep on the same 
course to the Banks of Newfoundland, v.'here it was 
probable I might meet with some ship or sloop that 
they might hire to carry them back to Canada, from 
whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on 
their part, and therefore I inclined to agree to it ; 
for, indeed, I considered, that to carry this whole 
company to the East Indies, would not only be an 
intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would 
be ruining our whole voyage, by devouring all our 
provisions ; so I thought it no breach of charter- 
party, but what an unforeseen accident made abso- 
lutely necessary to us, and in which no one could 
say we were to blame : for the laws of God and na- 
ture would have forbid that we should refuse to take 
up two boats full of people in such a distressed condi- 
tion ; and the nature of the thing, as vv^ell respecting 
ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set them 
on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance : 
so I consented that we would carry them to New- 
foundland, if wind and weather would permit ; and 
if not, that I would carry them to Martinico, in the 
West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the wea- 
ther pretty good ; and as the winds had continued 
in the points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, 
we missed several opportunities of sending them to 
France ; for we met several ships bound to Europe, 
whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's ; 
but they had been so long beating up against the 



24 ADVENTUUES OP 

wind, that they durst take in no passengers, For 
fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well 
for themselves as for those they should take in ; so 
we were obliged to go on. It was about a week af- 
ter this that we made the Banks of Newfoundland; 
where, to shorten my story, we put all our French 
people on board a bark, which they hired at sea 
there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to car- 
ry them to France, if they could get provisions to 
victual themselves with. When I say, all the 
French went on shore, I should remember that the 
young priest I spoke of, hearing we were bound to 
the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, 
and to be set on shore on the Coast of Coromandel; 
which I readily agreed to, for I v.ondcrfully liked 
the man, and had very good reason, as will appear 
afterwards ; also four of the seamen entered them- 
selves on our ship, and p'-oved very useful fellows. 
From hence we directed our course for th.e West 
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about 
twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind at 
all ; when we met with another subject for our hu- 
manity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that 
before. 

It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes 
north, on the 19th day of March I()94-5, when we 
spied a sail, our course S. E. and by S. : we soon 
perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up 
to us, but could not at first know what to make of 
her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found she 
had lost her main top-mast, fore-mast, and bowsprit ; 
and presently she fired a gun, as a signal of distress: 
the weather was pretty good, wind at N. N. W. a 
fresh gale, and we soon came to speak with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from 
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road at 
liarbadoes a few days before she was ready to sail, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief 
mate were both gone on shore ; so that, besides the 
terror of the storm, they were in an indifferent case 
for good artists to bring the ship home. They had 
been ah-eady nine weeks at sea, and bad met with 
another terrible storm, after the hurricane was over, 
which had blown them quite out of their knowledge 
to the westward, and in which they lost their masts, 
as above. They told us they expected to have seen 
the Bahama islands, but were then driven away 
again to the south-east, by a strong gale of wind at 
N. N. W. the same that blew now : and having no 
sails to work the ship with but a main-course, and 
a kind of square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which 
they had set up, they could not lie near the wind, 
but were endeavouring to stand away for the 
Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all was, that they 
were almost starved for want of provisions, besides 
thefatigues they had undergone: theirbread and flesh 
were quite gone ; they had not one ounce left in the 
ship, and had none for eleven days. The only re- 
lief they had was, their water was not all spent, and 
they had about half a barrel of flour left ; they had 
sugar enough ; some succades, or sweet meats, they 
had at first, but they were devoured; and they had 
seven casks of rum. 

There were a youth and his mother, and a maid 
servant, on board, v/ho were going passengers, and 
thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came 
on board the evening before the hurricane began ; 
and having no provisions of their own left, they 
were in a more deplorable condition than the rest : 
for the seamen being reduced to such an extreme ne- 
cessity themselves, had no compassion, we may be 
sure, for the poor passengers ; and they were, in- 



26 ADVENTURES OF 

deed, in a condition, that their misery is very hard 
to describe. 

1 had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity 
had not led nie (the weather being fair, and the 
wind abated) to go on board the ship. The second 
niaie, who, upon this occasion, commanded the 
sliip, had been on board our ship, and he told me, 
indeed, they had three passengers in the great cabin, 
that were in a deplorable condition : Nay, says he, 
I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of 
them fur above two days; and 1 was afraid to inquire 
after theui, said he, for 1 had nothing to relieve them 
with. 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them 
what relief we could spare; and. indeed, I had so 
far overruled things with my nephew, that I would 
have victualled them, though we had gone away to 
Virginia, or any other part of the coast of America, 
to have supplied ourselves ; but there was no neces- 
sity for that. 

But now they were in a new danger ; for they 
were afraid of eating too much, even of that little 
we gave them. The mate or conmiander brought 
six men with him in his boat ; but these poor 
wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak, 
that they could hardly sit to their oars. The mate 
himself was very ill, and half starved ; for he de- 
clared he had reserved nothing from the men, and 
went share and share alike with them in every bit 
they ate. 

J cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat 
before him innnediately ; and he had not eaten three 
mouthfuls before he began to be .sick, and out of 
order ; so he stopped a while, and our surgeon 
mi.\ed him up something with some broth, which he 
said would be to him both food and physic; and after 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 27 

he had taken it, he grew better. In the mean time, 
I forgot not the men ; I ordered victuals to be given 
them ; and the poor creatures rather devoured than 
ate it: they were so exceeding hungry, that they 
were in a kind ravenous, and had no command of 
themselves ; and two of them ate with so much 
greediness, that they were in danger of their lives 
the next morning. 

The sight of these people's distress was very mov- 
ing to me, and brought to mind what I had a ter- 
rible prospect of at my first coming on shore in my 
island, where I had never the least mouthful of food, 
or any prospect of procuring any ; besides the hourly 
apprehensions I had of being made the food of other 
creatures. But all the while the mate was thus re- 
lating to me the miserable condition of the ship's 
company, I could not put out of my thought the 
story he had told me of the three poor creatures in 
the great cabin, viz. the mother, her son, and the 
maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for 
two or three days, and whom, he seemed to confess, 
they had wholly neglected, their own extremities 
being so great : by which I understood, that they 
had really given them no food at all, and that there- 
fore they must be perished, and be all lying dead, 
perhaps, on the floor or deck of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then call- 
ed captain, on board with his men, to refresh them, 
so I also forsiot not the starving crew that were left 
on board ; but ordered my own boat to go on board 
tlie ship, and, with my mate and twelve men, to 
carry them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces 
of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to 
cause the meat to be boiled while they staid, and 
to keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men 
taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot be- 
fore it was well boiled, and then to give every maa 

D 2 



58 ADVENTUUES OF 

but a very little at a time : and by this caution he 
preserved the men, wlio would otherwise have killed 
themselves with that very food that was given them 
on purpose to save their lives. 

At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into 
the great cabin, and see what condition the poor 
passengers were in ; and if they were alive, to com- 
fort them, and give them what refreshment was 
proper : and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher, 
with some of the prepared broth which he had given 
the mate that was on board, and which he did not 
question would restore them gradually. 

J was not satisfied with this ; but, as I said above, 
having a great mind to see the scene of misery which 
I knew the ship itself would present me with, in a 
more livel)' manner than 1 could have it by report, 
I took the captain of the ship, as we now called 
him, with me, and went myself, a little after, in 
their boat. 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, 
to get the victuals out of the boiler before it was 
ready ; but my mate observed his orders, and kept 
a good guard at the cook-room door ; and the man 
he placed there, after using all possible persuasion to 
have patience, kept them off by force : however, 
he caused some biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the 
pot, and softened with the liquor of the meat, which 
they called brevvis, and gave them every one some, 
to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for 
their own safety that he was obliged to give them 
but little at a time. But it was ail \n vain ; and had 
I not come on board, and their own connnander and 
officers with me, and with good words, and some 
threats also of giving them no more, I believe they 
would have brolven into the cook-room by force, and 
torn the meat out of the furnace ; for words are in- 
deed of very small force to a hungry belly : however, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 29 

we pacified them, and fed them gradually and cau- 
tiously for the first, and the next time gave them 
more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men 
did well enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin 
was of another nature, and far beyond the rest ; for 
as, first, the ship's company had so little for them- 
selves, it was but too true that they had at first kept 
them very low, and at last totally neglected them ; 
so that for six or seven days it might be said they 
had really no food at all, and for several days before 
very little. The poor mother, who, as the men re- 
ported, was a woman of sense and good-breeding, 
had spared all she could so affectionately for her son, 
that at last she entirely sunk under it ; and v/hen 
the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the floor 
or deck, with her back up against the sides, between 
two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head 
sunk between her shoulders, like a corpse, though 
not quite dead. INIy mate said all he could to re- 
vive and encourage her, and with a spoon put some 
broth into her mouth. She opened her lips, and 
lifted up one hand, but could not speak ; yet she 
understood what he said, and made signs to him, in- 
timating that it was too late for her, but pointed to 
her child, as if she would have said they should take 
care of him. However, the mate, who was exceed- 
ingly moved with the sight, endeavoured to get some 
of the broth into her mouth, and, as he said, got 
two or three spoonfuls down ; though I question 
whether he could be sure of it or not : but it was too 
late, and she died the same night. 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his 
most affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone ; 
yet he lay in a cabin-bed, as one stretched out, with 
hardly any life left in him. He had a piece of an old 
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it :

30 ADVENTURES OF 

however, being young, and having more strength 
than his motlier, the mate got something down his 
throat, and he began sensibly to revive ; though by 
giving him, gome time after, but two or tiree 
spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and 
brought it up again. 

But the next care was the poor maid : she lay 
all along upon the deck, hard by her mistress, and 
just like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, 
and struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted ; 
one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a 
chair, and she griped it so hard, that we could not 
easily make her let it go : her other arm lay over her 
head, and her feet lay both together, set fast against 
the frame of the cabin-table : in short, she lay just 
like one in the agonies of death, and yet she was 
alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hun- 
ger, and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, 
as the men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted 
for her mistress, whom she saw dying for two or 
three days before, and whom she loved most ten- 
derly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for 
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great 
knowledge and experience, had, with great appli- 
cation, recovered her as to life, he had her upon his 
hands as to her senses ; for she was little less than 
distracted for a considerable ti.ne after, as shall ap- 
pear presently. 

Whoever shall read these memorandums must be 
desired to consider, that visits at sea, are not like a 
journey into the country, where sometimes people 
stay a week or a fortnight at a place : our business 
was, to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie 
by for them; and though they were willing to steer 
the same course with us for some days, yet we could 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 31 

carry no sail, to keep pace with a ship that had no 
masts : however, as their captain begged of us to 
help him to set up a main-topraast, and a kind of a 
topmast to his jury-foremast, we did, as it were, 
lie by him for three or four days ; and then having 
given him five barrels of beef, a barrel of pork, two 
hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, 
flour, and what other things we could spare ; and 
taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some 
pieces of eight from them for satisfaction, we left 
them ; taking on board with us, at their own ear- 
nest request, the youth and the maid, and all their 
goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age ; 
a pretty, well-bred, modest and sensible youth, 
greatly dejected v.'ith the loss of his mother, and, 
as it seems, had lost his father but a few months 
before, at Barbadoes : he begged of the surgeon to 
speak to me to take him out of the ship ; for he said 
the cruel fellows had murdered his mother : and, in- 
deed, so they had, that is to say, passively; for 
they might have spared a small sustenance to the 
poor helpless widow, that might have preserved her 
life, though it had been but just enough to keep 
her alive : but hunger knows no friend, no relation, 
no justice, no right ; and therefore is remorseless, 
and capable of no compassion. 

The surgeon told him how far we were going, 
and that it would carry him away from all his friends, 
and put him perhaps in as bad circumstances almost 
as those we found him in, that is to say, starving 
in the world. He said it mattered not whither he 
went, if he was but delivered from the terrible 
crew that he was among ; that the captain (by which 
he meant me, for he could know nothing of my 
nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure would 
not hurt him ; and as for the maid, he was sure, it 



S2 ADVENTURES OF 

she came to herself, she would be very thanlvful for 
it, let us carry them where we would. The surgeon 
represented the case so affectionately to me, that I 
yielded, and we took them both on board, with all 
their goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar, 
which could not be removed or come at ; and as the 
youth had a bill of lading for them, I made his com- 
mander sign a writing, obliging himself to go, as 
soon as he came to Bristol, to one ?vlr. Rogers, a 
merchant there, to whom the youth said he was re- 
lated, and to deliver a letter M'hich I wrote to him, 
and all the goods he had belonging to the deceased 
widow ; which I suppose was not done, for I could 
never learn that the ship came to Bristol, but was, 
as is most probable, lost at sea ; being in so disabled 
a condition, and so far from any. land, that 1 am of 
opinion the first storm she met with afterwards she 
might founder in the sea; for she was leaky, and 
had damage in her hold, when we met with her. 

I was now in the latitude of 1 9 degrees 32 mi- 
nutes, and had hitherto a tolerable voyage as to 
weather, though, at first, the winds had been con- 
trary. I shall trouble nobody with the little inci- 
dents of wind, weather, currents, &c. on the rest of 
our voj'age ; but, to shorten my story, for the sake 
of what is to follow, shall observe, that I came to my 
old habitation, the island, on the 10th of April, 1695. 
It was with no small difKculty that I found the place ; 
for as I came to it, and wcr.t from it, before, on tJie 
south and east side of the island, as coming from the 
Brazils, so now, coming in between the main and 
the island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any 
land-mark, I did not know it when 1 saw it, or 
know whether I saw it or not. 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore 
on several islands in the mouth of the great river 
Oronoo([ue, but none for n5y purpose ; only this I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under 
one great mistake before, viz. that the continent 
which I thought I saw from the island I lived in, was 
really no continent, but a long island, or rather a 
ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other side 
of the extended mouth of that great river ; and that 
the savages who came to my island were not properly 
those which we call Caribbees, but islanders, and 
other barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited 
something nearer to our side than the rest. 

In short, I visited several of these islands to no 
purpose ; some I found were inhabited, and some 
were not : on one of them I found some Spaniards, 
and thought they had lived there ; but speaking with 
them, found they had a sloop lay in a small creek 
hard by, and came thither to make salt and to catch 
eome pearl muscles, if they could ; but that they be- 
longed to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay farther 
north, in the latitude of 10 and 11 degrees. 

Thus coasting from one island to another, some- 
times with the ship, sometimes with the French- 
men's shallop, which we had found a convenient boat, 
and therefore kept her with their very good wiil. at 
length I came fair on the south side of my island, 
and presently knew the very countenance of the 
place : so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, 
broadside with the little creek _where my old habita- 
tion was. 

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and 
asked him if he knew where he was ; he looked about 
a little, and presently clapping his hands, cried, O 
yes, O there, O yes, O there, pointing to our old 
habitation, and fell dancing and capering like a mad 
fellow ; and I had much ado to keep him from jump- 
ing into the sea, to swim ashore to the place. 

Well, Friday, says I, do you think we shall find 
any body here or no ? and do you think we shall see 



Si ADVENTURES OF 

your father ? Tlie fellow stood mute as a stock a 
good while, but when 1 named his father, the poor 
affectionate creoture looked dejected, and I could see 
the tears run down his face very plentifully. What 
is the matter, Friday ? says 1, are you troubled be- 
cause you may see your father? No, no, says he, 
shaking his head, no see him more : no, never more 
see him again. Why so, said I, Friday? how do 
you know that ? O nO; O no, says Friday ; he long 
ago die, long ago; he much old man. Well, well, 
says I, Friday, you don't know; but shall we see any 
one else then? The fellow, it seems, had better eyes 
than I, and he points to the hill just above my old 
house ; and though we lay half a league off, he cries 
out. We see, we see, yes, yes, we see much man 
there, and there, and there. I looked, but I saw 
nobody, no, not with a perspective-glass, which 
was, I suppose, because I could not hit the place; 
for the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the 
next day ; and there were five or six men all toge- 
ther, who stood to look at the ship, not knowing 
w^hat to think of us. 

As soon as Friday told me be saw people, I caused 
the English ancient to be spread, and fired three 
guns, to give them notice we were friends ; and in 
about half a quarter of an hour after; we perceived 
a smoke arise from the side of the creek; so 1 im- 
mediately ordered the boat out, taking Friday with 
me ; and hanging out a white flag, or a flag of truce, 
I went directly on shore, taking with me the young 
friar I mentioned, to whom I had told the story of 
my living there, and the manner of it, and every 
particular both of myself and those 1 left there; and 
who was, on that account, extremely desirous to go 
Avith me. We liad besides about sixteen men well 
armed, if we had found any new guests there which 
we did not know of; but wc had no need of weapons. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near 
high water, we rowed directly into the creek ; and 
the first man 1 fixed my eye upon was the ^Spaniard 
whose life 1 had saved, and whom I knew by his face 
perfectly well : as to his habit, I shall describe it af- 
terwards I ordered nobody to go on shore at first 
but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the 
boat, for the atfectionate creature had spied his fa- 
ther at a distance, a good way oft the Spaniards, 
where indeed I saw nothing of him ; and if they had 
not let him go ashore, he would have jumped into 
the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew 
away to his father, like an arrow out of a bow. It 
would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the 
firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports 
of this poor fellow's joy when he came to his father : 
how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face, 
took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, 
and lay down by him ; then stood and looked at him, 
as any one would look at a strange picture, for a 
quarter of an hour together; then lay down on the 
ground, and stroked his legs, and kissed them, and 
then got up again, and stared at him ; one would 
have thought the fellow bewitched. But it would 
have made a dog laugh the next day to see how his 
passion r-m out another way : in the morning he 
walked along the shore, to and again, with his father 
several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if 
he had been a lady ; and every now and then he 
would come to the boat to fetch something or other 
for him, either a lump of sugar, a dram, a biscuit- 
cake, or something or, other that v.as good. In the 
afternoon his frolics ran another away ; for then 
he would set the old man down upon the ground 
and dance about him, and make a thousand antic 
postures and gestures ; and all the while he did this. 



56 ADVENTURES OF 

he would be talking to him, and telling him one 
story or other of his travels, and of what had hap- 
pened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if 
the same filial aifection was to be found in Chris- 
tians to their parents in our part of the world, one 
would be tempted to say, there would hardly have 
been any need of the fifth connnandment. 

But this is a digression : I return to my landing. 
It would be needless to take notice of all the cere- 
niopies and civilities that the Spaniards received me 
with. The first Spaniard, who, as I said, I knew 
very well, was he whose life I had saved ; he came 
towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a 
flag of truce also ; and he not only did not know me 
at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion of its be- 
ing me that was come, till I spoke to him. Seignior, 
said I, in Portuguese, do you not know me? At 
which he spoke not a word, but giving his musket 
to the man that was with him, threw his arms 
abroad, saying something in Spanish that I did not 
perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me ; tell- 
hig me he was inexcusable not to know that face 
again, that he had once seen as if an angel from 
heaven sent to save his life : he said abundance of 
very handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard al- 
ways knows how ; and then beckoning to the person 
that attended him, bade him go and call out his 
comrades. He then asked me if I would walk to my 
old habitation, where he would give me possession of 
my own house again, and where I should see they 
had made but mean improvements : so I walked 
along with him ; but, alas I I could no more find the 
place again than if I had never been there ; for they 
had planted so many trees, and placed them in such 
a posture, so thick and close to one another, and in 
ten years' time they were grown so big, that, in short, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 37 

the place was inaccessible, except by such windings 
and blind ways as they themselves only, who made 
them, could find. 

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifi- 
cations : he told me I wouldsay there was need enough 
of it, when they had given me an account how they 
had passed their time since their arriving in the 
island, especially after they had the misfortune to find 
that I was gone. He told me he could not but have 
some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he heard 
that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfac- 
tion ; and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion 
that, one time or other, he should see me again ; but 
nothing that ever befell him in his life, he said, was 
so surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the 
disappointment he was under when he came back to 
the island and found I was not there. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that 
were left behind, and of whom, he said, he had a 
long story to tell me, the Spaniards all thought 
themselves much better among the savages, only 
that their number was so small : and, says he, had 
they been strong enough, we had been all long ago 
in purgatory ; and with that he crossed himself on 
the breast. But, sir, says he, I hope you will not 
be displeased when I shall tell you, how, forced by 
necessity, we were obliged, for our own preservation, 
to disarm them, and make them our subjects, who 
would not be content with being moderately our 
masters, but would be our murderers. I answered, 
I was heartily afraid of it when I left them there, 
a)id nothing troubled me at my parting from the 
island but that they were not come back, that I 
might have put them in possession of every thing 
first, and left the others in a state of subjection, as 
they deserved ; but if they had reduced them to it, I 
was very glad, and should be very far from finding 

VOL. XVII. E 



38 ADVENTURES OF 

any fault with it : for I knew they were a parcel of 
refractory, ungoverned villains, and were fit for any 
manner of mischief. 

While I was thus saying this, the man came 
whom he had sent back, and with him eleven men 
more, in the dress they were in, it was impossible 
to guess what nation they were of; but he made all 
clear, both to them and to me. First he turned to 
me, and pointing to them, said, These sir, are some 
of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you ; and 
then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let 
them know who I was ; upon which they all came 
up, one by one, not as if they had been sailors and 
ordinary fellows, and the like, but really as if they 
had been ambassadors of noblemen, and I a monarch 
or great conqueror : their behaviour was to the last 
degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with 
a manly, majestic gravity, which very well became 
them ; and, in short, they had so much more man- 
ners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their 
civilities, much less how to return them in kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, 
the island, after my going away, is so very remarka- 
ble, ancJ has so many incidents, which the former 
part of my relation will help to understand, and 
which will, in most of the particulars, refer to the 
account I have already given, that I cannot but com- 
mit them, with great delight, to the reading of those 
that come after me. 

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation 
in the first person, which will put me to the expense 
of ten thousand said Fs, and said he's, and he told 
me^s, and / t(,ld him's, and the like ; but I shall col- 
lect the facts historically, as near as I can gather 
them out of my memory, from what they related to 
me, and from what I met with in my conversing 
with them and with the place. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. S9 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly 
as I can, I must go back to the circumstances in 
which 1 left the island, and in which the persons 
were of whom I am to speak. And first, it is neces- 
sary to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's father and 
the Spaniard (the two whose lives 1 had rescued 
from the Savages) in a large canoe, to the main, as 
I then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's com- 
panions that he left behind him, in order to save 
them from the like calamity that he had been in, and 
in order to succour them for the present ; and that, 
if possible, we might together find some way for our 
deliverance afterwards. 

When I sent them away, I had no visible appear- 
ance of, or the least room to hope for, my own de- 
liverance, any more than I had twenty years before, 
much less had I any foreknowledge of what after- 
wards happened, I mean, of an English ship coming 
on shore there to fetch me off; and it could not but be 
a very great surprise to them, when they came back, 
not only to find that I was gone, but to find three 
strangers left on the spot, possessed of all that I had 
left behind me, which would otherwise have been 
their own. 

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, 
•^hat 1 might begin where I left off, was of their 
own part ; and I desired he would give me a parti- 
cular account of his voyage back to his countrymen 
with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. 
He told he there was little variety in that part, for 
nothing remarkable happened to them on the way, 
having had very calm weather, and a smooth sea. 
As for his countrymen, it could not be doubted, he 
said, but that they were overjoyed to see him (it 
seems he was the principal man among them, the 
captain. of the vessel they had been shipwrecked in 
having been dead some time) ; they were, he said, 

e2 



40 ADVENTUKES OF 

the more surprised to see him, because they knew 
that he was fallen into the hands of the savages, who, 
they were satisfied, would devour him, as they did 
all the rest of their prisoners ; that when he told 
them the story of his deliverance, and in what man- 
ner he was furnished for carrying them away, it 
was like a dream to them, and their astonishment, 
he said, was somewhat like that of Joseph's bre- 
thren, when he told them who he was, and told 
them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court ; 
but when he showed them the arms, the powder, 
the ball, and provisions, that he brought them for 
their journey or voyage, they were restored to them- 
selves, took a just share of the joy of their deliver- 
ance, and immediately prepared to come away with 
him. 

Their first business was to get canoes : and in this 
they were obliged not to stick so much u])on the 
honest part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly 
savages, and to borrow two large canoes, or peria- 
guas, on pretence of going out a fishing, or for 
pleasure. In these they came away the next morn- 
ing. It seems they wanted no time to get them- 
selves ready ; for they had no baggage, neither, 
clothes nor provisions, nor any thing in the world 
but what they had on them, and a few roots to eat, 
of which they used to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent ; and in that 
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered 
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and 
to get off from the island, leaving three of the 
most impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable 
villains behind me, that any man could desire to 
meet with ; to the poor Spaniards' great grief and 
disappointment, you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when 
the Spaniards came ashore, they gave ray letter 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 41 

to them, and gave them provisions, and other rehef, 
as I had ordered them to do ; also they gave them 
the long paper of directions which I had left with 
them, containing the particular methods which I 
took for managing every part of my life there ; the 
way how I baked my bread, bred up tame goats, and 
planted my corn ; how I cured my grapes, made 
my pots, and, in a word, every thing I did ; all 
this being written down, they gave to the Spaniards 
(two of them understood English well enough) : 
nor did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards 
with any thing else, for they agreed very well for some 
time. They gave them an equal admission into the 
house, or cave, and they began to live very sociably; 
and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much 
of my methods, and Friday's father together, ma- 
naged all their att'airs : but as for the Englishmen, 
they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot 
parrots, and catch tortoises ; and when they came 
home at night, the Spaniards provided their suppers 
for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied vvith this, 
had the others but let them alone; which, however, 
they could not find in their hearts to do long, but, 
like the dog in the manger, they would not eat them- 
selves, neither would they let the others eat. The 
differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, 
and such as are not worth relating, but at last it 
broke out into open war : and it began with all the 
rudeness and insolence that can be imagined, with- 
out reason, without provocation, contrary to nature, 
and, indeed, to common sense: and vhough, it is 
true, the first relation of it came from the ^l:)aniards 
themselves, whom I may call the accusers, yet when 
I came to examine the fellows, they could not deny 
a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, 

E 3 



42 ADVENTURES Of 

I must supply a defect in my former relation ; and 
this was, 1 forgot to set down, among the rest, that 
just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, there 
happened a little quarrel on board of our ship, which 
I was once afraid would have turned to a second 
mutiny ; nor was it appeased till the captain, rous- 
ing up his courage, and taking us all to his assist- 
ance, parted them by force, and making two of tho 
most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in 
irons ; and as they had been active in the former 
disorders, and let fall some ugly, dangerous words, 
the second time he threatened to carry them in irons 
to England, and have them hanged there for mutiny, 
and running away with the ship. This, it seems, 
though the captain did not intend to do it, fright- 
ened some other men in the ship ; and some of them 
had put it into the heads of the rest that the captain 
only gave them good words for the present, till they 
should come to some English port, and that then 
they should be all put into gaol, and tried for their 
lives. The mate got intelligence of this, and ac- 
quainted us with it ; upon which it was desired that 
1, who still passed for a great man among them, 
should go down with the mate, and satisfy the men, 
and tell them that they might be assured, if they 
behaved well the rest of tiie voyage, all they had 
done for the time past should be pardoned. So I 
went, and after passing my honour's word to them, 
they appeared easy, and the more so when I caused 
the two men that were in irons to be released and 
forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor 
for that night ; the wind also falling calm next 
morning, we found that our two men who had been 
laid in irons had stole each of them a musket, and 
some other weapons (what powder or shot they had 
we knew not), and had taken the ship's pinnace, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 43 

which was not yet haled up, and run away with her, 
to their companions in roguery on shore. As soon 
as we found this, I ordered the long boat on shore, 
with twelve men and the mate, and away they went 
to seek the rogues; but they could neither find them 
or any of the rest, for they all fled into the woods 
when they saw the boat coming on shore. The mate 
was once resolved, in justice to their roguery, to 
have destroyed their plantations, burned all their 
household-stuff and furniture, and left them to shift 
without it; but having no orders, he let it all alone, 
left every thing as he found it, and bringing the 
pinnace away, came on board without them. These 
two men made their number five ; but the other 
three villains were so much more wicked than they, 
that after they had been two or three days together, 
they turned the two new-comers out of doors to shift 
for themselves, and would have nothing to do with 
them ; nor could they, for a good while, be persuad- 
ed to give them any food : as for the LSpaniards, they 
were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the busi- 
ness began to go forward : the Spaniards would have 
persuaded the three English brutes to have taken in 
their two countrymen again, that, as they said, they 
might be all one family ; but they would not hear 
of it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves ; 
and finding nothing but industry and application 
would make them live comfortably, they pitched 
their tents on the north shore of the island, but a 
little more to the west, to be out of danger of the 
savages, who always landed on the east parts of the 
island. 

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, 
and the other to lay up their magazines and stores 
in ; and the Spaniards having given them some corn 
for seed, and especially some of the peas which I had 



41< ADVENTURES OF 

left them, they dug, planted, and enclosed, after the 
pattern I had set for them all, and began to live 
pretty well. Their first crop of corn was on the 
ground ; and though it was but a little bit of land 
which they had dug up at first, having had but a 
little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and 
find them with bread and other eatables; and one 
of the fellows being the cook's-mate of the ship, was 
very ready at making soup, puddings, and such other 
preparations as the rice and the milk, and such little 
flesh as they got, furnished him to do. 

They were going on in this little thriving posture, 
when the three unnatural rogues, their own coun- 
trymen too, in mere humour, and to insult them, 
came and bullied them, and told them the island 
was theirs ; that the governor, meaning me, had 
given them the possession of it, and nobody else 
had any right to it; and that they should build no 
houses upon their ground, unless they would pay 
rent for them. 

The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, 
asked them to come in and sit down, and see what 
fine houses they were that they had built, and to 
tell them what i*ent they demanded ; and one of 
them merrily said, if they were the ground-landlords, 
he hoped, if they built tenements upon their land, 
and made improvements, they would, according to 
the custom of landlords, grant alonglease: and 
desired they would get a scrivener to draw the writ- 
ings. One of the three, cursing and raging, told 
them they should see they were not in jest ; and go- 
ing to a little place at a distance, where the honest 
men had made a fire to dre^s tht-ir victuals, he takes 
a firebrand, and claps it to the outside of their hut, 
and very fairly set it on fire; and it would have been 
all burnt down in a i'uw minutes, if one of the two 
had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 

the fire out with his feet, and that not without some 
difficulty too. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's 
thrusting him away, that he returned upon him, 
with a pole he had in his hand, and had not the man 
avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, 
he had ended his days at once. His comrade, seeing 
the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and 
immediately they came both out with their muskets, 
and the man that was first struck at with the pole, 
knocked the fellow down that had begun the quar- 
rel with the stock of his musket, and that before the 
other two could come to help him ; and then seeing 
the rest come at them, they stood together, and 
presenting the other ends of their pieces to them, 
bade them stand off. 

The others had fire-arms with them too : but one 
of the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, 
and made desperate by his danger, told them, if 
they offered to move hand or foot they were dead 
men, and boldly commanded them to lay down their 
arms. They did not, indeed, lay down their arms, 
but seeing him so resolute, it brought them to a 
parley, and they consented to take their wounded 
man with them and be gone ; and, indeed, it seems 
the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the blow. 
However, they were much in the wrong, since they 
had the advantage, that they did not disarm them 
effectually, as they might have done, and have gone 
immediately to the Spaniards, and given them an 
account how the rogues had treated them ; for the 
three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every 
day gave them some intimation that they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the 
lesser part of the rogueries, such as treading down 
their corn; shooting three young kids and a she-goat, 
^^ hich the poor men had got to breed up tame for 



46 ADVENTURES OF 

tlieir store ; and, in a word, plaguing them night 
and day in this manner; it forced, the two men to 
such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them 
all three, the first time they had a fair opportunity. 
In order to this, they resolved to go to the castle, 
us they called it (that was, my old dwelling), where 
the three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together 
at that time, intending to have a fair battle, and 
the Spaniards should stand by, to see fair play : so 
they got up in the morning before day, and came to 
the place, and called the Englishmen by their names, 
telling a Spaniard that answered that they wanted 
to speak with them. 

It happened that the day before, two of the Spa- 
niards, having been in the woods, had seen one of 
the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I call- 
ed the honest men, and he had made a sad com- 
plaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they 
had met with from their three countrymen, and 
how they had ruined their plantation, and destroy- 
ed their corn that they had laboured so hard tobring 
forward, and killed the milch-goat and their three 
kids, which was all they had provided for their sus- 
tenance ; and that if he and his friends, meaning 
the Spaniards, did not assist them again, they should 
be starved. When the Spaniards came home at 
night, and they were all at supper, one of them took 
the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, 
though in very gentle and mannerly terms, and 
asked them how they could be so cruel, they being 
harmless, inoffensive fellows ; that they were put- 
ting themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, 
and that it had cost them a great deal of pains to 
bring things to such perfection as they were then 
in. 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, 
What had they to do there? that they came on shore 



ROBINSON CRL'SOE. 4-7 

witfiout leave ; and that they should not plant or 
build upon the island; it was none of their ground. 
Why, says the Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior Ing- 
lese, they must not starve. The Englishman re- 
plied, like a rough-hewn tarpauling, They might 

starve and be d d ; they should not plant nor 

build in that place. But what must they do then, 
seignior ? said the Spaniard. Another of the brutes 
returned, Do ? d n them, they should be ser- 
vants, and work for them. But how can you expect 
that of them ? says the Spaniard ; they are not 
bought with your money : you have no right to 
make them servants. The Englishman answered, 
the island was theirs ; the governor had given it to 
them, and no man had any thing to do there but 
themselves ; and with that swore by his Maker that 
they would go and burn all their new huts ; they 
should build none upon their land. Why, seignior, 
says the Spaniard, by the same rule, we must be 
your servants too. — Aye, says the bold dog, and so 
you shall too, before we have done with you : (mix- 
ing two or three G — d d — n rae's in the proper in- 
tervals of his speech). The Spaniard only smiled at 
that, and made him no answer. However, this lit- 
tle discourse had heated them ; and, starting up, 
one says to the other, I think it was he they called 
Will Atkins, Come, Jack, let's go, and have t'other 
brush with 'em ; we'll demolish their castle, I'll 
warrant you ; they shall plant no colony in our do- 
minions. 

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every 
man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered 
some insolent things among themselves, of what 
they would do to the Spaniards too, when oppor- 
tunity offered ; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not 
•so perfectly understand thein as to know all the par- 



48 ADVENTURES OK 

ticulars, only that, in general, they threatened them 
hard tor taking the two Englishmen's part. 

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their 
time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not 
know ; but it seems they wandered about the coun- 
try part of the night, and then lying down in the 
place which I used to call my bower, they were 
weary, and overslept themselves. The case was 
this ; they had resolved to stay till midnight, and 
so to take the two poor men when they were asleep, 
and, as they acknowledged afterwards, intended to 
set fire to their huts while they were in them, and 
either burn them there, or murder them as they 
came out; as malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was 
very strange they should not have been kept awake. 

However as the two men had also a design upon 
them, as I have said, though a much fairer one than 
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and 
very luckily for them all, that they were up, and 
gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues came 
to their huts. 

When they came there, and found the men gone, 
Atkins, who, it seems, was the forwardest man, 
called out to his comrade, Ha, Jack, here's the 
nest, but, d — n them, the birds are flown. They 
mused awhile, to think what should be the occasion 
of their being gone abroad so soon, and suggested 
presently that the Spaniards had given them notice 
of it : and with that they shook hands, and swore 
to one another that they would be revenged of the 
Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody 
bargain, they fell to work with the poor men's ha- 
bitation ; they did not set fire, indeed, to any thing, 
but they pulled down both their houses, and pulled 
them so limb from limb, that they left not the least 
stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

where they stood : they tore all their little collected 
household-stuft' in pieces, and threw every thing 
about in such a manner, that the poor men after- 
wards found some of their things a mile off their ha- 
bitation. When they had done this, they pulled up 
all the young trees which the poor men had planted ; 
pulled up an enclosure they had made to secure their 
cattle and their corn; and, in a word, sacked and 
plundered every thing as completely as a horde of 
Tartars would have done. 

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find 
them out, and had resolved to fight them wherever 
they had been, though they were but two to three ; 
so that, had they met, there certainly would have 
been bloodshed among them ; for they were all very 
stout, resolute fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep them asun- 
der than they themselves could do to meet; for, as 
if they had dogged one another, when the three 
were gone thither, the two were here ; and after- 
wards, when the two went back, to find them, the 
three were come to the old habitation again : we 
shall see their different conduct presently. When 
the three came back like furious creatures, flushed 
with the rage which the work they had been about 
had put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, 
and told them what they had done, by way of scoff 
and bravado ; and one of them stepping up to one 
of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of 
boys at play, takes hold of his hat as it was upon 
his head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his 
face, says to him. And you, seignior Jack Spaniard, 
shall have the same sauce, if you do not mend your 
manners. The Spaniard, who, though a quiet civil 
man, was as brave a man as could be, and withal a 
strong, well-made man, looked at him for a good 
while, and then, having no weapon in his hand, 



50 ADVENTURES OF 

Stepped gravely up to him, and with one blow of 
his fist knocked him down, as an ox is felled with 
a pole-axe; at which one of the rogues, as insolent 
as the first, fired his pistol at the Spanitird immedi- 
ately : he missed his body, indeed, for the bullets 
went through his hair, but one of them touched the 
tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood 
made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt thau 
he really was, and that put him into some heat, for 
before he acted all in a perfect calm ; but now re- 
solving to go through with his work, he stooped, 
and took the fellow's nmsket whom he had knocked 
down, and was just going to shoot the man who had 
fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being 
in the cave, came out, and calling to him not to 
shoot, they stepped in, secured the other two, and 
took their arms from them. 

When they were thus disarmed, and found they 
had made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as 
their own countrymen, they began to cool, and, 
giving the Spaniards better words, would have their 
arms again; but the Spaniards, considering the 
feud that was between them and the other two 
Englishmen, and that it would be the best method 
they could take to keep them from killing one 
another, told them they would do them no harm, 
and if they would live peaceably, they would be 
very willing to tussist and associate with them as 
they did before; but that they could not think of giv- 
ing them their arms again, while they appeared so 
resolved to do mischief with them to their own 
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to 
make them their servants. 

The rogues were now no more capable to hear 
reason than to act with reason; but being refused 
their arms, they went raving away, and raging like 
madmen, threatening what they would do,, though 



KOEIKSON CRUSOE. 51 

they Iiad no fire-arms. But the Spaniards, despising 
their threatening, told them they should take care 
how ihey oftered any injury to their plantation or 
cattle, for if they did, they would shoot them as 
they would ravenous beasts, wherever they found 
them ; and if they fell into their hands alive, they 
should certainly be hanged. However, this was far 
from cooling them, but away they went, raging and 
swearing like furies of hell. As soon as they were 
gone, the two men came back, in passion and rage 
enough also, though of another kind ; for having 
been at their plantation, and finding it all demolished 
and destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed 
they had provocation enough. They could scarce 
have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were so 
eager to tell them theirs ; and it was strange enough 
to "find that three men should thus bully nineteen, 
and receive no punishment at all. 

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and espe- 
cially having thus disarmed them, made light of their 
threatenings; but the two Englishmen resolved to 
have their remedy against them, what pains soever 
k cost to find them out. But the Spaniards inter- 
posed here too, and told them, that as they had dis- 
armed them, they could not consent that they (the 
two) should pursue them with fire-arms, and per- 
haps kill them.. But, said the grave Spaniard, who 
v/as their governor, we will endeavour to make them 
do you justice, if you will leave it to us : for there 
is no doubt but they will come to us again, when 
their passion is over, being not able to subsist with- 
out our assistance ; we promise you to make no 
peace with them, without having a full satisfactioa 
for you ; and upon this condition we hope you will 
promise to use no violence with them, other than in 
your own defence. The two Englishmen yielded to 
this very awkwardly, and with great reluctance; but 

e2 



52 ADVENTURES OF 

the Spaniards protested, that they did it only to 
keep them from bloodshed, and to make all easy at 
last. For, said they, we are not so many of us ; 
here is room enough for us all, and it is a great pity 
we should not be all good friends. At length they 
did consent, and waited for the issue of the thing, 
living for some days with the Spaniards; for their 
own habitation was destroyed. 

In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired 
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger, 
having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while, 
came back to the grove ; and findmg my Spaniard, 
who, as I have said, was the governor, and two 
more with him walking by the side of the creek, they 
came up in a very submissive, humble manner, and 
begged to be received again into the family. The 
Spaniards used them civilly, but told them they 
had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and 
so very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they 
could not come to any conclusion without consult- 
ing the two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, 
they would go to them, and discourse about it, 
and they should know in half an hour. It may be 
guessed that they were very hard put to it : for, it 
seems, as they were to wait this half-hour for an 
answer, they begged they would send them out 
some bread in the mean time, which they did; send- 
ing, at the same time, a large piece of goat's flesh, 
and a boiled parrot, which they eat very heartily, 
for they were hungry enough. 

After half an hour's consultation, they were call- 
ed in, and a long debate ensued ; their two coun- 
trymen charging them with the ruin of all their la- 
bour, and a design to murder them ; all which they 
owned before, and therefore could not deny now. 
Upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the mode- 
rator between them; and as they had obliged the 



KOBINSON CRUSOE, SJ 

two Englishmen not to hurt the three while they 
were naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the 
three to go and rebuild their fellows' two huts, one 
to be of the same, and the other of larger dimen- 
sions than they were before ; to fence their ground 
again where they had pulled up their fences, plant 
trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the 
land again for planting corn where they had spoiled 
it, and in a word, to restore every thing in the same 
state as they found it, as near as they could ; for 
entirely it could not be, the season for the corn, 
and the growth of the trees and hedges, not being- 
possible to be recovered. 

Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had 
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they 
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to 
live pleasantly and agreeably together again; only, 
that these three fellows could never be persuaded to 
work, I mean for themselves, except now and then 
a little, just as they pleased : however, the Spa- 
niards told them plainly, that if they would but live 
sociably and friendly together, and study the good 
of the whole plantation, they would be content to 
work for them, and let them walk about and be as 
idle as they pleased : and thus having lived pretty 
well together for a month or two, the Spaniards 
gave them arms again, and gave them liberty to go 
abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, 
and v/ent abroad, but the ungrateful creatures be- 
gan to be as insolent and troublesome as before: 
but, however, an accident happened presently upon 
this, which endangered the safety of them all ; and 
they were obliged to lay by all private resentments, 
and look to the preservation of their lives. 

It happened one night that the Spanish governor^ 
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life 

f3 



54- ADVENTURES OF 

I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader, or 
governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in 
the night, and could by no means get any sleep: he 
was perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, 
only found his thoughts tumultuous ; his mind ran 
upon men fighting and killing of one another, but 
he was broad-awake, and could not by any means 
get any sleep; in short, he lay a great while ; but 
growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise. 
As they lay, being so many of them upon goats' 
skins laid thick upon such couches and pads as they 
made for themselves, and not in hammocks and 
ship-beds, as I did, who was but one, so they had 
little to do when they were willing to rise, but to 
get up upon their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, 
such as it was, and their pumps, and they were 
ready for going any way that their thoughts guided 
them. Being thus got up, he looked out; but, be- 
ing dark, he could see little or nothing ; and, be- 
sides, the trees which I had planted, as in my former 
account is described, and which were now grown 
tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could only look 
up, and see that it was a clear star-light night, and 
hearing no noise, he returned and laid him down 
again: but it was all one; he could not sleep, nor 
could he compose himself to any thing like rest; 
but his thoughts w'ere to the last degree uneasy, and 
lie knew not for what. 

Having made some noise with rising and walking 
about, going out and coming in, another of them 
waked, and calling, asked who it was that was up. 
The governor told him how it had been with him. 
Say you so? says the other Spaniard; such things 
are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is 
certainly some mischief working near us : and pre- 
sently he asked him, Where are the Englishmen ? 
— They are all in their huts, says he, safe enough. 
5 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 55 

It seems the Spaniards had kept possession of the 
main apartment, and had made a place for the three 
Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny, were 
always quartered by themselves, and could not come 
at the rest. Well, says the Spaniard, there is some- 
thing in it, I am persuaded, from my own expe- 
rience. I am satisfied our spirits embodied have a 
converse with, and receive intelligence from, the 
spirits unembodied, and inhabiting the invisible 
world ; and this friendly notice is given for our ad- 
vantage, if we knew how to make use of it. Come, 
says he, let us go and look abroad ; and if we find 
nothing at all in it to justify the trouble, I'll tell 
you a story to the purpose, that shall convince you 
of the justice of my proposing it. 

In a word they went out, to go up to the top of 
the hill, where 1 used to go; but they being strong, 
and a good company, not alone, as I was, used none 
of my cautions, to go up by the ladder, and pulling 
it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top, 
but were going round through the grove, uncon- 
cerned and unweary, when they were surprised with 
seeing a light as of fire, a very little way off from 
them, and hearing the voices of men, not of one 
or two, but of a great number. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages 
landing on the island, it was my constant care to 
prevent them making the least discovery of there 
being any inhabitant upon the place ; and when by 
any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so 
effectually, that they that got away were scarce able 
to give any account of it ; for we disappeared as 
soon as possible ; nor did ever any that had seen me 
escape to tell any one else, except it was the three 
savages in our last encounter, who jumped into the 
boat ; of whom, I mentioned, I was afraid they 
should go home and bring more help. Whether it 



56 ADVENTURES OF 

was the consequence of the escape of those men that 
so great a number came now together, or whether 
they came ignorantly, and by accident, on their 
usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it 
seems, understand; but, whatever it was, it had 
been their business either to have concealed them- 
selves, or not to have seen them at all, much less 
to have let the savages have seen that there were 
any inhabitants in the place; or to have fallen upon 
the n so effectually, as that not a man of them 
should have escaped, which could only have been by 
getting in between them and their boats: but this 
presence of mind was wanting to them, which was 
the ruin of their tranquillity for a great while. 

We need not doubt, but that tlie governor and 
the man with him, surprised with this sight, ran 
back immediately, and raised their fellows, giving 
them an account of the inmiinent danger they were 
all in, and they again as readily took the alarm; 
but it was impossible to persuade them to stay close 
within, where they were, but they must all run out 
to see how thinsrs stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, 
and thjy had opportunity enough, for some hours, 
to view them, by the light of three fires they had 
made at a distance from one another; what they 
were doing they knew not, and wiiat to do them- 
selves they knew not. For, first, the enemy were 
too many; and, secondly, they did not keep toge- 
ther, but were divided into several parties, and were 
on shore in several places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at 
this sight; and as tliey found that tlie fellows ran 
straggling all over the shore, they made no doubt 
but, first or last, some of them would clu)|) in upon 
their habitation, or upon some other place where 

they would see the token of inhabitants; and they 

t^ 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 51 

were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock, 
of goats, M'hic.h would have been little less than 
starving them, if they should have been destroyed ; 
so the first thing they resolved upon was, to dispatch 
three men away before it was light, two Spaniards 
and one Englishman, to drive all the goats away to 
the great valley where the cave was, and, if need 
were, to drive them into the very cave itself. Could 
they have seen the savages all together in one body, 
and at a distance from their canoes, they resolved, 
if there had been a hundred of them, to have at- 
tacked them ; but that could not be obtained ; for 
they were some of them two miles off from the 
other ; and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two 
different nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course 
they should take, and beating their brains in consi- 
dering their present circumstances, they resolved, 
at last, while it was still dark, to send the old savage, 
Friday's father, out as a spy, to learn, if possible, 
something concerning them ; as what they came for, 
what they intended to do, and the like. The old 
man readily undertook it ; and stripping himself 
quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he 
went. After he had been gone an hour or two, he 
brings word that he had been among them undis- 
covered ; that he found they were two parties, and 
of two several nations, who had war with one ano- 
ther, and had a great battle in their own country : 
and that both sides having had several prisoners 
taken in the fight, they were, by mere chance, 
landed all on the same island, for the devouring 
their prisoners and making merry, but their coming 
so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their 
mirth ; that they were in a great rage at one ano- 
ther, and were so near, that he believed they would 
fight again as soon as day-light began to appear : 



58 ADVENTURES OF 

but he did not perceive that they had any notion of 
any body being on the island bat themselves. He 
had hardly made an end of lolling his story, when 
they could perceive, by the unusual noise they 
made, that the two little armies w^ere engaged in a 
bloody fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to 
persuade our people to lie close, and not be seen ; 
he told them their safety consisted in it, and that 
they had nothing to do but lie still, and the savages 
would kill one another to their hands, and then the 
rest would go away ; and it was so to a tittle. But 
it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the Eng- 
lishmen ; their curiosity was so importunate upon 
their prudentials, that they nmst run out and see 
the battle: however, they used some caution too, 
viz. they did not go openly, just by their ow'n dwell- 
ing, but went farther into the woods, and placed 
themselves to advantage, where they might securely 
see them manage the fight, and, as they thought, 
not be seen by them ; but it seems the savages did 
see tliem, as we shall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce ; and, if I might be- 
lieve the Englishmen, one of them said he could per- 
ceive that some of them w'crc men of great bravery, 
of invincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding 
the fight. The battle, they said, held two hours be- 
fore they could guess vv'hich party would be beaten; 
but then that party which was nearest our people's 
habitation began to appear weakest, and, after some 
time more, some of them began to fly; and this put 
our men again into a great consternation, lest any 
one of those that fled should run into the grove be- 
fore their dwelling for shelter, and thereby involun- 
tarily discover the place; and that, by consequence, 
the pursuers would do the like in search of them. 
Upon this they resolved that they would stand armed 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

within the Avail, and whoever came into the grove, 
they resolved to sally out over the wall and kill them : 
so that, if possible, not one should return to give 
an account of it : they ordered also that it should be 
done with their swords, or by knocking them down 
with the stocks of their muskets, but not by shooting 
them, for fear of raising an alarm by the noise. 

As they expected, it fell out : three of the routed 
army fled for life, and crossing the creek, ran di- 
rectly into the place, not in the least knowing whi- 
ther they went, but running as into a thick wood 
for shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad 
gave notice of this within, with this addition, to 
our men's great satisfaction, viz. that the conquer- 
ors had not pursued them, or seen which way they 
were gone ; upon this, the Spaniard governor, a 
man of humanity, would not suffer them to kill the 
three fugitives, but sending three men out by the 
top of the hill, ordered them to go round, come in 
behind them, and surprise and take them prisoners, 
which was done. The residue of the conquered peo- 
ple fled to their canoes, and got off to sea ; the vic- 
tors retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but 
drawing themselves inio a body together, gave two 
great screaming shouts, which they supposed was 
by way of triumph, and so the fight ended : and the 
same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, 
they also marched to their canoes. And thus the 
Spaniards had their island again free to themselves, 
their fright was over, and they saw no savages in 
several years after. 

After tliey were all gone, the Spaniards came out 
of their den, and viewing the field of battle, they 
found about two and thirty men dead on the spot : 
some wei"e killed with great long arrows, some of 
which were found sticking in their bodies; but most 
of them were killed with great wooden swords, six- 



60 ADVENTURES OF 

teen or seventeen of which they found in the field 
of battle, and as many bows, with a great many ar- 
rows. These swords were strange, great, unwieldy 
things, and they must be very strong men that used 
them : most of those men that were killed with 
them had their heads mashed to pieces, as we may 
say, or, as we call it in English, their brains knock- 
ed out, and several their arms and legs broken ; so 
that it is evident they fight with inexpressible rage 
and fury. We found not one man that was not 
stone-dead, for either they stay by their enemy till 
they have quite killed him, or they carry all the 
wounded men that are not quite dead away with 
them. 

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a 
great while ; the sight had filled them with horror, 
and the consequences appeared terrible to the last 
degree, especially upon supposing that some time 
or other they should fall into the hands of those 
creatures, who would not only kill them as enemies, 
but kill them for food, as we kill our cattle; and they 
professed to me, that the thoughts of being eaten 
up like beef or mutton, though it was supposed it 
"was not to be till they were dead, had something in 
it so horrible, that it nauseated their very stomachs, 
made them sick when they thought of it, and filled 
their minds with such unusual terror, that they were 
not themselves for some weeks after. This, as I 
said, tamed even the three English brutes I have 
been speaking of, and, for a great while after, they 
were tractable, and went about the common business 
of the whole society well enough ; planted, sowed, 
reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the coun- 
try. But some time after this, they fell into such 
simple measures again, as brought them into a great 
■deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed ; 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 61 

and these three being lusty, stout young fellows, 
they made them servants, and taught them to work 
for them ; and, as slaves, they did well enough ; but 
they did not take their measures with them as I did 
by my man Friday, viz. to begin with them upon 
the principle of having saved their lives, and then 
instruct them in the rational principles of life ; much 
less of religion, civilizing, and reducing them by 
kind usage and affectionate arguings ; but as they 
gave them their food every day, so they gave them 
their work too, and kept them fully employed in 
drudgery enough ; but they failed in this by it, that 
they never had them to assist them, and fight for 
them, as 1 had my man Friday, who was as true to 
me as the very flesh upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part. Being all now 
good friends, for common danger, as I said above, 
had effectually reconciled them, they began to con- 
sider their general circumstances; and the first 
thing that came under their consideration was, whe- 
ther, seeing the savages particularly haunted that 
side of the island, and that there were more remote 
and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way 
of living, and manifestly to their advantage, they 
should not rather move their habitation, and plant 
in some more proper place for their safety, and es- 
pecially for the security of their cattle and corn. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded 
that they would not remove their habitation ; be- 
cause that, some time or other, they thought they 
might hear from their governor again, meaning me; 
and if I should send any one to seek them, I should 
be sure to direct them to that side ; where, if they 
should find the place demolished, they would con- 
clude the savages had killed us all, and we were 
gone ; and so our supply would go too. But as to 
their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them 

G 



62 APVENTURES OF 

into the valley where my cave was, where the land 
was as proper for both, and where, indeed, there 
was land enough : however, upon second thoughts, 
they altered one part of their resolution too, and 
resolved only to remove part of th^'ir cattle thither, 
and plant part of their corn there ; and so if one 
part was destroyed, the other might be saved. And 
one part of prudence tluy used, which it was very 
well they did,- viz. that they never trusted those 
three savages, which they hud prisoners, with know- 
ing any thing of the plantation they had made 'in 
that valley, or of any cattle they had there, much 
less of the cave there, which they kcjit, in case of 
necessity, as a safe retreat ; and thither they carried 
also the two barrels of powder vvhicli 1 had sent them 
at my coming away. But, however they resolved 
not to change their habitation ; yet they agreed, 
that as I had carefully covered it first with a wall 
or fortification, and then with a grove of trees, so 
seeing their safety consisted entirely in their being 
concealed, of which they were now fully convinced, 
they set to work to cover and conceal the place yet 
more effectually than before, lor this purpose, as 
I planted trees, or rather thrust in stakes, which in 
time all grew up to be trees, for some good dis- 
tance before the entrance mto my apartments, they 
went on in the same manner, and filled up the rest 
of that whole space of ground, froin the trees I had 
set, quite down to the side of the creek, where, as 
I said, I landed my floats, and even into the very 
ooze where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving 
any place to land, or any sign that there had been 
any landing thereabout; these stakes also being of 
a wood very forward to grow, as 1 have noted for- 
merly, they took care to have them generally much 
larger and taller than those which I had planted ; 
and as they grew apace, so they planted them so 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

very thick and close together, that when thejf had 
been three or four years grown, there was no yjierc- 
ing with the eye any considerable way into the 
plantation: and, as for that part which I had plant- 
ed, the trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh, 
and among them they placed so many other short 
ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a 
pallisado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next 
to impossible to penetrate it, but with a little army 
to cut it all down; for a little dog could hardly get 
between the trees, they stood so close. 

But this was not all ; for they did the same by all 
the groui^id to the right hand and to the left, and 
round even to the top of the hill, leaving no way, 
not so much as for themselves to come out, but by 
the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and 
then lifted up, and placed again from the first stage 
up to the top ; and when the ladder was taken down, 
nothing but what had wings, or witchcraft to assist 
it, could come at them. This was excellently well 
contrived , nor was it less than what they afterwards 
found occasion for ; which served to convince me, 
that as human prudence has the authority of Pro- 
vidence to justify it, so it has doubtless the direc- 
tion of Providence to set it to work ; and if we lis- 
tened carefully to the voice of it, I am persuaded 
we might prevent many of the disasters which our 
lives are now, by our own negligence, subjected to: 
but this by the way. 

I return to the story. — They lived two years after 
this in perfect retirement, and had no more visits 
from the savages. They had indeeil, an alarm given 
them one morning, wliich put them into a gi'eat 
consternation; for some of the Spaniards being out 
early one morning on the west side, or rather end, 
of the island (which was that end where 1 never 
went, for fear of being discovered), they were sur- 

G 2 



64 ADVENTURES OF 

prised with seeing above twenty canoes of Indians 
just coming on shore. They made the best of their 
way home, in hurry enough ; and giving the alarm 
to their comrades, they kept close all that day and 
the next, going out only at night to make their ob- 
servation : but tliey had the good luck to be mis- 
taken ; for wherever the savages went, they did not 
land that time on the island, but pursued some 
other design. 

And now they had another broil with the three 
Englishmen ; one of whom, a most turbulent fel- 
low, being in a rage at one of the three slaves, 
which I mentioned they had taken, because the fel- 
low had not done something right which he bid him 
do, and seemed a little untractable in his showing 
him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he 
wore it by his side, and fell upon the poor savage, 
not to correct him, but to kill him. One of the 
Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the fellow 
a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed 
at his head, but struck into his shoulders, so that he 
thought he had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran 
to him, and entreating him not to murder the poor 
man, placed himself between him and the savage, to 
prevent the mischief. The fellow being enraged the 
more at this, struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, 
-and swore he would serve him as he intended to 
serve the savage ; which the Spaniard perceiving, 
avoided the blow, and with a shovel which he had 
in his hand (for they were all working in the field 
about their corn-land), knocked the brute down. 
Another of the Englishmen running at the same 
time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard 
down ; and then two Spaniards more came in to 
help their man, and a third Englishman fell in upon 
them. They had none of them any fire-arms, or any 
other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 65 

this third Enghshman : he had one of my rusty cut- 
lasses, with which he made at the two last Spaniards, 
and wounded them both. This fray set the whole 
family in an uproar, and more help coming in, they 
took the three Englishmen prisoners. The next 
question was, what should be done with them ? 
They had been so often mutinous, and were so very 
furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, they knew 
not what course to take with them, for they were 
mischievous to the highest degree, and valued not 
what hurt they did to any man; so that, in short, 
it was not safe to live with them. 

The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so 
many words, that if they had been of his own coun- 
" try, he would have hanged them ; for all laws and 
all governors were to preserve society, and those 
who were dangerous to the society ought to be ex- 
pelled out of it; but as they were Englishmen, and 
that it was to the trenerous kindness of an Ena;lish- 
man that they all owed their preservation and deli- 
verance, he would use them with all possible lenity, 
and would leave them to the judgement of the other 
tvro Englishmen, who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishm.en stood up, and 
said they desired it might not be left to them ; For, 
says he, I am sure we ought to sentence them to the 
gallows : and with that he gives an account how 
\Vill Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have 
all the five Englishmen join together, and murder 
all the Spaniards when they were in their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls 
to Will Atkins, How, Seignior Atkins, v/ould you 
murder us all ? What have you to say to that ? The 
hardened villain was so far from denying it, that he 
said it was true : and, G — d d — m him, they would 
do it still, before they had done with them. W^ell, 
but Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard, what have 

g3 



66 ADVENTURES OF 

we done to you, that you will kill us ? And what 
would you get by killing us? And what must we 
do to prevent your killing us ? Must we kill you, 
or you kill us ? Why will you put us to the necessity 
of this, Seignior Atkins? says the Spaniard very 
calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such a 
rage at the Spaniard's making a jest of it, that, had 
he not been held by three men, and withal had no 
weapon near him, it was thought he would have at- 
tempted to have killed the Spaniard in the middle 
of all the company. This hair-brain carriage obliged 
them to consider seriously what was to be done: the 
two Englishmen, and the Spaniard who saved the 
poor savage, were of the opinion that they should 
hang one of three, for an example to the rest ; and 
that particularly it should be he that had twice at- 
tempted to commit murder with his hatchet ; and, 
indeed, there was some reason to believe he had 
done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable 
condition with the wound he had received, that it 
was thought he could not live. But the governor 
Spaniard still said no ; it was an Englishman that 
had saved all their lives, and he would never consent 
to put an Englishman to death, though he had mur- 
dered half of them ; nay, he said, if he had been 
killed himself by an Englishman, and had time left 
to speak, it should be that they should pardon him. 

This was so positively insisted on by the governor 
Spaniard, that there was no gainsaymg it ; and as 
merciful counsels are most apt to prevail, where 
they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into 
it ; but then it was to be considered what should be 
done to keep them from doing the mischief tliey de- 
signed ; for all agreed, governor and all, that means 
were to be used for preserving the society from dan- 
ger. After a long debate, it was agreed, first, that 
they should be disarmed, and not permitted to have 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 67 

either gun, powder, shot, sword, or any weapon ; 
and should be turned out of the society, and left to 
live where they would, and how they would, by 
themselves ; but that none of the rest, either Spa- 
niards or English, should converse with them, speak 
with them, or have any thing to do with them : that 
they should be forbid to come within a certain dis- 
tance of the place where the rest dwelt ; and if they 
offered to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, 
kill, or destroy any of* the corn, plantings, buildings, 
fences, or cattle belonging to the society, they 
should die without mercy, and they would shoot 
them wherever they could find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing 
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it ; and 
turning to the two honest Englishmen, said. Hold ; 
you must reflect that it will be long ere they can 
raise corn and cattle of their own, and they must 
not starve ; we must therefore allow them provi- 
sions : so he caused to be added, that they should 
have a proportion of corn given them to last them 
eight months, and for seed to sow, by which time 
they might be supposed to raise some of their own ; 
that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, 
and six kids given them, as well for present subsist- 
ence as for a store; and that they should have tools 
given them for their work in the fields, such as 
six hatchets, an adze, a saw, and the like ; but 
they should have none of these tools or provisions, 
unless they would swear solemnly that they would 
not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them, 
or of their fellow Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned 
them out to shift for themselves. They went away 
sullen and refractory, as neither content to go 
away nor to stay ; but, as there was no remedy, they 
went, pretending to go and choose a place where they 



68 ADVENTURES OF 

Avould settle themselves ; and sonic provisions were 
given them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for 
some victuals, and gave the governor an account 
where they had pitched their tents, and marked 
themselves out a habitation and plantation ; and it 
was a very convenient place, indeed, on the remotest 
part of the inland, N. E. much about the place where 
1 providentially landed in my first voyage, when I 
was driven out to sea, the Lord alone knows whi- 
ther, in my foolish attempt to sail round the island. 
Here they built themselves two handsome huts, 
and contrived them in a manner like my first habi- 
tation, being close under the side of a hill, having 
some trees growing already on three sides of it, so 
that by planting others, it would be very easily 
covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched 
for. They desired some dried goats'-skins, for beds 
and covering, which were given them : and upon 
giving their words that they would not disturb the 
rest, or injure any of their plantations, they gave 
them hatchets, and what other tools they could 
spare ; some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing ; and, 
in a word, any thing they wanted, except arms and 
ammimition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six 
months, and luid got in their first harvest, though 
the quantity was but small, the parcel of land they 
iiad planted being but little ; for, indeed, having all 
their plantation to form, they had a great deal of 
work upon their hands; and when they came to 
make boards and pots, and such things, they were 
quite out of their element, and coul(| make nothing 
of it : and when the rainy season came on, for want 
of a cave in tlie earth, they could not keep their 
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling; 
and this humbled them much : so they came and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

begged the Spaniards to help them, which they 
very readily did ; and in four days worked a great 
hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough to 
secure their corn and other things from the rain ; 
but it was but a poor place, at best, compared to 
mine, and especially as mine was then, for the 
Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made several 
new apartments in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this separa- 
tion, a new frolic took these rogues, which, to- 
gether with the former villainy they had committed, 
brought mischief enough upon them, and had very 
near been the ruin of the whole colony. The three 
new associates began, it seems, to be weary of the 
laborious life they led, and that without hope of 
bettering their circumstances ; and a whim took 
them, that they would make a voyage to the con- 
tinent, from whence the savages came, and would 
try if they could seize upon some prisoners among 
the natives there, and bring them home, so to 
make them do the laborious part of their work for 
them. 

The project was not so preposterous, if they had 
gone no farther : but they did nothing, and pro- 
posed nothing, but had either mischief in the de- 
sign, or mischief in the event : and, if I may give 
my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from 
Heaven ; for if we will not allow a visible curse to 
pursue visible crimes, how shall we reconcile the 
events of things with the divine justice ? It was 
certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of 
mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state 
they were in ; and they showed not the least re- 
morse for the crime, but added new villanies to it, 
such as the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding 
a poor slave, because he did not, or perhaps could 
not, understand to do what he directed, and to 



70 ADVENTURES OF 

wound him in such a manner as made him a cripple 
all his life, and in a place v/here no surgeon or me- 
dicine could be had for his cure ; and what was stili 
worse, the murderous intent, or, to do justice to 
the crime, the intentional murder, for such to be 
sure it was, as was afterwards the formed design 
they all laid, to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, 
and in their sleep. 

But 1 leave observing, and return to the story : — 
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one 
morning, and in very humble terms desired to be 
admitted to speak w ith them : the Spaniards very 
readiiy heard what they had to say, which was this: 
— That they were tired of living in the manner they 
did ; and that they were not handy enough to make 
the necessaries they wanted, and that having no 
help, they found they should be starved ; but if the 
Spaniards would give them leave to take one of the 
canoes which they came over in, and give them 
arms and ammunition proportioned to their defence, 
they would go over to the main and seek their for- 
tunes, and so deliver them from the trouble of sup- 
plying them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of 
them, but very honestl}^ represented to them the 
certain destruction they were running into ; told 
them they had suffered such hardships upon that 
very spot, that they could, without any spirit of 
prophecy, tell them they would be starved, or nmr- 
dered, and bade them consider of it. 

The men rei)l!ed audaciously, they should be 
starved if they staid here, for they couid not work, 
and would not work, and they couid but be starved 
abroad ; and if they were murdered, there was an 
end of them : they had no wives or children to cry 
aficr them : and, in short, insisted iniportunately 
upon their demand ; declaring they would go, 
whether they would give them any arms or no. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 71 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, 
that if they were resolved to go, they should not 
go like naked men, and be in no condition to de- 
fend themselves: and that though they could ill 
spare their fire-ai'ms, having not enough for them- 
selves, yet they would let them have two muskets, 
a pistol and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, 
which they thought was sufficient for them. In a 
word, they accepted the offer ; and having baked 
them bread enough to serve them a month, and 
given them as much goat's-flesh as they could eat 
while it was sweet, and a great basket of dried 
grapes, a pot of fresh water, and a young kid alive, 
they boldly set out in the canoe for a voyage over 
the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad. 

The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would 
very well have carried fifteen or twenty men, and 
therefore was rather too big for them to manage ; 
but as they had a fair breeze, and flood-tide with 
them, they did well enough. They had made a 
mast of a long pole, and a sail of four laige goats'- 
skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; 
and away they went merrily enough : the Spaniards 
called after them, Bon veyajo ; and no man ever 
thought of seeing them any more. 

The Spaniards were often saying to one another, 
and to the two honest Englishmen who remained 
behind, how quietly and comfortably they lived, 
now these three turbulent fellows were gone ; as for 
their coming again, that was the remotest thing 
from their thoughts that could be imagined ; when, 
behold, after tv/o and twenty days' absence, one of 
the Englishmen, being abroad upon his planting 
work, sees three strange men coming towards hira 
at a distance, with guns upon their shoulders. 

Away runs the Englishman, as if he wasbewitched, 
comes frightened and amazed to the governor 



72 ADVENTURES OF 

Spaniard,and tells him they were all undone, for there 
were strangers landed upon the island, but could 
not tell who. The Spaniard, pausing a while, says 
to him, How do you mean, you cannot tell who ? 
They are the savages to be sure. — No, no, says the 
Englishman ; they are men in clothes, with arms. — 
Nay then, says theSpaniard, why are you concerned? 
If they are not savages, they must be friends ; for 
there is no Christian nation upon earth but will do 
us good rather than harm. 

While they were debating thus, came the three 
Englishmen, and standing without the wood, which 
was new planted, hollowed to them : they presently 
knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that 
kind ceased. But now the admiration was turned 
upon another question, viz. What could be the mat- 
ter, and what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brought the men in, 
and inquiring where they had been, and what they 
had been doing, they gave them a full account of 
their voyage in a few words, viz. That they reached 
the land in two days, or something less ; but find- 
ing the people alarmed at their coming, and pre- 
paring with bows and arrows to fight them, they 
durst not go on shore, but sailed on to the north- 
ward six or seven hours, till they came to a great 
opening, by which they perceived that the land they 
saw from our i-sland, was not the main, but an island ; 
upon entering that opening of the sea, they saw an- 
othei- island on the right hand, north, and several 
more west ; and being resolved to land somewhere, 
they put over to one of the islands which lay west, 
and went boldly on shore : that they found the peo- 
ple very courteous and friendly to them ; and that 
they gave them several roots and some dried fish, 
and appeared very sociable ; and the women as well 
iis the men, were very forward to supply them with 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

any thing they could get for them to eat, and 
brought it to. them a great way upon their heads. 

They continued here four days ; and inquired, as 
well as they could of them, by signs, what nations 
were this way, and that way ; and were told of se- 
veral fierce and terrible people that lived almost 
every way, who, as they made known by signs to 
them, used to eat men ; but as for themselves, they 
said, they never eat men or women, except only 
such as they took in the wars ; and then, they 
owned, they made a great feast, and ate their pri- 
soners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had had a 
feast of that kind ; and they told them about two 
moons ago, pointing to the moon, and to two 
fingers ; and that their great king had two hun- 
dred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war, 
and they were feeding them to make them fat for 
the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty 
desirous of seeing those prisoners ; but the others 
mistaking them, thought they were desirous to have 
some of them to carry away for their own eating; 
so they beckoned to them, pointing to the setting 
of the sun, and then to the rising ; which was to 
signify, that the next morning at sun-rising they 
would bring some for them ; and, accordingly, the 
next morning, they brought down five women and 
eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to 
carry with them on their voyage, just as we would 
bring so many cows and oxen down to a sea-port 
town to victual a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at 
home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and the)^ 
did not know what to do. To refuse the prisoners 
would have been the highest affront to the savage 
gentry that could be offered them, and what to do 
with them they knew not. However, after some 

VOL XVII. H 



74 ADVENTURES OF 

debate, they resolved to acco{)t of them ; and, in re- 
turn, they gave the savages that brought them one 
of their hatchets, an old key, a knite, and six or 
seven of their bullets ; which, though they did not 
understand their use, they seemed particularly 
pleased with ; and then tying the poor creatures' 
hands behind them, they dragged the prisoners into 
the boat for our men. 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as 
soon as they had them, or else they that gave them 
this noble present would certainly have expected 
that they should have gone to work with them, have 
killed two or three of them the next morning, and 
perhaps have invited the donors to dinner. But 
having taken their leave, with all the respect and 
thanks that could well pass between people, w here, 
on either side, they understood not one word they 
could say, they put off with their boat, and came 
back towards the first island ; where, when they ar- 
rived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, 
there being too many of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage, they endeavoured to have some 
communication with their prisoners ; but it was 
impossible to make them understand any thing ; no- 
thing they could say to them, or give them, or do 
for them, but was looked upon as going to murder 
them. They first of all unbound them ; but the 
poor creatures screamed at that, especially the wo- 
men, as if they had just felt the knife at their 
throats; for they immediately concluded they were 
unbound on purpose to be killed. If they gave them 
any thing to eat, it was the same thing ; they then 
concluded, it was for fear they should sink in flesh, 
and so not be fat enough to kill. If they looked at 
one of them more particularly, the party presently 
concluded, it was to see whether he or she was fattest, 
and fittest to kill first : nay, after they had brought

them quite over, and began to use them kindly, and 
treat them well, still they expected every day to 
make a dinner or supper for their new masters. 

Wlien the three wanderers had given this unac- 
countable history or journal of their voyage, the 
Spaniard asked them where their new family was ; 
and being told that they had brought them on 
shore, and put them into one of their huts, and 
were come up to beg some victuals for them, they 
(the Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that 
is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down 
to the place and see them ; and did so, and Friday's 
father with them. 

When they came into the hut, there they sat all 
bound ; for when they had brought them on shore, 
they bound their hands, that they might not take 
the boat and make their escape ; there, I say, they 
sat, all of them stark naked. First, there were 
three men, lusty, comely fellows, well-shaped, 
straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five 
years of age ; and five women, whereof two might 
be from thirty to forty ; two more not above four 
or five and twenty; and the fifth, a tall comely 
maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The women 
were well favoured, agreeable persons, both in shape 
and features, only tawny ; and two of them, had 
they been perfect white, would have passed for very 
handsome women, even in London itself, having 
pleasant agi*eeable countenances, and of a very mo- 
dest behaviour: especially when they came after- 
wards to be clothed and dressed, as they called it, 
though that dress was very indifferent, it must be 
confessed ; of which hereafter. 

The sight, you may be sure, was something un- 
couth to our Spaniards, who were, to give them a 
just character, men of the best behaviour, of the 
most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good-hu- 

h2

mour, that ever 1 met with ; and, in particular, of 
the most modesty, as will presently appear: I say 
the sight was very uncouth, to see three naked 
men and five naked women, all together bound, 
and in the most miserable circumstances that hu- 
man nature could be supposed to be, viz. to be ex- 
pecting every moment to be dragged out, and have 
their brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up 
like a calf that is killed for a dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old In- 
dian, Friday's father, to go in, and see, first, if he 
knew any of them, and then if he understood any 
of their speech. As soon as the old man came in, 
he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them; 
neither could any of them understand a word he 
said, or a sign he could make, except one of the 
women. However, this was enough to answer the 
end, which was to satisfy them that the men into 
whose hands they were fallen were Christians ; that 
they abhorred eating men or women ; and that they 
might be sure they would not be killed. As soon 
as they were assured of this, they discovered such 
a joy, and by such awkward gestures, several vvays, 
as is hard to describe ; for, it seems, they were of 
several nations. 

The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in 
the next place, to ask them if they were willing to 
be servants, and to work for the men who had 
brought them away, to save their lives ; at which 
they all fell a dancing ; and presently one fell to 
taking up this, and another that, any thing that 
lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that 
they were willing to work. 

The governor, who found that the having wo- 
men among them would presently be attended with 
some inconvenience, and might occasion some strife, 
and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 77 

intended to do with these women, and how they in- 
tended to use them, whether as servants or as wo- 
men ? One of the Englishmen answered very boldly 
and readily, that they would use them as both : to 
which the governor said, I am not going to restrain 
you from it ; you are your own masters as to that ; 
but this I think is but just, for avoiding disorders 
and quarrels among you, and I desire it of you for 
that reason only, viz. That you will all engage, that 
if any of you take any of these women as a woman 
or wife, that he shall take but one : and that hav- 
ing taken one, none else shall touch her ; for though 
we cannot marry any one of you, yet it is but rea- 
sonable til at while you stay here, the woman any 
of you takes should be maintained by the man that 
takes her, and should be his wife; I mean, says he, 
while he continues here, and that none else shall have 
any thing to do with her. All this appeared so just, 
that every one agreed to it without any difficulty. 

Then the Englishman asked the Spaniards if they 
designed to take any of them ? But every one of 
them answered no : some of them said they had 
wives in Spain, and the others did not like women 
that were not Christians : and all together declared 
that they would not touch one of them : which was 
an instance of such virtue as I have not met with in 
all my travels. On the other hand, to be short, the 
five Englishmen took them every one a wife, that is 
to say, a temporary wife ; and so they set up a new 
form of living ; for the Spaniards and Friday's fa- 
ther lived in my old habitation, which they had en- 
larged exceedingly within. The three servants 
which were taken in the late battle of the savagres 
lived with them ; and these carried on the main part 
of the colony, supplied all the rest with food, and 
assisted them in any thing as they could, or as they 
fou nd necessity required.

But the wonder of this story was, how five such 
refractory, ill-matched fellows, should agree about 
these women, and that two of them should not pitch 
upon the same woman, especially seeing two or three 
of them were, without comparison, more agreeable 
than the others : but they took a good way enough 
to prevent quarrelling among themselves ; for they 
set the five women by themselves in one of their 
huts, and they went all into the other hut, and drew 
lots among them who should choose first. 

He that drew to choose first went away by him- 
self to the iiut where the poor naked creatures were, 
and fetched out her he chose ; and it was worth ob- 
serving, that he that chose first took her that was 
reckoned the homeliest and oldest of the five, which 
made mirth enough among the rest ; and even the 
Spaniards laughed at it : but the fellow considered 
better than any of them, that it was application and 
business they were to expect assistance in, as much 
as in any thing else ; and she proved the best wife 
of all the parcel. 

When the poor women saw themselves set in a 
row thus, and fetched out one by one, the terrors of 
their condition returned upon them again, and they 
firmly believed they were now going to be devoured. 
Accordingly, when the English sailor came in and 
fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most la- 
mentable cry, and hung about her, and took their 
leave of her with such agonies and affection, as would 
have grieved the hardest heart in the world ; nor 
was it possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them 
that they were not to be immediately murdered, till 
they fetched the old man, Friday's father, who im- 
mediately let them know that the five men, who had 
fetched them out one by one, had chosen them for 
their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

were in was a little over, the men went to work, 
and the Spaniards came and helped them ; and in a 
few hours they had built them every one anew hut 
or tent for their lodging apart ; for those they had 
already were crowded with their tools, household 
stuff, and provisions. The three wicked ones had 
pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, 
but both on the north shore of the island, so that 
they continued separated as before ; and thus my 
island was peopled in three places ; and, as I might 
say, three towns were begun to be built. 

And here it is very well worth observing, that, 
as it often happens in the world (what the wise 
ends of God's providence are in such a disposition of 
things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had 
the two worst wives ; and the three reprobates, that 
were scarce worth hanging, that were fit for no- 
thing, and neither seemed born to do themselves 
good, nor any one else, had three clever, diligent, 
cai'eful, and ingenious wives ; not that the first two 
were bad wives, as to their temper or humour, for 
all the five were most willing, quiet, passive and 
subjected creatures, rather like slaves than wives ; 
but my meaning is, they were not alike capable, 
ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and 
neat. 

Another observation I must make, to the honour 
of a diligent application, on one hand, and to the 
disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper, on 
the other, that when I came to the place, and 
viewed the several improvements, plantings, and 
management of the several little colonies, the two 
men had so far out-gone the three, that there was 
no comparison. They had, indeed, both of them 
as much ground laid out for corn as they wanted, 
and the reason was, because, according to my rule, 
jiature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow 



80 ADVESTTRES OF 

more com than they wanted : but the difference of 
the cultJTation. of the planting, of the fence*, and, 
indeed, of erery thing else, was easy to be seen 
at first view. 

The two men had immmerable young trees plant- 
ed about their huts, so that when you came to the 
fiace, nothing was to be eeax but a wood : and 
tboogfa tfaer had twice had their plantation demo- 
lished, once by their own countrymm, and once by 
the enemT, as shall be shown in its place., yet they 
had restored all again, and every thing was thriTing 
agod floanshing about them : they had grapes plant- 
ed in order, and managed like a riDeyard, though 
thev had thanselres never seen any thing of that 
kind ; and by thor good ordering their vines, their 
grapes were as good again as any of the othos. 
Ther had also found themselves out a retreat in the 
thickest part of the woods : where, though there 
was not a natural cave, as I had foimd, yet they 
nade one with incessant labour of their haiids, and 
where, when the nnsdiief which followed happaied, 
they seoired th&r wives and children, so as they 
could never be found ; they having, by sticking 
iiuuiinerable stakes and poles of the wood which, as 
I said, grew so readily, made the grove unpassable, 
except in some plaxtes where they climbed up to get 
over the outaide part, and then went on by ways of 
tlieir own leaving. 

j\s to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, 
though thev were much civilized by their s^tlement 
coanpiared to what they were before, and were not 
so qoarrelsoaie, having not the same opportunity : 
yet one of die certain companions of a profligate 
mind never left them, and that was their idleness. 
It is true, they planted com, and made fences : but 
Soiomoa's words were ne^er better verified than in 
them. " I went b? the vinevard of the slothful, and 



KOBIKSON CRUSOE. 81 

it was all overgrown with thorns ;"' for when the 
Spaniards came to view their crop, thev could not 
see it in some places for weeds, the hedge had several 
gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and eaten 
up the com ; perhaps here and there a dead bush 
was crammed in. to stop them out for the present, 
but it was only shutting the stable-door after the 
steed was stolen : whereas, when they looked on 
the colony of the other two, there was the verv face 
of industry and success upon all they did ; there 
was not a weed to be seen in all their com. or a gap 
in any c^' their hedges ; and they, on the other 
hand, verified Solomon's words in another place, 
" that the diligent hand maketh rich ;'' for every 
thing grew and thrived, and they had plenty within 
and without ; they had more tame cattle than the 
others, more utensils and necessaries within doors, 
and yet more pleasure and diversion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy 
and cleanly within doors, and having learned the 
English ways of dressing and cooking firom one of 
the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a cook's- 
mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands' 
victuals very nicely and well ; whereas the others 
could not be brought to understand it : but then 
the husband, who, as I say. had been cook"s-mate, 
did it himself. But as for the husbands of the three 
wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, 
and caught iish and birds : in a word, any thing 
but labour, and thev fared accordingly. The dili- 
gent hved weU and comfortably : and the slothful 
lived hard and beggarly ; and so. I believe, gene- 
rally speaking, it is all over the world. 

But I now come to a scene different from all that 
had happened before, either to them or to me ; and 
the original of the story was this : Early one mom- 
ing, there came on shore five or six canoes of In- 



82 ADVENTURES OF 

dians or savages, call them which you please, and 
there is no room to doubt they came upon the old 
errand of feeding upon their slaves ; but that part 
was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to our 
men too, that they did not concern themselves 
about it, as I did : but having been made sensible, 
by their experience, that their only business was to 
lie concealed, and that if they were not seen by any 
of the savages, they would go off again quietly, 
when their business was done, having, as yet, not 
the least notion of there being any inhabitants in 
the island ; I say, having been made sensible of this, 
they had nothing to do but give notice to all the 
three plantations to keep within doors, and not 
show themselves, only placing a scout in a proper 
place, to give notice when the boats went to sea 
again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a dis- 
aster spoiled all these measures, and made it known 
among the savages that there were inhabitants 
there ; which was, in the end, the desolation of al- 
most the whole colony. After the canoes with the 
savages were gone off", the Spaniards peeped abroad 
again; and some of them had the curiosity to go 
to the place where they had been, to see what they 
had been doing. Here, to their great surprise, they 
found three savages left behind, and laying fast 
asleep upon the ground. It was supposed they had 
either been so gorged with their inhuman feast, 
that, like beasts, they were fallen asleep, and would 
not stir when the others went, or they had wan- 
dered into the woods, and did not come back in 
time to be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at tliis sight, 
and perfectly at a loss what to do. The Spanish 
governor, as it happened, was with them, and his 
advice was asked, but he professed he knew not 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 

what to do. Asfor slaves, they had enough, ah-eady ; 
and as to killing them, they were none of them in- 
clined to that: the Spaniard governor told me, they 
could not think of shedding innocent blood: for 
as to them, the poor creatures had done them no 
wrong, invaded none of their property, and they 
thought they had no just quarrel against them, to 
take away their lives. And here I must, in justice 
to these Spaniards, observe, that let the accounts of 
Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they 
will, I never met with seventeen men of any nation 
whatsoever, in any foreign country, who were so 
universally modest, temperate, virtuous, so very 
good-humoured, and so courteous, as these Spani- 
ards ; and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in 
their very nature : no inhumanity, no barbarity, 
no outrageous passions ; and yet all of them men 
of great courage and spirit. Their temper and 
calnmess had appeared in their bearing the insuf- 
ferable usage of the three Englishmen ; and their 
justice and humanity appeared now in the case of 
the savages, as above. After some consultation, 
they resolved upon this ; that they would lie still a 
while longer, till, if possible, these three men 
might be gone. But then the governor Spaniard 
recollected, that the three savages had no boat ; 
and if they were left to rove about the island, they 
would certainly discover that there were inhabitants 
in it ; and so they should be undone that way. 
Upon this they went back again, and there lay the 
fellows fast asleep still, and so they resolved to 
waken them, and take them prisoners ; and they 
did so. The poor fellows were strangely frightened 
when they were seized upon and bound ; and afraid, 
like the women, that they should be murdered and 
eaten : for it seems, those people think all the world 
does as they do, eating men's flesh j but they were 



84 ADVENTURES OF 

soon made easy as to that, and away they carried 
them. 

It was very happy for them that they did not 
carry them home to their caotle, 1 mean to my pa- 
lace under the hill ; but they carried them first to 
the bower, where was the chief" of their country 
work, such as the keeping the goats, the planting 
the corn, &c.; and afterwards they carried tliem to 
the habitation of the two Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not 
much they had for them to do ; and whether it was 
by negligence in guarding them, or that they 
thou^lit the fellows could not mend themselves, I 
know not, but one of them ran away, and taking to 
the woods, they could never hear of him any more. 

They had good reason to believe he got home 
again soon after, in some other boats or canoes of 
savages who came on shore three or four weeks 
afterwards ; and who, carrying on their revels as 
usual, went off in two days time. This thought 
terrified them exceedingly ; for they concluded, and 
that not without good cause indeed, that if this 
fellow came home safe among his comrades, he 
would certainly give them an account that there 
were people in the island, and also how i'ew and 
weak they were ; for this savage, as I observed be- 
fore, had never been told, and it was very happy he 
had not, how many there were, or where they 
lived ; nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any 
of their guns, much less had they shown him any 
of their other retired places ; such as the cave in 
the valley, or the new retreat which the two Eng- 
lishmen had made, and the like. 

The first testimony they had that this fellow had 
given intelligence of them was, that about two 
months after this, six canoes of savages, with about 
seven, eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing 

5 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

along the north side of the island, where they never 
used to come before, and landed, about an hour 
after sun-rise, at a convenient place, about a mile 
from the habitation of the two Englishmen, where 
this escaped man had been kept. As the Spaniard 
governor said, had they been all there the damage 
would not have been so much, for not a man of 
them would have escaped : but the case diflFered now 
very much, for two men to fifty was too much odds. 
The two men had the happiness to discover them 
about a league off, so that it was above an hour be- 
fore they landed ; and as they landed a mile from 
their huts, it was some time before they could come 
at them. Now, having great reason to believe that 
they were betrayed, the first tiling they did was to 
bind the two slaves which were left, and cause two 
of the three men whom they brought with the wo- 
men (who, it seems, proved very faithful to them) to 
lead them, with their two wives, and whatever they 
could can-y away with them, to their retired places 
in the woods, which I have spoken of above, and 
there to bind the two fellows hand and foot, till 
they heard farther. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all 
come on shore, and that they had bent their course 
directly that way, they opened the fences where the 
milch-goats were kept, and drove them all out ; 
leaving their goats to straggle in the woods, whither 
they pleased, that tlie savages might think they 
were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came with 
them was too cunning for that, and gave them an 
account of it all, for they went directly to the place. 

When the two poor frightened men had secured 
their wives and goods, they sent the other slave they 
had of the three who came with the women, and 
who was at their place by accident, away to the 
Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm. 



86 ADVENTURES OF 

and desire speedy help ; and, in tlie mean time, 
they took tlieir arms, and what ammunition they 
had, and retreated towards the place in the w ood 
where their wives were sent ; keeping at a distance, 
yet so that they might see, it' possible, which way 
the savages took. 

They had not gone far, but that from a rising 
ground they could see the little army of their ene- 
mies come on directly to their habitation, and, in a 
moment more, could see all their huts and house- 
hold stuff flaming up together, to their great grief 
and mortification : for they had a very great loss, 
to them irretrievable, at least for some time. They 
kept their station for a while, till they found the 
savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over 
the place, rummaging every way, and every place 
they could think of, in search of prey ; and in par- 
ticular for the people, of whom, now, it plainly ap- 
peared, they had intelligence. 

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking them- 
selves not secure where they stood, because it was 
likely some of the wild people might come that 
way, and they might come too many together, 
thought it proper to make another retreat about 
half a mile farther: believing, as it afterwards hap- 
pened, that the farther they strolled, the fewer 
would be together. 

Their next halt was at the entrance into a very 
thick-grown part of the woods, and where an old 
trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and vastly 
large ; and in this tree they both took their stand- 
ing, resolving to see there what might offer. They 
had not stood there long, before two of the savages 
appeared running directly that way, as if they al- 
ready had notice where they stood, and were com- 
ing up to attack them; and a little way farther 
they espied three more coming after them, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 87 

five more beyond them, all coming the same way : 
besides which, they saw seven or eight more at a 
distance, running another way ; for, in a word, they 
ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their 
game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity whe- 
ther they should stand and keep their posture, or fly ; 
but, after a very short debate with themselves, they 
considered, that if the savages ranged the country 
thus before help came, they might perhaps find out 
their retreat in the woods, and then all would be 
lost ; so they resolved to stand them there ; and if 
they were too many to deal with, then they would 
get up to the top of the tree, from whence they 
doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted, as 
long as their ammunition lasted, though all the 
savages that were landed, which was near fifty, were 
to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered 
whether they should fire at the first two, or wait 
for the three, and so take the middle party, by 
which the two and the five that followed would be 
separated ; at length they resolved to let the first 
two pass by, miless they should spy them in the 
tree, and come to attack them. The first two sa- 
vages confirmed them also in this regulation, by 
turning a little from them towards another part of 
the wood ; but the three, and the five after them, 
came forward directly to the tree, as if they had 
known the Englishmen were there. Seeing them 
come so straight toward them, they resolved to 
take them in a line as they came ; and as they re- 
solved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first 
shot might hit them all three : for which purpose, 
the man who was to fire put three or four small 
bullets into his piece ; and having a fair loop-hole, 
as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he took 

I 2 



88 ADVENTURES OF 

a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they 
were within about thirty yards of the tree, so that 
he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages 
came on, they plainly saw that one of the three was 
the runaway savage that had escaped from them ; 
and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved 
that, if possible, he should not escape, though they 
should both fire ; so the other stood ready with his 
piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he 
should be sure to have a second. But the first was 
too good a marksman to miss his aim ; for as the sa- 
vages kept near one another, a little behind, in a 
line, he fired, and hit two of them directly : the 
foremost was killed outright, being shot in the 
head ; the second, which was the runaway Indian, 
was shot through the body, and fell, but was not 
quite dead ; and the third had a little scratch in the 
shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that went 
through the body of the second ; and being dread- 
fully frightened, though not so much hurt, sat 
down upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a 
hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frightened with 
the noise than sensible of the danger, stood still at 
first ; for the woods made the sound a thousand 
times bigger than it really was, the echoes rattling 
from one side to another, and the fowls rising from 
all parts, screaming, and every sort making a dif- 
ferent noise, according to their kind ; just as it was 
when I fired the first gun that perhaps was ever 
shot ortin the island. 

However, all being silent again, and they not 
knowing what the matter was, came on uncon- 
cerned, till they came to the place where their 
companions lay, in a condition miserable enough ; 
and here the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

that they were within reach of the same mischief, 
stood all of a huddle over the wounded man, talk- 
ing, and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him 
how he came to be hurt ; and who, it is very ra- 
tional to believe, told them, that a flash of fire first, 
and immediately after that thunder from their gods, 
had killed those two and wounded him ; this, I say, 
is rational ; for nothing is more certain than that, 
as they saw no man near them, so they had never 
heard a gun in all their lives, nor so much as heard 
of a gun ; neither knew they any thing of killing 
and wounding at a distance with fire and bullets : 
if they had, one might reasonably believe they 
would not have stood so unconcerned in viewing the 
fate of their fellows, without some apprehensions of 
their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, 
it grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor 
creatures, who, at the same time, had no notion of 
their danger ; yet, having them all thus in their 
power, and the first having loaded his piece again, 
resolved to let fly both together among them ; and 
singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they 
shot together, and killed, or very much wounded, 
four of them ; the fifth, frightened even to death, 
though not hurt, fell with the rest ; so that our 
men seeing them all fall together, thought they had 
killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed made 
our two men come boldly out from the tree before 
they had charged their guns, which was a wrong 
step ; and they were under some surprise when they 
came to the place, and found no less than four of 
them alive, and of them two very little hurt, and 
one not at all : this obliged them to fall upon them 
with the stocks of their muskets; and first they 
made sure of the runaway savage, that had been the 

I 3 



90 ADVENTURES OF 

cause of all the mischief, and of another that was 
hurt in the knee, and put them out of their pain : 
then the man that was hurt not at all came and 
kneeled down to them, with his two hands held up, 
and made y)iteous moans to them, by gestures and 
signs, for his life, but could not say one word to them 
that they could understand. However, they made 
signs to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard 
by ; and one of the Englishmen, with a piece of 
rope twined, which he had by great chance in his 
pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and there 
they left him: and with what speed they could made 
after the other two, which were gone before, fear- 
ing they, or any more of them, should find the 
way to their covered place in the woods, where 
their wives, and the few goods they had left, lay. 
They came once in sight of the two men, but it was 
at a great distance ; however, they had the satisfac- 
tion to cross over a valley towards the sea, quite the 
contrary way from that which led to their retreat, 
which they were afraid of ; and being satisfied with 
that, they went back to the tree where they left 
their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered 
by his comrades, for he was gone, and the two 
pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound 
him, lay just at the foot of the tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not 
knowing what course to take, or how near the 
enemy might be, or .in what numbers; so they re- 
solved to go away to the place where their wives 
were, to see if all was well there, and to make them 
easy, who were in fright enough to be sure ; for 
though the savages were their own country-folk, yet 
they were most terribly afraid of them, and per- 
haps the more for the knowledge they had of them. 

N\ hen they came there, they found thesavages had 
been in the wood, and very near that place, but 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 91 

had not found it : for it was indeed inaccessible, by 
the trees standing so thick, as before, unless the 
persons seeking it had been directed by those that 
knew it, which these did not : they found, there- 
fore, every thing very safe, only the women in a 
terrible fright. While they were here, they had the 
comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come to 
their assistance ; the other ten, with their servants, 
and old Friday, I mean Friday's father, were gone 
in a body to defend their bower, and the corn and 
cattle that was kept there, in case the savages 
should have rowed over to that side of the country; 
but they did not spread so far. With the seven 
Spaniards came one of the three savages who, as I 
said, were their prisoners formerly : and with them 
also came the savage whom the Englishmen had 
left bound hand and foot at the tree ; for it seems, 
they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven 
men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him 
along with them ; where, however, they were 
obliged to bind him again, as they had the two 
others who were left when the third ran away. 

The prisoners now began to be a burthen to 
them ; and they were so afraid of their escaping, 
that thev were once resolving to kill them all, be- 
lieving they were under an absolute necessity to do 
so, for their own preservation. However, the 
Spaniard governor would not consent to it ; but or- 
dered, for the present, that they should be sent out 
of the way, to my old cave in the valley, and be 
kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them; and 
give them food for their subsistence, which was 
. done ; and they were bound there hand and foot for 
that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen 
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy 
themselves to stay any longer there ; but taking five 



92 ADVENTURES OF 

of the Spaniards and themselves, with four muskets 
and a pistt)l among theni, and two stout quarter- 
staves, away they went in quest of the savages. 
And first they came to the tree where the men lay 
that had been killed ; but it was easy to see that 
some more of the savages had been there, for they 
liad attempted to carry their dead men away, and 
liad dragged two of them a good way, but had given 
it over. From thence they advanced to the first 
rising ground, where they had stood and seen their 
camp destroyed, and where they had the mortifica- 
tion still to see some of the smoke : but neither 
could they here see any of the savages. They then 
resolved, though with all possible caution, to go 
forward, towards their ruined plantation ; but a 
little before they came thither, coming in sight of 
the sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages all em- 
barked again in their canoes, in order to be gone. 
They seemed sorry, at first, that there was no way 
to come at them, to give them a parting blow ; but, 
upon the whole, they were very well satisfied to be 
rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, 
and all their improvements destroyed, the rest all 
agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and to as- 
sist them with needful supplies. Their three coun- 
trymen, who were not yet noted for having the 
least inclination to do any good, yet as soon as 
they heard of it (for they living remote eastward, 
knew nothing of the matter till all was over), came 
and offered their help and assistance, and did, very 
friendly, work for several days, to restore their ha- 
bitation, and make necessaries for them. And thus, 
in a little time, they were set upon their legs again. 

About two days after this, they had the farther 
satisfaction of seeing three of the savages' canoes come 
driving on shore, and, at some distance from them, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

two drowned men : by which they had reason to 
believe that they had met with a storm at sea, 
which had overset some of them ; for it had blown 
very hard the night after they went off. 

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the 
other hand, enough of them escaped to inform the 
rest, as well of what they had done as of what had 
happened to them, and to whet them on to another 
enterprise of the same nature ; which they, it 
seems, resolved to attempt, with sufficient force to 
carry all before them : for except what the first 
man had told them of inhabitants, they could say 
little of it of their own knowledge, for they never 
saw one man ; and the fellow being killed that had 
affirmed it, they had no other witness to confirm it 
to them. 

It was five or six months after this before they 
heard anymore of the savages, in which time our men 
were in hopes they had either forgot their former 
bad luck, or given over hopes of better ; when, on 
a sudden, they were invaded with a most formida- 
ble fleet of no less than eight-and-twenty canoes, 
full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great 
clubs, wooden swords, and such-like engines of war ; 
and they brought such numbers with them, that, in 
short, it put all our people into the utmost conster- 
nation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the 
eastermost side of the island, our men had that 
night to consult and consider what to do ; and, in 
the first place, knowing that their being entirely 
concealed was their only safety before, and would 
be much more so now, while the number of their 
enemies was so great, they therefore resolved, first 
of all, to take down the huts which were built for 
the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to 
the old cave; because they supposed the savages would 



94 ADVENTURES OF 

go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to play 
the old game over again, though they did not now 
land within two leagues of it. In the next place, 
they drove away all the flocks of goats they had at 
the old bower, as 1 called it, which belonged to the 
Spaniards ; and, in short, left as little appearance 
of inhabitants any where as was possible : and the 
next morning early they posted themselves, with all 
their force, at the plantation of the two men, to 
wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it hap- 
pened : these new invaders leaving their canoes at 
the east end of the island, came ranging along the 
shore, directly towards the place, to the number of 
two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could 
judge. Our army was but small, indeed; but that 
which was worse, they had not arms for all their 
number neither. The whole account, it seems, 
stood thus : first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, 
five Englishmen, old Friday, or Friday's father, the 
three slaves taken with the women, who proved very 
faithful, and three other slaves, who lived with the 
Spaniards. To arm these, they had eleven muskets, 
five pistols, three fowling-pieces, five muskets or 
fowling-pieces which were taken by me from the 
mutinous seamen whom I reduced, two swords, and 
three old halberds. 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or 
fusee, but tliey had every one a halberd, or a long 
staff, like a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron 
fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet; 
also every one of our men had a hatchet. Two of the 
women could not be prevailed upon but they would 
come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows, 
which the Spaniards had taken iVom the savages 
when the first action happened, which I have 
spoken of, where the Indiaiis fought with one an- 
other ; and the women had hatchets too. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

The Spaniard governor, whom I described so oft- 
en, commanded the whole; and Will Atkins, who, 
though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was a 
most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. 
The savages came forward like lions; and our men, 
which was the worst of their fate, had no advan- 
tage in their situation; only that Will Atkins, who 
now proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was 
planted just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an 
advanced guard, with orders to let the first of them 
pass by, and then fire into the middle of them, and 
as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat as nim- 
ble as he could round a part of the wood, and so 
come in behind the Spaniards, where they stood, 
having a thicket of trees before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling 
about every way in heaps, out of all manner of or- 
der, and W' ill Atkins let about fifty of them pass by 
him ; then seeing the rest come in a very thick 
throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having 
loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets a- 
piece, about as big as large pistol bullets. How 
many they killed or wounded they knew not, but 
the consternation and surprise was inexpressible 
among the savages ; they were frightened to the 
last degree to hear such a dreadful noise, and see 
their men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody 
that did it; when, in the middle of their fright. 
Will Atkins and his other three let fly again among 
the thickest of them ; and in less than a minute the 
first three being loaded again, gave them a third 
volley. 

Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, 
as soon as they had fired, as they were ordered to 
do, or had the rest of the body been at hand, to 
have poured in their shot continually, the savages 
had been effectually routed ; lor the terror that was 



96 ADVENTURES OF 

among theiu came principally from this, viz. that 
they were killed by the gods with thunder and light- 
ning, and could see nobody that hurt them ; but 
Will Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the 
cheat ; some of the savages who were at a distance 
spying them, came upon them behind; and though 
Atkins and his men fired at them also, two or three 
times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as 
they could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and 
killed one of his fellow Englishmen with their ar- 
rows, as they did afterwards one Spaniard, and one 
of the Indian slaves who came with the women. 
This slave was a most gallant fellow, and fought 
most desperately, kiUing five of them with his own 
hand, having no weapon but one of the armed 
staves and a hatchet. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wound- 
ed, and two other men killed, retreated to a rising 
ground in the wood ; and the Spaniards, after firing- 
three volleys upon them, retreated also ; for their 
number was so great, and they were so desperate, 
that though above fifty of them were killed, and 
more than as many wounded, yet they came on in 
the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and shot 
their arrows like a cloud : and it was observed that 
their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, 
were made outrageous by their wounds, and fought 
like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard 
and the Englishman that were killed behind them ; 
and the savages, when they came up to them, kill- 
ed them over again in a wretched manner, break- 
ing their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs and 
wooden swords, like true savages ; but finding our 
men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, 
but drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it 
seems, their custom, and shouted twice, in token 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 

of their victory ; after which, they had the mortifi- 
cation to see several of their wounded men fall, dy- 
ing with the mere loss of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little 
body up together upon a rising ground, Atkins, 
though he was wounded, would have had them 
march and charge again all together at once : but 
the Spaniard rephed. Seignior Atkins, you see how 
their wounded men fight : let them alone till morn- 
ing ; all the wounded men will be stiff and sore 
with their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood ; 
and so we shall have the fewer to engage. This ad- 
vice was good; but Will Atkins replied merrily. 
That is true, seignior, and so shall I too ; and that 
is the reason I would go on while I am warm. — Well, 
seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard, you have be- 
haved gallantly, and done your part; we will fight 
for you, if you cannot come on ; but I think it best 
to stay till morning: so they waited. 

But as it was a clear moon-light night, and they 
found the savages in great disorder about their dead 
and wounded men, and a great noise and hurry 
among them where they lay, they afterwards resolv- 
ed to" fall upon them in the night; especially if 
they could come to give them but one volley before 
they were discovered, which they had a fair oppor- 
tunity to do ; for one of the Englishmen, in whose 
quarter it was where the fight began, led them 
round between the woods and the sea-side westward, 
and then turning short south, they came so near 
where the thickest of them lay, that, before they 
were seen or heard, eight of them fired in among 
them, and did dreadful execution upon them ; in 
half a minuto more, eight others fired after them, 
pouring in their small shot in such a quantity, that 
abundance were killed and wounded ; and all this 



98 ADVENTURES OF 

while they were not able to see wlio hurt them, or 
which way to fly. 

The Sj)aniar(ls charged again with the utmost ex- 
pedition, and then divided themselves in three bo- 
dies, and resolved to fall in among them all together. 
They had in each body eight persons, that is to say, 
twenty-two and the two women, who, by the way, 
fought desperately. They divided the fire-arms 
equally in each party, and so the halberds and staves. 
They would have had the women kept back, but 
they said they were resolved to die with their hus- 
bands. Having thus formed their little army, they 
marched out from among the trees, and came up to 
the teeth of the enemy, shouting and holloing as 
loud as they could; the savages stood all together, 
but were in tlie utmost confusion, hearing the noise 
of our men shouting from three quarters together : 
they would have fought if they had seen us ; for as 
soon as we came near enough to be seen, some ar- 
rows were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, 
though not dangerously ; but our men gave them 
no time, but, running up to them, fired among 
them three ways, and then fell in with the but-ends 
of their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and 
liatchets, and laid about them so well, that, in a 
word, they set up a dismal screaming and howling, 
flying to save their lives which way soever they could. 
Our men were tired with the execution, and kill- 
ed or mortally wounded in the two fights about one 
Imndred and eighty of them ; the rest, being fright- 
ened out of their wits, scoured through the woods 
and over the hills, with all the speed fear and nim- 
ble feet could help them to ; and as we did not 
trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they got 
all together to the sea-side where they landed, and 
where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not at 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 99 

an end yet ; for it blew a terrible storm of wind 
that evening from the sea, so that it was impossi- 
ble for them to go off; nay, the storm contiiming 
all night, when the tide came up, their canoes were 
most of them driven by the surge of the sea so high 
upon the shore, that it required infinite toil to get 
them off; and some of them were even dashed to 
pieces against the beach, or against one another. 

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got 
little rest that night ; but having refreshed them- 
selves as well as they could, they resolved to march 
to that part of the island where the savages were 
fled, and see what posture they were in. This ne- 
cessarily led them over the place where the fight 
had been, and where they found several of the poor 
ci-eatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering 
life ; a sight disagreeable enough to generous 
minds ; for a truly great man, though obliged by 
the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no de- 
light in his misery. However, there was no need 
to give any orders in this case ; for their own 
savages, who were their servants, dispatched these 
poor creatures with their hatchets. 

At length, they came in view of the place where 
the more miserable remains of the savages' army 
lay, where there appeared about a hundred still : 
their posture was generally sitting upon the ground, 
with their knees up towards their mouth, and the 
head put between the two hands, leaning down 
upon the knees. 

When our men came within two musket-shots of 
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets 
to be fired, without ball, to alarm them : this he 
did, that by their countenance he might know what 
to expect, viz. whether they were still in heart to 
fight, or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited 
and discouraged, and so he might manage accord- 

K 2 



100 ADVENTURES OF 

ingly. This stratagem took ; for as soon as the sa- 
vages heard the first gun and saw the flash of the 
second, they started up upon their feet in the great- 
est consternation imaginable : and as our men ad- 
vanced swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming 
and yelling away, with a kind of howling noise, 
which our men did not understand, and had never 
heard before ; and thus they ran up the hills into 
the country. 

At first our men had much rather the weather 
had been calm, and they had all gone away to sea ; 
but they did not then consider that this might pro- 
bably have been the occasion of their coming again 
in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, 
to come so many, and so often, as would quite de- 
solate the island, and starve them. Will Atkins, 
therefore, who, notwithstanding his womid, kept 
always with them, proved the best counsellor in 
this case : his advice was, to take the advantage that 
offered, and clap in between them and their boats, 
and so deprive them of the capacity of ever return- 
ing any more to plague the island. 

They consulted long about this ; and some were 
against it, for fear of making the wretches fly to the 
woods and live there desperate, and so they should 
have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to 
stir out about their business, and have their planta- 
tion continually rifled, all their tame goats destroy- 
ed, and, in short, be reduced to a life of continual 
distress. 

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do 
with a hundred men than with a hundred nations : 
that as they must destroy their boats, so they must 
destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed them- 
selves. In a word, he showed them the necessity 
of it so plainly, that they all came into it ; so they 
went to work immediately with the boats, and get- 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 101 

ting some dry wood together from a dead tree, they 
tried to set some of them on fire, but they were so 
wet that they would not burn ; however, the fire 
so burned the upper part, that it soon made them 
unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. When 
the Indians saw what they were about, some of 
them came running out of the woods, and coming 
as near as they could to our men, kneeled down 
and cried, " Oa, Oa, VVaramokoa," and some other 
words of their language, which none of the others 
understood any thing of; but as they made pitiful 
gestures and strange noises, it was easy to under- 
stand they begged to have their boats spared, and 
that they would be gone, and never come there 
again. But our men were now satisfied that they 
had no way to preserve themselves, or to save their 
colony, but effectually to prevent any of these people 
from ever going home again: depending upon this, 
that if even so much as one of them got back into 
their country to tell the story, the colony was un- 
done ; so that, letting them know that they should 
not have any mercy, they fell to work with their 
canoes, and destroyed them every one that the storm 
had not destroyed before; at the sight of which the 
savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which 
our people heard plain enough, after which they 
ran about the island like distracted men ; so that, 
in a word, our men did not really know at first, 
what to do with them. Nor did the Spaniards, with 
all their prudence, consider, that while they made 
those people thus desperate, they ought to have 
kept a good guard at the same time upon their 
plantations ; for though it is true, they had driven 
away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out 
their main retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill, 
uor the cave in the valley, yet they found out my 
plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, 

K 3 



102 ADVENTURES OP 

and all the fences and planting about it ; trod all 
the corn under foot, tore up tlie vines and grapes, 
being just then almost ripe, and did our men an in- 
estimable damage, though to themselves not one 
farthing's worth of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon 
all occasions, yet they were in no condition to pur- 
sue them, or hunt them up and down; for as they 
were too nimble oi" foot for our men, when they 
found them single, so our men durst not go abroad 
single, for fear of being surrounded with their 
numbers. The best was, they had no weapons; 
for though they had bows, they had no arrows left, 
nor any materials to make any ; nor had they any 
edged tool or weapon among them. 

The extremity and distress they were reduced to 
was great and indeed deplorable; but at the same 
time, our men were also brought to very bad cir- 
cumstances by them ; for though their retreats were 
j)reserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and 
their harvest spoiled ; and what to do, or which 
way to turn themselves, they knew not. The only 
refuge they had now was, the stock of cattle they 
had in the valley by the cave, and some little corn 
which grew there, and the plantation of the three 
Englishmen, Will Atkins and his comrades, who 
were now reduced to two ; one of them being kill- 
ed by an arrow, which struck him on the side of 
his head, just under the temples, so that he never 
spoke more: and it was very remarkable, that this 
was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor 
savage slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards 
intended to have murdered the Spaniards. 

I looked upon their case to have been worse at 
this time than mine was at any time, after I first 
discovered the grains of barley and rice, and got 
into the manner of planting and raising my corn, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 103 

and my tame cattle; for now they had, as I may 
say, a hundred wolves upon the island, which 
would devour every thing they could come at, yet 
could be hardly come at themselves. 

When they saw what their circumstances were, 
the first thing they concluded was, that they would, 
if possible, drive them up to the farther part of the 
island, south-west, that if any more savages came 
on shore they might not find one another: then 
that they would daily hunt and harass them, and 
kill as many of them as they could come at, till 
they had reduced their number; and if they could 
at last tame them, and bring them to any thing, 
they would give them corn, and teach them how to 
plant, and live upon their daily labour. 

In order to this, they so followed them, and so 
tei'rified them with their guns, that in a few days, 
if any of them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not 
hit him, yet he would fall down for fear ; and so 
dreadfully frightened they were, that they kept out 
of sight farther and farther ; till, at last, our men 
following them, and almost every day killing or 
wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods 
or hollow places so much, that it reduced them to 
the utmost misery for want of food ; and many were 
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any 
hurt, absolutely starved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts 
relent, and pity moved them, especially the Spaniard 
governor, who was the most gentleman-like, gene- 
rous-minded man, that I ever met with in my life ; 
and lie proposed, if possible, to take one of them 
alive, and bring him to understand what they meant, 
so far as to be able to act as interpreter, and go 
among them, and see if they might be brought to 
some conditions that might be depended upon, to 
save their lives and do us no harm. 



104 ADVENTURES OF 

It was some while before any of them could be 
taken ; but being weak and half-starved, one of 
them was at last surprised and made a prisoner. He 
was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink; 
but finding himself kindly used, and victuals given 
him, and no violence offered him, he at last grew 
tractable, and came to himself. They brought old 
Friday to him, who talked often with him, and told 
liim how kind the others would be to them all ; that 
they would not only save their lives, but would give 
them part of the island to live in, provided they 
would give satisfaction that they would keep in their 
own bounds and not come beyond it to injure or 
prejudice others ; and that they should have corn 
given them to plant, and make it grow for their 
bread, and some bread given them for their present 
subsistence : and old Friday bade the fellow go and 
talk with the rest of his countrymen, and see what 
they said to it : assuring them, that if they did not 
agree immediately, they should be all destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re- 
duced in number to about thirty-seven, closed with 
the proposal at the first offer, and begged to have 
some food given them ; upon which, twelve Spa- 
niards and two Englishmen, well-armed, with three 
Indian slaves and old Friday, marched to the place 
where they were. The three Indian slaves carried 
them a large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up 
to cakes and dried in the sun, and three live goats ; 
and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill, 
where they sat down, ate their provisions very thank- 
fully, and were the most faithful fellows to their 
words that could be tliought of; for, except when 
they came to beg victuals and directions, they never 
came out of their bounds: and there they lived when 
I came to the island, and I went to see them. 
They had taught them both to plant corn, make 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 105 

bread, breed tame goats, and milk them : they want- 
ed nothing but wives, and they soon would have 
been a nation. They were confined to a neck of 
land, surrounded with high rocks behind them, 
and lying plain towards the sea before them, on 
the south-east corner of the island. They had land 
enough, and it was very good and fruitful; about 
a mile and a half broad, and three or four miles in 
length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, 
such as I made ibr myself, and gave among them 
twelve hatchets and three or four knives ; and there 
they lived, the most subjected innocent creatures 
that ever were heard of. 

After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tanquil- 
lity with respect to the savages till I came to revisit 
them, which was about two years after; not but 
that, now and then, some canoes of savages came 
on shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts; but 
as they were of several nations, and perhaps had 
never heard of those that came before, or the rea- 
son of it, they did not make any search or inquiry 
after their countrymen ; and if they had, it would 
have been very hard to have found them out. 

Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all 
that happened to them till my return, at least, that 
was worth notice. The Indians or savages were 
wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently 
went among them; but forbid, on pain of death, 
any one of the Indians coming to them, because 
they would not have their settlement betrayed again- 
One thing was very i-emarkable, viz. that they 
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or bas- 
kets, but they soon outdid their masters ; for they 
made abundance of most ingenious things in wicker- 
work, particularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird- 
cages, cupboards, &c.; as also chairs to sit on,

Stools, beds, couches, and abundance of other things; 
being very ingenious, at such work, wlien tliey were 
once put in the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, 
because we furnished them with knives, scissars, 
spades, shovels, pick-axes, and all things of that 
kind which they could want. With the help of 
those tools they were so very handy, that they came 
at last to build up their huts, or houses, very hand- 
somely, raddling or working it up like basket-work 
all the way round; which was a very extraordinary 
piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd, but was 
an exceeding good fence, as well against heat as 
against all sorts of vermin ; and our men were so 
taken with it, that they got the wild savages to 
come and do the like for them; so that when I 
came to see the two Englishmen's colonies, they 
looked, at a distance, as if they all lived like bees 
in a hive. As for Will Atkins, who was now be- 
come a very industrious, useful, and sober fellow, 
he had made himself such a tent of basket-work, 
as, I believe, was never seen ; it was one hundred 
and twenty paces round on the outside, as I mea- 
sured by my steps ; the walls were as close worked 
as a basket, in pannels or squares of thirty-two in 
number, and very strong, standing about seven 
feet high: in the middle was another not above 
twenty-two paces round, but built stronger, being 
octagon in its form, and in the eight corners stood 
eight very strong posts; round the top of which he 
laid strong pieces, pinned together with wooden 
pins, from which he raised a pyramid for a roof of 
eight rafters, very handsome, I assure you, and 
joined together very well, though he had no nails, 
and only a few iron spikes, which he made himself 
too, out of the old iron that I had left there ; and, 
indeed, this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107 

in several things which he had no knowledge of: 
he made himaTbrge, with a pair of wooden bellows 
to blow the fire ; he made himself charcoal for his 
work ; and he formed out of the iron crows a mid- 
dling good anvil to hammer upon : in this manner 
he made ma^^y things, but especially hooks, staples 
and spikes, bolts and hinges. — But, to return to the 
house : After he had pitched the roof of his inner- 
most tent, he worked it up between the rafters with 
basket-work, so firm, and thatched that over again 
so ingeniously with rice-straw, and over that a large 
leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that his house 
was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. Indeed, 
he owned that the savages had made the basket- 
work for him. The outer circuit was covered as a 
lean-to, all round this inner apartment, and long 
rafters lay from the thirty-two angles to the top posts 
of the inner house, being about twenty feet distant; 
so that there was a space like a walk within the 
outer wicker-wall and without the inner, near 
twenty feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same 
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided into six 
apartments, so that he had six rooms on a floor, 
and out of every one of these there was a door ; 
first into the entry, or coming into the main tent, 
another door into the main tent, and another 
door into the space or walk that was round it ; so 
that walk was also divided into six equal parts, 
which served not only for a retreat, but to store 
up any necessaries which the family had occasion 
for. These six spaces not taking up the whole cir- 
cumference, what other apartments the outer cir- 
cle had were thus ordered : — As soon as you were in 
at the door of the outer circle, you had a short pas- 
sage straight before you to the door of the inner house; 
but on either side was a wicker partition, and a 



108 ADVENTURES OF 

door in it, by which you went first into a large room, 
or store-house, twenty feet wide, and about thirty 
feet long, and through that into another, not 
quite so long; so that in the outer circle wei"e ten 
handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come 
at through the apartments of the inner tent, and 
served as closets or retiring rooms to the respective 
chambers of the inner circle ; and four large ware- 
houses, or barns, or what you please to call them, 
which went through one another, two on either 
hand of the passage, that led through the outer door 
to the inner tent. 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never 
seen in the world, nor a house or tent so neatly con- 
trived, much less so built. In this great bee-hive 
lived the three families, that is to say. Will Atkins 
and his companion ; the third was killed, but his 
wife remained, with three children, for she was, it 
seems, big with child when he died: and the other 
two were not at all backward to give the widow her 
full share of every thing, I mean as to their corn, 
milk, grapes, &c. and when they killed a kid, or 
found a turtle on the shore ; so that they all lived 
well enough ; though it was true, they were not 
so industrious as the other two, as has been observed 
already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that as 
for religion, I do not know that there was any tiling of 
that kind among them : the}'^ often, indeed, put one 
another in mind that there was a God, by the very 
common method of seamen, viz. swearing by his 
name: nor were their poor ignorant savage wives 
much better for having been married to Christians, 
as we must call them; for as they knew very little of 
God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of en- 
tering intoany discourse with their wives abouta God, 
or to talk any thing to them concerning religion. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can 
say the wives had made from them was, that they 
had taught them to speak English pretty well ; and 
most of their children, which were near twenty in 
all, were taught to speak English too, from their 
first learning to speak, though they at first spoke it 
in a very broken manner, like their mothers. There 
was none of these children above six years old when 
I came thither, for it was not much above seven 
years that they had fetched these five savage ladies 
over; but they had all been pretty fruitful, for 
they had all children, more or less; I think the 
cook's mate's wife was big of her sixth child ; and 
the mothers were all a good sort of well-governed, 
quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, help- 
ful to one another, mighty observant and subject to 
their masters (I cannot call them husbands), and 
wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the 
Christian religion, and to be legally married ; both 
which were happily brought about afterwards by 
my means, or, at least, in consequence of my com- 
ing among them. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in 
general, and pretty much of my runagate English, 
1 must say something of the Spaniards, who were 
the main body of the family, and in whose story 
there are some incidents also remarkable enough. 

I had a great many discourses with them about 
their circumstances when they were among the sa- 
vages. They told me readily that they had no in- 
stances to give of their application or ingenuity in 
that country ; that they were a poor miserable, de- 
jected handful of people ; that if means had been 
put into their hands, yet they had so abandoned 
themselves to despair, and so sunk under the weight 
of their misfortune, that they thought of nothing 
but starving. One of them, a grave and sensible 

VOL. XVII. L 



110 ADVENTUKES OF 

man, told me he was convinced they were in the 
wrong ; that it was not the part of" wise men to give 
themselves up to their misery, but always to take 
hold of the helps which reason offered, as well for 
present support as for future deliverance : he told 
me that grief was the most senseless insignificant 
passion in the world, for that it regarded only things 
past, which were generally impossible to be recalled, 
or to be remedied, but had no views of things to 
come, and had no share in any thing that looked 
like deliverance, but rather added to the affliction 
than proposed a remedy ; and upon this he repeated 
a Spanish proverb, which though I cannot repeat 
in just the same words that he spoke it in, yet I re- 
member I made it into an English proverb of my 
own, thus : 

In trouble to be troubled. 

Is to have your trouble doubled. 

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little im- 
provements I had made in my solitude; my un- 
wearied application, as he called it; and how I had 
made a condition which in its circumstances was at 
first much worse than theirs, a thousand times more 
happy than theirs was, even now when they were 
all together. He told me it was remarkable that 
Englishmen had a greater presence of mind, in their 
distress, than any people that ever he met with : 
that their unhappy nation and the I'ortuguese were 
the worst men in the world to struggle with misfor- 
tunes ; for that their first step in dangers, after the 
common efforts were over, was to despair, lie down 
under it, and die, without rousing their thoughts up 
to proper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine differed exceed- 
ingly ; that they were cast ujion the shore without 
necessaries, without supply of food, or present sus- 
tenance till they could provide ; that, it was true, I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ill 

liad this disadvantage and discomfort, that 1 was 
alone ; but then the suppHes I had providentially 
thrown into my hands, by the unexpected driving 
of the ship on shore, was such a help as would have 
encouraged any creature in the world to have applied 
himself as I had done. Seignior, says the Spaniard, 
had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we should 
never have got half those things out of the ship, as 
you did : nay, says he, we should never have found 
means to have got a raft to carry them, or to have 
got the raft on shore without boat or sail : and how 
much less should we have done if any of us had 
been alone ! Well, I desired him to abate his com- 
pliment, and go on with the history of their coming 
on shore, where they landed. He told me they 
unhappily landed at a place where there were peo- 
ple without provisions ; whereas, had they had the 
common sense to have put off to sea again, and gone 
to another island a little farther, they had found 
provisions, though without people ; there being an 
island that way, as they had been told, where there 
were provisions, though no people ; that is to say, 
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been 
there, and had filled the island with goats and hogs 
at several times, where they had bred in such mul- 
titudes, and where turtle and sea-fowls were in 
such plenty, that they could have been in no want 
of flesh, though they had found no bread ; whereas 
here, they were only sustained with a few roots and 
herbs, which they understood not, and which had 
no substance in them, and which the inhabitants 
gave them sparingly enough ; and who could treat 
them no better, unless they would turn cannibals, 
and eat men's flesh, which was the great dainty of 
their country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they 
strove to civilise the savages they were with, and to 

l2 



112 ADVENTURES OF 

teach them rational customs in the ordinary way of 
living, but in vain ; and how they retorted it upon 
them, as unjust, that they, who came there lor as- 
sistance and support, should attempt to set up for 
instructors of those that gave them food ; intimat- 
ing, it seems, that none should set up for the in- 
structors of others but those who could live without 
them. 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities 
they were driven to ; how sometimes they were 
many days without any food at all, the island they 
were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that 
lived more indolent, and for that reason were less 
supplied with the necessaries of life, than they had 
reason to believe others were in the same part of the 
world : and yet they found that these savages were 
less ravenous and voracious than those who had bet- 
ter supplies of food. Also they added, they could 
not but see with what demonstrations of wisdom 
and goodness the governing providence of God 
directs the events of things in the world ; which, 
they said, appeared in their circumstances ; for if, 
pressed by the hardships they were under, and the 
barrenness of the country where they were, they 
had searched after a better to live in, they had then 
been out of the way of the relief that happened to 
them by my means. 

They then gave me an account how the savages 
whom they lived among expected them to go out 
with them into their wars ; and, it was true, that as 
they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the 
disaster to lose their ammunition, they should have 
been serviceable not only to their friends, but have 
made themselves terrible both to friends and ene- 
mies ; but being without powder and shot, and yet 
in a condition that they could not in reason deny 
to go out with their landlords to their wars, so when 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 113 

they came into the field of battle, they were in a 
worse condition than the savages themselves ; for 
they had neither bows nor arrows, nor could they 
use those the savages gave them ; so they could do 
nothing but stand still, and be wounded with ar- 
rows, till they came up to the teeth of their enemy; 
and then, indeed, the three halberds they had were 
of use to them ; and they would often drive a whole 
little army before them with those halberds, and 
sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their mus- 
kets : but that, for all this, they were sometimes 
surrounded with multitudes, and in great danger 
from their arrows, till at last they found the way 
to make themselves large targets of wood, which 
they covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names 
they knew not, and these covered them from the 
arrows of the savages : that, notwithstanding these, 
they were sometimes in great danger ; and five of 
them were once knocked down together with the 
clubs of the savages, which was the time when one 
of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spa- 
niard whom I had relieved: that at first they thought 
he had been killed ; but when they afterwards heard 
he was taken prisoner, they were under the greatest 
grief imaginable, and would willingly have all ven- 
tured their lives to have rescued him. 

They told me that when they were so knocked 
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and 
stood over them fighting till they were come to them- 
selves, all but him who they thought had been 
dead : and then they made their way with their hal- 
berds and pieces, standing close together in a line, 
through a body of above a thousand savages, beat- 
ing down all that came in their way, got the victory 
over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, be- 
cause it was with the loss of their friend, whom the 

l3 



114 ADVENTURES OF 

Other party, finding him alive, carried off, with some 
others, as I gave an account before. 

They described most affectionately how they were 
surprised with joy at the return of their friend and 
companion in misery, who, they thought, had been 
devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind, viz. by 
wild men ; and yet how more and more they were 
surprised with the account he gave them of his er- 
rand, and that there was a Christian in any place 
near, much more one that was able, and had human- 
ity enough, to contribute to their deliverance. 

They described how they were astonished at the 
sight of the relief I sent them, and at the appear- 
ance of loaves of bread, things they had not seen since 
their coming to that miserable place; how often 
they crossed and blessed it as bread sent from Hea- 
ven ; and what a reviving cordial it was to their spi- 
rits to taste it, as also the other things I had sent 
for their supply : and, after all, they would have 
told me something of the joy they were in at the 
sight of a boat and pilots, to carry them away to 
the person and place from whence all these new 
comforts came, but it was impossible to express it 
by words, for their excessive joy naturally driving 
them to unbecoming extravagances, they had no 
way to describe them, but by telling me they bor- 
dered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to 
their passions suitable to the sense that was upon 
them ; that in some it worked one way, and in some 
another ; and that some of them, through a surprise 
of joy, would burst into tears, others be stark mad, 
and others immediately faint. This discourse ex- 
tremely affected me, and called to my mind Friday's 
ecstasy when he met his father, and the poor peo- 
ple's ecstasy when I took them up at sea after their 
ship was on fire ; the joy of the mate of the ship 



nOBINSON CRUSOE. 115 

when he found himself delivered in the place where 
he expected to perish ; and my own joy, when, 
after twenty-eight years' captivity, I found a good 
ship ready to carry me to my own countrj'. All 
these things made me more sensible of the relation 
of these poor men, and more affected with it. 

Having thus given a view of the state of things 
as 1 found them, I must relate the heads of what I 
did for these people, and the condition in which I 
left them. It was their opinion, and mine too, that 
they would be troubled no more with the savages, 
or, if they were, they would be able to cut them 
off, if they were twice as many as before ; so they 
had no concern about that. Then I entered into 
a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call 
governor, about their stay in the island ; for as I 
was not come to carry any of them off, so it would 
not be just to carry off some and leave others, who, 
perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength 
was diminished. On the other hand, I told them I 
came to establish them there, not to remove them : 
and then I let them know that I had brought with 
me relief of sundry kinds for them ; that 1 had been 
at a great charge to supply them with all things 
necessary, as well for their convenience as their 
defence ; and that I had such and such particular 
persons with me, as well to increase and recruit 
their number, as by the particular necessary em- 
ployments which they were bred to, being artificers, 
to assist them in those things in which at present 
they were in want. 

They were all together when I talked thus to 
them ; and before 1 delivered to them the stores I 
had brought, I asked them, one by one, if they had 
entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that 
had been among them, and would shake hands with 
one another, and engage in a strict friendship and 



116 ADVENTURES OF 

union of interest, that so there might be no more 
niisuiulerstandings and jealousies. 

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and 
good humour, said, they had met with affliction 
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough 
to make them all friends ; that, for his part, he 
would live and die with them ; and was so far from 
designing any thing against the Spaniards, that he 
owned they had done nothing to him but what his 
own mad humour made necessary, and what he 
would have done, and perhaps worse, in their case; 
and that he would ask them pardon, if I desired it, 
for the foolish and brutish things he had done to 
them, and was very willing and desirous of living in 
terms of entire friendship and union with them, 
and would do any thing that lay in his power to 
convince them of it ; and as for going to England, 
he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty 
years. 

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first dis- 
armed and excluded Will Atkins and his two coun- 
trymen for their ill conduct, as they had let me 
know, and they appealed to me for the necessity 
they were under to do so ; but that Will Atkins had 
behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they had 
with the savages, and on several occasions since, and 
had showed himself so faithful to, and concerned 
for, the general interest of them all, that they had 
forgotten all that was past, and thought he merited 
as much to be trusted with arms, and supplied with 
necessaries, as any of them ; and they had testified 
their satisfaction in him, by committing the com- 
mand to bin), next to the governor himself; and as 
they had entire confidence in him, and all his coun- 
trymen, so they acknowledged they Jiad merited 
that confidence by all the methods that honest men 
could merit to be valued and trusted; and they 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 117 

most heartily embraced the occasion of giving me 
this assurance, that they would never have any in- 
terest separate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friend- 
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all together; 
and, indeed, we made a splendid feast. I caused 
the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and 
dress our dinner, and the old cook's-mate we had 
on shore assisted. We brought on shore six pieces 
of good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the 
ship's provision, with our punch-bowl, and mate- 
rials to fill it ; and, in particular, I gave them ten 
bottles of French claret, and ten bottles of English 
beer; things that neither the Spaniards nor the 
English had tasted for many years, and which, it 
may be supposed, they were very glad of. The 
Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, which 
the cooks roasted ; and three of them were sent 
covered up close, on board the ship to the seamen, 
that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore, 
as we did with their salt meat from on board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocently 
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods ; wherein, 
that there might be no dispute about dividing, I 
showed them that there was a sufficiency for them 
all, desiring that they might all take an equal quan- 
tity of the goods that were for wearing ; that is to 
say, equal when made up. As, first, 1 distributed 
linen sufficient to make every one of them four 
shirts, and, at the Spaniards' request, afterwards 
made them up six ; these were exceeding comfort- 
able to them, having been what, as I may say, they 
had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to 
wear them. I allotted the thin English stuffs, which 
I mentioned before, to make every one a light coat 
like a frock, which I judged fittest for the heat of 



118 ADVENTUHES OF 

the season, cool and loose ; and ordered that when- 
ever they decayed they should make more, as they 
thought fit ; the like for pumps, shoes, stockings, 
hats, &c. 

1 cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction, 
sat upon the countenances of all these poor men, 
when they saw the care I had taken of them, and 
how well I had furnished them. They told me I 
was a father to them ; and that having such a cor- 
respondent as I was in so remote a part of the world, 
it would make them forget that they were left in a 
desolate place ; and they all voluntarily engaged to 
me not to leave the place without my consent. 

Then I presented to them the people I had brought 
with me, particularly the tailor, the smith, and the 
two carpenters, all of them most necessary people ; 
but, above all, my general artificer, than whom 
they could not name any thing that was more use- 
ful to them : and the tailor, to show his concern for 
them, went to work immediately, and, with my 
leave, made them every one a shirt, the first thing 
he did ; and, which was still more, he taught the 
women not only how to sew and stitch, and use the 
needle, but made them assist to make the shirts for 
their husbands, and for all the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how 
useful they were ; for they took to pieces all my 
clumsy, unhandy things, and made them clever con- 
venient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, 
shelves, and every thing they wanted of that kind. 
But to let them see how nature made artificers at 
first, 1 carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins's 
basket-house, as I called it : and they both owned 
they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity 
before, nor any thing so regular and so handily 
built, at least of its kind ; and one of them, when 
5 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 119 

he saw it, after musing a good while, turning about 
to me, I am sure, says he, that man has no need of 
us ; j'ou need do nothing but give him tools. 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, 
and gave every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and 
a rake, for we had no harrows or ploughs ; and to 
every separate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad 
axe, and a saw ; always appointing, that as often as 
any were broken or worn out they should be sup- 
plied, without grudging, out of the general stores 
that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, ham- 
mers, chisels, knives, scissars, and all sorts of iron- 
work, they had without tale, as they required ; for 
no man would take more than he wanted, and he 
must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on 
any account whatever; and, for the use of the smith, 
I left two tons of unwrought iron for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought 
them was such, even to profusion, that they could 
not but rejoice at them ; for now they could march 
as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, 
if there was occasion ; and were able to fight a thou- 
sand savages, if they had but some little advantages 
of situation, which also they could not miss, if they 
had occasion. 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose 
mother was starved to death, and the maid also : 
she was a sober, well-educated, religious young wo- 
man, and behaved so inoffensively, that every one 
gave her a good word ; she had, indeed, an unhappy 
life with us, there being no woman in the ship but 
hei'self, but she bore it with patience. After a while, 
seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine a way 
of thriving upon my island, and considering that 
they had neither business nor acquaintance in the 
East Indies, or reason for taking so long a voyage ; 
I say, considering all this, both of them came to 



120 ADVENTURES OF 

me, and desired I would give them leave to remain 
on the island, and he entered among my family, as 
they called it. 1 agreed to this readily ; and they 
had a little plot of ground allotted to them, where 
they had three tents or houses set up, surrounded 
with a basket-work, pallisadoed like Atkins's, ad- 
joining to his plantation. Their tents were con- 
trived so that they had each of them a room apart 
to lodge in, and a middle tent, like a great store- 
house, to lay their goods in, and to eat and drink in. 
And now the other two Englishmen removed their 
habitation to the same place ; and so the island was 
divided into three colonies, and no more, viz. the 
Spaniards, with old Friday, and the first servants, 
at my old habitation under the hill, which was, in 
a word, the capital city ; and where they had so en- 
larged and extended their works, as well under as 
on the outside of the hill, that they lived, though 
perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was 
there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any 
part of the world ; for I verily believe a thousand 
men might have ranged the island a month, and, if 
they had not known there was such a thing, and 
looked on purpose for it, they would not have found 
it ; for the trees stood so thick and so close, and 
grew so fast-woven one into another, that nothing 
but cutting them down first could discover the place, 
exeejit the only two narrow entrances where they 
went in and out could be found, which was not very 
easy ; one of them was close down at the water's 
edge, on the side of the creek, and it was afterwards 
above two hundred yards to the ])lace; and the other 
was up a ladder at twice, as I have already formerly 
described it ; and they had also a large wood thick- 
planted on the top of the hill, containing above an 
acre, which grew apace, and concealed the place 
IVom all discovery tftere, with only one narrow place 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 121 

between two trees, not easily to be discovered, to 
enter on that side. 

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where 
there were four families of Englishmen, I mean 
those I had left there, with their wives and children ; 
three savages that were slaves ; the widow and the 
children of the Englishman that was killed ; the 
young man and the maid ; and, by the way, we 
made a wife of her before we went away. There 
was also the two carpenters and the tailor, whom 
I brought with me for them ; also the smith, who 
was a very necessary man to them, especially as a 
gunsmith, to take care of their arms ; and my other 
man, whom I called Jack of all trades, who was in 
himself as good almost as twenty men ; for he was 
not only a very ingenious fellow, but a very merry 
fellow ; and before I went away we married him to 
the honest maid that came with the youth in the 
ship I mentioned before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me na- 
turally to say something of the French ecclesiastic 
that I had brought with me out of the ship's crew 
whom I took up at sea. It is true, this man was a 
Roman, and perhaps it may give offence to some 
hereafter, if I leave any thing extraordinary upon 
record of a man whom, before I begin, I must (to 
set him out in just colours) represent in terms very 
much to his disadvantage, in the account of protest- 
ants : as, first, that he was a Papist ; secondly, a 
Popish priest ; and, thirdly, a French Popish priest. 
But justice demands of me to give him a due cha- 
racter; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, 
pious, and most religious person; exact in his life, 
extensive in his charity, and exemplary in almost 
every thing he did. What then can any one say 
against being very sensible of the value of such a 
man, notwithstanding his profession? though it 

M 



122 ADVENTURES OF 

may be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion 
of others who shall read this, that he was mis- 
taken. 

The first hour that I began to converse with him 
after he had agreed to go with me to the East In- 
dies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in his 
conversation; and he first began with me about re- 
ligion in the most obliging manner imaginable. 
Sir, says he, you have not only under God (and at 
that he crossed his breast) saved my life, but you 
have admitted me to go this voyage in your sliip, 
and by your obliging civility have taken me into 
your family, giving me an opportunity of free con- 
versation. Now, sir, you see by my habit what my 
profession is, and I guess by your nation what yours 
is ; I may think it is my duty, and doubtless it is 
so, to use my utmost endeavours, on all occasions, 
to bring all the souls I can to the knowledge of the 
truth, and to embrace the catholic doctrine ; but 
as I am hei-e under your permission, and in your 
family, I am bound, in justice to your kindness, as 
v/cll as in decency and good manners, to be under 
your government ; and therefore 1 shall not, with- 
out your leave, enter into any debate on the points 
of religion in which we may not agree, farther than 
you shall give me leave. 

1 told him his carriage was so modest, that I could 
not but acknowledge it ; that it was true, we were 
such people as they called heretics, but that he was 
not the first catholic I had conversed with, without 
falling into inconveniences, or carrying the questions 
to any height in debate ; that he should not find 
himself the worse used for being of a different opi- 
nion from us ; and if we did not converse without 
any dislike on either side, it should be his fault, not 
ours. 

He replied, that he thought all our conversation 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 123 

might be easily separated from disputes ; that it 
was not his business to cap principles with every 
man he conversed with ; and that he rather desired 
me to converse with him as a gentleman than as a 
religionist ; and that, if I would give him leave at 
any time to discourse upon religious subjects, he 
would readily comply with it, and that he did not 
doubt but 1 would allow him also to defend his own 
opinions as well as he could ; but that, without my 
leave, he would not break in upon me with any such 
thing. He told me farther, that he would not cease 
to do all that became him, in his office as a priest as 
well as a private Christian, to procure the good of 
the ship, and the safety of all that was in her ; and 
though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and 
he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray 
for us, which he would do upon all occasions. In 
this manner we conversed ; and, as he was of the 
most obliging, gentleman-like behaviour, so he was, 
if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense, 
and, as I believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, 
and of the many extraordinary events of it ; of many 
adventures which had befallen him in the few years 
that he had been abroad in the world; and parti- 
cularly this was very remarkable, viz. that in the 
voyage he was now engaged in, he had the misfor- 
tune to be five times shipped and unshipped, and 
never to go to the place whither any of the ships he 
was in were at first designed. That his first intent 
was to have gone to Martinico, and that he went 
on board a ship bound thither at St. Malo : but, be- 
ing forced into Lisbon by bad weather, the ship re- 
ceived some damage by running aground in the 
mouth of the river Tagus, and was obliged to un- 
load her cargo there ; but finding a Portuguese ship 
there bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail, and 

M 2 



124 ADVENTURES OF 

supposing he should easily meet with a vessel there 
bound to Martinico, he went on board, in order to 
sail to the Madeiras ; but the master of the Portu- 
guese ship, being but an indifferent mariner, had 
been out of his reckoning, and they drove'to Fyal ; 
where, however, he happened to find a very good 
market for his cargo, which was corn, and there- 
fore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load 
salt at the isle of May, and to go away to Newfound- 
land. He had no remedy in this exigence but to go 
with the ship, and had a pretty good voyage as far 
as the Banks (so they call the place where they 
catch the fish) ; where meeting with a French ship 
bound from France to Quebec, in the river of Ca- 
nada, and from thence to Martinico, to carry pro- 
visions, he thought he should have an opportunity 
to complete his first design ; but when he came to 
Quebec, the master of the ship died, and the vessel 
proceeded no farther : so the next voyage he shipped 
himself for France, in the ship that was burned when 
we took them up at sea ; and then shipped with us 
for the East Indies, as I have already said. Thus 
he had been disappointed in five voyages, all, as 1 
may call it, in one voyage, besides what I shall have 
occasion to mention farther of the same person. 

But I shall not make digression into other men's 
stories, which have no relation to my own : I return 
to what concerns our affairs in the island. He came 
to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the 
while we were upon the island, and it happened to 
be just when I was going to visit the Englishmen's 
colony, at the farthest part of the island ; 1 say, he 
came to me, and told me, with a very grave coun- 
tenance, that he had for two or three days desired 
an opportunity of some discourse with me, which 
he hoped would not be displeasing to me, because 
he thought it might in some measure correspond 



ROBINSON CUUSOE. 125 

with my general design, which was, the prosperity 
of my new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least 
more than he yet thought it was, in the way of 
God's blessing. 

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his 
discourse, and turning a little short, How, sir, said 
I, can it be said that we are not in the way of God's 
blessing, after such visible assistances and wonder- 
ful deliverances as we have seen here, and of which 
I have given you a large account ? — If you had 
pleased, sir, said he, with a world of modesty, and 
yet with great readiness, to have heard me, you 
would have found no room to have been displeased, 
much less to think so hard of me, that I should sug- 
gest that you have not had wonderful assistances 
and deliverances ; and I hope, on your behalf, that 
you are in the way of God's blessing, as your design 
is exceeding good, and will prosper : but, sir, though 
it were more so than is even possible to you, yet 
there may be some among you that are not equally 
right in their actions : and you know, that in the 
story of the children of Israel, one Achan in the 
camp removed God's blessing from them, and turned 
his hand so against them, that six and thirty of them, 
though not concerned in the crime, were the objects 
of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that 
punishment. 

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and 
told him his inference was so just, and the whole 
design seemed so sincere, and was really so religious 
in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had in- 
terrupted him, and begged him to go on : and, in 
the mean time, because it seemed that what we had 
both to say might take up some time, I told him I 
was going to the Englishmen's plantations, and 
asked him to go with me, and we might discourse 
of it by the way. He told me he would the more 

M 3 



126 ADVENTUKES OF 

willingly wait on me thither, because there partly 
the thing was acted which he desired to speak to 
me about ; so we walked on, and I pressed him to 
be free and plain with me in what he had to say. 

Why then, sir, says he, be pleased to give me leave 
to lay down a few propositions, as the foundation of 
what I have to say, that we may not differ in the 
general principles, though we may be of some dif- 
fering opinions in the practice of particulars. First, 
sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal arti- 
cles of religion, and it is very unhappy it is so, es- 
pecially in the case before us, as I shall show after- 
wards, yet there are some general principles in 
which we both agree, viz. that there is a (Jod ; and 
that this God having given us some stated general 
rules for our service and obedience, we ought not 
willingly and knowingly to offend him, either by 
neglecting to do what he has commanded, or by 
doing what he has expressly forbidden : and let our 
different religions be what they will, this general 
principle is readily owned by us all, that the blessing 
of God does not ordinarily follow presumptuous sin- 
ning against his command; and every good Chris- 
tian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any 
that are under his care living in a total neglect of 
God and his commands. It is not your men being 
Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of such, 
that discharges me from being concerned for their 
souls, and from endeavouring, if it lies before me, 
that they should live in as little distance from en- 
mity with their Maker as possible, especially if you 
give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit. 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and 
told him I granted all he had said, and thanked him 
that he would so far concern himself for us ; and 
begged he would explain the particulars of what he 
had observed, that, like Joshua, to take his own pa- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 127 

ruble, I might put away the accursed thing from 
us. 

Why then, sir, says he, I will take the liberty you 
give me ; and there are three things, which, if I 
am right, must stand in the way of God's blessing 
upon your endeavours here, and which I should re- 
joice, for your sake, and their own, to see removed : 
and, sir, 1 promise myself that you will fully agree 
with me in them all, as soon as I name them ; es- 
pecially because I shall convince you that every one 
of them may, with great ease, and very much to 
your satisfliction, be remedied. First, sir, says he, 
you have here four Englishmen, who have fetched 
women from among the savages, and have taken 
them as their wives, and have had many children by 
them all, and yet are not married to them after any 
stated, legal manner, as the laws of God and man 
require ; and therefore are yet, in the sense of both, 
no less than fornicators, if not living in adultery. 
To this, sir, I know you will object that there was 
no clergyman or priest of any kind, or of any pro- 
fession, to perform the ceremony ; nor any pen and 
ink, or paper, to write down a contract of marriage, 
and have it signed between them : and I know also, 
sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you, I 
mean, of the agreement that he obliged them to 
make when they took those women, viz. that they 
should choose them out by consent, and keep sepa- 
rately to them ; which, by the way, is nothing of a 
marriage, no agreement with the women, as wives, 
but only an agreement among themselves, to keep 
them from quarrelling. But, sir, the essence of the 
sacrament of matrimony (so he called it, being a 
Roman) consists not only in the mutual consent of 
the parties to take one another as man and wife, 
but in the formal and legal obligation that there is 
in the contract, to compel the man and woman, at 



128 ADVENTURES OF 

all times, to own and acknowledge each other ; 
obliging the man to abstain from all other women, 
to engage in no other contract while these subsist, 
and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to provide 
honestly for them and their children ; and to oblige 
the women to the same, or like conditions, mutatis 
mutandis, on their side. Now, sir, says he, these 
men may, when they please or when occasion pre- 
sents, abandon these women, disown their children, 
leave them to perish, and take other women, and 
marry them while these are living : and here he add- 
ed, with some warmth. How, sir, is God honoured 
in this unlawful liberty ? and how shall a blessing 
succeedyour endeavours in this place, however good 
in themselves, and however sincere in your design, 
while these men, who at present are your subjects, 
under your absolute government and dominion, are 
allowed by you to live in open adultery ? 

I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but 
much more with the convincing arguments he sup- 
ported it with ; for it was certainly true, that though 
they had no clergyman upon the spot, yet a formal 
contract on both sides, made before witnesses, and 
confirmed by any token which they had all agreed 
to be bound by, though it had been but breaking a 
stick between them, engaging the men to own 
these women for their wives upon all occasions, and 
never to abandon them or their children, and the 
women to the same with their husbands, had 
been an eftectual lawful marriage in the sight of 
God ; and it was a great neglect that it was not 
done. But I thought to have got off my young 
priest by telling him that all that part was done 
when I was not here ; and they had lived so many 
years with them now, that if it was adultery, it was 
past remedy ; they could do nothing in it now, 

i5ir,says he, asking your pardon for such freedom. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 129 

you are right in this, that, it being done in your ab- 
sence, )'^ou could not be charged with that part of 
the crime ; but, I beseech you, flatter not yourself 
that you are not therefore under an obligation to do 
your utmost now to put an end to it. How can you 
think but that, let the time past lie on whom it will, 
all the guilt, for the future, will lie entirely upon 
'ou '•' because it is certainly in your power now to 
put an end to it, and in nobody's power but yours. 

I was so dull still, that 1 did not take him right ; 
but I imagined that, by putting an end to it, he 
meant that I should part them, and not suffer them 
to live together any longer : and 1 said to him I 
could not do that, by any means, for that it would 
put the whole island into confusion. He seemed 
surprised that I should so far mistake him. No, 
sir, says he, I do not mean that you should now se- 
parate them, but legally and effectually marry them 
now ; and as, sir, my way of marrying them may 
not be easy to reconcile them to, though it will be 
effectual, even by your own laws, so your way may 
be as well before God, and as valid among men ; I 
mean, by a written contract signed by both man and 
woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all 
the laws of Europe would decree to be valid. 

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so 
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impar- 
tiality in his discourse as to his own party or church, 
and such true warmth for preserving the people that 
he had no knowledge of or relation to; I say, for pre- 
serving them from transgressing the laws of God, 
the like of which I had indeed not met with any 
where : but, recollecting what he had said of mar- 
rying them by a written contract, which I knew he 
would stand to, I returned it back upon him, and 
told him, I granted all that he had said to be just, 
and on his part very kind ; that I would discourse 



130 ADVENTURES OF 

with the men upon the point now, when I came to 
them ; and I knew no reason why they should scru- 
ple to let him marry them all, which 1 knew well 
enough would be granted to be as authentic and 
valid in England as if they were married by one of 
our own clergymen ; what was afterwards done in 
this matter, I shall speak of by itself. 

1 then pressed him to tell me what was the second 
complaint which he had to make, acknowledging 
that I was very much his debtor for the first, and 
thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would 
use the same freedom and plainness in the second, 
and hoped I would take it as well ; and this was, 
that notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, 
as he called them, had lived with those women for 
almost seven years, had taught them to speak Eng- 
lish, and even to read it, and that they were, as he 
perceived, women of tolerable understanding, and 
capable of instruction, yet they had not, to this 
hour, taught them any thing of the Christian reli- 
gion, no, not so much as to know that there was a 
God, or a worship, or in what manner God was to 
be served ; or that their own idolatry, and worship- 
ping they knew not whom, was false and absurd. 
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and 
what (jod would certainly call them to account for, 
and perhaps, at last, take the work out of their 
hands — he spoke this very affectionately, and warmly. 
I am persuaded, says he, had those men lived in the 
savage country whence their wives came, the savages 
would have taken more pains to have brought them 
to be idolaters, and to worship the devil, than any 
of these men, so far as 1 can see, have taken with 
them to teach them the knowledge of the true God, 
Now, sir, said he, though I do not acknowledge 
your religion, or you mine, yet we would be glad to 
see the devil's servants, and the subjects of his king- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 131 

dom, taught to know the general principles of the 
Christian religion ; that they might, at least, hear of 
God and a Redeemer, and of the resurrection, and 
of a future state, — things which we all believe ; 
they had, at least, been so much nearer coming into 
the bosom of the true church than they are now, in 
the public profession of idolatry and devil-worship. 
I could hold no longer ; I took him in my arms, 
and embraced him with an excess of passion. How 
far, said I to him, have I been from understanding 
the most essential part of a Christian ! viz. to love 
the interest of the Christian church, and the good 
of other men's souls : I scarce have known what 
belongs to the being a Christian. — O, sir, do not say 
so, replied he; this thing is not your fault. — No, 
said I ; but why did I never lay it to heart as well 
as you ? — It is not too late yet, said he ; be not too 
forward to condemn yourself. — But what can be 
done now ? said I ; you see I am going away. — 
Will you give me leave to talk with these poor men 
about it ? — Yes, with all my heart, said I ; and will 
oblige them to give heed to what you say too. — As 
to that, said he, we must leave them to the mercy 
of Christ ; but it is your business to assist them, en- 
courage them, and instruct them ; and if you give 
me leave, and God his blessing, I do not doubt but 
the poor ignorant souls shall be brought home to 
the great circle of Christianity, if not into the par- 
ticular faith we all embrace, and that even while you 
stay here. Upon this I said, I shall not only give 
you leave, but give }'ou a thousand thanks for it. 
What followed on this account, I shall mention also 
again in its place. 

I now pressed him for the third article in which 
we were to blame. Why, really, says he, it is of the 
same nature ; and I will proceed, asking your leave, 
with the same plainness as before : it is about your 



132 ADVENTURES OF 

poor savages, who are, as I may say, your conquered 
subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is, or ought to be, 
received among all Christians, of what church or 
pretended church soever, viz. The Christian know- 
ledge ought to be propagated by all possible means, 
and on all possible occasions. It is on this principle 
that our church sends missionaries into Persia, In- 
dia, China ; and that our clergy, even of the supe- 
rior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous 
voyages, and the most dangerous residence among 
murderers and barbarians, to teach them the know- 
ledge of the true God, and to bring them over to 
embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have 
such an opportunity here to have six or seven and 
thirty poor savages, brought over from idolatry to 
the knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, 
that I wonder how you can pass such an occasion 
of doing good, which is really worth the expense of 
a man's whole life. 

I was now struck dumb, indeed, and had not one 
word to say. I had here a spirit of true Christian 
zeal for God and religion before me, let his parti- 
cular principles be of what kind soever: as for me, 
I had not so nmch as entertained a thought of this 
in my heart before, and I believe I should not have 
thought of it ; for I looked upon these savages as 
slaves, and people whom, had we had any work for 
them to do, we would have used as such, or would 
have been glad to have transported them to any 
other part of the world : for our business was to get 
rid of them ; and we would all have been satisfied 
if they had been sent to any country, so they had 
never seen their own. Hut to the case ; — I say, I 
was confounded at his discourse, and knew not what 
answer to make him. 

He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some 
disorder — Sir, says he, I shall be very sorry if what 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 

I have said gives you any offence. — No, no, said I, 
I am offended witli nobody but myself; but I am 
perfectly confounded, not only to think that I should 
never take any notice of this before, but with re- 
flecting what notice I am able to take of it now. 
You know, sir, said I, what circumstances I am in ; 
I am bound to the East Indies in a ship freighted 
by merchants, and to whom it would be an insuf- 
ferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, 
the men lying all this while at victuals and wages 
on the owners' account. It is true, I agreed to be 
allowed twelve days here, and if I stay more, I must 
pay three pounds sterling per diem demurrage ; nor 
can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more, 
and I have been here thirteen already ; so that I am 
perfectly unable to engage in this work, unless I 
would suffer myself to be left behind here again ; 
in which case, if this single ship should miscarry in 
any part of her voyage, I should be just in the same 
condition that I was left in here at first, and from 
which 1 have been so wonderfully delivered. He 
owned the case was very hard upon me, as to my 
voyage ; but laid it home upon my conscience, whe- 
ther the blessing of saving thirty-seven souls was not 
worth venturing all I had in the world for. I was 
not so sensible of that as he was. I returned upon 
him thus : Why, sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, 
to be an instrument in God's hand to convert thirty- 
seven heathens to the knowledge of Christ ; but as 
you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to the 
work, so that it seems so naturally to fall into the 
way of your profession, how is it then that you do 
not rather offer yourself to undertake it, than press 
me to do it ? 

Upon this he faced about just before me, as he 
walked along, and putting me to a full stop, made 
me a very low bow. I most heartily thank God and 

N 



134< ADVENTURES OF 

you, sir, said he, for giving me so evident a call to 
so blessed a work ; and if you think yourself dis- 
charged from it, and desire me to undertake it, 1 
will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward 
for all the hazards and difficulties of such a broken, 
disappointed voyage as 1 have met with, that 1 am 
dropped at least into so glorious a work. 

1 discovered a kind of rapture in his face while 
he spoke this to me ; his eyes sparkled like fire, his 
face glowed, and his colour came and went, as if 
he had been falling into fits ; in a word, he was fired 
with the joy of being embarked in such a work. I 
paused a considerable while before I could tell what 
to say to him ; for I was really surprised to find a 
man of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in 
his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his 
profession only, but even of any profession whatso- 
ever. But after I had considered it awhile, I asked 
him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would 
venture, on the single consideration of an attempt 
on those poor people, to be locked up in an un- 
planted island for perhaps his life, and at last might 
not know whether he should be able to do them 
good or not ? 

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I 
called a venture? Pray, sir, said he, what do you 
think I consented to go in your ship to the East In- 
dies for? — Nay, said I, that I know not, unless it 
was to preach to the Indians. — Doubtless it was, 
said he ; and do you think, if I can convert these 
thirty-seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ, it is not 
worth my time, though I should never be fetched 
off the island again ? nay, is it not infinitely of more 
worth to save so many souls than my life is, or the 
life of twenty more of the same profession ? Yes, 
sir, says he, I would give Christ and the blessed Vir- 
gin thanks all my days, if I could be made the least 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 135 

happy instrument of saving the souls of those poor 
men, though I were never to set my foot off this 
island, or see my native country any more. But 
since you will honour me with putting me into this 
work, for which I will pray for you all the days of 
my life, I have one humble petition to you besides. 
— What is that? said I. Why, says he, it is, that 
you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my 
interpreter to them, and to assist me ; for without 
some help I cannot speak to them, or they to me. 

1 was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, 
because I could not think of parting with him, and 
that for many reasons : he had been the companion 
of my travels ; he was not only faithful to me, but 
sincerely affectionate to the last degree ; and I had 
resolved to do something considerable for him if he 
outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then I 
knew that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protest- 
ant, it would quite confound him to bring him to 
embrace another profession ; and he would never, 
while his eyes were open, believe that his old master 
was a heretic, and would be damned; and this might, 
in the end, ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so 
turn him back again to his first idolatry. However, 
a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it 
was this : I told him I could not say that I was will- 
ing to part with Friday on any account whatever, 
though a work that to him was of more value than 
his life, ought to be to me of much more value than 
the keeping or parting with a servant. But, on the 
other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by 
no means agree to part with me ; and I could not 
force him to it without his consent, without mani- 
fest injustice; because I had promised I would 
never put him away, and he had promised and en- 
gaged to me that he would never leave me, unless I 
put him away. 

n2 



136 ADVENTURES OF 

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had 
no rational access to these poor people, seeing he 
did not understand one word of their language, nor 
they one word of his. To remove this difficulty, 
I told him Friday's father had learned Spanish, 
which I found he also understood, and he should 
serve him as an interpreter. So he was much bet- 
ter satisfied, and nothing could persuade him but 
he would stay and endeavour to convert them ; but 
Providence gave another very happy turn to all 
this. 

I come back now to the first part of his objec- 
tions. When we came to the Englishmen, I sent 
for them all together, and after some account given 
them of what 1 had done for them, viz. what neces- 
sary things I had provided for them, and how they 
were distributed, which they were very sensible of, 
and very thankful for, 1 began to talk to them of the 
scandalous life they led, and gave them a full ac- 
count of the notice the clergyman had taken of it ; 
and arguing how unchristian and irreligious a life it 
was, I first asked them if they were married men or 
bachelors ? They soon explained their conditions to 
me, and showed that two of them were widowers, 
and the other three were single men, or bachelors. 
I asked them with what conscience they could take 
those women, and lie with them as they had done, 
call them their wives, and have so many children 
by them, and not be lawfully married to them ? 

They all gave me the answer I expected, viz. that 
there was nobody to marry them ; that they agreed 
before the governor to keep them as their wives, 
and to maintain them and own them as their wives; 
and they thought., as things stood with them, they 
were as legally married as if they had been married 
by a parson, and with all the formalities in the 
world. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 137 

I told them that no doubt they were married in 
the sight of God, and were bound in conscience to 
keep them as their wives ; but that the laws of men 
being otherwise, they might desert the poor women 
and children hereafter ; and that their wives being 
poor desolate women, friendless and moneyless, 
would have no way to help themselves : I therefore 
told them that unless I was assured of their honest 
intent, I could do nothing for them, but would take 
care that whac I did should be for the women and 
children without them ; and that unless they would 
give me some assurances that they would marry the 
women, I could not think it was convenient they 
should continue together as man and wife ; for that 
it was both scandalous to men and oifensive to God, 
who they could not think would bless them if they 
went on thus. 

All this went on as I expected : and they told me, 
especially Will Atkins, who now seemed to speak 
for the rest, that they loved their wives as well as 
if they had been born in their own native country, 
and would not leave them upon any account what- 
ever ; and they did verily believe their wives were 
as virtuous and as modest, and did, to the utmost of 
their skill, as much for them and for their children, 
as any women could possibly do ; and they would 
not part with them on any account : and Will At- 
kins, for his own particular, added, that if any man 
would take him away, and offer to carry him home 
to England, and make him captain of the best man 
of war in the navy, he would not go with him, if 
he might not carry his wife and children with him ; 
and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would 
be married to her now with all his heart. 

This was just as I would have it : the priest was 
not with me at that moment, but was not far off; 
so, to try him farther, I told him I had a clergyman 

n3 



138 ADVENTURES OF 

with inc, and, if lie was sincere, I would have him 
married next morning, and bade him consider of it, 
and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he 
need not consider of it at all, for he was very ready to 
do it, and was glad I had a minister with me, and 
he believed they would be all willing also. I then 
told him that my friend, the minister, was a French- 
man, and could not speak English, but 1 would act 
the clerk between them. He never so much as 
asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, 
which was indeed what I was afraid of; so we part- 
ed ; I went back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins 
went in to talk with his companions. I desired the 
French gentleman not to say any thing to them till 
the business was thorough ripe ; and I told him 
what answer the men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came 
to me, and told me they had been considering what 
I had said ; that they were glad to hear I had a 
clergyman in my company, and they were very will- 
ing to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be 
formally married as soon as I pleased ; for they were 
far from desiring to part with their wives, and that 
they meant nothing but what was very honest when 
they chose them. So I appointed them to meet 
me the next morning ; and, in the mean time, they 
should let their wives know the meaning of the mar- 
riage-law ; and that it was not only to prevent any 
scandal, but also to oblige them that they sliould 
not forsake them, whatever might happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the 
meaning of the thing, and were very well satisfied 
with it, as indeed they had reason to be : so they 
failed not to attend all together at my apartment 
next morning, where 1 brought out my clergyman ; 
and though he had not on a minister's gown, after 
the manner of England, or the habit of a priest, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 139 

after the manner of France, yet having a black 
vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round 
it, he did not look very unlike a minister ; and as 
for his language, I was his interpreter. But the 
seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the scru- 
ples he made of marrying the women, because they 
were not baptised and professed Christians, gave 
them an exceeding reverence for his person ; and 
there was no need, after that, to inquire whether he 
was a clergyman or not. Indeed, I was afraid his 
scruples would have been carried so far, as that he 
would not have married them at all ; nay, notwith- 
standing all I was able to say to him, he resisted 
me, though modestly, yet very steadily : and at last 
refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had first 
talked with the men and the women too ; and though 
at first I was a little backward to it, yet at last I 
agreed to it with a good will, perceiving the sin- 
cerity of his design. 

When he came to them, he let them know that I 
had acquainted him with their circumstances, and 
with the present design ; that he was very willing 
to perform that part of his function, and marry 
them, as I had desired ; but that before he could do 
it, he must take the liberty to talk with them. He 
told them, that in the sight of all indifferent men, 
and in the sense of the laws of society, they had 
lived all this while in open fornication ; and that it 
was true, that nothing but the consenting to marry, 
or effectually sepai-ating them from one another, 
could now put an end to it ; but there was a diffi- 
culty in it too, with respect to the laws of Christian 
matrimony, which he was not fully satisfied about, 
viz. that of marrying one that is a professed Chris- 
tian to a savage, an idolater and a heathen, one that 
is not baptised ; and yet that he did not see that 
there was time left to endeavour to persuade the 



110 ADVENTURES OF 

women to be baptised, or to profess the name of 
Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing 
of, and without which they could not be baptised. 
lie told them he doubted they were but inditfcrent 
Christians themselves; that they had but little know- 
ledge of God or of his ways, and therefore he could 
not expect that they had said much to their wives 
on that head yet ; but that unless they would pro- 
mise him to use their endeavours with their wives 
to persuade tliem to become Christians, and would, 
as well as they could, instruct them in the know- 
ledge and belief of God that made them, and to 
worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could 
not marry them ; for he would have no hand in join- 
ing Christians with savages ; nor was it consistent 
with the principles of the Christian religion, and 
was indeed expressly forbidden in God's law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I de- 
livered it very faithfully to them from his mouth, 
as near his own words as I could; only sometimes 
adding something of my own, to convince them 
how just it was, and how I was of his mind : and I 
always very faithfully distinguished between what I 
said from myself, and what were the clergymen's 
words. They told me it was very true what the 
gentleman said, that they were very indifferent 
Christians themselves, and that they had never 
talked to their wives about religion. Lord, sir, 
says Will Atkins, how should we teach them reli- 
gion ? why, we know nothing ourselves ; and be- 
sides, sir, said he, should we talk to them of God 
and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it would 
make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe 
ourselves ? And if we should tell them that we 
believe all the things we speak of to them, such as 
of good people going to heaven, and wicked people 
to the devil, they would ask us where we intend to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 141 

go ourselves, that believe all this, and are such 
wicked fellows as we indeed are? Why, sir, 'tis 
enough to give them a surfeit of religion at first 
hearing ; folks must have some religion themselves 
before they pretend to teach other people. — Will 
Atkins, said I to him, though I am afraid that what 
you say has too much truth in it, yet can you not 
tell your wife she is in the wrong ; that there is a 
God, and a religion better than her own ; that her 
gods are idols ; that they can neither hear nor 
speak ; that there is a great Being that made all 
things, and that can destroy all that he has made ; 
that he rewards the good and punishes the bad ; 
and that we are to be judged by him at last for all 
we do here ? You are not so ignorant, but even 
nature itself will teach you that all this is true ; and 
I am satisfied you know it all to be true, and be- 
lieve it yourself. — That is true, sir, said Atkins; 
but with what face can I say any thing to my wife 
of all this, when she will tell me immediately it can- 
not be true ? — Not true! said I; what do you mean 
by that ? — Why, sir, said he, she will tell me it can- 
not be true that this God I shall tell her of can be 
just, or can punish or reward, since I am not pu- 
nished and sent to the devil, that have been such a 
wicked creature as she knows I have been, even to 
her, and to every body else ; and that I should be 
suffered to live, that have been always acting so con- 
trary to what I must tell her is good, and to what 
I ought to have done. — Why, truly, Atkins, said I, 
I am afraid thou speakest too much truth ; and with 
that I informed the clergyman of what Atkins had 
said, for he was impatient to know. O, said the 
priest, tell him there is one thing will make him the 
best minister in the world to his wife, and that is, 
repentance ; for none teach repentance like true 
penitents. He wants nothing but to repent, and 



142 ' ADVENTURES OF 

then he will be so much the better qualified to in- 
struct his wife : he will then be able to tell her that 
there is not only a God, and that he is the just re- 
warder of good and evil, but that he is a merciful 
being, and with infinite goodness and long-suffering 
forbears to punish those that offend ; waiting to be 
gracious, and willing not the death of a sinner, but 
rather that he should return and live : that often- 
times he suffers wicked men to go a long time, and 
even reserves damnation to the general day of re- 
tribution ; that it is a clear evidence of God and of 
a future state, that righteous men receive not their 
reward, or wicked men their punishment, till they 
come into another world ; and this will lead him to 
teach his wife the doctrine of the resurrection and 
of the last judgement. Let him but repent for him- 
self, he will be an excellent preacher of repentance 
to his wife. 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very se- 
rious all the while, and who, we could easily per- 
ceive, was more than ordinarily affected with it : 
when being eager, and hardly suffering me to make 
an end — 1 know all this, master, says he, and a 
great deal more ; but I have not the impudence to 
talk thus to my wife, when God and my conscience 
know, and my wife will be an undeniable evidence 
against me, that I have lived as if I had never heard 
of a God or future state, or any thing about it; and 
to talk of my repenting, alas ! (and with that he 
fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that the tears 
stood in his eyes), 'tis past all that with me. — Past 
it, Atkins? said I; what dost thou mean by that? — 
I know well enough what I mean, says he ; I mean 
'tis too late, and that is too true. 

I told the clergyman, word for word, what he 
said : the poor zealous priest, — I umst call him so, 
for, be his opinion what it will, he had certainly a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 143 

most singular affection for the good of other men's 
souls, and it would be hard to think he had not the 
like for his own, — I say, this affectionate man could 
not refrain from tears; but, recovering himself, 
said to me, Ask him but one question ; Is he easy 
that it is too late ; or is he troubled, and wishes it 
were not so? I put the question fairly to Alkins ; 
and he answered, with a great deal of passion. How 
could any man be easy in a condition that must cer- 
tainly end in eternal destruction ? that he was far 
from being easy ; but that, on the contrary, he be- 
lieved it would, one time or other, ruin him. What 
do you mean by that? said I. Why, he said, he 
believed he should one time or other cut his throat, 
to put an end to the terror of it. 

The clergyman shook his head, with great concern 
in his face, when I told him all this ; but turning 
quick to me upon it, says. If that be his case, we 
may assure him it is not too late ; Christ will give 
him repentance. But, pray, says he, explain this 
to him ; that as no man is saved but by Christ, and 
the merit of his passion procuring divine mercy for 
him, how can it be too late for any man to receive 
mercy ? Does he think he is able to sin beyond the 
power or reach of divine mercy ? Pray tell him, there 
may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer 
strive, and when God may refuse to hear, but that 
it is never too late for men to ask mercy ; and we, 
that are Christ's servants, are commanded to preach 
mercy at all times in the name of Jesus Christ, to 
all those that sincerely repent ; so that it is never 
too late to repent. 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great 
earnestness ; but it seemed as if he turned oft' the 
discourse to the rest, for he said to me, he would go 
and have some talk with his wife ; so he went out a 
while, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they 



144? ADVENTURES OF 

were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion, 
as much as I was when I went rambling away from 
my father ; and yet there were none of them back- 
ward to hear what had been said ; and all of them 
seriously promised that they would talk with their 
wives about it, and do their endeavours to persuade 
them to turn Christians. 

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported 
what answer they gave, but said nothing a good 
while; but at last shaking his head, We that are 
Christ's servants, says he, can go no farther than to 
exhort and instruct ; and when men comply, submit 
to the reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all 
we can do ; we are bound to accept their good 
words ; but, believe me, sir, said he, whatever you 
may have known of the life of that man you call 
Will Atkins, 1 believe he is the only sincere convert 
among them : I take that man to be a true peni- 
tent : I will not despair of the rest ; but that man 
is apparently struck with the sense of his past life, 
and 1 doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion 
to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it ; 
for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best 
way of teaching ourselves. I know a man, who, 
having nothing but a summary notion of religion 
himself, and being wicked and profligate to the last 
degree in his life, made a thorough reformation in 
himself by labouring to convert a Jew. If that poor 
Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus 
Christ to his wife, ray life for it, he talks himself 
into a thorough convert, makes himself a penitent, 
and who knows what may follow ? 

Upon this discourse, however, and their promis- 
ing, as above, to endeavour to persuade their wives 
to embrace Christianity, he married the other two 
couple ; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet 
come in. After this, my clergyman waiting awhile, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 145 

was curious to know where Atkins was gone ; and 
turning to nie, said, I entreat you, sir, let us walk 
out of your labyrinth here, and look ; I dare say we 
shall find this poor man somewhere or other talking 
seriously to his wife, and teaching her already some- 
thing of religion. I began to be of the same mind ; 
so we went out together, and I carried him a way 
which none knew but myself, and where the trees 
were so very thick that it was not easy to see through 
the thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than 
to see out ; when coming to the edge of the wood, 
I saw Atkins and his tawny wife sitting under the 
shade of a bush, very eager in discourse : I stopped 
short till ray clergyman came up to me, and then 
having showed him where they were, we stood and 
looked very steadily at them a good while. We ob- 
served h",a very earnest with her, pointing up to 
the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens, and 
then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then 
to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. 
Now, says the clergyman, you see my words are 
made good, the man preaches to her ; mark him 
now, he is telling her that our God has made him 
and her, and the heaveris, the earth, the sea, the 
Avoods, the trees, &c. — I believe he is, said I. Im- 
mediately we perceived WiU Atkins start upon his 
feet, fall down on his kuees, and lift up both his 
hands. We supposed he said something, but we 
could not hear him: it was too far for that. He 
did not continue kneeling half a lainute, but comes 
and siis down again by his wife, and talks to her 
again : we perceived then the woman very attentive, 
but whether she siiid any thing to him, we could 
not tell. \Vhile the poor fellow was upon his knees, 
I could see the tears run plentifully down my cler- 
gyman's cheeks, and I could hardly forbear myself; 
but it was a great affliction to us both that we were 

VOL. XVII. o 



1^6 ADVENTURES OF 

not near enough to hear any thing that passed be- 
tween them. Well, however, we could come no 
nearer, for fear of disturbing them ; so we resolved 
to see an end of this piece of still conversation, and 
it spoke loud enough to us without the help of voice. 
He sat down again, as I have said, close by her, and 
talked again earnestly to her, and two or three times 
we could see him embrace her most passionately ; 
another time we saw him take out his handkerchief 
and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a 
kind of transport very unusual ; and after several of 
these things, we saw him on a sudden jump up again, 
and lend her his hand to help her up, when imme- 
diately leading her by the hand a step or two, they 
both kneeled down together, and continued so about 
two minutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out 
aloud, St. Paul ! St. Paul ! behold he prayeth. I 
was afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore I en- 
treated him to withhold himself awhile, that we 
might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must 
confess, was the most affecting that ever I saw in 
my life. Well, he strove with himself for a while, 
but was in such raptures to think that the jioor hea- 
then woman was become a Christian, that he was 
not able to contain himself; he wept several times, 
then throwing up his hands and crossing his breast, 
said over several things ejaculatory, and by way of 
giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of 
the success of our endeavours; some he spoke softly, 
and I could not well hear others ; some in Latin, 
some in French ; then two or three times the tears 
would interrupt him, that he could not speak at 
all ; but I begged that he would contain himself, 
and let us more narrowly and fully observe what was 
before us, vt^hich he did for a time, the scene not 
being near ended yet ; for after the poor man and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 147 

Ills wife were risen again from their knees, we ob- 
served he stood talking still eagerly to her, and we 
observed her motion, that she was greatly affected 
with what he said, by her frequently lifting up her 
hands, laying her hand to her breast, and such other 
postures as express the greatest seriousness and at- 
tention : this continued about half a quarter of an 
hour, and then they walked away ; so we could see 
no more of them in that situation. I took this in- 
terval to talk with my clergyman ; and first, I was 
glad to see the particulars we had both been wit- 
nesses to, that, though I was hard enough of be- 
lief in such cases, yet that I began to think it was 
all very sincere here, both in the man and his wife, 
however ignorant they might both be, and I hoped 
such a beginning would yet have a more happy end : 
And who knows, said I, but these two may in time, 
by instruction and example, work upon some of the 
others? — Some of them? said he, turning quick 
upon me : aye, upon all of them : depend upon it, 
if those two savages, for he has been but little bet- 
ter, as you relate it, should embrace Jesus Christ, 
they will never leave it till they work upon all the 
rest ; for true religion is naturally communicative, 
and he that is once made a Christian will never leave 
a pagan behind him, if he can help it. I owned it 
was a most Christian principle to think so, and a tes- 
timony of true zeal, as well as a generous heart, in 
him. But, my friend, said I, will you give me 
leave to start one difficulty here ? I cannot tell how 
to object the least thing against that affectionate 
concern which you show for the turning the poor 
people from their paganism to the Christian reli- 
gion : but how does this comfort you, while these 
people are, in your account, out of the pale of the 
catholic church, without which you believe there is 
no salvation? so that you esteem these but heretics, 

o2 



148 ADVENTURES OF 

for Other reasons as effectually lost as the pagang 
themsftlves. 

To this he answered, with abundance of candour, 
thus: Sir. I am a catholic of the Roman church, 
and a priest of the order of St. Benedict, and I em- 
brace all the principles of the Roman faith ; but 3et, 
if you will believe me, and that 1 do not speak in 
compliment to you, or in respect to my circum- 
stances and your civilities ; I say, nevertheless, I do 
not look upon you, who call yourselves reformed, 
without some charity : I dare not say (though I 
know it is our opinion in general) that yt>a cannot 
be saved ; I will by no means limit the mercy of 
Christ so far as to think that he cannot receive you 
into tlie bosom of his church, in a manner to us 
imperceivable ; and I hope 30U have the same cha- 
rity for us : I pray daily for your being all restored 
to Christ's church, by whatsoever method he, who 
is all-wise, is pleased to direct. In the mean time, 
sure you will allow it consists with nie, as a Roman, 
to distinguish fai' between a protestant and a pagan ; 
between one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in 
a way which J do not think is according to the true 
faith, and a savage or a barbarian, that knows no 
God, no Christ, no Redeemer ; and if you are not 
within the pale of the catholic cliurch, we hope you 
are nearer being restored to it than those that know 
nothing of God or of his church: and I rejoice, 
therefore, when I see this poor man, whom you 
say has been a profligate, and almost a murderer, 
kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose 
he did, tliough not fully enlightened ; believing 
that God. from whom every .such work proceeds, 
will sensibly touch his heart, and bring him to the 
farther knowledge oF that truth in his own time : 
and if God shall influence this poor inan to convert 
and instruct the ignorant savage, his wife, 1 caa 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 

never believe that he shall be cast away himself. And 
have I not reason then to rejoice the nearer any are 
brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they 
may not be brought quite home into the bosom of 
the catholic church just at the time when I may 
desire it, leaving it to the goodness of Christ to per- 
fect his work in his own time, and in his own way ? 
Certainly, 1 would rejoice if all the savages in Ame- 
rica were brought, like this poor woman, to pray to 
God, though they were all to be protestants at first, 
rather than they should continue pagans or heathens; 
firmly believing, that he that had bestowed the first 
light to them would farther illuminate them with a 
beam of his heavenly grace, and bring them into 
the pale of his church, when he should see good. 

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of 
this pious papist, as much as I was oppressed by the 
power of his reasoning ; and it presently occurred to 
my thoughts, that if such a temper was universal, 
we might be all catholic Christians, whatever 
church or particular profession we joined in ; that a 
spirit of charity would soon work us all up into 
right principles ; and as he thought that the like 
charity would make us all catholics, so I told him I 
believed had all the members of his church the like 
moderation, they would soon all be protestants. — 
And there we left that part ; for we never disputed 
at all. 

However, I talked to him another way, and tak- 
ing him by the hand, My friend, says I, I wish all 
the clergy of the Romish church were blest with 
such moderation, and had an equal share of your 
charit)^ 1 am entirely of your opinion : but I must 
tell you, that if you should preach such doctrine in 
Spain or Italy, they would put you into the Inqui- 
sition. — It may be so, said he; I know not what 
they would do in Spain or Italy ; but I will not say 

o3 



150 ADVENTURES Or 

they would be the better Christians for that severity 
for I am sure there is no heresy in abounding witn 
charity. 

Weil, as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our 
business there was over, so we went back our own 
way ; and when we carae back, we found them 
waiting to be called in: observing this, I asked my 
clergyman if we should discover to him that we had 
seen him under the bush or not ; and it was his 
opinion wc should not; but that we should talk to 
him first, and hear what he would say to us ; so we 
called him in alone, nobody being in the place but 
ourselves, and I began with him thus : 

Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had 
you ? What was your father ? 

fV. A. A better man than ever I shall be : Sir, my 
father was a clergyman. 

R. C. What education did he give you ? 
W. A. He would have taught me well, sir ; but I 
despised all education, instruction, or correction, 
like a beast as I was. 

R. C. It is true, Solomon says, He that despises 
reproof is brutish. 

IV. A, Aye, sir, I was brutish indeed, for I mur- 
dered my father : for God's sake, sir, talk no more 
about that ; sir, I murdered my poor father. 
Pr. Ha ! a murderer ! 

Here the priest started (for I interpreted every 
word as he spoke) and looKcd pale : it seems he be- 
lieved that Will had really killed his father. 

R. C. No, no, sir: I do not understand him so: 
Will Atkins, explain yourself: you did not kill your 
father, did you, with your own hands ? 

JV. A. No, Sir, I did not cut his throat ; but I 
cut the thread of all his comforts, and shortened his 
days : I broke his heart by the most ungrateful, un- 
natural return, for the most tender and affectionate 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 151 

treatment that father ever gave, or child could re- 
ceive. 

R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father, 
to extort this confession : I pray God give you re- 
pentance for it, and forgive that and ail your other 
sins ; but I asked you because I see that though you 
have not much learning, yet you are not so ignor- 
ant as some are in things that are good ; that you 
have known more of religion, a great deal, than 
you have practised. 

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the con- 
fession that I make about my father, conscience 
does ; and whenever we come lo look back upon our 
lives, the sins against our indulgent parents are cer- 
tainly the first that touch us ; the wounds they make 
lie deepest, and the weight they leave will lie hea- 
viest upon the mind, of all the sins we can commit. 

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, 
Atkins ; I cannot bear it. 

IV. A. You bear it, master ! I dare say you know 
nothing of it. 

R. C. Yes, Atkins ; every shore, every hill, nay, 
I may say every tree in this island, is witness to the 
anguish of my sou! for my ingratitude and bad 
usage of a good, tender father; a father much like 
3'ours, by your description : and I murdered my fa- 
ther as well as you, Will Atkins ; but I think, for 
all that, my repentance is short of yours too, by a 
great deal. 

I would have said more, if I could have restrained 
my passions ; but I thought this poor man's repent- 
ance was so much sincerer than mine, that 1 was 
going to leave off the discourse and retire ; for I was 
surprised with what he had said, and thought that 
instead of my going about to teach and instruct 
him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to 
me in a most surprising and unexpected manner, 



152 ADVENTURES OF 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who 
was greatly aft'ected with it, and said to me, Did I 
not say, sir, that when this man was converted he 
would preach to us all ? I tell 3'ou, sir, if" this one 
man be made a true penitent, here will be no 
need of me ; he will make Christians of all in the 
island. — But having a little composed myself, I re- 
newed my discourse with Will Atkins. But Will, 
said I, how comes the sense of this matter to touch 
you just now? 

fl'. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that 
has struck a dart through my very soul ; I have 
been talking about God and religion to my wife, in 
order, as you directed me, to make a Christian of 
her, and she has preached such a sermon to me as 
J shall never forget while I live. 

It. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to 
you ; but Aviien you were moving religious argu- 
ments to her, conscience has flung them back upon 

you- 

IV. A. Aye, sir, with such force as is not to be 
resisted. 

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed be- 
tween you and your wife ; for I know something of 
it already. 

JV. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full ac- 
count of it ; I am too full to hold it, and yet have no 
tongue to express it ; but let her have said what she 
will, and though I cannot give you an account of 
it, this I can tell you, that I have resolved to 
amend and reform my life. 

11. C. But tell us some of it: how did you begin, 
Will ? For this has been an extraordinary case, that 
is certain. She has preached a sermon, indeed, if 
she has wrought this upon you. 

fV. A. Why, I first told her the nature of our 
laws about marriage, and what the reasons were 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 153 

that men and women were obliged to enter into such 
compacts, as it was neither in the power of one nor 
other to break; thatothcrwise, order andjustice could 
not be maintained, and men would run from their 
wives, and abandon their children, mix confusedly 
with one another, and neither families be kept en- 
tire, nor inheritances be settled by legal descent. 

R. C. You talk like a civilian, VVill. Could you 
make her understand what you meant by inherit- 
ance and families ? They know no such things 
among the savages, but marry any how, without re- 
gard to relation, consanguinity, or family ; brother 
and sister, nay, as I have been told, even the father 
and the daUj-hter, and the son and the mother. 

fV. A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and 
my wife assures me of the contrary, and that they 
abhor it; perhaps, for any farther relations, they 
may not be so exact as we are ; but she tells me they 
never touch one another in the near relationship 
you speak of. 

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told 
her ? 

IV. A. She said she liked it very well, and It was 
much better than in her country. 

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was ? 
W. A. Aye, aye ; there began our dialogue. I 
asked her if she would be married to me our way. 
She asked me what way that was. I told her mar- 
riage was appointed by God ; and hei-e we had a 
strange talk together, indeed, as ever n)an amd wife 
had, 1 believe. 

N.B. This dialogue between Will Atkins and his 
wife I took down in writing, just after he had 
told it me, which was as follows : 
JVife. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a 
God in your country ? 



154- ADVENTURES OF 

W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country. 

PFi/b. No your God in my country ; my country 
have the great old Benamuckee God. 

IV. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who 
God is ; God is in heaven, and made the heaven and 
the earth, the sea, and all that in them is. 

JVife. No makee de earth ; no your God makee 
all earth; no makee my country. 

Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of 
God not making her country. 

PFife. No laugh ; why laugh me ? This nothing 
to laugh. 

He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was 
more serious than he at first. 

IV. A. That's true, indeed ; I will not laugh any 
more, my dear. 

JVife. Why, you say you God makee all ? 

JV. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, 
and you and me, and all things ; for he is the only 
true God, and there is no God but him ; he lives for 
ever in heaven. 
, JVife. Why, you no tell me long ago ? 

JV. A. That's true, indeed ; but I have been a 
wicked wretch, and have not only forgotten to ac- 
quaint thee with any thing before, but have lived 
without God in the world myself. 

JVife. What, have you a great God in your coun- 
try, you no know him ? No say O to him ? No do 
good thing for him? That no possible? 

/r. A. It is true ; though, for all that, we live as 
if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no 
power on earth. 

tVi/e. But why God let you do so ? Why he no 
makee you good live ? 

JV. A. It is all our own fault. 

JVife. But you say me he is great, much great. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 155 

have much great power, can makee kill when he 
will, why he no makee kill when you no serve him ? 
No say O to him, no be good mans. 

fV. A. That is true, he might strike me dead ; and 
I ought to expect it, for 1 have been a wicked 
wretch, that is true ; but God is merciful, and does 
not deal with us as we deserve. 

Wife. But then do you not tell God thankee for 
that too ? 

IV. A. No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his 
mercy, any more than I have feared God for his 
power. 

IVife. Then you God no God ; me no think be- 
lieve he be such one, great much power, strong : 
no makee kill you, though you make him much 
angry. 

IV. A. What, will my wicked life hinder you from 
believing in God? V/hat a dreadful creature am 1 1 
and what a sad truth is it, that the horrid lives of 
Christians hinder the conversion of heathens ! 

fVife. How me think you have great much God 
up there (she points up to heaven), and yet no do 
well, no do good thing ? Can he tell ? Sure he no 
tell what you do ? 

W^. A. Yes, yes, he knovps and sees all things ; he 
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we 
think, though we do not speak. 

Wife. What ! he no hear you curse, swear, speak 
de great damn ? 

W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all. 

Wife. Where be then the much great power 
strong ? 

W. A. He is merciful, that is all we can say for it ; 
and this proves him to be the true God ; he is God, 
and not man, and therefore we are not consumed. 

Here Will Atkins told us he was struck with hor- 
ror, to think how he could tell his wife so clearly that 



\56 ADVENTURES OP 

God sees, and hears, and knows the secret tlioughts 
of the heart, and all that we do, and yet that he had 
dared to do all the vile things Jie had done. 

m/e. Merciful ! What you call that ? 

W. A. He is our father and maker, and he pities 
and spares us. 

Wife. So then he never rnakee kill, never angry 
when you do wicked ; then he no good himself, or 
no great able. 

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good 
and infinitely great, and able to punish too ; and 
sometimes; to .s!iow his justice and vengeance, he 
lets fly his anger to destroy sinners and make ex- 
amples ; many are cut oil in their sins. 

Wife. But )io rnakee kill you yet ; then he tell you, 
may be, that he no makre you kill ; so you makee de 
bargain with him, you do bad thing, he no be angry 
at you when he be angry ar other mans. 

W. A. No, indeed; my sins are all presumptions 
upon his goodness ; and he would be infinitely just 
if he destroyed me, as he has done other men. 

Wife. Well, and yt-t no kill, no makee you dead ; 
what you say to him for that i You no tell him 
thankee for all that too ? 

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that 
is true. 

Wife. Why he no makee you much good better ? 
you say he makee you. 

W. A. He made me, as he made all the world : it 
is I have deformed myself and abused his goodness, 
and made myself ai\ abominable wretch. 

Wife. I wish you makee God know me ; I no 
makee him angry, 1 no do bad wicked thing. 

Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, 
to hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught 
to know God, and he such a wicked wretch that he 
could not say one word to her about God, but what 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 157 

the reproach of his own carriage would make most 
irrational to her to believe; nay, that already she 
had told him that she could not beheve in God, be- 
cause he, that was so wicked, was not destroyed. 

IV. A. My dear, you mean, you wish I could teach 
you to know God, not God to know you ; for he 
knows you already, and every thought in your heart. 

IViJe. Why then he know what I say to you 
now ; he know me wish to know him ; how shall 
me know who makee me? 

IV. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I can- 
not teach thee ; I will pray to him to teach thee to 
know him, and forgive me, that am unworthy to 
teach thee. 

The poor fellow was in such an agony at her 
desiring him to make her know God, and her wish- 
ing to know him, that he said he fell down on his 
knees, before her, and prayed to God to enlighten 
her mind with a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, 
and to pardon his sins, and accept of his being the 
unworthy instrument of instructing her in the prin- 
ciples of religion : after which he sat down by her 
again, and their dialogue went on. — This was the 
time when we saw him kneel down, and hold up his 
hands. 

Wife. What you put down the knee for ? What 
you hold up the hand for ? What you say ? Wlio 
you speak to ? What is all that ? 

W. A. My dear. I bow my knees in token of my 
submission to him that made me ; 1 said O to him, 
as you call it, and as your old men do to their idol 
Benarauckee ; that is, I prayed to him. 

Wife. What you say O to him for ? 

W. A. 1 prayed to him to open your eyes, and 
your undei-standing, that you may know him, and 
be accepted by him. 

Wife. Can he do that too ? 

p 



158 ADVENTURES OF 

W, A. Yes, lie can; he can do all things. 

Wife. But now he iiear what you say? 

JV. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him. and 
promised to hear us 

Wife. Bid you pray ? When he bid you ? How 
he bid you ? What, you hear him speak ? 

W. A. No, we do not hear him speak ; but he 
has revealed himself many ways to us. 

Here he was at a great loss to make her under- 
stand that God has revealed himself" to us by his 
word, and what his word was ; but at last he told 
it her thus : 

W. A. God has spoken to some good men in for- 
mer days, even from heaven, by plain words ; and 
God has inspired good men by his Spirit ; and they 
have written all his laws down in a book. 

Wife. Me no understand that ; where is book ? 

W. A. Alas ! my poor creature, I have not this 
book ; but I hope I shall one time or other get it 
for you, and help you to read it. 

Here he embraced her with great affection ; but 
with expressible grief that he had not a Bible. 

Wife. But how you makec me know that God 
teachee them to write that book ? 

W. A . By the same rule that we know him to beG od. 

Wife. What rule ? What way you know him ? 

W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing 
but what is good, righteous, and holy, and tends to 
make us perfectl}^ good, as well as perfectly happy; 
and because he forbids, and commands us to avoid, 
all that is wicked, that is evil in itself, "or evil in its 
consequence. 

Wife. That me would understand, that me fain 
see: if he teachee all good thing, he makee all good 
thing, he give all thing, he hear me when I say O 
to him, as you do just now; he makee mc good, it 
I wish to be good; he spare me, no makee kill me, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 159 

when I no be good: all this you say he do, yet he 
be great God: me take, think, believe him to be 
great (xod; me say O to him with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but 
raised her up, made her kneel by him, and he prayed 
to God aloud to instruct her in the knowledge of 
himself, by his Spirit; and that by some good pro- 
vidence, if possible, she might some time or other 
come to have a Bible, that she might read the word 
of God, and be taught by it to know him. — This 
was the time that we saw him lift her up by the 
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above. 

They had several other discourses, it seems, after 
this, too long to be set down here; and particularly 
she made him promise that since he confessed his 
own life had been a wicked abominable course of pro- 
vocations against God, that he would reform it, and 
not make God angry any more; lest he should make 
him dead, as she called it, and then she would be 
left alone, and never be taught to know this God 
better; and lest he should be miserable, as he had 
told her wicked men would be after death. 

This was a strange account, and very affecting to 
us both, but particularly to the young clergyman ; 
he was indeed wonderfully surprised with it, but 
under the greatest affliction imaginable that he 
could not talk to her, that he could not speak Eng- 
lish, to make her understand him ; and as she 
spoke but very broken English, he could not under- 
stand her ; however, he turned himself to me, and 
told me that he belived that there must be more to 
do with this woman than to marry her. I did not 
understand him at first, but at length he explained 
himself, viz. that she ought to be baptised. 1 agreed 
with him in that part readily, and was for going 
about it presently. No, no ; hold, sir, said he ; 
though I would have her be baptised by all means, 

p2 



IGO ADVENTURES OF 

yet I must observe that Will Atkins, her husband, 
has indeed brought lier, in a wonderful manner, to be 
wiUing to embrace a religious life, and has given her 
just ideas of the being of a God ; of his power, jus- 
tice, and mercy: yet I desire to know of him if he 
has said any thing to her of Jesus Christ, and of the 
salvati'^'n of sinners; of the nature of faith in him, 
and redemption by him ; of the Holy Spirit, the re- 
surrection, the last judgement, and a future state. 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but 
the poor fellew fell immediately into tears, and told 
us he had said something to her of all those things, 
but i!iat he was himself so wicked a creature, and 
his own conscience so reproached him with his hor- 
rid, ungodly life, that he trembled at the appre- 
hensions that her kno'.vledge of him should lessen 
the attention she should give to those things, and 
make her rather contemn religion than receive it; 
but he was assured, he said, that her mind was so 
disposed to receive due impressions of all those 
things, and that if I would but discourse with her, 
she would make it appear to my satisfaction that 
my labour would not be lost upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself 
as interpreter between my religious priest and the 
woman, I entreated him to begin with her; but 
sure such a sermon was never preached by a po- 
pish priest in these latter ages of the world ; and, 
as I told him, I thought he had all the zeal, all the 
knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, without 
the error of a Roman catholic; and that I took him 
to be such aclerg3'man as the Roman bishops were, 
before the church of Rome assumed spiritual sove- 
reignty over the consciences of men. In a word, 
lie brought the poor woman to embrace the know- 
ledge of Christ, and of redemption by him, not with 
wonder and astonishment only, as she did the first 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 161 

notions of a God, but with joy and faith; with an 
affection, and a surprising degree of understanding, 
scaixe to be imagined, much less to be expressed; 
and, at her own request, she was baptised. 

When he was preparing to baptise her, I entreat- 
ed him that he would perform that office with some 
caution, that the man might not perceive he was of 
the Roman church, if possible, because of other ill 
consequences which might attend adifference among 
us in that very religion which we were instructing 
the other in. He told me that as he had no conse- 
crated chapel, nor proper things for the office, I 
should see he would do it in a manner that I should 
not know by it that he was a Roman catholic myself, 
if I had not known it before; and so he did; for 
saying only some words over to himself in Latin, 
which I could not understand, he poured a whole 
dishful of water upon the woman's head, pronoun- 
cing in French very loud, " Mary" (which was the 
name her husband desired me to give her, for I 
was her godfather), " I baptise thee in the name of 
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;" 
so that none could know any thing by it what re- 
ligion he was of. He gave the benediction after- 
wards in Latin, but either Will Atkins did not 
know but it was French, or else did not take notice 
of it at that time. 

As soon as this was over, we married them ; and 
after the marriage was over, he turned to Will 
Atkins, and in a very atfectionate manner exhorted 
him, not only to persevere in that good disposition 
he was in, but to support the convictions that were 
upon him by a resolution to reform his life ; told 
him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not 
forsake his crimes : represented to him how God 
had honoured him with being the instrument of 
bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian 

p 3 



162 ADVENTURES OF 

religion, and that he should be careful he did not 
dishonour tlie grace of God; and that if he did, he 
would sec the heathen abetter Christian than him- 
self; the savage converted, and the instrument cast 
away. He said a great many good things to them 
both; and then recommending them to God's good- 
ness, gave them the benediction again, I repeating 
every thing to them in English ; and thus ended 
the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant 
and agreeable day to me that ever I passed in my 
whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yt ; his thoughts 
hung continually upon the conversion of the thirty- 
seven savages, and fain he would have staid upon 
the island to have undertaken it ; but 1 convinced 
him, first, tiuit his undertaking was impracticable 
in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps 1 would put 
it into a way of being done in his absence to his 
satisfaction; of which by and by. 

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to 
a narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board 
the ship, when the young man I had taken out of 
the famished ship's company came to n)e, and told 
me he understood I had a clergyman with me, and 
that I had caused the Englishmen to be married to 
the savages; that he had a match, too, which he 
desired might be finished before I went, between 
two Christians, which he hoped would not be dis- 
agreeable to me. 

1 knew this must be the young woman who was 
his mother's servant, for there was no other Chris- 
tian woman on the island : so 1 began to persuade 
him not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or be- 
cause he found himself in this solitary circumstance. 
1 represented to him that he had sotuc considerable 
substance in riie world, and good friends, as I un- 
derstood by himself, and the maid also j that the 
3 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 163 

maid was not only poor, and a servant, but was un- 
equal to him, she being six or seven and twenty 
years old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen ; 
that he might very probably, with my assistance, 
make a remove from this wilderness, and come into 
his own country again : and that then it would be 
a thousand to one but he would repent his choice, 
and the dislike of that circumstance mijiht be dis- 
advantageous to both. I was going to saj' more, 
but he mterrupted, smiling, and told me, with a 
great deal of modesty, that i mistook in my guesses, 
that he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts ; 
and he was very glad to hear that 1 had an intent 
of putting them in a way to see their own country 
again ; and nothing should have put him upon 
staying there, but tliat the voyage I was going was 
so exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry 
him quite out of the reach of all his friends; that 
he had nothing to desire of me, but that I would 
settle him in some little property in the island where 
he was, give him a servant or two, and some few 
necessaries, and he would settle himself here like a 
planter, waiting the good time when, if ever I re- 
turned to England, I would redeem them ; and 
hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I 
came to England : that he would give me some let- 
ters to his friends in London, to let them know how 
good 1 had been to him, and in what part of the 
world, and what circumstance, I had left him in ; 
and he promised me that whenever I redeemed him, 
the plantation, and all the improvements he had 
made upon it, let the value be what it would, should 
be wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered, consi- 
dering his youth, and was the more agreeable to me, 
because he told me positively the match was not for 
liimself. 1 gave him all possible assurances that if 



164 ADVENTURES OF 

I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver his 
letters, and do his business eftectually ; and that he 
might depend 1 should never forget the circum- 
stances I had left him in : but still 1 vi'as impatient 
to know who was the person to be married ; upon 
which he told me it was my Jack of all trades and 
his maid Susan. I was most agreeabl}' surprised 
when he named the match ; for indeed 1 thought 
it very suitable. The character of that man I have 
given already ; and as for the maid, she was a very 
honest, modest, sober, and religious young woman ; 
had a very good share of sense, was agreeable enough 
in her person, spoke very handsomely, and to the 
purpose, always with decency and good manners, 
and neither too backward to speak, when requisite, 
nor impertinently forward, when it was not her 
business; very handy and housewifely, and an ex- 
cellent manager; fit, indeed, to have been governess 
to the whole island, and she knew very well how to 
behave in every respect. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we 
married them the same day ; and as I was father at 
the altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave 
her a portion ; for I appointed her and her husband 
a handsome large space of ground for their planta- 
tion ; and, indeed, this match, and the proposal the 
young gentleman made to give him a small property 
in the island, put me upon parcelling it out amongst 
them, that they might not quarrel afterwards about 
their situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will 
Atkins, who was now grown a sober, gntve, manag- 
ing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceedingly pious 
and religious, and, as far as I may be allowed to 
speak positively in such a case, I verily believe he 
was a true penitent. He divided things so justly, 
and so much to every one's satisfaction, that they 



KOBINSON cncsoE. 165 

only desired one general writing under my hand for 
the whole, which l caused to be drawn up, and signed 
and sealed to them, setting out the bounds and si- 
tuation of every man's plantation, and testifying 
that I gave them thereby severally a right to the 
whole possession and inheritance of the respective 
plantations or farms, with their improvements, to 
them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of the 
island as my own property, and a certain rent for 
every particular plantcition after eleven years, if I, 
or any one from me, or in my name, came to de- 
mand it, producing an attested copy of the same 
w-riting 

As to the government and laws among them, I 
told them I was not capable of giving them better 
rules than they were able to give themselves ; only 
I made them promise me to live in love and good 
neighbourhood with one another ; and so 1 pre- 
pared to leave them. 

One tiling I must not omit, and that is, that be- 
ing now settled in a kind of commonwealth among 
themselves, and having much business in hand, it 
was but odd to have seven and thirty Indians live in 
a nook of the island, independent, and, indeed, un- 
employed : for, excepting the providing themselves 
food, which they had difficulty enough to do, some- 
times they had no manner of business or property 
to manage. I proposed, therefore, to the governor 
Spaniard, that he should go to them, with Friday's 
father, and propose to them to remove, and either 
plant for themselves, or take them into their seve- 
ral families as servants, to be maintained for their 
labour, but without being absolute slaves; for I 
would not admit them to make them slaves by force, 
by any means ; because they had their liberty given 
them by capitulation, as it were articles of surrender, 
which they ought not to break. 



166 ADVENTUUES OF 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and 
came all very cheerful along with him ; so we allot- 
ted them land, and plantations, which three or four 
accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed as 
servants in the several fa:Tiilies we had settled ; and 
' thus my colony was in a manner settled, as follows : 
— The Spaniards possessed my original habitation, 
which was the capital city, and extended their plant- 
ations all along the side of the brook, which made 
the creek that I have so often described, as far as 
my bower ; and as they increased their culture, it 
went always eastward. The English lived in the 
north-east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades 
began, and came on southward and south-west, to- 
wards the back part of the Spaniards ; and every 
plantation had a great addition of land to take in, 
if they found occasion, so that they need not jostle 
one another for want of room. All the east end of 
the island was left uninhabited, that if any of the 
savages should come on shore there only for their 
usual customary barbarities, they might come and 
go ; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb 
them : and no doubt but they were often ashore, 
and went away again, for I never heard that the 
planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more. 

It now came into my thoughts that J had hinted 
to my friend the clergyman that the work of con- 
verting the savages might perhaps be set on foot in 
his absence to his satisfaction, and told him that 
now I thought it was put in a fair way ; for the sa- 
vages being thus divided among the Christians, if 
they would but every one of them do their part with 
those which came under their hands, 1 hoped it 
might have a very good effect. 

lie agreed presently in that, if they did their part. 
But how, says he, shall wv obtain that of them ? 
I told him we would call them all together, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 167 

leave it in charge with them, or go to them, one 
by one, which he thought best : so we divided it, he 
to speak to the Spaniards, who were all papists, 
and I to the English, who were all protestants ; and 
we recommended it earnestly to them, and made 
them promise that the}^ would never make any dis- 
tinction of papist or protestant in their exhorting 
the savages to turn Christians, but teach them the 
general knowledge of the true God, and of their Sa- 
viour Jesus Christ ; and they likewise promised us 
that they would never have any differences or dis- 
putes one with another about religion. 

When I came to Will Atkins's house (T may call it 
so, for such a house, or such a piece of basket-work, 
I believe, was not standing in the world again), thei'e 
I found the young woman I have mentioned above, 
and W^ill Atkins's wife, were become intimates ; and 
this prudent, religious young wpman, had perfected 
the work Will Atkins had begun ; and though it was 
not above four days after what I have related, yet 
the new-baptised savage woman was made such a 
Christian as I have seldom heard of in all my obser- 
vation or conversation in the world. 

It came next into my mind, in the morning be- 
fore I went to them, that amongst all the needful 
things I had to leave with them, 1 had not left them 
a Bible, in which I showed myself less considering 
for them than my good friend the widow was for 
me, when she sent me the cargo of a hundred 
pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up thi-ee 
Bibles and a prayer-book. However, the good wo- 
man's charity had a greater extent than ever she 
imagined, for they were reserved for the comfort 
and instruction of those that made much better use 
of them than I had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when 
I came to Will Atkins's tent, or house, and found 



168 ADVENTURES OF 

the young woman and Atkins's baptised wife liad 
been discoursing of religion together, for Will At- 
kins told it me with a great d>^il of joy, 1 asked if 
they were together now, and he said yes ; so 1 went 
into the house, and he with nie, and we found them 
together very earnest in discourse. O, sir, says 
Will Atkins, when God lias sinners to reconcile to 
himself, and aliens to bring home, he never wants a 
messenger ; my wife has got a new instructor : I 
knew 1 was as unworthy as I was incapable of that 
work ; that young woman has been sent hither from 
heaven ; she is enough to convert a whole island of 
savages. The young woman blushed, and rose up 
to go away, but 1 desired her to sit still ; I told her 
she had a good work upon her hands, and i hoped 
God would bless her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they 
had any book among them, though 1 did not ask : 
but I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled out 
my Bible ; Here, says I to Atkins, 1 have brought 
you an assistant that perhaps you had not before. 
The man was so confounded that he was not able 
to speak for some time -, but recovering himself, he 
takes it with both his hands, and turning to his wife, 
Here, my dear, says he, did not 1 tell you our God, 
though lie lives above, could hear what we said ? 
Here's the book I prayed for when you and I kneel- 
ed down under the bush ; now God has heard us, 
and sent it. When he had said so, the man fell 
into such transports of passionate joy, that between 
the joy of having it, and giving God thanks for it, 
the tears ran down his face like a child that was 
crying. 

The woman was surprised, and was like to have 
run into a mistake that none of us were awart of, for 
she firmly believed God had sent the book upon her 
husband's petition. It is true, that providentially it 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 169 

was so, and might be taken so in a consequent 
sense ; but I believe it would have been no difficult 
matter, at that time, to have persuaded the poor 
woman to have believed that an express messenger 
came from heaven on purpose to bring that indivi- 
dual book ; but it was too serious a matter to suf- 
fer any delusion to take place ; so I turned to the 
young woman, and told her vve did not desire to 
impose upon the new convert, in her first and more 
ignorant understanding of things, and begged her 
to explain to her that God may be very properly 
said to answer our petitions, when, m the course of 
his providence, such things are in a particular man- 
ner brought to pass as we petitioned for ; but we 
did not expect returns from Heaven in a miraculous 
and particular manner, and it is our mercy that it 
is not so. 

This the young woman did afterwards effectually, 
so that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used 
here ; and I should have thought it one of the most 
unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so. 
But the surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is really 
not to be expressed ; and there, we may be sure, 
was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more 
thankful in the world for any thing of its kind than 
he was for the Bible ; nor, I believe, never any man 
was glad of a Bible from a better principle ; and 
though he had been a most profligate creature, 
headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, yet 
this man is a standing rule to us all for the weljl in- 
structing children, viz. that parents should never 
give over to teach and instruct, nor ever despair of 
the success of their endeavours, let the children be 
ever so refractory, or, to appearance, insensible of 
instruction ; for, if ever God, in his providence, 
touches the conscience of such, the force of their 
education returns upon them, and the early instruc- 

Q 



170 ADVENTURES OF 

tion of parents is not lost, tliough it may have been 
many years laid asleep, hut, some tie.ie or other, 
they may find the benefit of it. Thus it was witli 
this })oor man, however ignorant he was of religion 
and Christian knowledge, he found he had some 
to do with now more ignorant than himself, and 
that the least part of the instruetion of his good 
father that now came to his mind was of use to 
him. 

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how 
his father used to insist so much on the inexpressi- 
ble value of the Bible, the privilege and blessing of 
it to nations, families, and persons ; but he never 
entertained the least notion of the worth of it till 
now, when being to talk to heathens, savages, and 
barbarians, he wanted the help of the written oracle 
for his assistance. 

The young woman was glad of it also for the pre- 
sent occasion, though she had one, and so had the 
youth, on board our ship, among their goods, which 
were not yet brought on shore. And now having 
said so many things of this young woman, I cannot 
omit telling one story more of her and myself, 
which has something in it very informing and re- 
markable. 

1 have related to what extremity the poor young 
woman was reduced, how her mistress was starved 
to death, and died on board that unhappy ship we 
met at sea, and how the whole ship's company was 
reduced to the last extremity. The gentlewoman 
and her son, and this maid, were first hardly used, 
as to provisions, and at last totally neglected and 
starved ; that is to say, brought to the last extre- 
mity of hunger. — One day, being discoursing with 
her on the e.xtremitics they suffered, 1 asked her if 
she could describe by what she had felt, what it 
was to starve, and how it appeared ? She told me 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. lYl 

she believed she cuukl, and she told her tale very 
distinctly, thus : 

First, sir, said she, we had for some days fared 
exceding hard, and suffered very great hunger : 
but at last we were wholly without food of any 
kind, except sugar, and a little wine and water. 
The first day, after I had received no food at all, I 
found myself, towards evening, first empty and sick 
at the stomach, and nearer night much inclined to 
yawning and sleep. I laid down on a couch in the 
great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, 
■ and awaked a little refreshed, having taken a glass 
of wine when I lay down : after bemg about three 
hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the 
morning, I found myself empty, and my stomach 
sickish, and lay down again, but could nut sleep at 
all, being very faint and ill ; and thus I continued 
all the second day, with a strange variety, first 
hungry, then sick again, with reachings to vomit. 
The second night, being obliged to go to bed again 
without any food, more than a draught of fresh 
water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barba- 
does, and that the mai-ket was mightily stocked 
with provisions ; that I bought some for my mis- 
tress, and went and dined very heartily. I thought 
my stomach was as full after this as it would have 
been after a good dinner ; but when I awaked, I 
was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find myself in 
the extremity of famine. The last glass of wine we 
had I drank, and put sugar in it, because of its 
having some spirit to supply nourishment ; but 
there being no substance in the stomach for the di- 
gesting office to work upon, I found the only effect 
of the wine was, to raise disagreeable fumes from 
the stomach into the head ; and I lay, as they told 
me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some 

a 2 



172 ADVEN'TUKES OF 

time. The third day, in the morning, after a night 
of strange, confused, and inconsistent dreams, and 
rather dozing than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and 
furious with hunger ; and 1 question, had not my 
understanding returned and conquered it, whether, if 
1 had been a mother, and had had a little child with 
me, its life would have been safe or not This lasted 
about three hours ; during which time I was t\vice 
raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my young 
master told me, and as he can now inform you. 

In one of these tits of lunacy or distraction I fell 
down, and struck my face against the corner of a 
pallet bed, in which my mistress lay, and, with the 
blow, tiie blood gushed out of my nose ; and the 
cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, I sat down and 
bL^d into it a great deal; and as the blood came 
from me, 1 came to myself, and the violence of the 
flame or fever I was in abated, and so did the ra- 
venous part of the hunger. Then I grew sick, and 
reached to vomit, but could not, for I had nothing 
in my stomach to bring up. After 1 had bled some 
time, I swooned, and they all believed I was dead ; 
but r came to myself soon after, and then had a 
most dreadful pain in my stomach, not to be de- 
scribed, not like the cholic, but a knawing, eager 
pain foi- food ; and towards the night it went off, 
with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for food, 
something like, as I suppose, the longing of a woman 
wich child. I took another draught of water, with 
sugar in it; but my stomach loathed the sugar, and 
brought it all up again : then 1 took a draught of 
water without sugar, and that staid with me ; and 
I laid me down upon the bed, praying most heartily 
that it would please God to take me away; and com- 
posing Hiy iiiind in hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, 
and then waking, thought myself dying, being light 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 173 

with vapours from an empty stomach ; I recom- 
mended my soul then to God, and earnestly wished 
that somebody would throw me into the sea. 

All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I 
thought, expiring," but bore it with much more pa- 
tience than I ; gave the last bit of bread she had 
left to her child, my young master, who would not 
have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it : and 1 
believe it saved his life. 

Towards the morning I slept again ; and when I 
awoke, I fell into a violent passion of crying, and 
after that had a second fit of violent hunger : I got 
vip ravenous, and in a most dreadful condition: had 
my mistress been dead, as much as I loved her, I am 
certain I should have eaten a piece of her flesh with 
as much relish, and as unconcerned, as ever I did 
eat the flesh of any creature appointed for food; and 
once or twice I was going to bite my own arm : at 
last I saw the basin in which was the blood I had 
bled at my nose the day before ; I ran to it, and 
swallowed it with such haste, and such a greedy ap- 
petite, as if I wondered nobody had taken it before, 
and afraid it should be taken from me now. After 
it was down, though the thoughts of it filled me 
with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger, and I 
took another draught of water, and was composed 
and refreshed for some hours after. This was the 
fourth day ; and thus I held it till towards night ; 
when, within the compass of three hours, I had all 
the several circumstances over again, one after 
another, viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in 
the stomach, then ravenous again ; then sick, then 
lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so 
every quarter of an hour ; and my strength wasted 
exceedingly : at night I laid me down, having no 
comfort but in the hope that I should die before 
morning. 

q3 



174< ADVENTURES OF 

All this night I had no sleep ; but the liunger was 
now turned into a disease ; and I had a terrible 
cholic and griping, by wind, instead of food, having 
found its way into the bowels ; and in this condition 
I lay till morning, when I was surprised with the 
ci-ies and lamentations of my young master, who 
called out to me that his mother was dead ; I lifted 
myself up a little, for 1 had not strength to rise, but 
found she was not dead, though she was able to give 
very little signs of life. 

1 had then such convulsions in my stomach, for 
want of some sustenance, that I cannot describe ; 
with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite, 
that nothing but the tortures of death can injitate ; 
and in this condition I was when I heard the seamen 
above cry out, A sail ! a sail ! and hollo and jump 
about as if they were distracted. 

I was not able to get off from the bed, and my 
mistress much less ; and my young master was so 
sick, that J thought he had been expiring ; so we 
could not open the cabin door, or get any account 
what it was that occasioned such confusion ; nor had 
we any conversation with the ship's company for two 
days, they having told us that they had not a mouth- 
ful of any thing to eat in the ship ; and they told 
us afterwards, they thought we had been dead. It 
was this dreadful condition we were in when you 
were sent to save our lives; and how you found us, 
sir, you know as well as I, and better too. 

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct 
account of starving to death, as, 1 confess, I never 
met with, and was exceeding entertaining to me. 
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, 
because the youth gave me an account of a good 
part of it; though, I must own, not so distinct and 
so feeling as the maid; and the rather, because it 
seems liis mother fed him at the price of her own 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 175 

life ; but the poor maid, though her constitution 
being stronger than that of her mistress, who was in 
years, and a weakly woman too, she might struggle 
harder with it ; I say, the poor maid might be sup- 
posed to feel the extremity something sooner than 
her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last 
bit something longer than she parted with any to 
relieve the maid. JSIo question, as the case is here 
related, if our ship, or some other, had not so pro- 
videntially met them, a few days more would have 
ended all their lives, unless they had prevented it by 
eating one another ; and that even, as their case 
stood, would have served them but a little while, 
they being five hundred leagues from any land, or 
any possibility of relief, other than in the miracu- 
lous manner it happened: but this is by the way; 
I return to my disposition of things among the 
people. 

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many 
reasons I did not think fit to let them know any 
thing of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought 
of setting up among them ; for I found, at least at 
my first coming, such seeds of divisions among them, 
that I saw plainly, had I set up the sloop, and l.ft 
it among them, they would, upon every light dis- 
gust, have separated, and gone away from one 
another, or perhaps have turned pir-rites, and so 
made the island a den of thieves, instead of a planta- 
tion of sober and religious people, as 1 intended it : 
nor did I leave the two pieces of brass caunon that 
I had on board; or the two quarter- leck guns ihat 
my nephew took extraordinary, fur the sa.nj reason: 
I thought it was enough to quaiiiy them for a de- 
fensive war against any that should invade them, 
but not to set th m u^ for an oifcnsivu wai-; or to 
go abroad to attack others ; which, in the end, 
would only bring ruin and destruction upon them : 



176 ADVENTURES OF 

I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns, for 
their service another way, as I shall observe in its 
place. 

Having novs^ done with the island, I left them all 
in good circumstances and in a flourishing condition, 
and went on board my ship again the 6th of May, 
having been about twenty-five days among them ; 
and as they were all resolved to stay upon the island 
till I came to remove them, I promised to send them 
farther relief from the Brazils, if I could possibly 
find an opt)ortunity : and, particularly, I promised 
to send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs, and 
cows ; as to the two cows and calves which I brought 
from England, we had been obliged, by the length 
of our voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of hay 
to feed them. 

The next day, giving them a salute of five guns 
at parting, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All 
Saints, in the Brazils, in about twenty-two days, 
meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this : 
that about three days after we had sailed, being be- 
calmed, and the current setting strong to tlie E.N. E. 
running, as it were, into a bay or gulf on the land 
side, we were driven something out of our course, 
and once or twice our nien cried out, Land to the 
eastward; but whetlier it was the continent or islands 
we could not tell by any means. But the third day, 
towards evening, the sea smooth, and the weather 
calm, "we saw the sea, as it were, covered towards 
the land with something very black ; not being able 
to discover what it was, till after some time, our 
chief mate going up the main-shrouds a little way, 
and looking at them with a perspective, cried out it 
was an army. I could not imagine what he meant by 
an army, and thwarted him a little hastily. Nay, sir, 
says he, don't be angry, ibr 'tis an army, and a fleet 
too ;'for 1 bt'lieve there are a thousand canoes, and 
5 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 177 

you may see them paddle along, for they are com- 
ing towards us apace. 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was 
my nephew the captain ; for he had heard such ter- 
rible stories of them in the iduid, and having never 
been in those seas before, that hu- could not tell what 
to think of it, but said, two or three times, we 
should all be devoured. I must confess, consider- 
ing we were becalmed, and the current set strong 
towards the shore, 1 liked it the worse ; however, I 
bade them not be afraid, but brinjr the ship to an 
anchor as soon as we came so near as to know that 
we must engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on 
apace towards us ; so I gave order ro come to an 
anchor, and furl all our sails : as for thu savages, I 
told them tliey had notliing to fear but fire, and 
therefore they should get their boats out, and fasten 
them, one close by the head, and the other by the 
stern, and man them both well, and waic the issue 
in that posture : this 1 did, that the men in the 
boats might be ready with sheets and buckets to put 
out any fire these savages would endeavour to fix 
to the outside of the ship. 

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little 
while they came up with us ; but never was such a 
horrid sight seen by Christians: though my mate 
was much mistaken in liis calculation of their num- 
ber, yet when they came up we reckoned about a 
hundred and twenty-six ; some of them l.aJ sixteen 
or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the 
least six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be 
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a Sight 
w hich doubtless they had never seen before ; nor 
could they, at first, as we afterwards understood, 
know what to make of us ; they came boldly up, 



178 ADVENTURES OF 

however, very near to us, and seemed to go about to 
row round us ; but we called to our men in the 
boats not to let them come too near them. This 
very order brought us to an engagement with tliem, 
■ vithout our designing it ; for five or six of the large 
canoes came so near our long-boat that our men 
beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which 
they understood very well, and went back, but at 
their retreat about fifty arrows came on board us 
frofTi those boats, and one of our men in the long- 
boat was very much wounded. However, I called 
to them not to fire by any means ; but we handed 
down some deal-boards into the boat, and the car- 
penter presently set up a kind offence, like waste 
boards, to cover them from the arrows of the sa- 
vages, if they should shoot again. 

About half an hour afterwards they all came up 
in a body astern of us, and so near, as that we could 
easily discern what they were, though we could not 
tell their design ; and I easily found they were some 
of my old friends, the same sort of savages that I 
had been used to engage with ; and in a short time 
more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they 
came directly broadside with us, and then rowed down 
straight upon us, till they came so near that they 
could hear us speak : upon this 1 ordered all my men 
to keep close, lest they should shoot anymore arrows, 
and made all our guns ready ; but being so near as 
to be within hearing, 1 made Friday go out upon 
the deck, and call out aloud to them in his lan- 
guage, to know what they meant ; which accord- 
ingly he did. Whether they understood him or not, 
that T knew not ; but as soon as he had called to 
them, six of them, who were in the foremost or 
nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from us, and 
stooping down, showed us their nuked backsides, 
just as if, in English, saving your presence, they had 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 179 

bid us kiss : whether this was a defiance or 

challenge we knew not, or whether it was done iu 
mere contempt, or as a signal to the rest ; but im- 
mediately Friday cried out they were going to shoot, 
and, unhappily tor him, poor fellow, they let fly 
about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my in- 
expressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man 
being in their sight. The poor fellow was shot with 
no less than three arrows, and about three more fell 
very near him ; such unlucky marksmen they were ! 

I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty ser- 
vant and companion, that 1 immediately ordered 
five guns to be loaded with small-shot, and four 
with great, and gave them such a broadside as they 
had never heard in their lives before, to be sure. 
They were not above half a cable length off when 
we tired ; and our gunners took their aim so well 
that three or four of their canoes were overset, as 
we had reason to believe, by one shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare back- 
sides to us gave us no great offence ; neither did I 
know for certain whether that which would pass 
for the greatest contempt among us might be un- 
derstood so by them or not ; therefore, in return, I 
had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at 
them with powder only, which I knew would frighten 
them sufficiently ; but when they shot at us directly, 
with all the fury they v.'ere capable of, and espe- 
cially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom I 
so entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, so 
well deserved it, I thought myself not only justifi- 
able before God and man, but would have been very 
glad if I could have overset every canoe there, and 
drowned every one of them. 

I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how 
many we wounded, at tliis broadside, but sure such 
a fright and hurry never was seen among such a 



180 ADVENTURES OF 

multitude ; there were thirteen or fourteen of their 
canoes split and overset in all, and the men all set 
a-svvimniing: the rest, frightened out of their wits, 
scoured away as fast as they could, taking but httle 
care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled 
with our shot ; so T suppose that many of them were 
lost; and our men took up one poor fellow swimming 
for his life, above an hour after they M'ere all gone. 

The sn)all-shot from our cannon must needs kill 
and wound a great many ; but, ^ short, we never 
knew any thing how it went with them, for they 
fled so flist, that in three hours, or tiiereabouts, we 
could not see hbovo three or four straggling canoes, 
nor did vt e ever see the rest any more ; for a breeze 
of wind sp.inging up the same evening, we weighed, 
and set sail ior the Brazils. 

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was 
so sullen that he would neither eat nor speak, and 
we all fancied he would starve himself to death : but 
I took a way to cure him; for 1 made them take 
him and turn him into the long-boat, and make him 
believe they would toss him into the sea again, and 
so leave him where they found him, if he would 
not speak : nor would that do, but they really did 
throw him into the sea, and came away from him ; 
and tl>en he followed ihem, for he swam like a 
cork, and called to them, in his tongue, though 
they knew not one word of what he said : however, 
at Uist they took him in again, and then he began 
to be more tractable ; nor did I ever design they 
should drown him. 

We were now under sail again; but I was the 
nio^t disconsolate creature alive for want of my man 
F'-'.day, and would have been very glad to have gone 
b'-'ck to the island to have taken one of the rest from 
thence for my occasion ; but it could not be ; so we 
nent on. We had one prisoner, as I have said, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 181 

it was a long time before we could make him un- 
derstand any thing ; but, in time, our men taught 
him some EngHsh, and lie began to be a little trac- 
table. Afterwards, we inquired what country he 
came from, but could make nothing of what he 
said ; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, and 
he spoke in the throat in such a hollow, odd man- 
ner, that we could never form a word after him; 
and we were all of opinion that they might speak 
that language as well if they v/er3 gagged as other- 
wise ; nor could we perceive that they had any oc- 
casion either for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but 
formed tlieir words just as a hunting-horn forms a 
tune, with an open throat. He told us, however, 
some time after, whon we had taught him to speak 
a little English, that they were gomg with their 
kings to light a great battle. When he jaid kings, 
we asked hnn how nuiay kings ? He said they were 
five nation, (we could not make him understand the 
plural s), and that they ill joined to go against two 
nation. We asked him what made tiiem come up 
to us ? He said, -' To makee te great wonder look." 
Here it is to be observed, that all those natives, as 
also those of Africa, when they learn English, 
always add two ^'s at the end of the words whtre 
we use one ; and they place the accent upon them, 
as makee, takee, and the like ; and we could not 
break them of it ; nay, 1 could hardly make Friday 
leave it off, though at last he did 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I 
must take my last leave of him : Poor honest Fri- 
day ! We buried him with all the decency and so- 
lemnity possible, by putting him into a coifin, and 
throwing him into the sea ; and I caused them to 
fire eleven guns for him : and so ended the life of 
the most grateful, faithful, honest, and most affec- 
tionate servant, that ever riian had.

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil ; 
and in about twelve days' time we made land, in the 
latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the 
north-easterniost land of all that part of America. 
We kept on S.by E.in sight of the shore four days, 
when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three 
days came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints, 
the old place of my deliverance, from whence came 
both my good and evil fate. 

Never ship came to this port that had less busi- 
ness than I had, and yet it was with great difficulty 
that we were admitted to hold the leaat correspond- 
ence on shore : not my partner himself, who was 
alive, and made a great figure among them, not my 
two merchant-trustees, not the fame of my wonder- 
ful preservation in the island, could obtain me that 
favor; but my partner remembering that I had 
given five hundred moidores to the prior of the 
monastery of the Augustines, and two hundred and 
seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery, 
and obliged the prior that then was, to go to the 
governor, and get leave for me personally, with the 
captain and one more, besides eight seamen, to 
come on shore, and no more ; and this upon con- 
dition absolutely capitulated for, that we should 
not offer to land any goods out of the ship, or to 
carry any person away without licence. They were 
so strict with us as to landing any goods, that it 
was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore three 
bales of English goods, such as fine broad-cloths, 
stufis, and some linen, which I had brought for a 
present to my partner. 

He was a very generous, open-hearted man ; 
though, like me, he came from little at first : and 
though he knew not that I had the least design of 
giving him any thiiig, he sent me on board a pre- 
sent of frcbh provisions, v ine, and sweetmeats, worth 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 183 

above thirty moidores, including some tobacco, and 
three or tour fine medals of gold : but I was even 
with him in my present, which, as I have said, con- 
sisted of fine broad-cloth, English stuffs, lace, and 
fine hollands ; also I delivered him about the value 
of one hundred pounds sterling, in the same goods, 
for other uses; and I obliged him to set up the 
sloop, which I had brought with me from England, 
as I have said, for the use of my colony, in order to 
send the refreshments I intended to my plantation. 

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop 
in a very few days, for she was already framed; and 
I gave the master of her such instructions as that 
he could not miss the place ; nor did he miss them, 
as I had an account from my partner afterwards. I 
got him soon loaded with the small cargo I sent 
them ; and one of our seamen, that had been on 
shore with me there, offered to go with the sloop 
and settle there, upon my letter to the governor 
Spaniard to allot him a sufficient quantity of land 
for a plantation, and giving him some clothes and 
tools for his planting-work, which he said he un- 
derstood, having been an old planter at Maryland, 
and a buccaneer into the bargain. I encouraged the 
fellow, by granting all he desired ; and, as in con- 
dition, I gave him the savage whom we had taken 
prisoner of war to be his slave, and ordered the go- 
vernor Spaniard to give him his share of every thing 
he wanted with the rest. 

When we came to fit this man out, my old part- 
ner told me there was a certain very honest fellow, 
a Brazil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen 
into the displeasure of the church. I know not 
what the matter is with him, says he, but on my 
conscience I think he is a heretic in his heart, and 
he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of 
the Inquisition ; that he would be very glad of such 

r2 



IS'l ADVENTURES OF 

an opportunity to make his escape, with his wife 
and two dauiihtcrs; and if I would let them co to 
my isiiuui, and allot them a piantation, he would 
give ih^m a small stork to btgin with; for the offi- 
cers of the Inqui^ilLion had seized ail his effects and 
estati!; and he had nothing left but a little house- 
hoid ^tuff', and two slaves : and, adds he, though I 
liate his principles, yet 1 would not have him fall 
into their hands, for he will be assuredly burned 
alive if he does. 

1 granted this presently, and joined my English- 
man with them ; and we concealed the man, and 
his wife and daughters, on board our ship, till the 
sloop put out to go to sea • and then having put all 
thtir goods on board some time before, we put them 
on board the sloop after she was got out of the bay. 

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new 
partner; and their stocks, indeed, were much alike 
rich in tools, in preparations, and a farm ; but no- 
thing to begin with, except as above : liowever, 
they carried over with them, which was worth all 
the rest, some materials for planting sugar-canes, 
with some plants of canes, which he, I mean the 
Portugal man, understood very well. 

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants 
in the island, 1 sent them by the sloop three milch 
cows and five calves, about twenty-two hogs among 
them, three sows big with pig, two mares, and a 
stone-horse. For my Spaniards, according to my 
promise, I engaged three Portugal women to go, 
and recommended it to them to marry them, and 
use them kindly. I could have procured more wo- 
men, but 1 remembered that the poor prosecuted 
man had two daughters, and that there were but 
five of the Spaniards that wanted; the rest had 
wives of their own, though in another country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may ea- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 18.5 

sily suppose, was very welcome to my old inhabit- 
ants, who were now, with this addition, between 
sixty and seventy people, besides little children, of 
which there were a great many. I found letters at 
London from them all, by way of Lisbon, when I 
came back to England, of which 1 shall also take 
some notice immediately. 

I have now done with the island, and all manner 
of discourse about it ; and whoever reads the rest of 
my memorandums would do well to turn his thoughts 
entirely from it, and expect to read of the follies of 
an old man, not warned by his own harms, much 
less by those of other men, to beware of the like ; 
not cooled by almost forty years" miseries and dis- 
appointments ; not satisfied with prosperity beyond 
expectation, nor made cautious by afflictions and 
distress beyond imitation. 

I had no more business to go to the East Indies 
than a man at full liberty has to go to the turnkey 
at Newgate, and desire him to lock him up among 
the prisoners there, and starve him. Had I taken 
a small vessel from England, and gone directly to 
the island ; had I loaded her, as I did the other 
vessel, with all the necessaries for the plantation, 
and for my people ; taken a patent from the govern- 
ment here to have secured my property, in subjec- 
tion only to that of England; had I carried over can- 
non and ammunition, servants, and people to plant, 
and taken possession of the place, fortified and 
strengthened it in the name of England, and in- 
creased it with people, as I might easily have done ; 
had I then settled myself there, and sent the ship 
back laden with good rice, as I might also have done 
in six months' time, and ordered my friends to have 
fitted her out again for our supply ; had I done this, 
and staid there myself, I had at least acted like a 
man of common sense : but I was possessed with a 

r3 



186 ADVENTURES OF 

wandering spirit, and scorned all advantages : I 
pleased niyself with being the patron of the people 
I placed there, and doing for them in a kind of 
haughty, majestic way, like an old patriarchal mo- 
narch, providing for them as if I had been father 
of the whole family, as well as of the plantation : 
but I never so much as pretended to plant in the 
name of any government or nation, or to acknow- 
ledge any prince, or to call my people subjects to 
any one nation more than another : nay, I never so 
much as gave the place a name, but left it, as I 
i'ound it, belonging to nobody, and the people under 
no discipline or government but my own ; who, 
thouiih 1 had influence over them as a father and 
benefactor, had no authority or power to act or 
conunand one way or other, farther than voluntary 
consent moved them to comply : yet even this, had 
I staid there, would have done well enough ; but 
as I rambled from them, and came there no more, 
the last letters I had from any of them were by my 
partner's means, who afterwards sent another sloop 
to the place, and who sent me word, though I had 
not the letter till I got to London, several years 
after it was written, that they went on but poorly, 
were malcontent with their long stay there ; thiit 
"Will Atkins was dead ; that five of the Spaniards 
ivere come away ; and though they had not been 
much molested by the savages, yet they had some 
skirmishes with them ; and that they begged of him 
to write to me to think of the promise I had made 
to fetch them away, that they might see their coun- 
try again before they died. 

But I was gone a wildgoose chase, indeed ! and 
they that will have any more of me must be content 
to follow me into a new variety of follies, hardships, 
and wild adventures, wherein the justice of Provi- 
dence may be duly observed ; and we may see how 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 187 

easily Heaven can gorge us with our own desires, 
make the strongest of our wishes to be our affliction, 
and punish us most severely with those very things 
which we think it would be our utmost happiness to 
be allowed in Whether I had business or no busi- 
ness, awav I went : it is no time now to enlarge 
upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct, 
but to come to the history ; I was embarked for the 
voyage, and the voyage 1 went. 

I shall only add a word or two concerning my 
honest popish clergyman ; for let their opinion of 
us, and all other heretics in general, as they call us, 
be as uncharitable as it may, I verily believe this 
man was very sincere, and wished the good of all 
men : yet 1 believe he was upon the reserve in 
many of his expressions, to prevent giving me 
offence ; for I scarce heard him once call on the 
blessed Virgin, or mention St. Jago or his guardian 
angel, though so common with the rest of them : 
however, I say, I had not the least doubt of his sin- 
cerity and pious intentions on his own part; and I 
am firmly of opinion, if the rest of the popish mis- 
sionaries were like him, they would strive to visit 
even the poor Tartars and Laplanders, where they 
have nothing to give them, as well as covet to flock 
to India, Persia, China, &c. the most wealthy of 
the heathen countries ; for if they expected to bring 
no gains to their church by it, it may well be ad- 
mired how they came to admit the Chinese Confu- 
cius into the calendar of the Christian saints. But 
this by the bye. 

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious 
priest asked me leave to go thither ; being still, as 
he observed, bound never to finish any voyage he 
began. How happy had it been for me if 1 had gone 
\vlth him ! But it was too late now : all things Hea- 
ven appoints for the best : liad I gone with him, I 



1S8 ADVENTURES OF 

had never had so many things to be thankful for, 
and the reader had never heard of the second part 
of the travels and adventures of Robinson Crusoe ; 
so I must here leave exclaiming at myself, and go 
on with my voyage. From the Brazils we made 
directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of Good 
Hope, and had a tolerable good voyage, our course 
generally south-east, now and then a storm, and 
some contrary winds, but my disasters at sea were 
at an end ; my future rubs and cross events were 
to befall me on shore, that it might appear the 
land was as well prepared to be our scourge as the 
sea. 

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a su- 
))ercargo on board, who was to direct all her mo- 
tions after she arrived at the Cape, only being li- 
mited to a certain number of days for stay, by 
charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to. 
This was none of my business, neither did I meddle 
with it ; my nephew, the captain, and the super- 
cargo, adjusting all those things between them as 
they thought fit. 

We staid at the Cape no longer than was needful 
to take in fresh water, but made the best of our way 
for the coast of Coromandel. We were indeed in- 
formed that a French man of war of fifty guns, and 
two large merchant-ships, were gone for the Indies; 
and as I knew we were at war with France, I had 
some apprehensions of them ; but they went their 
own way, and we heard no more of them. 

I shall not pester the reader with a tedious de- 
scription of places, journals of our voyages, varia- 
tions of the compass, latitudes, trade-winds. &c.; 
it is enough to name the ports and placep which we 
touched at, and what occurred to us upon our pass- 
ing from one to another. We touched first at the 
island of Madagascar, where, though the people are 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 189 

fierce and treacherous, and very well armed with 
lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable 
dexterity, yet we fared very well with them awhile ; 
they treated us very civilly ; and for some trifles 
which we gave them, such as knives, scissars, &c. 
they brought us eleven good fat bullocks of a mid- 
dling size, which we took in, partly for fresh pro- 
visions for our present spending, and the rest to salt 
for the ship's use. 

We were obliged to stay here some time after we 
had furnished ourselves with provisions; and I, who 
was always too curious to look into every nook of 
the world wherever I came, was for going on shore 
as often as I could. It was on the east side of the 
island that we went on shore one evening: and the 
people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came 
thi'onging about us, and stood gazing at us at a 
distance; but as we had traded freely with them, 
and had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in 
no danger ; but when we saw the people, we cut 
three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a 
distance fi'om us ; which, it seems, is a mark in 
that country, not only of a truce and friendship, but 
when it is accepted, the other side sets up three poles 
or boughs, which is a signal that they accept the 
truce too ; but then this is a known condition of 
the truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three 
poles, towards them, nor they to come past your 
three poles, or boughs, towards you ; so that you 
are perfectly secure within the three poles, and all 
the space between your poles and theirs is allowed 
like a market for free converse, traffic, and com- 
merce. When you go there, you must not carry 
your weapons with you: and if they come into that 
space, they stick up their javelins and lances all at 
the first poles, and come on unarmed ; but if any 
violence is offered them, and the truce thereby broken 



190 ADVENTURES OF 

avvay they run to the poles, and lay liofd of their 
M eapons, and the truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening when we went on shore, 
that a greater number of their people came down 
than usual, but all very friendly and civil; and they 
brought several kinds of provisions, for which we 
satisfied them with such toys as we had; their wo- 
men also brought us milk and roots, and several 
tilings very acceptable to us, and all was quiet: and 
we made us a little tent or hut of some boughs of 
trees, and lay on shore all night. 

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not 
so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the 
boat riding at an anchor about a stone's cast from 
the land, with two men in her to take care of her, 
I made one of them come on shore ; and getting 
some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, 
I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and 
lay under the cover of the branches of the trees all 
night in the boat. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one 
of our men make a terrible noise on the shore, call- 
ing out, for God's sake, bring the boat in, and 
come and help them, for they were all like to be 
murdered ; at the same time 1 heard the fire of five 
muskets, which was the number of the guns they 
had, and that three times over ; for, it seems, the 
natives here were not so easily frightened with guns 
as the savages were in America, where I had to do 
with them. All this while I knew not what was 
the matter, but rousing immediately from sleep 
with the noise, I caused the boat to be thrust in, 
and resolved with three fusees we had on board, to 
land and assist our men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men 
were in too much haste ; for being come to the 
shore, they plunged into the water, to get to the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 191 

boat with all the expedition they could, being pur- 
sued by between three and four hundred men. Our 
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had 
fusees with them; the rest had pistols and swords, 
indeed, but they were of small use to them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty 
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded ; 
and that which was still worse was, that while we 
stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as 
much danger as they were in on shore; for they 
poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we 
were glad to barricade the side of the boat up with 
the benches, and two or three loose boards, which, 
to our great satisfaction, we had by mere accident 
in the boat. And yet, had it been day-light, they 
are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that if they 
could have seen but the least part of any of us, they 
would have been sure of us. We had, by the light 
of the moon, a little sight of them, as they stood 
pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows; and 
having got ready our fire-arms, we gave them a 
volley, that we could hear, by the cries of some of 
them, had wounded several ; however, they stood 
thus in battle-array on the shore till break of day, 
which we suppose was that they might see the bet- 
ter to take their aim at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how 
to weigh our anchor or set up our sail, because we 
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as 
sure lo hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with 
small shot. We made signals of distress to the ship, 
which though she rode a league off, yet my nephew 
the captain, hearing our firing, and by glasses per- 
ceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired to- 
wards the shore, pretty well understood us; and 
weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the 
shore as he durst with the ship, and then sent an- 



192 ADVENTURES OF 

Other boat, witli ten hands in her, to assist us: but 
we called to them not to come too near, telling them 
what condition we were in ; however they stood in 
near to us, and one of the men taking the end of a 
tow-line in his hand, and keeping one boat between 
him and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly 
see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line 
to the boat; upon which we slipped out a little 
cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us 
out of reach of the arrows ; we all the while lying 
close behind the barricado we had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and 
the shore, that we could lay her side to the shore, 
she run along just by them, and poured in a broad- 
side among them loaded with pieces of iron and 
lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides the great 
shot, which made a terrible havoc among them. 

When we were got on board and out of danger, 
we had time to examine into the occasion of this 
fray ; and, indeed, our supercargo, who had been 
often in those parts, put me upon it ; for he said he 
was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us 
after we had made a truce, if we had not done some- 
thing to provoke them to it. At length it came out 
that an old woman, who had come to sell us some 
milk, had brought it within our i)oles, and a young 
woman with her, who also brought some roots or 
herbs ; and while the old woman (whether she was 
mother to the young woman or no they could not 
tell) was selling us the milk, one of our men otfored 
some rudeness to the wench that was with her, at 
which the old woman made a great noise : however, 
the seaman would not quit his prize, but carried her 
out of the old woman's sight among the trees, it 
being almost dark ; the old woman went away with- 
out her, and, as we may supj)ose, made an outcry 
among the people she came from : who, upon notice, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 193 

raised this great army upon us in three or four 
hours ; and it was great odds but we had all been 
destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at 
him just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied 
out of the tent they had made : the I'est came off 
free, all but the fellow who was the occasion of all 
the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black 
mistress, for we could not hear what became of him 
a great while. We lay upon the shore two days after, 
though the wind presented, and made signals for 
him, and made our boat sail up shore and down 
shore several leagues, but in vain, so we were obliged 
to give him over ; and if he alone had suffered for 
it, the loss had been less. 

1 could not satisfy myself, however, without ven- 
turing on shore once more, to try if 1 could learn 
any thing of him or them ; it was the third night 
after the action that 1 had a great mind to learn, if 
J could by any means, what mischief we had done, 
and how the game stood on the Indians' side. I was 
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be at- 
tacked again ; but I ought, indeed, to have been 
sure that the men I went with had been under my 
command, before I engaged in a thing so hazardous 
and mischievous as I was brought into by it, with- 
out design. 

We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in 
the ship, besides the supercargo and myself, and we 
landed two hours before midnight, at the same place 
where the Indians stood drawn up in the evening 
before : I landed here because my design, as I have 
said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted the field, 
and if they had left any marks behind them of the 
mischief we had done them ; and 1 thought if we 
could surprise one or two of ti)em, perhaps we might 
get our man again, by way of exchange. 

s 



ig-l- AOVENTUUES (JF 

We landed without any noise, and divided our 
men into two bodies, whereof the boatswain cwn- 
manded one, and I the other. We neither saw nor 
heard any body stir when we landed: and we march- 
ed up, one body at a distance from the other, to the 
place ; but at first could see nothing, it being very 
dark; till by and by our boatswain, who led the 
first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. This 
made them halt awhile: for knowing by the circum- 
stances that they were at the place where the Indians 
had stood, they waited for my coming up there. We 
concluded to halt till the moon began to rise, which 
we knew would be in less than an hour, when we 
could easily discern the havoc we had made among 
them. We told thirty-two bodies upon the ground, 
whereof two were not quite dead ; some had an arm, 
and some a leg shot otF, and one his head; those 
that were wounded, we suppose, they had carried 
away. 

When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery 
of all we could come to the knowledge of, I was re- 
solved for going on board ; but the boatswain and 
his party sent me word that they were resolved to 
make a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, 
as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go along 
with them; and if they could find them, as they still 
fancied they should, they did not doubt of getting a 
good booty; and it mignt be they might find Tom 
Jeffry there; that was the man's name we had lost. 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well 
enough what answer to have given them ; for I 
should have commanded them instantly on board, 
knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who 
had a ship, and ship-loading in our charge, and a 
voyage to make which depended very much upon 
the lives of the men ; but as they sent me word they 
were resolved to go, and only asked me and my com- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 195 

pany to go along with them, I positively refused it, 
and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground, in order 
to go to the boat. One or two of the men began 
to importune me to go; and when I refused, began 
to grumble, and say that they were not under my 
command, and they would go. Come, Jack, says one 
of the men, will you go with me? I'll go for one. 
Jack said he would, — and then another, — and, in a 
word, they all left me but one, whom I persuaded to 
stay, and a boy left in the boat. So the supercargo 
and I, with the third man, went back to the boat, 
where we told them we would stay for them, and 
take care to take in as many of them as should be 
left ; for I told them it was a mad thing they were 
going about, and supposed most of them would 
run the fate of Tom Jelfry. 

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant 
it they would come off again, and they would take 
care, &c.; so away they went. I entreated them to 
consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives 
were not their own, and that they were entrusted 
with the voyage, in some measure; that if they mis- 
carried, the ship might be lost for want of their 
help, and that they could not answer for it to God or 
man. But I might as well have talked to the main- 
mast of the ship; they were mad upon their jour- 
ney, only they gave me good words, and begged I 
would not be angry ; that they did not doubt but 
they would be back again in about an hour at far- 
thest ; for the Indian town, they said, was not 
above half a mile off, though they found it above 
two miles before they got to it. 

Well, they all went away ; and though the attempt 
was desperate, and such as none but madmen would 
have gone about, yet to give them their due, they 
went about it as warily as boldly : they were gal- 
lantly armed, for they had every man a fusee or

196 ADVENTURES OF 

musket, a bayonet, and a pistol ; some of them had 
broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and the 
boatswain and two more had pole-axes ; besides all 
which, they had among them thirteen hand-grena- 
does ; bolder fellows, and better provided, never 
went about any wicked work in the world. 

WJien they went out, their chief design was plun- 
der, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold 
there; but a circumstance, which none of them were 
aware of, set them on fire with revenge, and made 
devils of them all. When they came to the few In- 
dian houses which they thought had been the town, 
which was not above half a mile off, they were under 
a great disappointment, for there were not above 
twelve or thirteen houses ; and where the town was, 
or how big, they knew not. They consulted, there- 
fore, what to do, and were some time before they 
could resolve ; for if they fell upon these, they nmst 
cut all their throats, and it was ten to one but some 
of them might escape, it being in the night, though 
the moon was up; and if one escaped, he would run 
and raise all the town, so they should have a whole 
army upon them: again, on the other hand, if they 
went away and left those untouched, for the people 
were all asleep, they could not tell which way to look 
for the town : however, the last was the best advice; 
so they resolved to leave them, and look for the 
town as well as they could. They went on a little 
way and found a cow tied to a tree ; this they pre- 
sently concluded, would be a good guide to them ; 
for, they said, the cow certainly belonged to the 
town before them, or the town behind them ; and if 
they untied her, they should see which way she went; 
if she went back, they had nothing to say to her; 
but, if she went forward, they would follow her: so 
they cut the cord, m Inch was made of twisted fiags, 
and the cow went on before them, directly to the 



ROBINSON cRusor;. 197 

town; which, as they reported, consisted of above 
two hundred houses or huts, and in some of these 
they found several famiHes Hving together. 

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly se- 
cure as sleep could make them : and, first, they called 
another council, to consider what they had to do; 
and, in a word, they resolved to divide themselves 
into three bodies, and so set three houses on fire in 
three parts of the town ; and as the men came out, 
to seize them and bind them (if any resisted, they 
need not be asked what to do then), and so to search 
the rest of the houses for plunder : but they resolved 
to march silently first through the town, and see 
what dimensions it was of, and if they might venture 
upon it or no. 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they 
would venture upon them : but while they were ani- 
mating one another to the work, three of them, who 
were a little before the rest, called out aloud to them, 
and told them that they had found Tom JefFry: they 
all ran up to the place, where they found the poor 
fellow hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat 
cut. There was an Indian house just by the tree, 
where they found sixteen or seventeen of the prin- 
cipal Indians, who had been concerned in the fray 
with us before, and two or three of them wounded 
with our shot ; and our men found they were awake, 
and talking one to another in that house, but knew 
not their number. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so en- 
raged them, as before, that they swore to one an- 
other they would be revenged, and that not an Indian 
that came into their hands should have any quarter ; 
and to work they went immediately, and yet not so 
madly as might be expected from the rage and fury 
they were in. Their first care was to get something 
that would soon take fire, but, after a little search, 

s3 



198 ADVENTURES OF 

they found that would be to no purpose ; for most 
of the houses were low, and thatched with flags and 
rushes, of which the country is full ; so they pre- 
sently made some-wild fire, as we call it, by wetting 
a little powder in the palm of their hands ; and in a 
quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four 
or five places, and particularly that house where the 
Indians were not gone to bed. 

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor 
frightened creatures began to rush out to save their 
lives, but met with their fate in the attempt ; and 
especially at the door, where they drove them back, 
the boatswain himself killing one or two with his 
pole-axe; thehousebeinglarge, andmanyinit,hedid 
not care to go in, but called for a hand-grenado, and 
threw it among them, which at first frightened them, 
but, when it burst, made such havoc among them, 
that they cried out in a hideous manner. In short, 
most of the Indians who were in the open part of 
the house were killed or hurt with the grenado, ex- 
cept two or three more who pressed to the door, 
which the boatswain and two more kept, with their 
bayonets on the muzzles of their pieces, and dis- 
patched all that came in their way : but there was 
another apartment in the house, where the prince or 
king, or whatever he was, and several others were; 
and these were kept in till the house, which was by 
this time all in a light flame, fell in upon them, and 
they were smothered together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because thty 
would not waken the people faster than they could 
niastiT them ; but the fire began to waken them fast 
enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little 
together in bodies ; for the fire grew so raging, all 
the houses being made of light combustible stutt", 
that they could hardly bear the street between them ; 
and their business was to follow the fire, for the surer 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 199 

execution : as fast as the fire either forced the people 
out of those houses which were burning, or frighten- 
ed them out of others, our people were ready at their 
doors to knock them on the head, still calling and 
hollowing one to another to remember Tom Jeffry. 
While this was doing, I must confess I was very 
uneasy, and especially when I saw the flames of the 
town, which, it being night, seemed to be just by me. 
My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men, 
seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing 
what the matter was, or what danger I was in, espe- 
cially hearing the guns too, for by this time they 
began to use their fire-arms ; a thousand thoughts 
oppressed his mind concerning me and the super- 
cargo, what would become of us; and, at last, though 
he could ill spare any more men, yet not knowing 
what exigence we might be in, he takes another 
boat, and with thirteen men and himself comes on 
shore to me. 

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in 
the boat, with no more than two men ; and though 
he was glad that we were well, yet he was in the 
same impatience with us to know what was doing ; 
for the noise continued, and the flame increased ; in 
short, it was next to an impossibility for any man in 
the world to restrain their curiosity to know what 
had happened or their concern for the safety of the 
men : in a word, the captain told me he would go 
and help his men, let what would come. I argued 
•with him, as I did before with the men, the safety of 
the ship, the danger of the voyage, the interest of 
the owners and merchants, &c. and told him I and 
the two men would go, and only see if we could 
at a distance learn what was like to be the event, 
and come back and tell him. It was all one to talk 
to my nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before ; 
he would go, he said ; and he only wished he had 



200 ADVENTURES OF 

left but ten men in the ship ; for he could not think 
of having his men lost for want of help ; he had 
rather lose the ship, the voyage, and his life and all ; 
and away he went. 

I was no more able to stay behind now than I was 
to persuade them not to go ; so, in short, the cap- 
tain ordered two men to row back the pinnace, and 
fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat at an 
anchor ; and that when they came back, six men 
should keep the two boats, and six more come after 
us : so that he left only sixteen men in the ship ; for 
the whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, 
whereof two were lost in the late quarrel which 
brought this mischief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt 
little of the ground we trod on ; and being guided 
by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to 
the place of the flame. If the noise of the guns was 
surprising to us before, the cries of the poor people 
were now quite of another nature, and filled us with 
horror. I must confess I was never at the sacking 
a city, or at the taking a town by storm. 1 had 
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ire- 
land, and killing man, woman, and child; and I had 
read of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdebourg, 
and cutting the throats of twenty-two thousand of 
all sexes ; but I never had an idea of the thing itself 
before, nor is it possible to describe it, or the horror 
that was upon our minds at hearing it. However, 
we went on, and at length came to the town, though 
there was no entering the streets of it for the fire. 
The first object we met with was the ruins of a hut 
or house, or rather the ashes of it, for the house was 
consumed ; and just before it, plain now to be seen 
by the light of the fire, lay four men and three women 
killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in 
the heap among the fire ; in short, there were such 



ROBIJ3SOX CRUSOE, 201 

instances of rage altogether barbarous, and of a fury 
something beyond what was human, that we thought 
it impossible our men could be guilty of it; or if 
they were the authors of it, we thought they ought 
to be every one of them put to the M'orst of deaths. 
But this was not all: we saw the fire increased for- 
ward, and the cry went on just as the fire went on ; 
so that we were in the utmost confusion. We ad- 
vanced a little way farther ; and, behold, to our 
astonishment, three naked women, and crying in a 
most dreadful manner, came Hying as if they had 
wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen men, na- 
tives, in the same terror and consternation, with 
three of our English butchers in the rear ; who 
when they could not overtake them, fired in among 
them, and one that was killed by their shot fell 
down in our sight. "When the rest saw us, believ- 
ing us to be their enemies, and that we would mur- 
der them as well as those that pursued them, they 
set up a most dreadful shriek, especially the women, 
and two of them fell down, as if already dead, with 
the fright. 

My very soyl shrunk within me, and my blood ran 
chili in my veins, when I saw this : and 1 believe, 
had the three English sailors that pursued them 
come on, 1 had made our men kill them all : how- 
ever, we took some ways to let the poor flying crea- 
tures know that we would not hurt them; and im- 
mediately they came up to us, and kneeling down, 
with their hands lifted up, made piteous lamenta- 
tions to us to save them, which we let them know we 
would ; whereupon they crept all together in a hud- 
dle close behind us, as for protection. I left my 
men drawn up together, and charging them to hurt 
nobody, but, if possible, to get at some of our people, 
and see what devil it was possessed them, and what 
they intended to do, and to command them oft"; 
assuring them that if they staid till daylight, they 



202 ADVENTURES OF 

would have a hundred thousand men about their 
ears : I say, I left them, and went among those fly- 
ing people, taking only two of our men with me ; 
and there was indeed a piteous spectacle among 
them ; some of them had their feet terribly burn- 
ed, with trampling and running through the fire, 
others their hands burned ; one of the women had 
fallen down in the fire, and was very much burned 
before she could get out again ; and two or three 
of the men had cuts in their backs and thighs, from 
our men pursuing ; and another was shot through 
the body, and died while I was there. 

I would fain have learned what the occasion of 
all this was, but I could not understand one word 
they said ; though, by signs, I perceived some of 
them knew not what was the occasion themselves. 
I was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous 
attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back 
to my own men, and resolved to go into the middle 
of the town, through the fire, or whatever might 
be in the way, and put an end to it, cost what it 
would : accordingly, as I came back to my men, I 
told them my resolution, and commanded them to 
follow me ; when at the very moment came four 
of our men, with the boatswain at their head, rov- 
ing over heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered 
with blood and dust, as if they wanted more people 
to massacre, when our men hollowed to them as 
loud as they could hollow ; and with much ado one 
of them made them hear, so that they knew who 
we were, and came up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a hol- 
low like a shout of triumph, for having, as he 
thought, more help come ; and without waiting to 
hear me. Captain, says he, noble captain ! 1 am 
glad you are come ; we are not half done yet : vil- 
lanous hell-hound dogs ! I'll kill as many of them as 
poor Tom has hairs upon his head : we have sworn 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 203 

to spare none of them ; we'll root out the very na- 
tion of them from the earth : and thus he ran on, 
out of breath too with action, and would not give 
us leave to speak a word. 

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence 
him a little, Barbarous dog ! said I, what are you 
doing ? I won't have one creature touched more, 
upon pain of death : I charge you, upon your life, 
to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are 
a dead man this minute. — Why, sir, says he, do you 
know what you do, or what they have done ? if you 
want a reason for what we have done, come hi- 
ther ; and with that he showed me the poor fellow 
hanging, with his throat cut. 

1 confess 1 was urged then myself, and at another 
time would have been forward enough : but I 
thought they had carried their rage too far, and re- 
membered Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi 
— " Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce ; and 
their wrath, for it was cruel." But 1 had now a new 
task upon my hands; for when the men I carried 
with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as 
much to do to restrain them as I should have had 
with the others ; nay, my nephew himself fell in 
with them, and told me, in their hearing, that he 
was only concerned for fear of the men being over- 
powered ; and as to the people, he thought not one 
of them ought to live ; for they had all glutted 
themselves with the murder of the poor man, and 
that they ought to be used like murderers ; upon 
these words, away ran eight of my men, with the 
boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody 
work ; and I, seeing it quite out of my power to 
restrain them, came away pensive and sad ; for I 
could not bear the sight, much less the horrible noise 
and cries of the poor wretches that fell into their 
hands. 



204? ADVENTUHES OF 

I got nobody to coine back witli me but the 
supercargo and two men, and with these walked 
back to the boat. It was a very great piece of folly 
in me, I confess, to venture back as it were alone ; 
for as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm 
had run over the country, there stood about forty 
men, armed with lances and bows, at the little place 
where the twelve or thirteen houses stood, mention- 
ed before ; but by accident I missed the place, and 
came directly to the sea-side ; and by the time I got 
to the sea-side it was broad day: immediately I took 
the pinnace and went on board, and sent her back 
to assist the men in what might happen. 

I observed, about the time that I came to the 
boat-side, that the fire was pretty well out, and the 
noise abated ; but in about half an hour after I got 
on board I heard a volley of our men's fire-arms, 
and saw a great smoke : this, as I understood af- 
terwards, was our men falling upon the men who, 
as I said, stood at the few houses on the way, of 
whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all 
the houses on fire, but did not meddle with the wo- 
men or children. 

By the time the men got to the shore again witli 
the pinnace, our men began to appear ; they came 
dropping in, not in two bodies as they went, but 
straggling here and there in such a manner, that 
a small force of resolute men might have cut them 
all ofi". But the dread of them was upon the whole 
country ; and the men were surprised, and so fright- 
ened, that I believe a hundred of them would have 
Hed at the sight of but five of our men; nor in all 
this terrible action was there a man that made any 
considerable defence ; they were so surprised be- 
tween the terror of the fire and the sudden attack 
of our men in the dark, that they knew not which 
way to turn themselves ; for if they fled one way 



ROBINSOX CRUSOE. 205 

they were met by one party ; if back again, by 
another ; so that they were every where knocked 
down : nor did any of our men receive the least 
hurt, except one that sprained his foot, and another 
that had one of his hands burned. 

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, 
and, indeed, with all the men, in my mind, but 
with him in particular, as well for his acting so out 
of his duty, as commander of the ship, and having 
the charge of the voyage upon him, as in his 
prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his 
blind men, in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. 
My nephew answered me very respectfully, but told 
me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman 
whom they had nmrdered in so cruel and barbarous 
a manner, he was not master of himself, neither 
could he govern his passion; he owned he should 
not have done so, as he was commander of the ship ; 
but as he was a man, and nature moved him, he 
could not bear it. As for the rest of the men, they 
were not subject to me at all, and they knew it well 
enough ; so they took no notice of my dislike. 

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any 
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the 
number they had killed ; but according to the best 
of their accounts, put all together, they killed or 
destroyed about one hundred and fifty people, men, 
women, and children, and left not a house standing 
in the town. As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as 
he was quite dead (for his throat was so cut that 
his head was half off), it would do him no service 
to bring him away ; so they only took him down 
from the tree, where he was hanging by one hand. 

However just our men thought this action, I was 
against them in it, and I always, after that time, 
told them God would blast the voyage ; for I look- 
ed upon all the blood they shed that night to be 

T 



206 ADVENTURES Of 

murder in theiu : for though it is true that they 
had killed 'i'oni Jeffry, yet .Icffry was the aggressor, 
had broken the truce, and had violated or debauch- 
ed a young woman of theirs, who came down to 
them innocentl}'^, and on the faith of the public ca- 
pitulation. 

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we 
were afterwards on board. He said it was true that 
we seemed to break the truce, but really had not ; 
and that the war was begun the night before by the 
natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed 
one of our men without any just provocation ; so 
that as we were in a capacity to fight them now, 
we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves jus- 
tice upon them in an extraordinary manner ; that 
though the poor man had taken a little liberty with 
the wench, he ought not to have been murdered, 
and that in such a villanous manner ; and that they 
did nothing but what was just, and what the laws 
of God allowed to be done to nmrderers. 

One would think this should have been enough 
to have warned us against going on shore amongst 
heathens and barbarians : but it is impossible to 
make mankind wise but at their own expense ; and 
their experience seems to be always of most use to 
them when it is dearest bought. 

We were now bound to the gulf of Persia, and 
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to 
touch at ijurat : but the chief of the supercargo's 
design lay at the bay of Bengal ; where if he miss- 
ed his business outward-bound, he was to go 
up to China, and return to the coast as he came 
home. 

The first disaster that befel us was in the gulf 
of Persia, where five of our men venturing on shore 
on the Arabian side of the gulf, were surrounded 
by the Arabians, and either all killed or carried away 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, 207 

into slavery ; the rest of the boat's crew were not 
able to rescue them, and had but just time to get 
off their boat. I began to upbraid them with the 
just retribution of Heaven in this case : but the 
boatswain very warmly told me, he thought I went 
farther in my censures than I could show any war- 
rant for in Scripture ; and referred to Luke xiii. 4. 
where our Saviour intimates that those men on 
whom the tower of Siloam fell were not sinners 
above all the Galileans ; but that which put me to 
silence in the case was, that not one of these five 
men who were now lost were of those who went on 
shore to the massacre of Madagascar, so I always 
called it, though our men could not bear to hear 
the word massacre with any patience. 

But my frequent preaching to them on the sub- 
ject had worse consequences than I expected ; and 
the boatswain, who had been the head of the at- 
tempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me 
he found that I brought that affair continually upon 
the stage ; that I made unjust reflections upon it, 
and had used the men very ill on that account, and 
himself in particular ; that as I was but a passen- 
ger, and had no command in the ship, or concern 
in the voyage, they were not obliged to bear it ; 
that they did not know but I might have some ill 
design in my head, and perhaps to call them to an 
account for it when they came to England ; and 
that, therefore, unless I would resolve to have done 
with it, and also not to concern myself any farther 
with him, or any of his affairs, he would leave the 
ship ; for he did not think it was safe to sail with 
me among them. 

1 heard him patiently enough till he had done, 
and then told him, that 1 confessed I had all along 
opposed the massacre of Madagascar, and that I had, 
on all occasions, spoken my mind freely about it, 

T 2 



208 ADVENTURES OF 

though not more upon him than any of the rest; 
that as to having no coamiand in the ship, that was 
true ; nor did I exercise any authority, only took 
the liberty of speaking my mind in things which 
publicly concerned us all ; and what concern I had 
in the voyage was none of his business ; that I was 
a considerable owner in the ship ; in that claim, I 
conceived I had a right to speak even farther than I 
had done, and would not be accountable to him or 
any one else ; and began to be a little warm with 
him. He made but little reply to me at that time, 
and I thought the affair had been over. We were 
at this time in the road at Bengal ; and being will- 
ing to see the place, 1 went on shore with the su- 
percargo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself; and 
towards evening was preparing to go on board, 
when one of the men came to me, and told me he 
would not have me trouble myself to come down to 
the boat, for they had orders not to carry me on 
board any more. Any one may guess what a sur- 
prise I was in at so insolent a message; and I asked 
the man, who bade him deliver that message to me ? 
He told me, the cockswain. I said no more to the 
fellow, but bade him let them know he had de- 
hvered his message,, and that I had given him no 
answer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, 
and told him the story ; adding, what I presently 
foresaw, that there would be a mutiny in the ship ; 
and entreated him to go immediately on board the 
ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the captain of 
it. liut I might have spared this intelligence, for 
before I had spoken to him on shore the matter was 
effected on board. The boatswain, the gunner, the 
carpenter, and all the inferior officers, as soon as I 
was gone off in the boat, came up, and desired to 
speak with the captain : and there the boatswain, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 209 

making a long harangue, and repeating all he had 
said to me, told the captain, in a few words, that as 
I was now ^one peaceably on shore, they were loath 
to use any violence with me, which, if I had not 
gone on shore, they would otherways have done, 
to oblige me to have gone ; they therefore thought 
fit to tell him, that as they shipped themselves to 
serve in the ship under his command, they would 
perform it well and faithfully ; but if I would not 
quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, 
they would all leave the ship, and sail no farther 
with him; and at that word all, he turned his face 
toward the mainmast, which was, it seems, the sig- 
nal agreed on between them, at which all the sea- 
men, being got together, there cried out. One and 
all ! one and all ! 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and 
of great presence of mind ; and though he was sur- 
prised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told 
them calmly that he would consider of the matter ; 
but that he could do nothing in it till he had spo- 
ken to me about it. He used some arguments with 
them to show them the unreasonableness and injus- 
tice of the thing : but it was all in vain ; they swore, 
and shook hands round before his face, that they 
would all go on shore, unless he would engage to 
them not to suffer me to come any more on board 
the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his 
obligation to me, and did not know how I might 
take it : so he began to talk smartly to them ; told 
them that I was a very considerable owner of the 
ship, and that, in justice, he could not put me out 
of my own house ; that this was next door to serv- 
ing me as the famous pirate Kidd had done, who 
made a mutiny in the ship, set the captain on shore 
on an uninhabited island, and ran away with the 

T 3 



210 ADVENTURES OF 

ship ; that let them go into what ship tlicy would, 
if ever they came to England again it would cost 
them very dear ; that the ship was mine, and that 
he could not put me out of it ; and tliat he would 
rather lose the ship and the voyage too than dis- 
oblige me so much ; so they might do as they pleas- 
ed : however, he would go on shore and talk with 
me, and invited the boatswain to go with him and 
perhaps they might acconnnodate the matter with 
me. But they all rejected the proposal, and said 
they would have nothing to do with me any more; 
and if I came on board, they would all go on shore. 
Well, said the captain, if you are all of this mind, 
let me go on shore and talk with him. So away he 
came to me with this account, a little after the 
message had been brought to mc from the cock- 
swain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess ; 
for I was not without apprehensions that they 
would confine him by violence, set sail, and run 
away with the ship ; and then I had been stripped 
naked in a remote country, having nothing to help 
mj'self ; in short, I luid been in a worse case than 
when I was alone in the island. But they had not 
come that length, it seems, to my satisfaction ; and 
when my nephew told me what they had said to 
him, and how they had sworn and shook hands that 
they would, one and all, leave the ship if I was suf- 
fered to come on board, I told him he should not 
be concerned at it at all, for I would stay onshore : 
I only desired he would take care and send me all 
my necessary things on shore, and leave me a suffi- 
cient sum of money, and I would find my way to 
England as well as 1 could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, 
but there was no way to help it but to comply ; so, 
in short, he went on board the ship again, and sa- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 211 

tisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their 
importunity, and had sent for his goods from on 
board the sliip ; so that the matter was over in a 
few hours, the men returned to their duty and I 
began to consider what course I should steer. 

I was now alone in the most remote part of the 
world, as 1 think I may call it, for I was near three 
thousand leagues by sea farther off from England 
than I was at my island , only, it is true, I might 
travel here by land over the great Mogul's country 
to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, 
up the gulf of Persia, and take the way of the ca- 
ravans, over the Desert of Arabia, to Aleppo and 
Scanderoon ; from thence by sea again to Italy, and 
so over-land into France ; and this put together 
might at least be a full diameter of the globe, or 
more. 

1 had another way before me, which was to wait 
for some English ships, which were coming to Ben- 
gal from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get 
passage on board them for England. But as I came 
hither without any concern with the English East 
India Company, so it would be difficult to go from 
hence without their licence, unless with great favour 
of the captains of the ships, or the Company's fac- 
tors, and to both I was an utter stranger. 

Here I had the mortification to see the ship set 
sail without me ; a treatment I think a man in my 
circumstances scarce ever met with, except when pi- 
rates running away with the ship, and setting those 
that would not agree with their villainy on shore. 
Indeed, this was next door to it, both ways ; how- 
ever, my nephew left me two servants, or rather 
one companion and one servant ; the first was clerk 
to the purser, whom he engaged to go with me, 
and the other was his own servant. I took me also 
a good lodging in the house of an Englishwoman, 



'212 ADVENTURES OF 

where several merchants lodged, some French, two 
Italians, or rather Jews, and one Englishman ; hero 
I was handsomely enough entertained : and that 1 
might not be said to run rashly upon anv thing, I 
staid here above nine months considering what 
course to take, and how to manage myself. I had 
some English goods with me of value, and a con- 
siderable sum of money ; my nephew furnishing me 
with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of cre- 
dit for more, if 1 had occasion, that I might not be 
straitened, whatever might happen. 

I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage, and, 
as I originally intended, I bought here some very 
good diamonds, which, of all other things, were the 
most proper for me, in my present circumstances ; 
because 1 could always carry my whole estate about 
me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made 
for my return to England, but none falling out to 
my mind, the English merchant who lodged with 
me, and whom 1 had contracted an intimate ac- 
quaintance with, came to me one morning. Coun- 
tryman, says he, I have a project to communicate 
to you, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, 
for aught I know, suit with yours also, when you 
shall have thoroughly considered it. Here we are 
posted, you by accident, and I by my own choice, 
in a part of the world very remote from our own 
country ; but it is in a country where, by us who 
understand trade and business, a great deal of mo- 
ney is to be got. If you will puc one thousand 
pounds to my one thousand pounds, we will hire a 
ship here, the first we can get to our minds ; you 
shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and we'll go a 
trading voyage to China : for what should we stand 
still for? Tlie whole world is in a motion, rolling 
round and round; all the creatures of God, hea- 

5 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 213 

venly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent ; 
why should we be idle ? There are no drones in the 
world but men ; why should we be of that number ? 

I liked this proposal very well, and the more be- 
cause it seemed to be expressed with so much good 
will, and in so friendly a manner. I will not say 
but that I might, by my loose unhinged circum- 
stances, be the fitter to embrace a proposal for 
trade, or indeed any thing else ; whereas, otherwise, 
trade was none of my element. However, I might 
perhaps say with some truth, that if trade was not 
my element, rambling was, and no proposal for see- 
ing any part of the world which I had never seen 
before could possibly come amiss to me. 

It was, however, sometime before we could get 
a ship to our minds, and when we had got a vessel, 
it was not easy to get English sailors ; that is to 
say, so many as were necessary to govern the voy- 
age and manage the sailors which we should pick 
up there. After some time we got a mate, a boat- 
swain, and a gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, 
and three foremast-men. With these we found we 
could do well enough, having Indian seamen, such 
as they were, to make up. 

There are so many travellers who have wrote the 
history of their voyages and travels this way, that it 
would be very little diversion to any body to give a 
long account of the places we went to, and the 
people who inhabit there ; these things I leave to 
others, and refer the reader to those journals and 
travels of Englishmen of which many I find are 
published and more promised every day ; it is 
enough for me to tell you that we made this voyage 
to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and from thente 
to Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares for 
opium and some arrack ; the first a commodity 



SH ADVENTURES OF 

which bears a great price among the Chinese, and 
which, at that time, was mucli wanted there. In a 
word, we went up to Suskan, made a very great 
voyage, were eight months out, and returned to 
Bengal ; and I was very well satisfied with my ad- 
venture. I observe that our people in England often 
admire how officers which the Company send into 
India, and the merchants which generallj'stay there, 
get such ver}^ great estates as they do, and sometimes 
come home wortl) sixty or seventy thousand pounds 
at a time ; but it is no wonder, or at least we shall 
see so much farther into it, when we consider the 
innumerable ports and places where they have a free 
commerce, that it will be none; and much less it 
will be so when we consider that at those places and 
ports where the English ships come, there is such 
great and constant demand for the growth of all 
other countries, that there is a certain vent for the 
returns, as well as a market abroad for the goods 
carried out. 

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got 
so much money by my first adventure, and such an 
insight into the method of getting more, that had I 
been twenty years younger, I should havebeen tempt- 
ed to have staid here, and sought no farther for mak- 
ing any fortune ; but what was all this to a man up- 
wards of threescore, that was rich enough, and came 
abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of see- 
ing the w orld than a covetous desire of gaining by 
it ? And, indeed, I think it is with great justice I 
now call it restless desire, for it was so. When I was 
at home, I was restless to go abroad ; and when I 
was abroad, I was restless to be at home. I say, 
what was this gain to me ? I was rich enough al- 
ready, nor had I any uneasy desires about getting 
more money ; and therefore the profit of the voyage 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 215 

to me was of" no great force for the prompting me 
forward to farther undertakings ; hence I tliought 
that by this voyage I had made no progress at all, 
because I was come back, as I might call it, to the 
place from whence I came, as to a home : whereas 
my eye, which, like that which Solomon speaks of, 
was never satisfied with seeing, was still more de- 
sirous of wandering and seeing. I was come into a 
part of the world which I was never in before, and 
that part, in particular, which 1 had heard much of, 
and was resolved to see as much of it as I could ; 
and then I thought I might say I had seen all the 
world that was worth seeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different no- 
tions : I do not name this to insist on my own, for 
I acknowledge his were the most just, and the most 
suited to the end of a merchant's life ; who, when 
he is abroad upon adventures, it is his wisdom to 
stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he is 
like to get the most money by. My new friend 
kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would 
have been content to have gone like a carrier's 
horse, always to the same inn, backward and for- 
ward, provided he could, as he called it, find his 
account in it. On the other hand, mine was the 
notion of a mad rambling boy, that never cares to 
see a thing twice over. But this was not all : I had 
a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home, 
and yet the most unsettled resolution imaginable 
which way to go. In the interval of these consulta- 
tions, my friend, who was always upon the search for 
business, proposed another voyage to me among the 
Spice Islands, and to bring home a loading of cloves 
from the Manillas, or thereabouts ; places, indeed, 
where the Dutch trade, but islands belonging partly 
to the Spaniards ; though we went not so far, but 



^IS ADVENTURES OF 

to some other, where they have not tlic whole power, 
as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. 

We were not long in preparing for this voyage ; 
the chief difficulty was in bringing nie to come into 
it : however, at last, nothing else offering, and find- 
ing that I'eally stirring about and trading, the profit 
being so great, and, as I may say, certani, had more 
pleasure in it, and had more satisfaction to my mind, 
than sitting still, which, to me especially, was the 
unhappiest part of life, J resolved on this voyage 
too, which we made very successfully, touchiiig at 
Borneo, and several islands whose names 1 do not 
remember, and came home in about five nionths. 
We sold our spice, which was chiefly cloves and some 
nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them 
away to the gulf; and making near five of one, 
we really got a great deal of money. 

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled 
at me: Well now, said he, with a sort of agreeable 
insult upon my indolent temper, is not this better 
than walking about here, like a man of nothing to 
do, and spending our time in staring at the non- 
sense and ignorance of the Pagans? — Why, truly, 
says I, my friend, I think it is, and 1 begin to be a 
coiWert to the principles of merchandising ; but I 
must tell you, said I, by the way, you do not know 
what I am doing; for if I once conquer my back- 
wardness, and embark heartily, as old as 1 am 1 shall 
harass you up and down the world till I tire you; 
for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you 
lie still. 

But, to be short with my speculations, a little 
while after this there came in a Dutch ship from Ba- 
tavia ; she was a coaster, not an I'Luropean trader, 
of about two hundred tons burthen ; the men, as 
tliey pretended, having been so sickly, that the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 217 

captain had not hands enough to go to sea with, he 
lay by at Bengal ; and having, it seems, got money 
enough, or being willing, for other reasons, to go 
for Europe, he gave public notice he would sell his 
ship. This came to my ears before my new partner 
heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy it ; so I 
went to him, and told him of it. He considered 
awhile, for he was no rash man neither; but musing 
some time, he replied. She is a little too big ; but, 
however, we will have her. Accordingly, we bought 
the ship, and agreeing with the master, we paid for 
her, and took possession. When we had done so, 
we resolved to entertain the men, if we could, to 
join them with those we had, for the pursuing our 
business; but on a sudden, they having received, not 
their wages, but their share of the money, as we 
afterwards learnt, not one of them was to be found ; 
we enquired much about them, and at length were 
told that they were all gone together by land to 
Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence, and 
from thence to travel to Surat, and go by sea to the 
gulf of Persia. 

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while 
as that I should miss the opportunity of going with 
them; for such a ramble, I thought, and in such 
company as would both have guarded and diverted 
me, would have suited mightily with my great de- 
sign ; and 1 should have both seen the world and 
gone homewards too : but I was much better satis- 
fied a few days after, when I came to know what 
sort of fellows they were ; for, in short, their history 
was, that this man they called captain was the gun- 
ner only, not the commander ; that they had been 
a trading voyage, in which they had been attacked 
on shore by some of the Malays, who had killed the 
captain and three of his men ; and that after the 
captain was killed, these men, eleven in number, 

VOL. XVH. u 



218 ADVENTURES OF 

had resolved to run away with the ship, which they 
did, and brought her to Bengal, leaving the mate 
and five men more on sliore ; of whom hereafter. 

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we 
came honestly by her, as we thought, though we did 
not, I confess, examine into things so exactly as we 
ought; for we never inquired any thing of the sea- 
men, who would certainly have faltered in their ac- 
count, contradicted one another, and perhaps con- 
tradicted themselves; or one how or other we should 
have had reason to have suspected them ; but the 
man showed us a bill of sale for the ship, to one 
Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name, for I 
suppose it was all a forgery, and called himself by 
that name, and we could not contradict him ; and 
withal having no suspicion of the thing, we went 
through with our bargain. 

We picked iip some more English sailors here 
after this, and some Dutch ; and now we resolved 
for a second voyage to the south-east for cloves, &c. 
that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucca 
isles ; and, in short, not to fill up this part of my 
story with trifles, when what is to come is so re- 
markable, I spent, from first to last, six years in this 
country, trading from port to port, backward and 
forward, and with very good success, and was now 
the last year with my new partner, going in the ship 
above mentioned, on a voyage to China, but design- 
ing first to Siam, to buy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged 
to beat up and down a great while in the straits of 
Malacca, and among the islands, we were no sooner 
got clear of those difficult seas than we found our 
ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all 
our industry, to find out where it was. This forced 
us to make some port, and my partner, who knew 
the country better than I did, directed the captain 

5 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

to put into the river of Cambodia; for I had made 
the English mate, one Mr. Thompson, captain, not 
being willing to take the charge of the ship upon 
myself. This river lies on the north side of the great 
bay or gulf which goes up to Siam. While we were 
here, and going often on shore for refreshment, 
there comes to me one day an Englishman, and he 
was, it seems, a gunner's-mate on board an English 
East India ship which rode in the same river, up at 
or near the city of Campodia ; what brought him 
hither we knew not ; but he comes to me, and 
speaking English, Sir, says he, you are a stranger 
to me, and 1 to you, but I have something to tell 
you that very nearly concerns you. 

I looked steadfastly at him a good while, and 
thought at first I had known him, but I did not : If 
it very nearly concerns me, said 1, and not yourself, 
what moves you to tell it to me ? — I am moved, says 
he, by the imminent danger you are in, and, for 
aught I see, you have no knowledge of it. — I know 
no danger I am in, says I, but that my ship is leaky, 
and I cannot find it out ; but I intend to lay her 
aground to-morrow, to see if I can find it. — But, 
sir, says he, leaky or not leaky, find it or not find 
it, you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore 
to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say to 
you : do you know, sir, said he, the town of Cam- 
bodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river ? and 
there are two large English ships about five leagues 
on this side, and three Dutch. — Well, said I, and 
what is that to me ? — Why, sir, said he, is it for a 
man that is upon such adventures as you are, to come 
into a port and not examine first what ships there 
are there, and whether he is able to deal with them? 
I suppose you do not think you are a match for them? 
I was amused very much at his discourse, but not 
amazed at it, fori could not conceive what he meant; 

u2 



220 ADVENTURES OF 

and I turned short upon him, and said, Sir, I wish 
you would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what 
reason I have to be afraid of any of the Company's 
ships, or Dutch ships: lam no interloper; what can 
they have to say to me ? He looked like a man half 
angry and half pleased, and pausmg awhile, but 
smiling, Well, sir, says he, if you think yourself se- 
cure, you must take your chance ; I am sorry your 
fate should blind you against good advice ; but as- 
sure yourself, if you do not j)ut to sea immediately, 
you will the very next tide be attacked by five long- 
boats full of men, and perhaps, if you are taken, you 
will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be 
examined afterwards. 1 thought, sir, added he, I 
should have met with a better reception than this, 
for doing you a piece of service of such importance. 
— I can never be ungrateful, said I, for any service, 
or to any man that offers me any kindness ; but it is 
past my comprehension what they should have such 
a design upon me for : however, since you say there 
is no time to be lost, and that there is some villan- 
ous design on hand against me, I will go on board 
this minute, and put to sea immediately, if my men 
can stop the leak, or if we can swim without stop- 
ping it : but, sir, said I, shall I go away ignorant of 
the cause of all this ? Can you give me no further 
light into it? — I can tell you but part of the story, 
sir, says he ; but I have a Dutch seaman here with 
me, and I believe I could persuade him to tell you 
the rest ; but there is scarce time for it : but the 
short of the story is this, the first part of which, I " 
suppose, you know well enough, viz. that you was 
with this ship at Sumatra ; that there your captain 
was nmrdered by the Malays, with three of his men; 
and that you, or sontc of those that were on board 
with you, ran away with the ship, and are since 
turned pirates. This is the sum of the story, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOF. 221 

you will all be seised as pirates, I can assure you, and 
executed with very little ceremony; for you know 
merchant ships show but little law to pirates, if they 
get them into their power. — Now you speak plain 
English, said I, and I thank you; and though I 
know nothing that we have done like what you talk 
of, for I am sure we came honestly and fairly by the 
ship : yet seeing such a work is doing, as you say, 
and that you seem to mean honestly, I will be upon 
my guard. — Nay, sir, says he, do not talk of being 
upon your guard; the best defence is, to be out of 
the danger ; if you have any regard for your life, 
and the lives of all your men, put to sea, without 
fail, at high water ; and as you have a whole tide 
before you, you will be gone too far out before they 
can come down ; for they will come away at high 
water, and as they have twenty miles to come, you 
will get near two hours of them by the difference of 
the tide, not reckoning the length of the way ; be- 
sides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they will 
not venture to follow you far out to sea, especially 
if it blows. — Well, said I, you have been very kind 
in this ; what shall I do for you to make 3^ou amends? 
— Sir, says he, you may not be willing to make me 
any amends, because you may not be convinced of 
the truth of it : I will make an offer to you ; I have 
nineteen month's pay due to me on board the 
ship * * *, which I came out of England in ; and 
the Dutchman that is with me has seven months' 
pay due to him ; if you will make good our pay to 
us, we will go along with you : if you find nothing 
more in it, we will desire no more ; but if we do 
convince you that we have saved your lives, and 
the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will 
leave the rest to you. 

1 consented to this readily, and went immediately 
on board, and the two men with me. As soon as 

u 3 



222 ADVENTURKS OF 

I came to the ship's side, my partner, who was on 
board, came out on the quarter-deck, and called to 
me, with a great deal of joy, O ho ! O ho ! we have 
stopped the leak ! we have stopped the leak ! — Say 
you so ? said I, thank God ; but weigh anchor then 
immediately. — Weigh! says he: what do you mean 
by that? What is the matter? — Ask no questions, 
said I ; but all hands to work, and weigh without 
losing a minute. He was surprised, but, however, 
he called the captain, and he immediately ordered 
the anchor to be got up ; and though the tide was 
not quite down, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we 
stood out to sea. Then I called him into the cabin, 
and told him the story ; and we called in the men, 
and they told us the rest of it : but as it took up a 
great deal of time, before we had done a seaman 
comes to the cabin-door, and called out to us that 
the captain bade him tell us we were chased. Chased! 
says I ; by what ? — By five sloops, or boats, says 
the fellow, full of men. — Very well, said I ; then it 
is apparent there is something in it. In the next 
place I ordered all our men to be called up, and told 
them there was a design to seize the ship, and to 
take us for pirates, and asked them if they would 
stand by us, and by one another ; the men answered 
cheerfully, one and all, that they would live and die 
with us. Then I asked the captain what way he 
thought best for us to manage a fight with them ; 
for resist them I was resolved we would, and that 
to the last drop. He said readily that the way was 
to keep them off with our great shot as long as we 
could, and then to fire at them with our small arms, 
to keep them from boarding us ; but when neither of 
these would do any longer, we should retire to our 
close quarters ; perhaps they had not materials to 
break open our bulk-heads, or get in upon us. 
The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to 



IIOBINSON CRUSOE. 2^3 

bring two guns to bear fore and aft, out of the 
steerige, to clear the deck, and load them with 
musket-bullets and small pieces of old iron, and 
what came next to hand; and thus we made ready 
for fight : but all this while we kept out to sea, with 
wind enough, and could see the boats at a distance, 
being five large long-boats, following us M'ith all the 
sail they could make. 

Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could 
see w-ere English) out-sailed the rest, were near two 
leagues a-head of them, and gained upon us con- 
siderably, so that we found they would come up 
w ith us ; upon which we fired a gun without ball, 
to intimate that they should bring to : and we put 
out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley ; but they 
came crowding after us, till they came within shot, 
■when we took in our white flag, they having made 
no answer to it, and hung out a red flag, and fired 
at them with a shot. Notwithstanding this, they 
came on till they were near enough to call to them 
with a speaking-trumpet which we had on board ; 
so we called to them, and bade them keep oif, at 
their peril. 

It was all one ; they crowded after us, and en- 
deavoured to come under our stern, so as to board 
us on our quarter ; upon which, seeing they were re- 
solute for mischief, and depended upon the strength 
that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, 
so that they lay upon our broadside ; when imme- 
diately we fired five guns at them, one of which had 
been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of 
the hindermost boat, and bring them to the neces- 
sity of taking down their sail, and running all to 
the head of the boat to keep her from sinking ; so 
she lay by, and had enough of it ; but seeing the 
foremost boat crowd on after us, we made ready to 
fire at her in particular. While this was dohig, one 



224- ADVENTURES OF 

of the three boats tliat was behind, being forwarder 
than the other two, made up to the boat which we 
had disabled, to reHeve her, and we could see her 
take out the men : we called again to the foremost 
boat, and offered a truce, to parley again, and to 
know what her business was with us ; but had no 
answer, only she crowded close under our stern. 
Upon this our gunner, who was a very dexterous 
fellow, run out his two chase-guns, and fired again 
at her, but the shot missing, the men in the boat 
shouted, waved their caps, and came on ; but the 
gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired among 
them a second time, one shot of which, though it 
missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the men, 
and we could easily see had done a great deal of 
mischief among them ; but we took no notice of 
that, wore the ship again, and brought our quarter 
to bear upon them, and firing three guns more, we 
found the boat was almost split to pieces ; in par- 
ticular, a rudder and a piece of her stern was shot 
quite away ; so they handed her sail immediately, 
and were in great disorder. But to complete their 
misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them 
again; where he hit them we could not tell, but 
we found the boat was sinking, and some of the 
men already in the water : upon this I immediately 
manned out our pinnace, which we had kept close 
by our side, with orders to pick up some of the men, 
if they could, and save them from drowning, and 
immediately come on board the ship with them, be- 
cause we saw the rest of the boats began to come 
up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders, 
and took up three men, one of whom was just 
drowning, and it was a good while before we could 
recover him. As soon as they were on board, we 
crowded all the sail we could make, and stood far- 
ther out to sea ; and we found that when the other 



UOBI.VSON CRUSOE. 225 

three boats came up to the first, they gave over their 
chase. 

Beingthus delivered from a danger, which, though 
I knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much 
greater than I apprehended, I resolved that we 
should change our course, and not let any one know 
whither we were going : so we stood out to sea east- 
ward, quite out of the course of all European ships, 
whether they were bound to China or any where else, 
within the commerce of the European nations. 

When we were at sea. we began to consult with 
the two seamen, and inquire what the meaning of 
ail this should be ; and the Dutchman let us into 
the secret at once, telling us that the fellow that sold 
us the ship, as we said, was no more than a thief, 
that had run away with her. Then he told us how 
the captain, whose name too he told us, though I 
do not remember it now, was treacherously mur- 
dered by the natives on the coast of Malacca, with 
three of his men ; and that he, this Dutchman, and 
four more, got into the woods, where they wan- 
dered about a great while, till at length he, in par- 
ticular, in a miraculous manner, made his escape, 
and swam off to a Dutch ship, which, sailing near 
the shore in its way from China, had sent their boat 
on shore for fresh water ; that he durst not come to 
that part of the shore where the boat was, but made 
shift in the night to take the water farther off, and 
swimming a great while, at last the ship's boat took 
him up. 

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where 
two of the seamen belonging to the ship arrived, 
having deserted the rest in their travels, and gave 
an account that the fellow who had run away with 
the ship sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which 
were gone a cruising in her ; and that they had al- 



226 ADVENTURES OF 

ready taken an English ship and two Dutch ships 
very richly laden. 

This latter part was found to concern us directly, 
tliough we knew it to be false : yet, as my partner 
said very justly, if we had fallen into their hands, 
and they had had such a prepossession against us 
beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have de- 
fended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter 
at their hands ; and especially considering that our 
accusers had been our judges, and that we could 
have expected nothing from them but what rage 
would have dictated, and an ungoverned passion 
have executed ; and therefore it was his opinion we 
should go directly back to Bengal, from whence we 
came, without putting in at any port whatever ; be- 
cause there we could give a good account of our- 
selves, could prove where we were when the ship 
put in, of whom we bought her, and the like ; and, 
which was more than all the rest, if we were put 
upon the necessity of bringing it before the proper 
judges, we should be sure to have some justice, and 
not to be hanged first and judged afterwards. 

I was some time of my partner's opinion; but 
'after a little more serious thinking, I told him I 
thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt 
returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong 
side of the Straits of Malacca, and that if the alarm 
was given, we should be sure to be way-laid on every 
side, as well by the Dutch of Batavia as the English 
elsewhere ; that if we should be taken, as it were, 
runniiig away, we should even condemn ourselves, 
and there would want no more evidence to destroy 
us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who 
said he was of my mind, and that we should cer- 
tainly be taken. This danger a little startled my 
partner, and all the ship's company, and we imme- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 227 

diately resolved to go away to the coast of Tonquin, 
and so on to the coast of China ; and, pursuing the 
first design as to trade, find some way or other to 
dispose of the ship, and come back in some of the 
vessels of the country, such as we could get. This 
was approved of as the best method for our security ; 
and accordingly we steered away N. N. E. keeping 
above fifty leagues off from the usual course to the 
eastward. This, however, put us to some inconve- 
nience ; for, first, the winds, when we came to that 
distance from the shore, seemed to be more steadily 
against us, blowing almost trade, as we call it, from 
the E. and E. N. E. so that we were a long while 
upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with 
victuals for so long a run ; and, which was still 
worse, there was some danger that those English 
and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us, whereof 
some were bound that way, might be got in before 
us, and if not, some other ship bound to China 
might have information of us, from them, and pursue 
us with the same vigour. 

I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and 
thought myself, including the late escape from the 
long-boats, to have been in the most dangerous 
condition that ever I was through my past life ; for 
whatever ill circumstances I had been in, I was 
never pursued for a thief before ; nor had I ever 
done any thing that merited the name of dishonest 
or fraudulent, much less thievish ; I had chiefly 
been my own enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I 
had been nobody's enemy but my own : but now I 
was embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable ; 
for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no 
condition to make that innocence appear ; and if I 
had been taken, it had been under a supposed guilt 
of the worst kind. This made me very anxious to 
make an escape,' though which way to do it I knew 



22S ADVENTURES OF 

not, or what port or place we could go to. My 
partner seeing me thus dejected, though he was 
the most concerned at first, began to encourage 
me, and describing to me the several ports of that 
coast, told me he would put in on the coast of Co- 
chin China, or the bay of Tonquin, intending to go 
afterwards to Macao, a town once in possession of 
the Portuguese, and where still a great many Eu- 
ropean families resided ; and particularly the mis- 
sionary priests usually went thither, in order to 
their going forward to China. 

Hither then we resolved to go ; and accordingly, 
though after a tedious and irregular course, and 
very much straitened for provisions, we came within 
sight of the coast very early in the morning ; and 
upon reflection on the past circumstances we were 
in, and the danger if we had not escaped, we re- 
solved to put into a small river, which, however, 
had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we 
could, either overland or by the ship's pinnace, come 
to know what ships were in any port thereabouts. 
This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance ; for 
though we did not inmiediately see any European 
ships in the bay of Tonquin, yet the next morning 
there came into the bay two Dutch ships ; and a 
third, without any colours spread out, but which we 
believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two 
leagues' distance, steering for the coast of China: 
and in the afternoon went by two English ships 
steering the same course: and thus we thought we 
saw ourselves beset with enemies both one way and 
the other. The place we were in was wild and bar- 
barous ; the people thieves, even by occupation or 
profession ; and though, it is true, we had not much 
to seek of them, and, except getting a i'ew provi- 
sions, cared not how little we had to do with them, 
yet it was with much difficulty that we kept our- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 229 

selves from being insulted by them, several ways. 
We were in a small river of this country, within a 
few leagues of its utmost limits northward ; and by 
our boat we coasted north-east, to the point of land 
which opens the great bay of Tonquin ; and it was 
in this beating up along the shore that we discovered 
we were surrounded with enemies. The people we 
were among were the most barbarous of all the inha- 
bitants of the coast, having no correspondence with 
any other nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, 
and such gross commodities; and it may be parti- 
cularly seen that they are the most barbarous of 
any of the inhabitants. Among other customs, 
they have this one, viz. that if any vessel has the 
misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they 
presently make the men all prisoners or slaves; and 
it was not long before we found a piece of their 
kindness this way, on the occasion following. 

I have observed above, that our ship sprung a 
leak at sea, and that we could not find it out; and 
it happened that, as I have said, it was stopped un- 
expectedly in the happy minute of our being to be 
seized by the Dutch and English ships in the bay of 
Siam ; yet, as we did not find the ship so perfectly 
tight and sound as we desired, we resolved, while 
we were at this place, to lay her on shore, and take 
out what heavy things we had on board, and clean 
her bottom ; and, if possible, to find out where the 
leaks were. Accordingly, having lightened the ship, 
and brought all our guns and other moveables to 
one side, we tried to bring her down, that we might 
come at her bottom ; but, on second thoughts, we 
did not care to lay her on dry ground, neither could 
we find out a proper place for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted 
with such a sight, came wondering down the shore 
to look at us; and seeing the ship lie down on one 

X 



230 ADVKNTURES OF 

side in such a manner, and lieeling in towards the 
shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work 
on her bottom with stages, and with their boats on 
the offside, they presently concluded that the ship 
was cast away, and lay so fast on the ground. On 
this supposition, they all came about us in two or 
three hours' time, with ten or twelve large boats, 
having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, 
intending, no doubt, to have come on board and 
plundered the ship; and if they had found us there, 
to have carried us away for slaves to their king, or 
whatever they call him, for we knew nothing of 
their governor. 

When they came up to the ship and began to row 
round her, they discovered us all hard at work on 
the outside of the ship's bottom and side, washing, 
and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man 
knows how. They stood for a while gazing at us, 
and we, who were a little surprised, could not ima- 
gine what their design was; but being willing to 
be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us 
into the ship, and others to hand down arms and 
ammunition to those that were at work to defend 
themselves with, if there should be occasion ; and it 
was no more than need; for in less than a quarter 
of an hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that 
the ship was really a wreck; and that we were all at 
work endeavouring to save her, or to save our lives 
by the help of our boats ; and when we handed our 
arms into the boats, they concluded, by that motion, 
that we were endeavouring to save some of our 
goods ; upon this they took it for granted we all be- 
longed to them, and away they came directly upon 
our men, as if it had been in a line of battle. 

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be 
frightened, for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, 
and cried out to us to know what they should do. 



nOBINSON CRUSOE. 231 

I immediately called to the men that worked upon 
the stages, to slip them down, and get up the side 
into the ship; and bade those in the boat to row 
round, and come on board ; and those few of us who 
were on board worked with all the strength and 
hands we had to bring the ship to rights ; but, how- 
ever, neither the men upon the stages nor those in 
the boats could do as they were ordered, before the 
Cochin Chinese were upon them ; and two of their 
boats boarded our long-boat, and began to lay hold 
on the men as their prisoners. 

The first man they laid hold on was an English 
seaman, a stout, strong fellow^ who having a mus- 
ket in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it 
down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought ; but he 
understood his businessbetterthan I could teach him, 
for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by 
main force out of their boat into ours, where taking 
him by the ears, he beat his head so against the 
boat's gunnel, that the fellow died in his hands ; 
and, in the mean time a Dutchman, who stood 
next, took up the musket, and with the butt-end 
of it so laid about him, that he knocked down five 
of them who attempted to enter the boat. But this 
was doing little towards resisting thirty or forty men, 
who fearless, because ignorant of their danger, be- 
gan to throw themselves into the long-boat, where 
we had but five men in all to defend it : but the fol- 
lowing accident, which deserved our laughter, gave 
our men a complete victory. 

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the out- 
side of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where 
he had calked her to stop the leaks, had got two 
kettles just let down into the boat, one filled with 
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and 
oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights use for that 
work ; and the man that attended the carpenter had 

x2 



232 ADVENTURES OF 

a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he sup • 
pHed the men that were at work with the hot stuff; 
two of the enemies men entered the boat just where 
this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets; he im- 
mediately saluted them with a ladle full of the stuff, 
boiling-hot, which so burned and scalded them, be- 
ing half-naked, that they roared out like bulls, and, 
enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. The 
carpenter saw it, and cried out, Well done, Jack ! 
give them some more of it : and stepping forward 
himself, takes one of the mops, and dipping it in 
the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it among them 
so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in the 
three boats there was not one that escaped being 
scalded and burned with it, in a most frightful, piti- 
ful manner, and made such a howling and crying, 
that I never heard a worse noise : for it is worth ob- 
serving, that though pain naturally makes all people 
cry out, yet every nation has a particular way of ex- 
clamation, and makes noises as different from one 
another as their speech. I cannot give the noise 
these creatures made a better name than howling, 
nor a name more proper to the tone of it; for I ne- 
ver heard any thing more like the noise of the wolves, 
which, as I have said, I heard howl in the forest on 
the frontiers of Languedoc. 

I was never better pleased with a victory in my 
life; not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and 
that our danger was imminent before, but, as we 
got this victory without any bloodshed, except of 
that man the fellow killed with his naked hands, 
and which I was very much concerned at, for I was 
sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even 
though it was in my own defence, knowing they 
came on errands which they thought just, and knew 
no better; and that though it may be a just thing, 
because necessary (for there is no necessary wick- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

edness in nature), yet I thought it was a sad Hfe, 
when we must be always obhged to be killing our 
fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves; and, indeed, 
I think so still, and I would even now suffer a great 
deal, rather than I would take away the life even of 
the worst person injuring me ; and I believe all 
considering people who know the value of life would 
be of my opinion, if they entered seriously into the 
consideration of it. 

But to return to my story: — All the while this 
was doing, my partner and I, who managed the rest 
of the men on board, had with great dexterity 
brought the ship almost to rights, and having got 
the guns into their places again, the gunner called 
to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for he 
would let fly among them. I called back again to 
him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the carpenter 
would do the work without him ; but bid him heat 
another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who was on 
board, took care of: but the enemy was so terrified 
with what they had met with in their first attack, 
that they would not come on again ; and some of 
them who were farthest off", seeing the ship swim, 
as it were, upright, began, as we suppose, to see 
their mistake, and give over the enterprise, finding 
it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of 
this merry fight, and having got some rice, and 
some roots and bread, with about sixteen hogs, on 
board, two days before, we resolved to stay here no 
longer, but go forward, whatever came of it; for 
we made no doubt but we should be surrounded the 
next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than 
our pitch-kettle would dispose of for us. We there- 
fore got all our things on board the same evening, 
and the next morning were ready to sail : in the 
mean time, lying at anchor at some distance from 
the shore, we were not so much concerned, being 

x3 



234" ADVENTURKS OF 

now in a figliting posture, as well as in a sailing po- 
sture, if any enemy had presented. The next day, 
having finished our work within board, and finding 
our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set 
sail. We would have gone into the bay of Tonquin, 
for we wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be 
known concerning the Dutch ships that had been 
there; but we durst not stand in there, because we 
had seen several ships go in, as we supposed, but a 
little before; so we kept on N. E. towards the island 
of Formosa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch 
or English merchant ship, as a Dutch or English 
merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Alger- 
ine man of war. 

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E. 
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine 
islands, and this we did that we might not fall into 
the way of any of the European ships ; and then we 
steered north, till we came to the latitude of 22 deg. 
30 min. by which means we made the island Formo- 
sa directly, where we came to an anchor, in order 
to get water and fresh provisions, which the people 
there, who are very courteous and civil in their man- 
ners, supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly 
and punctually with us in all their agreements and 
bargains, which is what we did not find among 
other j)eople, and may be owing to the remains of 
Christianity which was once planted here by a Dutch 
missionary of protestants, and is a testimony of what 
I have often observed, viz. that the Christian reli- 
gion always civilises the people and reforms their 
manners, where it is received, whether it works 
saving effects upon them or no. 

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the 
coast of China at an equal distance, till we knew 
we were beyond all the ports of China where our 
European ships usually come; being resolved, ifpos- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 235 

sible, not to fall into any of their hands, especially 
in this country ; where, as our circumstances were, 
we could not fail of being entirely ruined. 

Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees, 
we resolved to put into the first trading port we 
should come at ; and standing in for the shore, a 
boat came off two leagues to us, with an old Portu- 
guese pilot on board, who knowing us to be an Eu- 
ropean ship, came to offer his service, which, in- 
deed, we were glad of, and took him on board ; 
upon which, without asking us whither we would 
go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent it 
back. 

I thought it was now so much in our choice to 
make the old man carry us whither he would, that 
I began to talk to him about carrying us to the 
gulf of Nanquin, which is the most northern part 
of the coast of China. The old man said he knew 
the gulf of Nanquin very well, but smiling, asked 
us what we would do there ? 1 told him we would 
sell our cargo and purchase China wares, callicoes, 
raw silks, tea, wrought silks, &c. and so would re- 
turn by the same course we came. He told us our 
best port had been to have put in at Macao, where 
we could not have failed of a market for our opium 
to our satisfaction, and might for our money have 
purchased all sorts of China goods as cheap as we 
could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, 
of which he was very opinionated or conceited, I 
told him we were gentlemen as well as merchants, 
and that we had a mind to go and see the great city 
of Peking, and the famous court of the monarch of 
China. Why then, says the old man, you should 
go to Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into 
the sea there, you may go up within five leagues of 
the great canal. This canal is a navigable stream, 



236 ADVENTURES OF 

which goes through the heart of that vast empire of 
Cluna, crosses ail the rivers, passes some consider- 
able hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes 
up to the city of j-'eking, being in length near two 
hundred and seventy leagues. 

Well, said I, seignior Portuguese, but that is not 
our business now; the great question is, if you can 
carry us up to the city of Nan(|uin, from whence wc 
can travel to Peking afterwards? He said we could 
do so very well, and that there was a great Dutch 
ship gone up that way just before. This gave me a 
little shock, for a Dutch ship was now our terror, 
and we had much rather have met the devil, at least 
if he had not come in too frightful a figure; and we 
depended upon it that a Dutch ship would be our 
destruction, for we were in no condition to hght 
them ; all the ships they trade with into those parts 
being of great burden, and of nmch greater force 
than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused, and under 
some concern, when he named a Dutch ship; and 
said to me, sir, you need be under no apprehensions 
of the Dutch ; I suppose they are not now at war 
with your nation ? — No, said I, that's true ; but I 
know not what liberties men may take when they 
are out of the reach of the laws of their own coun- 
try. — Why, says he, you are no pirates ; what need 
you fear ? They will not meddle with peaceable mer- 
chants, sure. 

If I had any I)lood in my body that did not fly up 
into my face at that word, it was hindered by some 
stop in the vessels appointed by nature to circulate 
it, for it put me into the greatest disorder and con- 
fusion imaginable; nor was it possible for me to 
conceal it so, but the old man easily perceived it. 

Sir, says he, I find you are in some disorder in 
your thoughts at my talk ; pray be pleased to go 



ROBINSON CKUSOi:. 237 

which way you think fit, and depend upon it, I'll do 
you all the service I can. — Why, seignior, said I, it 
IS true, I am a little unsettled in my resolution at this 
time, whither to go in particular ; and I am some- 
thing more so for what you said about pirates. I 
hope there are no pirates in these seas ; we are but 
in an ill condition to meet with them, for you see 
we have but a small force, and are but very weakly 
manned. — O, sir, says he, don't be concerned, 1 do 
not know that there have been any pirates in these 
seas these fifteen years, except one, which was seen, 
as I hear, in the bay of 8iani, about a month since; 
but you may be assured she is gone to the south- 
ward ; nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit 
for the work : she was not built for a privateer, but 
was run away with by a reprobate crew that was on 
board, after the captain and some of his men had 
been murdered by the Malayans, at or near the isl.uid 
of yLUuatra. — What! said I, seeming to know no- 
thing of the matter, did they murder the captain? — 
No, said he, I don't understand that they murdered 
him ; but as they afterwards ran away with the ship, 
it is generally believed that they betrayed him into 
the hands of the Malayans, who did nuuder him ; 
and perhaps they procured them todo it. — Why then, 
said I, they deserve death as much as if they had 
done it themselves. — Nay, says the old man, they do 
deserve it ; and they will certainly have it, if they 
light upon any English or Dutch shij); for they have 
all agreed together, that if they meet that rogue 
they'll give him no quarter.— But, said 1 to him, you 
say the pirate is gone out of these seas; how can they 
meet with him, then ? — Why, that's true, says he, 
they do say so ; but he was, as 1 tell you, in the bay 
of Siam, in the river ('anibodia; and was discovered 
there by some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, 
and who were left on shore when they ran away with 



238 ADVENTURES OF 

her ; and some English and Dutch traders being in 
the river, they were within a little of taking him : 
nay, said he, if the foremost boats had been well se- 
conded by the rest, they had certainly taken him, 
but he, finding only two boats within reach of him, 
tacked about, and fired at those two, and disabled 
them before the others came up, and then standing 
off to sea, the others were not able to follow, and 
so he got away ; but they have all so exact a de- 
scription of the ship, that they will be sure to know 
her ; and wherever they find her they have vowed to 
give no quarter either to the captain or seamen, but 
to hang them all up at the yard-arm. — What ! said 
I, will they execute them right or wrong ; hang them 
first, and judge them afterwards? — O sir, says the 
old pilot, there is no need to make a formal business 
of it with such rogues as those ; let them tie them 
back to back, and set them a-diving, 'tis no more 
than they deserve. 

1 knew I had my old man fast on board, and that 
he could do no harm, so that 1 turned short upon 
him : Well now, seignior, said I, this is the very 
reason why I would have you carry us up to Nan- 
quin, and not put back to Macao, or to any other 
part of the country where the English or Dutch 
ships come; for be it known to you, seignior, those 
captains of the English and Dutch ships are a parcel 
of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that neither know 
what belongs to justice, or how to behave them- 
selves as the laws of God and nature direct ; but 
being proud of their offices, and not understanding 
their power, tliey would act the nmrderers to punish 
robbers; would take upon them to insult men 
falsely accused, and determine them guilty without 
due inquiry : and perhaps I may live to bring some 
of them to account for it, when they may be taught ^ 
how justice is to be executed ; and that no man Jj 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. "239 

ought to be treated as a criminal till some evidence 
may be had of the crime, and that he is the man. 

With this I told him that this was the very ship 
they attacked, and gave him a full account of the 
skirmish we had with their boats, and how foolishly 
and cowardly they behaved. I told him all the story 
of our buying the ship, and how the Dutchman 
served us. 1 told him the reasons I had to believe 
the story of killing the master by the Malayans was 
true, as also the running away with the ship ; but 
it was all a fiction of their own to suggest that the 
men had turned pirates, and they ought to have been 
sure it was so before they had ventured to attack us 
by surprise, and oblige us to resist them ; adding, 
that they would have the blood of those men, whom 
we killed there in just defence, to answer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation, and 
told us we were very much in the right to go away 
to the north; and that if he might advise us, it 
should be to sell the ship in China, which we might 
very well do, and buy or build another in the coun- 
try ; and, said he, though you will not get so good 
a ship, yet you may get one able enough to carry 
you and all your goods back again to Bengal, or any 
where else. I told him I would take his advice 
when I came to any port where I could find a ship 
for my turn, or get any customer to buy this. He 
replied, I should meet with customers enough for 
the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would 
serve me very well to go back again ; and that he 
would procure me people both to buy one and sell 
the other. Well but, seignior, said J, as you say 
they know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I fol- 
low your measures, be instrumental to bring some 
honest innocent men into a terrible broil, and per- 
haps to be murdered in cold blood ; for wherever 
they find the ship, they will prove the guilt upon 



240 ADVENTURES OF 

the men, by proving this was the ship, and so inno- 
cent men may probably be overpowered and mur- 
dered. — Why, says the old man, I'll find out a way 
to prevent that also ; for as I know all those com- 
manders you speak of very well, and shall see them 
all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights 
in the thing, and let them know that they had been 
so much in the wrong ; that though the people who 
were on board at first might run away with the 
ship, yet it was not true that they had turned 
pirates ; and that, in particular, these were not the 
men that first went off with the ship, but innocently 
bought her for their trade ; and I am persuaded 
they will so far believe me, as at least to act more 
cautiously for the time to come. 

While these things were passing between us, by 
way of discourse, we went forward directly for Nan- 
quin, and in about thirteen days' sail came to an 
anchor at the south-west point of the great gulf 
of Nanquin ; where, by the way, I came by accident 
to understand that two Dutch ships were gone the 
length before me, and that I should certainly fall 
into their hands. I consulted my partner again in 
this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as 1 was, 
and would very gladly have been safe on shore almost 
any where : however, I was not in such perplexity 
neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was no 
creek or harbour which I might put into and pursue 
my business with the Chinese privately, and be in 
no danger of the enemy. He told me, if 1 would sail 
to the southward about forty-two leagues, there was 
a little port called Quinchang, where the fathers of 
the mission usually landed from Macao, on their 
progress to teach the Christian religion to the Chi- 
nese, and where no European ships ever put in; and 
if I thought to put in there, I might consider what 
farther course to take when I was on shore. He 



rOBIKSON CRUSOE. 241 

confessed, he said, it was not a place for merchants, 
except that at some certain times they had a kind 
of a fair there, when the merchants from Japan 
came over thither to buy the Chinese merchandises. 

We all agreed to go back to this place ; the name 
of the port, as he called it, 1 may perhaps spell 
wrong, for I do not particularly remember it, having 
lost this, together with the names of many other 
places set down in a little pocket-book, which was 
spoiled by the water by an accident ; but this I re- 
member, that the Chinese or Japanese merchants we 
corresponded with called it by a difterent name from 
that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pro- 
nounced it as above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to 
this place, we weighed the next day, having only 
gone twice on shore where we were to get fresh 
water ; on both which occasions the people of the 
country were very civil to us, and brought us 
abundance of things to sell to us, I mean of provi- 
sions plants, roots, tea, rice, and some fowls, but 
nothing without money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being con- 
trary) not till five days, but it was very much to our 
satisfaction ; and I was joyful, and I may say thank- 
ful, when I set my foot on shore, resolving, and my 
partner too, that if it was possible to dispose of our- 
selves and effects any other way, though not every 
way to our satisfaction, we would never set one foot 
on board that unhappy vessel more ; and, indeed, I 
must acknowledge, that of all the circumstances of 
life that ever I had any experience of, nothing makes 
mankind so completely miserable as that of being in 
constant fear. Well does the Scripture say, " The 
fear of man brings a snare;" it is a life of death, 
and the mind is so entirely oppressed by it, that it 
is capable of no relief.

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the 
fancy, by heightening every danger, representing 
the English and Dutch captains to be men incapable 
of hearing reason, or of distinguishing between 
honest men and rogues ; or between a story calcu- 
lated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on 
purpose to deceive, and a true genuine account of 
our whole voyage, progress, and design; for we might 
many ways have convinced any reasonable creature 
that we were not pirates ; the goods we had on 
board, the course we steered, our frankly showing 
ourselves, and entering into such and such ports ; 
and even our very manner, the force we had, the 
number of men, the few arms, little ammunition, 
short provisions; all these would have served to con- 
vince any men that we were no pirates. The opium 
and other goods we had on board would make it ap- 
pear the ship had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, 
who, it was said, had the names of all the men that 
were in the ship, might easily see that we were a 
mixture of English, Portuguese, and Indians, and 
but two Dutchmen on board. These, and many 
other particular circumstances, might have made it 
evident to the understanding of any commander, 
whose hands we might fall into, that we were no 
pirates. But fear, that blind, useless passion, work- 
ed another way, and threw us into the vapours ; it 
bewildered our understandings, and set the imagi- 
nation at work to form a thousand terrible things 
that perhaps might never happen. We first sup- 
posed, as indeed every body had related to us. that 
the seamen on board the English and Dutch ships, 
but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the 
name of a pirate, and especially at our beating off 
their boats and escaping, that they would not give 
themselves leave to inquire whether we were pirates 
or no ; but would execute us off hand, as we call it, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 243 

without giving us any room for a defence. We re- 
flected that there really was so much apparent evi- 
dence before them, that they would scarce inquire 
after any more ; as, first, that the ship was certainly 
the same, and that some of the seamen among them 
knew her, and had been on board her ; and, se- 
condly, that when we had intelligence at the river 
of Cambodia that they were coming down to examine 
us, we fought their boats and fled ; so that we made 
no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of our being 
pirates, as we were satisfied of the contrary ; and, 
as I often said, I know not but 1 should have been 
apt to have taken those circumstances for evidence, 
if the tables were turned, and my case was theirs ; 
and have made no scruple of cutting all the crew to 
pieces, without believing, or perhaps considering, 
what they might have to offer in their defence. 

But let that be how it will, these were our appre- 
hensions ; and both my partner and I scarce slept 
a night without dreaming of halters and yard-arms, 
that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and being taken ; 
of killing, and being killed : and one night I was in 
such a fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen 
had boarded us, and I was knocking one of their 
seamen down, that I struck my double fist against 
the side of the cabin I lay in with such a force, as 
wounded my hand grievously, broke my knuckles, 
and cut and bruised the flesh, so that it awaked me 
out of my sleep. 

Another apprehension 1 had was, the cruel usage 
we might meet with from them if we fell into their 
hands : then the story of Amboyna came into my head, 
and how the Dutch might perhaps torture us, as 
they did our countrymen there, and make some of 
our men, by extremity of torture, confess those 
crimes they never were guilty of, or own themselves 
and all of us to be pirates, and so they would put

244 ADVENTURES OF 

US to death with a formal appearance of justice; 
and that they might be tempted to do this for the 
gain of our ship and cargo, which was worth four 
or five thousand pounds, put all together. 

These things tormented me and my partner too, 
night and day ; nor did we consider that the cap- 
tains of ships have no authority to act thus ; and if 
we had surrendered prisoners to them, they could 
not answer the destroying us, or torturing us, but 
would be accountable for it when they came to their 
own country ; this, I say, gave me no satisfaction ; 
for if they were to act thus with us, what advantage 
would it be to us that they should be called to an 
account for it ? or if we were first to be murdered, 
what satisfaction would it be to us to have them 
punished when they came home ? 

I cannot refrain taking notice here what re- 
flections I now had upon the vast variety of my par- 
ticular circumstances ; how hard I thought it was, 
that I, who had spent forty years in a life of con- 
tinual difficulties, and was at last come, as it were, 
to the port or haven which all men drive at, viz. to 
have rest and plenty, should be a volunteer in new 
sorrows by my own unhappy choice; and that I, 
who had escaped so many dangers in my youth, 
should now come to be hanged in my old age, and 
in so remote a place, for a crime which I was not in 
the least inclined to, much less guilty of. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would 
come in ; and I should be considering that this 
seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate Pro- 
vidence, afnd I ought to look upon it and submit to 
it as such ; that although 1 was innocent as to men, 
I was far from being innocent as to my Maker ; and 
I ought to look in and examine what other crimes 
in my life were most obvious to me, and for which 
Providence might justly inflict thi« punishment as 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 24l5 

a retribution ; and that I ought to submit to this, 
just as I would to a shipwreck, if it had pleased God 
to have brought such a disaster upon me. 

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take 
its place, and then I would be talking myself up to 
vigorous resolutions; that I would not h? taken to 
be barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches 
in cold blood ; that it were much better to have 
fallen into the hands of the savages, though I was 
sure they would feast upon me when they had taken 
me, than those who would perhaps glut their rage 
upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities ; that 
in the case of the savages I always resolved to die 
fighting to the last gasp, and why should I not do 
so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, to me 
at least, to think of falling into these men's hands, 
than ever it was to think of being eaten by men ? for 
the savages, give them their due, would not eat a 
man till he was killed and dead, but that these men 
had many arts beyond the cruelty of death. When- 
ever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put 
myself into a kind of fever with the agitation of a 
supposed fight: my blood would boil, and my eyes 
sparkle, as if 1 was engaged, and 1 always resolved 
to take no quarter at their hands ; but, even at last, 
if I could resist no longer, I would blow up the ship 
and all that was in her, and leave them but little 
booty to boast of. 

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities 
of these things were to our thoughts while we were 
at sea, the greater was our satisfaction when we saw 
ourselves on shore ; and my partner told me he 
dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon his 
back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found 
that he was not able to stand longer under it ; but 
that the Portuguese pilot came and took it off his 
back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before 

Y 3 



2'1<6 ADVENTURE* OF 

him appearing ail smooth and plain ; and truly it 
was so; they vvere all like men who had a load taken 
off their backs. For my part, I had a weight taken 
off from my heart that it was not able any longer 
to bear; and, as I said above, we resolved to go no 
more to sea in that ship. When we came on shore, 
the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us a 
lodging and a warehouse for our goods, which, by 
the way, was much the same : it was a little house, 
or hut, with a larger house adjoining to it, all built 
with canes, and palisadoed round with large canes, 
to keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, 
there were not a few in that country ; however, the 
magistrates allowed us a little guard, and we had a 
soldier with a kind of halberd, or half-pike, who 
stood centinel at our door ; to whom we allowed a 
pint of rice, and a little piece of money, about the 
value of threepence, per day, so that our goods were 
kept very safe. 

The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had 
been over some time ; however, we found that there 
were three or four junks in the river, and two Ja- 
paners, I mean ships from Japan, with goods which 
they had bought in China, and were not gone away, 
having some Japanese merchants on shore. 

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us 
was, to get us acquainted with three missionary Ro- 
mish priests who were in town, and who had been 
there some time converting the people to Chris- 
tianity ; but we thought they made but poor work 
of it, and made them but sorry Christians when they 
had done; however, that was none of our business. 
One of these was a Frenchman, whom they called 
Father Simon ; another was a Portuguese, and the 
third a Genoese ; but Father Simon was courteous, 
easy in his manner, and very agreeable company ; 
the other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 24-7 

austere, and applied seriously to the work they came 
about, viz. to talk with, and insinuate themselves 
among, the inhabitants, wherever they had oppor- 
tunity. We often ate and drank with those men ; 
and though, I must confess, the conversion, as they 
call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so far from 
the true conversion required to bring heathen people 
to the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to 
little more than letting them know the name of 
Christ, and say some pi'ayers to the Virgin Mary and 
her Son, in a tongue which they understand not, 
and to cross themselves, and the like ; yet it must 
be confessed that the religionists, whom we call 
raissionaries, have a firm belief that these people will 
be saved, and that they are the instruments of it ; 
and, on this account, they undergo not only the fa- 
tigue of the voyage, and the hazards of living in 
such places, but oftentimes death itself, with the 
most violent tortures, for the sake of this work. 

But to return to my story : This French priest. 
Father Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of 
the chief of the mission, to go up to Peking, the 
royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only 
for another priest, who was ordered to come to him 
from Macao, to go along with him : and we scarce 
ever met together but he was inviting me to go that 
journey ; telling me how he would show me all the 
glorious things of that mighty empire, and, among 
the rest, the greatest city in the world ; a city, said 
he, that your London and our Paris put together, 
cannot be equal to. This was the city of Peking, 
which, 1 confess, is very great, and infinitely full of 
people ; but as 1 looked on those things with dif- 
ferent eyes from other men, so I shall give my 
opinion of them in a few words, whei\ I come in the 
course of my travels to speak more particularly of 
them. 



248 ADVENTURES OF 

But, first, i conic to my friar or missionary. 
Dining with him one day, and being very merry to- 
gether, I showed some httle incHnation to go with 
him ; and he pressed me and my partner very hard, 
and with a great many persuasions, to consent. 
Why, Father Simon, says my partner, should you 
desire our company so much ? you know we are 
heretics, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep 
us company with any pleasure. — O, says he, you may 
perhaps be good catholics in time ; my business here 
is to convert heathens, and who knows but I may 
convert you too ? — Very w ell, Father, said I, so you 
will preach to us all the way? — I will not be trouble- 
some to you, says he; our religion does not divest us 
of good manners: besides, we are here like country- 
men ; and so we are, conipared to the place we are 
in ; and if you are huguenots, and I a catholic, we 
may all be Christians at last ; at least, we are all 
gentlemen, and we may converse so, without being 
uneasy to one another. I liked this part of his dis- 
course very well, and it began to put me in mind of 
my priest that I had left in the Brazils ; but this 
Father Simon did not come up to his character by 
a great deal ; for though father Simon had no ap- 
pearance of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he 
had not that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and 
sincere affection to religion, that my other good ec- 
clesiastic had. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left us, 
nor soliciting us to go with him ; we had something 
else before us at first, for he had all this wliile our 
ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and we be- 
gan to be very doubtful what we should do, for we 
were now in a place of very little business; and once 
I was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam, 
and the city of Nanquin ; but Providence seemed 
now more visibly, as I thought, than ever, to con- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 249 

cern itself in our affairs ; and I was encouraged, 
from this very time, to think I should one way or 
other get out of this entangled circumstance, and 
be brought home to my own country again, though 
1 had not the least view of the manner. Providence, 
I say, began here to clear up our way a little : and 
the first thing that offered was, that our old Portu- 
guese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who 
inquired what goods we had ; and, in the first place, 
he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good 
price for it, paying us in gold by weight, some in 
small pieces of their own coin, and some in small 
wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each. While 
we were dealing with him for our opium, it came 
into my head that he might perhaps deal for the 
ship too, and I ordered the interpreter to propose it 
to him ; he shrunk up his shoulders at it, when 
it was first proposed to him ; but in a few days after 
he came to me, with one of the missionary priests 
for his interpreter, and told me he had a proposal 
to make to me, which was this : — he had bought a 
great quantity of goods of us, when he had no 
thoughts of proposals made to him of buying the 
ship ; and that, therefore, he had not money enough 
to pay for the ship : but if I would let the same men 
who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire 
the ship to go to Japan ; and would send them from 
thence to the Philippine islands with another load- 
ing, which he would pay the freight of before they 
went from Japan ; and that at their return he would 
buy the ship. I began to listen to his proposal, and 
so eager did my head still run upon rambling, that 
I could not but begin to entertain a notion of going 
myself with him, and so to sail from the Philippine 
islands away to the South Seas ; accordingly 1 asked 
the Japanese merchant if he would not hire us to 
the Philippine islands, and discharge us there. He 



250 ADVENTURES OF 

aaid, No, he could not do that, for then he could not 
have the return of his cargo ; hut he would dis- 
charge us in Japan, at the ship's return. Well, still 
J was for taking him at that proposal, and going 
myself; but my partner, wiser than myself, per- 
suaded me from it, representing the dangers, as 
well of the seas as of the Japanese, who are a 
false, cruel, and treacherous people ; likewise those 
of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, 
cruel, and treacherous, than they. 

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a 
conclusion : the first thing we had to do was, to 
consult with the captain of the ship, and with his 
men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan : 
and while 1 was doing this, the young man whom 
my nephew had left with nie as my companion for 
my travels came to me, and told me that he thought 
that voyage promised very fair, and that there 
was a great prospect of advantage, and he would 
be very glad if I undertook it ; but that if I would 
not, and would give him leave, he would go as a 
merchant, or how I pleased to order him ; that if 
ever he came to England, and I was there and alive, 
he would render me a faithful account of his suc- 
cess, which should be as much mine as 1 pleased. 
I was really loth to part with him ; but consider- 
ing the prospect of advantage, which really was 
considerable, and that he was a young fellow as 
hkely to do well in it as any I knew, I inclined to 
let him go ; but I told him I would consult my 
partner, and give him an answer the next day. My 
partner and 1 discoursed about it, and my partner 
made a most generous offer : You know it has been 
an unlucky ship, said he, and we both resolve not 
to go to sea in it again ; if your steward (so he call- 
ed my man) will venture the voyage, I will leave 
my share of the vessel to him, and let him make the 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 251 

best of it ; and if we live to meet in England, and 
he meets with success abroad, he shall account for 
one half of the profits of the ship's freight to us ; 
the other shall be his own. 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with 
my young man, made him such an offer, I could do 
no less than offer him the same : and all the ship's 
company being willing to go with him, we made 
over half the ship to him in property, and took a 
writing from him, obliging him to account for the 
other ; and away he went to Japan. The Japan 
merchant proved a very punctual honest man to 
him ; protected him at Japan, and got him a licence 
to come on shore, which the Europeans in general 
have not lately obtained ; paid him his freight very 
punctually; sent him to the Philippines, loaded with 
Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their 
own, who, trafficking with the Spaniards, brought 
back European goods again, and a great quantity 
of cloves and other spices; and there he was not 
only paid his freight very well, and at a very good 
price, but not being willing to sell the ship then, 
the merchant furnished him goods on his own ac- 
count ; and with some money, and some spices of 
his own which he brought with him, he went back 
to the Manillas to the Spaniards, where he sold his 
cargo very well. Here, having got a good acquaint- 
ance at Manilla, he got his ship made a free ship ; 
and the governor of Manilla hired him to go to 
Acapulco in America, on the coast of Mexico, and 
gave him a licence to land there, and to travel to 
Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe 
with all his men. He made the voyage to Acapulco 
very happily, and there he sold his ship ; and hav- 
ing there also obtained allowance to travel by land 
to Porto Bello, he found means, somehow or other, 
to get to Jamaica, with all his treasure ; and about 



252 ADVENTURES OF 

eight years after came to England exceeding rich, 
of which I shall take notice in its place ; in the 
mean time, I return to our particular affairs. 

Being now to part with the ship and ship's com- 
pany, it came before us, of course, to consider what 
recompence we should give to the two men that 
gave us such timely notice of the design against us 
in the river Cambodia. The truth was, they had done 
us a very considerable service, and deserved well at 
our hands ; though, by the way, they were a couple 
of rogues too ; for as they believed the story of our 
being pirates, and that we had really run away with 
the ship, they came down to us not only to betray 
the design that was formed against us, but to go to 
sea with us as pirates ; and one of them confessed 
afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going 
a roguing brought him to do it : however, the ser- 
vice they did us was not the less ; and, therefore, as 
I had promised to be grateful to them, I first or- 
dered the money to be paid them which they said 
was due to them on board their respective ships; 
over and above that, I gave each of them a small 
sum of money in gold, which contented them very 
well ; then I made the Englishman gunner in the 
ship, the gunner being now made second mate and 
purser ; the Dutchman I made boatswain ; so they 
were both very well pleased, and proved very ser- 
riceable, being both able seamen, and very stout 
fellows. 

We were now on shore in China : if I thought 
myself banished and remote from my own country 
at Bengal, where 1 had many ways to get home for 
my money, what could I think of myself now, when 
I was got about a thousand leagues forther off from 
home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of pro- 
spect of return ? All we had for it was this, that in 
about four months' time there was to be another 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 253 

fair at the place where we were, and then we might 
be able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of 
the country, and withal might possibly find some 
Chinese junks or vessels from Tonquin, that would 
be to be sold, and would carry us and our goods 
whither we pleased. This I liked very well, and 
resolved to wait • besides, as our particular persons 
were not obno .ious, so if any English or Dutch 
ships came thither, perhaps tve might have an op- 
portunity to load our goods, and get passage to 
some other place in India, nearer ho nj. Upon 
these hopes we resolved to continue here ; but, to 
divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into 
the country. First, we went ten days journey, to 
the city of Nanquin, a city well worth seeing, in- 
deed ; they say it has a million of people in it : it is 
regularly built, the streets ail exactly straight, and 
cross one another in direct lines, which gives the 
figure of it great advantage. But when I come to 
compare the miserable people of these countries 
with ours, their fabrics, their manner of living, 
their government, their religion, their wealth, and 
their glory, as some call it, 1 must confess that I 
scarcely think it worth my while to mention them 
here. It is very observable, that we wonder at the 
grandeur, the riches, Xhe pomp, the ceremoaies, 
the government, the manufactures, the commerce, 
and conduct of these people; not that it is to be 
wondered at, or, indeed, in the least to be regarded, 
but because having a true notion of the barb irlty 
of those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance 
that prevails there, v/e do not expect to find any 
such thing so far off. Otherwise, what are their 
buildings to the palaces and royal buildings of Eu- 
rope ? What their trade to the universal commerce 
of England, Holland, France, and Spain ^ \VTiat 
are their cities to ours, for wealth, strength, gaiety 

VOL. XVII. z 



254< ADVENTURES OF 

of apparel, rich furniture, and infinite variety ? 
What are their ports, supplied with a few junks and 
barks, to our navigation, our merchant Heets, our 
large and powerful navies ? Our city of London 
has more trade than half their mighty empire: one 
English, Dutch, or French man of war of eighty 
guns, would be able to fight almost all the shipping 
belonging to China ; but the greatness of their 
wealth, their trade, the power of their government, 
and the strength of their armies, may be a little 
surprising to us, because, as I have said, consider- 
ing them as a barbarous nation of pagans, little 
better than savages, we did not expect such things 
among them : and this, indeed, is the advantage 
with which all their greatness and power is represent- 
ed to us ; otherwise, it is in itself nothing at all ; 
for what I have said of their ships may be said of 
their armies and troops; all the forces of their em- 
pire, though they were to bring two millions of 
men into the field together, would be able to do 
nothing but ruin the country, ai*d starve themselves, 
if they were to besiege a strong town in Flan- 
ders, or to fight a disciplined army ; one good line 
of German cuirassiers, or of French cavalry, might 
withstand all the horse of China ; a million of their 
foot could not stand before one embattled body of 
our infantry, posted so as not to be surrounded, 
though they were not to be one to twenty in num- 
ber ; nay, I do not boast if I say that thirty thou- 
sand German or English foot, and ten thousand 
horse, well managed, could defeat all the forces of 
China ; and so of our fortified towns, and of the art 
of our engineers in assaulting and defending towns ; 
there is not a fortified town in China could hold out 
one month against the batteries and attacks of an 
European army ; and, at the sametime, all thearmies 
of C hina could never take such a town as Dunkirk, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 255 

provided it was not starved ; no, not in a ten years 
siege. They have fire-arms, it is true, but they are 
awkward and uncertain in their going off; and 
their powder has but little strength. Their armies 
are badly disciplined, and want skill to attack, or 
temper to retreat ; and, therefore, I must confess, it 
seemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard 
our people say such fine things of the power, glory, 
magnificence, and trade of the Chinese ; because, 
as far as 1 saw, they appeared to be a contemptible 
herd or crowd of ignorant sordid slaves, subjected 
to a government qualified only to rule such a peo- 
ple : and were not its distance inconceivably great 
from Muscovy, and the Muscovite empire in a man- 
ner as rude, impotent, and ill-governed as they, the 
Czar of Muscovy might with ease drive them all out 
of their country, and conquer them in one cam- 
paign : and had the Czar (who is now a growing 
prince) fallen this way, instead of attacking the 
warlike Swedes, and equally improved himself in 
the art of war, as they say he has done ; and if none 
of the powers of Europe had envied or interrupted 
him, he might by this time have been emperor of 
China, instead of being beaten by the king of Swe- 
den at Narva, when the latter was not one to six in 
number. As their strength and their grandeur, so 
their navigation, commerce and husbandry is very 
imperfect, compared to the same things in Europe : 
also in their knowledge, their learning, and in their 
skill in the sciences, they are either very awkward 
or defective, though they have globes and spheres, 
and a smattering of the mathematics, and think 
they know more than all the world besides ; but 
they know little of the motions of the heavenly bo- 
dies : and so grossly and absurdly ignorant are their 
common people, that when the sun is eclipsed, they 
think a great dragon has assaulted it, and is going

to run away with it ; and they fall a clattering with 
all the drums and kettles in the country, to fright 
the monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm of 
bees. 

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I 
have made in all the accounts I have given of my 
travels, so I shall make no more such ; it is none 
of my business, nor any part of my design ; but to 
give an account of my own adventures through a 
life of inimitable wanderings, and a long variety of 
changes, which, perhaps, few that come after me 
will have heard the like of: I shall therefore say 
very little of all the mighty places, desert countries, 
and numerous people I have yet to pass through, 
more than relates to my own story, and which my 
concern among them will make necessary. 

I was now, as near as 1 can compute, in the heart 
of China, about thirty degrees north of the line, for 
we were returned from Nanquin : I had, indeed, a 
mind to see the city of Peking, which I had heard 
so much of, and Father Simon importuned me daily 
to do it. At length his time of going away being 
set, and the other missionary who was to go with 
him being ai lived from Macao, it was necessary 
that we should resolve either to go or not : so I re- 
ferred it whcl.y to my partner, and left it wholl} to 
his choice, v. ho at length resoKed it in the affirma- 
tive, and we prepared for our journey. We set out 
with ve)y good advantage, as to finding the way, 
for we gi't leave to travel in the retinue of one of 
their Mandarins, a kind of viceroy or principal ma- 
gistrate in the province where they reside, and who 
take great state upon them, travelling with great 
attendaiice, and w.tli great homage from the peo- 
ple, who are sometiniis gieatly impoverished by 
tliem, l)eipg obligvd to lurnish provisions for them 
and all their attendants in their journeys. That 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 257 

which I particularly observed, as to our travelling 
with his baggage, was this, that though we receiv- 
ed sufficient provisions both for ourselves and our 
horses from the country, as belonging to the Man- 
darin, yet we were obliged to pay for every thing 
we had, after the market price of the country, and 
the Mandarin's steward collected it duly from us ; 
so that our travelling in the retinue of the Man- 
darin, though it was a very great kindness to us, 
was not such a mighty favour in him, but was a 
great advantage to him, considering there were above 
thirty other people travelled in the same manner 
besides us, under the protection of his retinue ; for 
the country furnished all the provisions for nothing 
to him, and yet he took our money for them. 

We were twenty-five days travelling to Peking, 
through a country infinitely populous, but I think 
badly cultivated; the husbandry, the economy, and 
the way of living miserable, though they boast so 
much of the industry of the people ; I say miserable, 
if compared with our own, but not so to these poor 
wretches, who know no other. The pride of the 
people is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing 
but their poverty, in some parts, which adds to 
that which I call their misery ; and I must needs 
think the naked savages of America live much more 
happy than the poorer sort of these, because as they 
have nothing, so they desire nothing ; whereas 
these are proud and insolent, and in the main are 
in many parts mere beggars and drudges; their os- 
tentation is inexpressible ; and, if they can, they 
love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which 
is to the last degree ridiculous, as well as the con- 
tempt of all the world but themselves. 

I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly after- 
wards in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand 
Tartary than here ; and yet the roads here are well

paved and well kept, and very convenient for tra- 
vellers ; but nothing was more awkward to me than 
to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, 
in the midst of the grossest simplicity and igno- 
rance ; and mv friend Father Simon and I used to 
be very merry upon these occasions, to see the beg- 
garly pride of these people : for example, coming 
by the house of a country gentleman, as Father Si- 
mon called him, about ten leagues off the city of 
Nanquin, we had first of all the honour to ride 
with the master of the house about two miles ; the 
state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being 
a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit was 
very proper for a scaramouch, or merry-andrew, 
being a dirty calico, with hanging-sleeves, tassels, 
and cuts and slashes almost on every side ; it cover- 
ed a taffety vest, as greasy as a butcher's, and which 
testified that his honour must be a most exquisite 
sloven. His horse was but a poor, starved, hobbling 
creature, and he had two slaves followed him on 
foot to drive the poor creature along ; he had a 
whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as 
fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail ; 
and thus he rode by us, with about ten or twelve 
servants going from the city to his country seat, 
about half a league before us. We travelled on 
gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode away 
before us, and as we stopped at a village about an 
hour to refresh us, when we came by the country 
seat of this great man, we saw him in a little 
place before his door, eating his repast. It was a 
kind of a garden, but he was easy to be seen ; 
and we were given to understand that the more 
we looked at him the better he would be pleased. 
He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto, 
which ertectually shaded him over the head, and on 
the south side ; but under the tree was also placed 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 259 

a large umbrella, which made that part look well 
enough ; he sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, 
being a heavy corpulent man, and had his meat 
brought him by two women slaves ; he had two 
more, one of which fed the squire with a spoon, and 
the other held the dish with one hand, and scraped 
off what he let fall upon his worship's beard and 
taffety vest. 

Thus leaving the poor wretch to please himself 
with our looking at him, as if we admired his pomp, 
though we really pitied and contemned him, we 
pursued our journey ; only Father Simon had the 
curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the 
country justice had to feed on in all his state, which 
he had the honour to taste of, and which was, I 
think, a mess pf boiled rice, with a great piece of 
garlic in it, and a little bag filled with green pep- 
per, and another plant which they have there, some- 
thing like our ginger, but smelling like musk, and 
tasting like mustard ; all this was put together, and 
a small piece of lean mutton boiled in it, and this 
was his worship's repast ; four or five servants more 
attended at a distance, who, we supposed, were to 
eat of the same after their master. 

As for our Mandarin with whom we travelled, he 
was respected as a king, surrounded always with his 
gentleman, and attended in all his appearances with 
such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a distance; 
but this I observed, that there was not a horse in 
his retinue but that our carriers' pack-horses in En- 
gland seemed to me to look much better ; though 
it was hard to judge rightly, for they were so cover- 
ed with equipage, mantles, trappings, &c. that we 
could scarce see any thing but their feet and their 
heads as they went along. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and 
perplexity that I have given an account of being

over, I had no anxious thought about be, which 
made this journey the pleasanter to me ; nor had I 
any ill accident attended me, only in passing or 
fording a small river my horse fell, and made me 
free of" the country, as they call it, that is to say 
threw me in ; the place was not deep, but it wetted 
me all over. I mention it, because it spoiled my 
pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names of 
several people and places which I had occasion to 
remember, and which, not taking due care of, the 
leaves rotted, and the words were never after to be 
read, to my great loss as to the names of some 
places I touched at in this journey. 

At length we arrived at Peking ; I had nobody 
with me but the youth whom my nephew the cap- 
tain had given me to attend me as a servant, and 
who proved very trusty and diligent ; and my part- 
ner had nobody with him but one servant, who was 
a kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being 
desirous to see the court, we bore his charges for 
his company, and to use him as an interpreter, for 
he understood the language of the country, and 
spoke good French, and a little English ; and, in- 
deed, this old man was a most useful implement to 
us every where ; for we had not been above a week 
at Peking, when he came laughing. Ah, seignior In- 
glese, says he, I have something to tell you will 
make your heart glad. — My heart glad ! says I ; 
what can that be ? I don't know any thing in this 
country can either give me joy or grief, to any great 
degree. — Yes, yes, said the old man, in broken Eng- 
lish, make you glad, me sorry. — Why, said I, will 
it make you sorry ? — Because, said he, you have 
brought me here twenty-five days' journey, and will 
leave me to go back alone, and which way shall I 
get to my port afterwards without a ship, without 
a horse, without pecunc: so he called money, being 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 261 

his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to 
make us merry with. In short, he told us there 
was a great caravan of Muscovite and Pohsh mer- 
chants in the city, preparing to set out on their 
journey by land to Muscovy, within four or five 
weeks, and he was sure we would take the op- 
portunity to go with them, and leave him behind, 
to go back alone. 

I confess I was greatly surprised with this good 
news, and had scarce power to speak to him for 
some time ; but at last I turned to him, How do 
you know this ? said I. Are you sure it is true ? — 
Yes, says he ; 1 met this mornmg in the street an 
old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is 
among them ; he came last from Astracan, and was 
designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew 
him, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved 
to go with the caravan to Moscow, and so down 

the river Wolga to Astracan. Well, seignior, 

says I, do not be uneasy about being left to go 
back alone ; if this be a method for my return 
to England, it shall be your fault if you go back to 
Macao at all. We then went to consult together 
what was to be done ; and I asked my partner what 
he thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would 
suit with his affairs ? He told me he would do just 
as I would ; for he had settled all his affairs so well 
at Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands, 
that as we had made a good voyage here, if he could 
vest it in China silks, wrought and raw, such as 
might be worth the carriage, he would be content 
to go to England, and then make his voyage back 
to Bengal by the Company's ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our 
Portuguese pilot would go with us we would bear 
his charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleas- 
ed ; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over ge- 
nerous in that neither, if we had not rewarded him 



262 ADVENTURES OF 

farther, the service he had done us being really 
worth more than that : for he had not only been a 
pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a broker for 
us on shore ; and his procuring for us the Japan 
merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our 
pockets. So we consulted together about it, and 
being willing to gratify him, which was but doing 
him justice, and very willing also to have him with 
us besides, for he was a most necessary man on all 
occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coin- 
ed gold, which, as 1 compute it, came to about one 
hundred and seventy-five pounds sterling, between 
us, and to bear all his charges, both for himself 
and horse, except only a horse to carry his goods. 
Having settled this between ourselves, we called him 
to let him know what we had resolved, I told him 
he had complained of our being to let him go back 
alone, and 1 was now to tell him we were resolved 
he should not go back at all ; that as we had resolved 
to go to Europe with the caravan, we resolved also 
he should go with us ; and that we called him to 
know his mind. He shook his head, and said, it 
was a long journey, and he had no pecuue to carry 
him thither, or to subsist himself when he came 
there. We told him we believed it was so, and 
therefore we had resolved to do something for him 
that should let him see how sensible we were of the 
service he had done us, and also how agreeable he 
was to us ; and then I told him what we had re- 
solved to give him here, which he might lay out as 
we would do our own ; and that as for his charges, 
if he would go with us we would set him safe on 
shore (life and casualties excepted) either in Mus- 
covy or England, which he would, at our own 
charge, except only the carriage of his goods. He 
received the proj)osal like a man transported, and 
told us he would go with us over the whole world ; 
and so we all prepared for our journey. However, 



ROBINSON CUUSOE. 263 

as it was with us, so it was with the other mer- 
chants ; they had many things to do ; and instead 
of being ready in five weeks, it was four months 
and some days before all things were got together. 

It was the beginning of February, our style, when 
we set out from Peking. iVI y partner and the old 
pilot had gone express back to the port where we 
had first put in, to dispose of some .goods which we 
had left there; and I, with a Chinese merchant 
whom I had some knowledge of at Nanquin, and 
who came to Peking on his own affairs, went to 
Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieces of fine da- 
masks, with about two hundred pieces of other very 
fine silks of several sorts, some mixed with gold, 
and had all these brought to Peking against my 
partner's return ; besides this, we bought a very 
large quantity of raw silk, and some other goods, 
our cargo amounting, in these goods only, to about 
three thousand five hundred pounds sterling; which, 
together with tea, and some fine calicoes, and three 
camels' loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all 
eighteen camels for our share, besides those we 
rode upon ; which, with two or three spare horses, 
and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, 
in short, twenty-six camels and horses in our 
retinue. 

The company was very great, and, as near as I 
can remember, made between three and four hun- 
dred horse, and upwards of one hundred and twenty 
men, very well armed, and provided for all events : 
for as the eastern caravans are subject to be attack- 
ed by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars ; but 
they are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, 
nor so barbarous, when they prevail. 

The company consisted of people of several na- 
tions ; but there were above sixty of them mer- 
chants or inhabitants of Moscow, though of them 



261< ADVENTURES OF 

some were Livonians ; and, to our particular satis- 
faction, five of them were Scots, who appeared also 
to be men of great experience in business, and of 
very good substance 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the 
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen- 
tlemen and mrrchants, that is to say, all the pas- 
sengers except the servants, to a great council, as 
they called it. At this council every one deposited 
a certam quantity of money to a common stock, for 
the necessary expence of buying forage on the way, 
where it was not otherwise to be had, and for sa- 
tisfying the guides, getting horses, and the like : 
and here they constituted the journey, as they call 
it, viz. they named captains and officers to draw us 
all up, and give the word of command, in case of 
an attack, and give every one their turn of com- 
mand ; nor was this forming us into order any more 
than what we found needful upon the way, as shall 
be observed. 

The road all on this side of the country is very 
populous, and is full of potters and earth makers, 
that is to say, people that temper the earth for the 
China-ware; and as I was coming along, our Por- 
tugal pilot, who had always something or other to 
say to make us merry, came sneering to me, and 
told me he would show me the greatv::!>t rarity in all 
the country, and that I should have this to say of 
China, aftL>r all the ill-humoured things I had said 
of it, that 1 had seen one thing which was not to 
be seen in all the world beside. I was very impor- 
tunate to know what it was : at last he told me it 
was a gentleman's house built with China-ware. 
Well, says I, are not the materials of their buildings 
the product of their own country, and so it is all 
China ware, is it not ? — No, no, says he, 1 mean it 
is a house all made of China-ware, such as you call 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 265 

it in England, or as it is called in oui' country, 
porcelain. — Well, says I, such a thing maybe ; how 
big is it ? Can we carry it in a box upon a camel ? 
If we can, we will buy it. — Upon a camel ! says the 
old pilot, holding up both his hands ; why there is 
a family of thirty people lives in it. 

I was then curious, indeed, to see it ; and when 
I came to it, it was nothing but this : it was a 
timber house, or a house built, as we call it in Eng- 
land, with lath and plaster ; but all this plastering 
was really China-ware, that is to say, it was plastered 
with the earth that makes china-ware. The outside, 
which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and 
looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with 
blue figures, as the large China-ware in England is 
painted, and hard as if it had been burned. As to 
the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were 
lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the little 
square tiles we call galley-tiles in England, all made 
of the finest China, and the figures exceeding fine, 
indeed, with extraordinary variety of colours, mixed 
with gold; many tiles making but one figure, but 
joined so artificially, the mortar being made of the 
same earth, that it was very hard to see where the 
tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the 
same composition, and as hard as the earthen floors 
we have in use in several parts of England ; as hard 
as stone, and smooth, but not burned and painted, 
except some smaller rooms, like closets, which were 
all as it were paved with the same tile : the ceiling, 
and all the plastering work in the whole house, 
were of the same earth ; and, after all, the roof 
was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep 
shining black. This was a China-warehouse, in- 
deed, truly and literally to be called so, and had I 
not been upon the journey, I could have staid some 
days to see and examine the particulars of it. They 

2 A 



266 ADVENTURES Of 

told me there were fountains and fish-ponds in the 
garden, all paved on the bottom and sides with the 
same : and fine statues set up in rows on the walks, 
entirely formed of the porcelain earth, and burned 
whole. 

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they 
may be allowed to excel in it ; but I am very sure 
they excel in their accounts of it ; for they told me 
Such incredible things of their performance in 
crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to re- 
late, as knowing it could not be true. They told 
me, in particular, of one workman that made a ship 
with all its tackle, and masts and sails, in earthen- 
ware, big enough to carry fifty men. If they had 
told me he launched it, and made a voyage to Japan 
in it, I might have said something to it, indeed ; 
but as it was, I knew the whole of the story, which 
was, in short, asking pardon for the word, that the 
fellow lied ; so I smiled, and said nothing to it. 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the ca- 
ravan, for which the leader of it for the day fined 
me about the value of three shillings; and told me, 
if it had been three days journey without the wall, 
as it was three days within, he must have fined me 
four times as much, and made nie ask pardon the 
next council day : I promised to be more orderly ; 
and, indeed, I found afterwards the orders made 
for keeping all together were absolutely necessary 
for our common safety. 

In two days more we passed the great China wall, 
made for a fortification against the Tartars ; and a 
very great work it is, going over hills and moun- 
tains in a needless track, where the rocks are im- 
passable, and the precipices such as no enemy could 
possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or where, if they 
did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us its 
length is near a thousand English miles, but that 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 267 

the country is five hundred in a straight measured 
line, which the wall bounds, without measuring the 
windings and turnings it takes; it is about four fa- 
thoms high, and as many thick in some places. 

I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without tres- 
passing our orders (for so long the caravan was in 
passing the gate) to look at it on every side, near 
and far off, I mean that was within my view ; and 
the guide of our caravan, who had been extolling it 
for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager to 
hear my opinion of it. I told him it was a most ex- 
cellent thing to keep out the Tartars ; which he 
happened not to understand as I meant it, and so 
took it for a compliment; but the old pilot laughed; 
O, seignior Inglese, says he, you speak in colours. — 
In colours ! said I ; what do you mean by that ? — 
Why you speak what looks white this way, and 
black that way ; gay one way, and dull another. 
You tell him it is a good wall to keep out Tartars ; 
you tell me by that it is good for nothing but to 
keep out Tartars. I understand you, seignior In- 
glese ; I understand you ; but seignior Chinese un- 
derstood you his own way. — Well, says I, seignior, 
do you think it would stand out an army of our 
country people, with a good train of artillery, or 
our engineers, with two companies of miners ? 
Would not they batter it down in ten days, that an 
army might enter in battalia ; or blow it up in the 
air, foundation and all, that there should be no 
sign of it left ? — Aye, aye, says he, I know that. 
The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said, 
and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after, 
for we were then almost out of their country, and 
he was to leave us in a little time after this ; but 
when he knew what 1 said, he was dumb all the 
rest of the way, and we heard no more of his fine

538 ADVENTURES OF 

Story of the Chinese power and greatness while he 
staid. 

After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, 
something like the Picts' wall, so famous in North- 
umberland, built by the Romans, we began to 
find the country thinly inhabited, and the people 
rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities, 
as being subject to the inroads and depredations of 
the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and therefore 
are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an 
open country. And here I began to find the neces- 
sity of keeping together in a caravan as we travel- 
led, for we saw several troops of Tartars roving 
about ; but when I came to see them distinctly, 1 
wondered more that the Chinese empire could be 
conquered by such contemptible fellows ; for they 
are a mere horde of wild fellows, keeping no order, 
and understanding no discipline or manner of fight. 
Their horses are poor lean creatures, taught notlnng, 
and fit for nothing ; and this we found the first day 
we saw them, which was after we entered the wilder 
part of the country. Our leader for the day gave 
leave for about sixteen of us to go a-hunting, as 
they call it, and what was this but hunting of sheep ; 
however, it may be called hunting too, for the crea- 
tures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I 
saw of their kind ; only they will not run a great 
way, and you are sure of sport when you begin the 
chase, for they appear generally thirty or forty in a 
flock, and, like true sheep, always keep together 
when they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our 
hap to meet with about forty Tartars; whether they 
were hunting mutton as we were, or whether they 
looked for another kind of prey, we knew not ; but 
as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 269 

horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I 
had never heard before, and, by the way, never 
care to hear again ; we all supposed this was to call 
their friends about them, and so it was ; for in less 
than ten minutes a troop of forty or fifty more ap- 
peared at about a mile distance ; but our work was 
over first, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened 
to be amongst us, and as soon as he heard the horn 
he told us that we had nothing to do but to charge 
them immediately, without loss of time ; and draw- 
ing us up in a line, he asked if we were resolved. 
"We told him we were ready to follow him ; so l^e 
rode directly towards them. They stood gazing at 
us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor 
showing the face of any order at all ; but as soon 
as they saw us advance, they let fly their arrows, 
which, however, missed us very happily : it seems 
they mistook not their aim, but their distance ; for 
their arrows all fell a little short of us, but with so 
true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards 
nearer, we must have had several men wounded, if 
not killed. 

Immediately we halted, and though it was at a 
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bul- 
lets for wooden arrows, following our shot full gal- 
lop, to fall in among them sword in hand, for so 
our bold Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed, 
but a merchant, but he behaved with that vigour 
and bravery on this occasion, and yet with such 
cool courage too, that I never saw any man in ac- 
tion fitter for command. As soon as we came up 
to them, we fired our pistols in their faces, and 
then drew ; but they fled in the greatest confusion 
imaginable. The only stand any of them made was 
on our right, where three of them stood, and, by 
signs, called the rest to come back to them, having

a kind of scimitar in their hands, and their bows 
hanging to tlieir backs. Our brave commander, 
without asking any body to follow him, gallops up 
close to them, and with his fusee knocks one of 
them oif his horse, killed the second with his pistol, 
and the third ran away ; and thus ended our fight : 
but we had this misfortune attending it, that all our 
mutton we had in chase got away. We had not a 
man killed or hurt; but as for the Tartars, there 
were about five of them killed ; how many were 
wounded we knew not ; but this we knew, that the 
other party were so frightened with the noise of 
our guns, that they made off, and never made any 
attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, 
and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after- 
wards ; but in about five days we entered a vast, 
great, wild desert, which held us three days and 
nights' march ; and we were obliged to carry our 
water with us in great leathern bottles, and to en- 
camp all night, just as I have heard they do in the 
desert of Arabia. 

I asked our guides whose dominion this was in ; 
and they told me this was a kind of border, that 
might be called no man's land, being a part of Great 
Karakathay, or Grand Tartary ; but. however, it 
was all reckoned as belonging to C'hina, but that 
there was no care taken here to preserve it from the 
inroads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned 
the worst desert in the whole march, though we 
were to go over some much larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which was at first 
very frightful to mc, we saw, two or three timts. 
little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be 
upon their own affairs, and to have no design upon 
us : and so, like the man who met the devil, if thL>y 
had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to 

3 



ROBINSOK CRUSOI. 271 

them ; we let them go. Once, however, a party of 
them came so near as to stand and gaze at us ; whe- 
ther it was to consider if they should attack us or 
not, we knew not; but when we were passed at 
some distance by them, we made a rear guard of 
forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the 
earavan pass half a mile or thereabouts before us : 
but after a while they marched off; only we found 
they saluted us with five arrows at their parting, 
one of which wounded a horse, so that it disabled 
him, and we left him the next day, poor creature, 
in great need of a good farrier : they might shoot 
more arrows, which might fall short of us, but we 
saw no more arrows or Tartars that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways 
not being so good as at first, though still in the do- 
minions of the emperor of China, but lay for the 
most part in villages, some of which were fortified, 
because of the incursions of the Tartars. When we 
were come to one of these towns (it was about two 
days and a half journey before we were to come to 
the city of Naum), I wanted to buy a camel, of 
Avhich there are plenty to be sold all the way upon 
that road, and horses also, such as they are, because 
so many caravans coming that way they are often 
wanted. The person that I spoke to, to get me a 
camel, would have gone and fetched one for me; 
but 1, like a fool, must be officious, and go myself 
along with him : the place was about two miles out 
of the village, where it seems they kept the camels 
and horses feeding under a guard. 

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and a Chi- 
nese, being very desirous of a little variety. W' hen 
we came to the place, it was a low marshy ground, 
walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry, with- 
out mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a 
little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Having 



272 ADVENTURES OF 

bought a camel, and agreed for the price, I came 
away, and the Chineseman that went with me led 
the camel, when on a sudden came up five Tartars 
on horseback ; two of them seized the fellow and 
took the camel from him, while the other three 
stepped up to me and my old pilot, seeing us, as 
it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me 
but my sword, which could but ill defend me against 
three horsemen. The first that came up stopped 
short upon my drawing my sword, for they are ar- 
rant cowards ; but a second coming upon my left, 
gave me a blow on the head, which 1 never felt till 
afterwards, and wondered, when I came to myself, 
what was the matter, and where I was, for he laid 
me flat on the ground ? but my never-failing old 
pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, unlooked for, 
directs deliverances from dangers which to us are 
unforeseen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I 
knew nothing of, nor the Tartars neither ; if they 
had, I suppose they would not have attacked us ; 
but cowards are always boldest when there is no 
danger. The old man seeing me down, with a bold 
heart stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, 
and laying hold of his arm with one hand, and pull- 
ing him down by main force a little towards him 
with the other, shot him in the head, and laid him 
dead upon the spot. He then immediately stepped 
up to him who had stopped us, as I said, and before 
he could come forward again, made a blow at him 
with a scimitar which he always wore, but missing 
the man, cut his horse in the side of his head, cut 
one of the ears off by the root, and a great slice 
down by the side of his face. The poor beast, en- 
raged with the wound, was no more to be governed 
by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough too, 
but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the 
pilot's reach ; and at some distance rising upon his 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 273 

hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell upon 
him. 

Irt tKis interval, the poor Chinese came in wh® 
Iiad lost the camel, but he had no weapon : how- 
ever, seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen 
Hpon him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon 
an Hgly ill-favoured weapon he had by his side, 
something like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe nei- 
ther, he wrenched it from him, and made shift to 
knock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my 
©Id man had the third Tartar to deal with still ; and 
seeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor come on 
to fight him, as he apprehended, but stand stock- 
still, the old man stood still too, and fell to work 
with his tackle, to charge his pistol again ; but as 
soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, away he scoured, 
and left my pilot, my champion I called him after- 
wards, a complete victory. 

By this time I was a little recovered; for I thought 
when I first began to wake, that I had been in a 
. sweet sleep ; but, as 1 said above, I wondered where 
I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was 
the matter ; but a few moments after, as sense re- 
sumed, I felt pain, though I did not know where ; 
to I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away 
bloody ; then 1 felt my head ache ; and then, in a 
moment, memory returned, and every thing was 
present to me again. 1 jumped upon my feet in- 
stantly, and got hold of my sword, but na enemies 
in. view : I found a Tartar He dead, and his horse 
standing very quietly by him ; and, looking fartlier, 
1 saw my champion and deliverer, who had been to 
see what the Chinese had done, coming back with 
his hanger in his hand : the oW man, seeing me on 
my feet, came running to me, and embraced me 
with a gi-eat deal of joy, being afraid before that I 
had been killed ; and seeing me bloody, would see 



274 ADVENTUIIES OX' 

how I was hurt ; but it was not much, only what 
we call a broken head ; neither did I afterwards find 
any great inconvenience from the blow, for it was 
well again in two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, 
for we lost a camel and gained a horse ; but that 
which was remarkable, when we came back to the 
village, the man demanded to be paid for the camel ; 
I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before 
the Chinese judge of the place. To give him his 
due, he acted with a great deal of prudence and im- 
partiality ; and, having heard both sides, he gravely 
asked the Chinese man that went with me to buy 
the camel, whose servant he was ? I am no servant, 
says he, but went with the stranger. — At whose re- 
quest? says the justice. At the stranger's request, 
says he. Why then, says the justice, you were the 
stranger's servant for the time ; and the camel being 
delivered to his servant, it was delivered to him, 
and he must pay for it. 

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not 
a word to say : but, admiring to see such just rea- 
soning upon the consequence, and an accurate 
stating of the case, 1 paid willingly for the camel, 
and sent for another ; but, you may observe, I did 
not go to fetch it myself any more, for I had had 
enough of that. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese 
empire ; tliey call it fortified, and so it is, as forti- 
fications go there ; for this 1 will venture to affirn), 
that all the Tartars in Karakathay, which, I be- 
lieve, are some millions, could not batter down the 
walls with their bows and arrows ; but to call it 
strong, if it were attacked with cannon, would be 
to make those who understand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' jour- 
ney of this city, when messengers were sent express 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 275 

to every part of the road to tell all travellers and 
caravans to halt till they had a guard sent for them ; 
for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten 
thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about 
thirty miles beyond the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers ; however, 
it was carefully done of the governor, and we were 
very glad to hear we should have a guard. Accord- 
ingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers 
sent us from a garrison of the Chinese, on our left, 
and three hundred more from the city of Naum, 
and with these we advanced boldly ; the three hun- 
dred soldiers from Naum marched in our front, the 
two hundred in our rear, and our men on each side 
of our camels, with our baggage, and the whole 
caravan in the centre ; in this order, and well pre- 
pared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for 
the whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had 
appeared ; but the next day, when they did ap- 
pear, it was quite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when, marching 
from a well situated little town, called Changu, we 
had a river to pass, which we were obliged to ferry ; 
and, had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had 
been the time to have attacked us, when the cara- 
van being over, the rear guard was behind ; but 
they did not appear there. About three hours after, 
when we were entered upon a desert of about fifteen 
or sixteen miles over, behold, by a cloud of dust 
they raised, we saw an enemy was at hand ; and 
they were at hand, indeed, for they came on upon 
the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had 
talked so big the day before, began to stagger ; and 
the soldiers frequently looked behind them, which 
is a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to 
run away. My old pilot was of my mind ; and, 



276 ADVENTURES OF 

being near me, called out, Si-'ignior Inges, says he, 
those fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin 
us all; for if the Tartars come on, they will never 
stand it. — I am of your mind, said I ; but what must 
be done ? — Done ! says he, let fifty of our men ad- 
vance, and flank them on each wing, and encourage 
them; and they will fight like brave fellows, in 
brave company ; but, without this, they will every 
man turn his back. Immediately I rode up to our 
leader, and told him, who was exactly of our mind; 
and accordingly fifty ol" us marched to the right 
wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest made a line 
of rescue; and so we marched, leaving the last two 
hundred men to make a body by themselves, and to 
guard the camels ; only that, if need were, they 
should send a hundred men to assist the last fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innu- 
merable company they were : how manv we could 
not tell, but ten thousand, we thought, was the 
least : a party of them came on first and viewed our 

f)OSture, traversing the ground in the front of our 
ine; and, as we found them within gun-shot, our 
leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and 
give them a salvo on each wing with their shot, which 
was done ; but they went off", and I suppose back, 
to give an account of the reception they were like 
to meet with; and, indeed, that salute cloyed their 
stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood awhile 
to consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they 
gave over their design, and said no more to us for 
that time ; which was very agreeable to our ciixum- 
stances, which were but very indifferent for a battle 
with such a number. 

Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or 
Naum; we thanked the governor for his care of us, 
and collected to the value of a hundred crowns, or 
thereabouts, which we gave to the soldierji sent to 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 277 

guard us ; and here we rested one day. This is a 
garrison, indeed, and there were nine hundred sol- 
diers kept here ; but the reason of it was, that for- 
merly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them 
than they now do, the Muscovites having aban- 
doned that part of the country, which lies from this 
city west for about two hundred miles, as desolate 
and unfit for use; and more especially being so 
very remote, and so difficult to send troops thither 
for its defence : for we had yet above two thousand 
miles to Moscovy, properly so called. 

After this we passed several great rivers, and two 
dreadful deserts ; one of which we were sixteen 
days passing over ; and which, as I said, was to be 
called no man's land ; and, on the 13ih of April, we 
came to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. 
I think the first town, or fortress, whichever it may 
be called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, 
was called Arguna, being on the west side of the 
river Arguna. 

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction 
that I was so soon arrived in, as I called it, a Chris- 
tian country, or, at least, in a country governed by 
Christians ; for though the Muscovites do, in my 
opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians, yet 
such they pretend to be, and are very devout in 
their way. It would certainly occur to any man 
who travels the world as I have done, and who had 
any power of reflection, what a blessing it is to be 
brought into the world where the name of God and 
a Redeemer is known, adored, and worshipped; and 
not where the people, given up by Heaven to strong 
delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate them- 
selves to stocks and stones ; worship monsters, ele- 
ments, horrid-shaped animals, and statues or images 
of monsters. Not a town or city we passed through 
but had their pagods, their idols, and their temples, 

2b 



278 ADVENTURES OF 

and ignorant people worshipping even the works of 
their own hands. Now we came where, at least, 
a face of the Christian worship appeared; where the 
knee was bowed to Jesus ; and whether ignorantly 
or not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and 
the name of the true God was called upon and 
adored, and it made my soul rejoice to see it. I 
saluted the brave Scots merchant I mentioned 
above with my first acknowledgement of this ; and 
taking him by the hand, I said to him, Blessed be 
God, we are once again amongst Christians. He 
smiled, and answered. Do not rejoice too soon, 
countryman ; these Muscovites are but an odd sort 
of Christians ; and but for the name of it, you may 
see very little of the substance for some months far- 
ther of our journey. Well, says I, but still it is 
better than paganism and worshipping of devils. — 
Why, I will tell you, says he, except the Russian 
soldiers in the garrisons, and a few of the inhabit- 
ants of the cities upon the road, all the rest of this 
country, for above a thousand miles farther, is in- 
habited by the worst and most ignorant of pagans : 
and so, indeed, we found it. 

We were now launched into the greatest piece of 
solid earth, if I understand any thing of the surface 
of the globe, that is to be found in any part of the 
world ; we had, at least, tw elvc thousand miles to 
the sea, eastward ; two thousand to the bottom of 
the Baltic sea, westward ; and above three thousand, 
if we left that sea and went on west, to the British 
and French channels ; we had full five thousand 
miles to the Indian or Persian sea, south; and about 
eight hundred to the Frozen sea, north. Nay, if 
some people may be believed, there might be no sea, 
north-east, till we came round the pole, and con- 
sequently into the north-west, and so had a continent 
of land into America, the Lord knows where; though 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 279 

I could give some reasons why I believe that to be 
a mistake. 

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a 
good while before we came to any considerable towns, 
we had nothing to observe there but this; first, that 
all the rivers run to the east : as I understood by 
the charts, which some in our caravan had with 
them, it was plain all those rivers ran into the great 
river Yamour, or Gamour; which river, by the 
natural course of it, must run into the East sea, or 
Chinese Ocean. The story they tell us, that the 
mouth of this river is choked up with bulrushes of 
a monstrous growth, viz. three feet about, and 
twenty or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to say, 
I believe nothing of it ; but, as its navigation is of 
no use, because there is no trade that way, the Tar- 
tars, to whom it alone belongs, dealing in nothing 
but cattle, so nobody, that ever I heard of, has 
been curious enough either to go down to the mouth 
of it in boats, or come up from the mouth of it in 
ships, as far as I can find : but this is certain, that 
this river running east, in the latitude of about fifty 
degrees, carries a vast concourse of rivers along with 
it, and finds an ocean to empty itself in that latitude ; 
so we are sure of sea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are 
several considerable rivers, whose streams run as 
due north as the Yamour runs east, and these are 
all found to join their waters with the great river 
Tartarus, named so from the northernmost nations 
of the Mogul Tartars; who, as the Chinese say, 
were the first Tartars in the world ; and, who, as 
our geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog 
mentioned in sacred story. These rivers running 
all northward, as well as all the other rivers I am 
yet to speak of, make it evident that the northern 
ocean bounds the land also on that side ; so that it 

2b2 



280 ADVENTURES OF 

does not seem rational in the least to think that the 
land can extend itself to join with America on that 
side, or that there is not a communication between 
the northern and eastern ocean : but of this I shall 
say no more; it was my observation at that time, 
and therefore I take notice of it in this place. 

We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy 
and moderate journeys, and were very visibly obliged 
to the care the Czar of Muscovy has taken to have 
cities and towns built in as many places as it is pos- 
sible to place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, 
something like the stationary soldiers placed by the 
Romans in the remotest countries of their empire ; 
some of which that 1 had read of were placed in 
Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the 
lodging travellers : and thus it was here ; for where- 
€ver we came, though at these towns and stations 
the garrisons and governors were Russians and pro- 
fessed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pa- 
gans; sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the sun, 
moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven ; and not 
only so, but were, of all the heathens and pagans 
that ever I met with, the most barbarous, except 
only that they did noteat men's flesh, as our savages 
of America did. 

Some instances of this we met with in the country 
between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite do- 
minions, and a city of Tartars and Russians to- 
gether, called Nortziousky, in which is a continued 
desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to travel 
over. In a village, near the last of these places, I 
had the curiosity to go and see their way of living, 
which is most brutish and unsutterable : they had, 
I suppose, a great sacrifice that day : for there stood 
out, upon an old stump of a tree, an idol made of 
wood, frightful as the devil ; at least, as any thing 
we can think of to represent the devil can be made : 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 281 

it had a head not so much as resembling any crea- 
ture that the world ever saw ; ears as big as goats' 
horns, and as high ; eyes as big as a crown-piece ; 
a nose like a crooked ram's horn, and a mouth ex- 
tended four-cornered; like that of a lion, with hor- 
rible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under-bill : it was 
dressed up in the filthiest manner that you could 
suppose: its upper garment was of sheep-skins, with 
the wool outward ; a great Tartar bonnet on the 
head, with two horns growing through it : it was 
about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor 
any other proportion of parts. 

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the 
village ; and, when I came near to it, there were 
sixteen or seventeen creatures, whether men or 
women I could not tell, for they made no distinction 
by their habits, all laying flat upon the groundround 
this formidable block of shapeless wood : I saw no 
motion among them any more than if they had been 
all logs of wood, like the idol, and at first I really 
thought they had been so ; but, when I came a little 
nearer, they started up upon their feet, and raised 
a howling cry as if it had been so many deep- 
mouthed hounds, and walked away, as if they were 
displeased at our disturbing them. A little way off 
from the idol, and at the door of a tent or hut, 
made all of sheep-skins and cow-skins dried, stood 
three butchers, — I thought they were such ; when 
I came nearer to them, 1 found they had long knives 
in their hands ; and in the middle of the tent ap- 
peared three sheep killed, and one young bullock 
or steer. These, it seems, were sacrifices to that 
senseless log of an idol ; the three men were priests 
belonging to it, and the seventeen prostrated wretches 
were the people who brought the offering, and were 
making their prayers to that stock. 

I confess, I was more moved at their stupidity 
2 B 3 



282 ADVENTUKES OF 

and brutish worship of a hobgoblin tlian ever I was 
at any thing in my Hfe ; to see God's most glorious 
and best creature, to whom he had granted so many 
advantages, even by creation above the rest of the 
works of his hands, vested with a reasonable soul, 
and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities 
adapted both to honour his Maker and be honoured 
by him, sunk and degenerated to a degree so very 
stupid as to prostrate itself to a frightful nothing, a 
mere imaginary object, dressed up by themselves, 
and made terrible to themselves by their own con- 
trivance, adorned only with clouts and rags ; and 
that this should be the effect of mere ignorance, 
wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil him- 
self; who, envying to his Maker the homage and 
adoration of his creatures, had deluded them into 
such sordid and brutish things as one would think 
should shock nature itself! 

But what signified all the astonishment and re- 
flection of thoughts ; thus it was, and 1 saw it be- 
fore my eyes, and there was no room to wonder at 
it, or think it impossible: all my admiration turned 
to rage, and I rode up to the image or monster, 
call it what you will, and with my sword made a 
stroke at the bonnet that was on its head, and cut 
it in two; and one of our men that was with me 
took hold of the sheep-skin that covered it, and 
pulled at it; when, behold, a n)ost hideous outcry 
and howling ran through the village, and two or 
three hundred people came about my ears, so that 
I was glad to scour for it, for we saw some had 
bows and arrows ; but 1 resolved from that moment 
to visit them again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, 
which was about four miles off', in order to provide 
some horses which they wanted, several of the horses 
having been lamed and jaded with the badness of 



I 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 283 

the way, and long march over the last desert ; so 
we had some leisure here to put my design in execu- 
tion. I communicated my design to the Scots mer- 
chant of Moscow, of whose courage I had sufficient 
testimony : I told him what 1 had seen, and with 
what indignation I had since thought that human 
nature could be so degenerate ; I told him, if I could 
get but four or five men well armed to go with me, 
I was resolved to go and destroy that vile, abomina- 
ble idol, and let them see that it had no power to 
help itself, and consequently could not be an ob- 
ject of worship, or to be prayed to, much less help 
them that offered sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me : — says he, Your zeal may be 
good, but what do you propose to yourself by it? — 
Propose ! said I, to vindicate the honour of God, 
which is insulted by this devil-worship. — But how 
will it vindicate the honour of God, said he, while 
the people will not be able to know what you mean 
by it, unless you could speak to them, and tell them 
so ? and then they will fight you, and beat you too, 
I'll assure you ; for they are desperate fellows, and 
that especially in defence of their idolatry. — Can we 
not, said I, do it in the night, and then leave them 
the reasons and the causes in writing in their own 
language ? — VV'riting ! said he ; why there is not a 
man in five nations of them that knows any thing 
of a letter, or how to read a word any way. — 
Wretched ignorance ! said I to him : however, I 
have a great mind to do it ; perhaps nature may 
draw inferences from it to them, to let them see how 

bruti^h they are to worship such horrid things 

Look you, sir, said he, if your zeal prompts you to 
it so warmly, you must do it; but in the next 
place 1 would have you consider, these wild nations 
of people are subjected by force to the Czar of Mus- 
covy's dominions, and if you do this, it is ten to one 



28t ADVENTURES OF 

but they will come by thousands to the governor of 
Nertsinkay, and demand satisfaction; and if he can- 
not give them satisfaction, it is ten to one but they 
revolt; and it will occasion a new war with all the 
Tartars in the country. 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head 
for awhile, but I harped upon the same siring still ; 
and all that day 1 was uneasy to put my project in 
execution. Towards the evening the Scots mer- 
chant met me by accident in our walk about the 
town, and desired to speak with me; I believe, said 
he, I have put you off your good design ; I have 
been a little concerned about it since ; for I abhor 
idolatry as much as you can do. — Truly, said-1, you 
have put it off a little, as to the execution of it, but 
you have not put it out of my thoughts; and I be- 
lieve I shall do it before I quit this place, though I 
were to be delivered up to them for satisfaction. — 
No, no, said he, God forbid they should deliver you 
up to such a crew of monsters ! they shall not do 
that, neither ; that would be murdering you in- 
deed. — Why, said I, how would they use me ? — Use 
you ! said he, I'll tell you how they served a poor 
Russian, who affronted them in their worship, just 
as you did, and whom they took prisoner, after they 
had lamed him with an arrow, that he could not 
run away : they took him and stripped him stark- 
naked, and set him upon the top of the idol-monster, 
and stood all round him, and shot as many arrows 
into him as would stick over his whole body ; and 
then they burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in 
him, as a sacrifice to the idol. — And was this the 
same idol ^ said I. Yes, said he, the very same. — 
Well, said I, I will tell you a story. So I related 
the story of our men at Madagascar, and how they 
burnt and sacked the village there, and killed man, 
woman, and child, for their murdering one of our 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 285 

men, just as it is related before; and I added, that 
I thought we ought to do so to this village. 

He listened very attentively to the story; but 
when I talked of doing so to that village, said he, 
You mistake very much ; it was not this village, it 
was almost a hundred miles from this place ; but it 
was the same idol, for they carry him about ia pro- 
cession all over the country. — Well, said I, then tiiat 
idol ought to be punished for it; and it shall, said 
I, if I live this night out. 

In a word, finding me resoJute, he liked the de- 
sign, and told me 1 should not go alone, but he 
would go with me, but he would go first and bring 
a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also 
with us ; and one, said he, as famous for his zeal as 
you can desire any one to be against such devilish 
things as these. In a word, he brought me his 
comrade, a Scotsman, whom he called captain Rich- 
ardson ; and I gave him a full account of what 1 had 
seen, and also what 1 intended ; and he told me 
readily, he would go with me if it cost him his life. 
So we agreed to go, only we three. I had, indeed, 
proposed it to my partner, but he declined it. He 
said, he was ready to assist me to the utmost, and 
upon all occasions, for my defence; but this was an 
adventure quite out of his way ; so, 1 say, we re- 
solved upon our work, only we three and my man- 
servant, and to put it in execution that night about 
midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable. 

However, upon second thoughts we were willing 
to delay it till the next night, because, the caravan 
being to set forward in the morning, we supposed 
the governor could not pretend to give them any 
satisfaction upon us when we were out of his 
power. The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolu- 
tion for the enterprise, as bold in executing, brought 
me a Tartar's robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a 



286 ADVENTURES OF 

bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had provided 
the same for himself and his countryman, that the 
people, if they saw us, should not determine who 
we were. 

All the first night we spent in mixing up some 
combustible matter with aqua vitae, gunpoAvder, and 
such other materials as we could get ; and, having 
a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour 
after night we set out upon our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at 
night, and found that the people Imd not the least 
jealousy of danger attending their idol. The night 
was cloudy ; yet the moon gave us light enough to 
see that the idol stood just in the same posture and 
place that it did before. The people seemed to be 
all at their rest; onl)-^, that in the great hut, or lent, 
as we called it, where we saw the three priests whom 
we mistook for but<:hers, we saw a light ; and going 
up close to the door, we heard people talking as if 
there were five or six of them ; we concluded, there- 
fore, that if we set wildfire to the idol, these men 
would come out immediately and run up to the 
place to rescue it from the destruction that we in- 
tended for it; and what to do with them we knew 
not. Once we thought of carrying it away and set- 
ting fire to it at a distance, but when we came to 
handle it, we found it too bulky for our carriage ; 
so we were at a loss again. The second Scotsman 
was for setting fire to the tent or hut, and knock- 
ing the creatures that were there on the head, when 
they came out: but I could not join with that ; I 
was against killing them, if it were possible to avoid 
it. Well, then, said the Scots merchant, I will tell 
you what we will do : we will try to make them 
prisoners, tie their hands, and make them stand 
and see their idol destroyed. 

As it happened, we had twine or packthread 



ROBINSON CIIUSOE. 287 

enough about us, which we used to tie our firelocks 
together with; so we resolved to attack these peo- 
ple first, and with as little noiseas we could. The 
first thing we did, we knocked at the door, when, 
one of the priests coming to it, we immediately 
seized upon him, stopped his mouth and tied his 
hands behind him, and led him to the idol, where 
we gagged him that he might not make a noise, 
tied his feet also together, and left him on the 
ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting 
that another would come out, to see what the mat- 
ter was ; but we waited so long till the third man 
came back to us; and then nobody coming out, we 
knocked again gently, and immediately out came 
two n}ore, and we served them just in the same 
manner, but were obliged to go all with them, and 
lay them down by the idol some distance from one 
another; when going back we found two more 
were come out to the door, and a third stood be- 
hind them within the door. We seized the two, 
and immediately tied them, when the third step- 
ping back, and^crying out, my Scots merchant went 
in after him, and, taking out a composition we had 
made, that would only smoke and stink, he set fire 
to it and threw it in among them : by that time the 
other Scotsman and my man, taking charge of the 
two men already bound, and tied together also by 
the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them 
there to see if their idol would relieve them, making 
haste back to us. 

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the 
hut with so much smoke that they were almost suf- 
focated, we then threw in a small leather bag of 
another kind, which flamed like a candle, and fol- 
lowing it in, v/e found there were but four people, 
and, as we supposed, had been about some of their 



288 ADVENTURES OV 

diaboUcsacrifices. They appeared, in short, frighten- 
ed to death, at least so as to sit trembh'ng and stupid, 
and not able to speak neither, for the smoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had- 
done the other, and all without any noise. I should 
have said we brought them out of the house, or hut, 
first; for indeed we were not able to bear the smoke 
any more than they were. When we had done this, 
we carried them all together to the idol : when we 
came there we fell to work with him; and first we 
daubed him all over, and his robes also, with tar, 
and such other stuff as we had, which was tallow 
mixed with brimstone : then we stopped his eyes 
and ears and mouth full of gunpowder ; then we 
wrapped up a great piece of wild-fire in his bonnet ; 
and then sticking all the combustibles we had 
brought with us upon him, we looked about to see 
if we could find any thing else to help to burn him ; 
when my Scotsman remembered that by the tent, 
or hut, where the men were, there lay a heap of dry 
forage, whether straw or rushes I do not remem- 
ber; away he and the other Scotsman ran and 
fetched their arms full of that. When we had done 
this, we took all our prisoners, and brought them, 
having untied their feet and ungagged their mouths, 
and made them stand up, and set them before their 
monstrous idol, and then set fire to the whole. 

We staid by it a quarter of an hour, or there- 
abouts, till the powder in the eyes and mouth and 
ears of the idol blew up, and as we could perceive, 
had split and deformed the shape of it : and in a 
word, till we saw it burnt into a mere block or log 
of wood ; and setting dry forage to it, we found it 
would be soon quite consumed ; so we began to 
think of going away ; but the Scotsman said. No, 
we nmst not go, for these poor deluded wretches 
will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn 



( 



a 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 289 

themselves with the idol. So we resolved to stay 
till the forage was burnt down too, and then came 
away and left them. 

After the feat was performed, we appeared in the 
morning among our fellow-travellers, exceedingly 
busy in getting ready for our journey ; nor could 
any man suggest that we had been any where but 
in om- beds, as travellers might be supposed to be, 
to fit themselves for the fatigues of the day's jour- 
iiey. 

But the affair did not end so ; the next day came 
a great number of the country people to the town- 
gates, and in a most outrageous manner demanded 
satisfaction of the Russian governor for the insult- 
ing their priests, and burning their great Cham Chi- 
Thaungu. The people of Nertsinskay were at first 
in a great consternation, for they said the Tartars 
were already no less than thirty thousand strong. 
The Russian governor sent out messengers to ap- 
pease them, and gave them all the good words ima- 
ginable ; assuring them that he knew nothing of 
it, and that there had not a soul in his garrison 
been abroad, so that it could not be from any body 
there ; but if they could let him know who did it, 
they should be exemplarily punished. They return- 
ed haughtily that all the country reverenced the 
great Chapn Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, 
and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to 
his image but some Christian miscreant ; and they 
therefore resolved to denounce war against him and 
all the Russians, who, they said, were miscreants 
and Christians. 

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make 
a breach, or to have any cause of war alleged to be 
given by him, the czar having strictly charged them 
to treat the conquered country with gentleness and 
civility, gave them still all the good words he could 

VOL. XVII. 2 c 



290 ADVENTURES OF 

At last he told them there was a caravan gone to- 
wards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some 
of them who had done them this injury ; and that 
if they would be satisfied with that, he would send 
after them to inquire into it. This seemed to ap- 
pease them a little ; and accordingly the governor 
sent after us, and gave us a particular account how 
the thing was; intimating withal, that if any in our 
caravan had done it, they should make their escape ; 
but that whether we had done it or no, we should 
make all the haste forward that was possible ; and 
that, in the mean time, he would keep them in play 
as long as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor ; however, 
when it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew 
any thing of the matter; and as for us that were guil- 
ty, we were least of all suspected. However, the cap- 
tain of the caravan for the time took the hint that 
the governor gave us, and we travelled two days 
and two nights without any considerable stop, and 
then we lay at a village called Plothus : nor did we 
make any long stay here, but hastened on towards 
Jarawena, another of the Czarof Muscovy's colonies, 
and where we expected we should be safe. But 
upon the second day's march from Plothus, by the 
clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, some 
of our people began to be sensible we were pursued. 
We had entered a great desert, and had passed by 
a great lake called Schaks Oser, when we perceived 
a very great body of horse appear on the other side 
of the lake, to the north, we travelling west. We 
observed they went away west, as we did, but had 
supposed we would have taken that side of the lake, 
whereas we very happily took the south side ; and 
in two days more they disappeared again : for they 
believing we were still before them, pushed on till 
they came to the river Udda, a very great river when 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 291 

it passes further north, but when we came to it we 
found it narrow and fordable. 

The third day, they had either found their mis- 
take, or had intelligence of us, and came pouring 
in upon us towards the dusk of the evening. We 
had, to our great satisfaction, just pitched upon a 
place for our camp, which was very convenient for 
the night ; but as we were upon a desert, though 
but at the beginning of it, that was above five hun- 
dred miles over, we had no towns to lodge at, and, 
indeed, expected none but the city Jarawena, which 
we had yet two days' march to ; the desert, how- 
ever, had some few woods in it on this side, and 
little rivers, which ran all into the great river Udda ; 
it was in a narrow strait, between little, but very 
thick, woods, that we pitched our little camp for that 
night, expecting to be attacked before morning. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pur- 
sued for : but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars 
to go about in troops in that desert, so the caravans 
always fortify themselves every night against them, 
as against armies of robbers ; and it was therefore 
no new thing to be pursued. 

But we had this night, of all the nights of our 
travels, a most advantageous camp ; for we lay be- 
tween two woods, with a little rivulet running just 
before our front, so that we could not be surround- 
ed, or attacked any way but in our front or rear. 
We took care also to make our front as strong as we 
could, by placing our packs, with our camels and 
horses, all in a line, on the inside of the river, .and 
felling some trees in our rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night ; but 
the enemy was upon us before we had finished our 
situation. They did not come on us like thieves, as 
we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to de- 
mand the men to be delivered to them that had 

2c2 



292 ADVENTURES OF 

abused their priests, and burned their god Cham 
Chi-Thaungu vi'ith fire, that they niiglit burn them 
with fire ; and upon this, they said, they would go 
away, and do us no farther harm, otherwise they 
would destroy us all. Our men looked very blank 
at this message, and began to stare at one another, 
to see who looked with the most guilt in their faces : 
but, nobody was the word ; nobody did it. The 
leader of the caravan sent word he was well assured 
that it was not done by any of our camp;- that we 
were peaceable merchants, travelling on our busi- 
ness ; that we had done no harm to them or to any 
one else ; and that, therefore, they must look far- 
ther for their enemies who had injured them, for 
we were not the people : so desired them not to 
disturb us, for, if they did, we should defend our- 
selves. 

They were far from being satisfied with this for 
an answer; and a great crowd of them came run- 
ning down in the morning, by break of day, to our 
camp; but seeing us in such an unaccountable si- 
tuation, they durst come no farther than the brook 
in our front, where they stood, and shewed us such 
a number that indeed terrified us very much ; for 
those that spoke least of them spoke of ten thou- 
sand. Here they stood and looked at us a while, 
and then setting up a great howl, they let fly a cloud 
of arrows among us ; but we were well enough 
fortified for that, for we sheltered under our bag- 
gage, and I do not remember that one of us was 
hurt. 

Some time after this, wc saw them move a little 
to our right, and expected them on the rear; when 
a cunning fellow, a Cossack of Jarawena, in the 
pay of the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the 
caravan, said to him, I'll go send all these people 
away to Siheilka ; this was a city four or five days," 



ROBINSON CUUSOE. 293 

journey at least to the right, and rather behind us. 
So he takes his bow and arrows, and getting on 
horseback, he rides away from our rear directly, as it 
were back to Nertsinskay ; after this, he takes a 
great circuit about, and comes directly on the army 
of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell 
them a long story, that the people who had burnt 
the Cham Chi-Thaungu were gone to Siheilka, with 
a caravan of miscreants, as he called them, that is 
to say, Christians ; and that they had resolved to 
burn the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Ton- 
gueses. 

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and 
perfectly spoke their language ; he counterfeited so 
well, that they all took it from him, and away they 
drove in a most violent hurry to Siheilka, which, it 
seems, was five days' journey to the north ; and in 
less than three hours they were entirely out of our 
si^ht, and we never heard any more of them, nor 
whether they went to Siheilka or no. So we passed 
away safely on to Jarawena, where there was a gar- 
rison of Muscovites, and there we rested five days 
the caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last 
day's hard march, and with want of rest in the 
night. 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which 
held us twenty-three days' march. We furnished 
ourselves with some tents here, for the better accom- 
modating ourselves in the night ; and the leader 
of the caravan procured sixteen carriages, or wag- 
gons of the country, for carrying our water or pro- 
visions ; and these carriages were our defence every 
night, round our little camp ; so that had the Tar- 
tars appeared, unless they had been very numerous 
indeed, they would not have been able to hurt us. 

We may well be supposed to want rest again after 
2 c 3 



294 ADVENTURES OF 

this long journey : for in this desert we neither saw 
house nor tree, and scarce a bush ; though we saw 
abundance of the sable hunters, who are all Tartars 
of the Mogul Tartary, of which this country is a 
part; and they frequently attack small caravans, 
but we saw no numbers of them together. 

After we had passi^d this desert, we came into a 
country pretty well inhabited ; that is to say, we 
found towns and castles, settled by the Czar of Mus- 
cov}^ with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to pro- 
tect the caravans, and defend the country against 
the Tartars, who would otherwise make it very 
dangerous travelling ; and his czarish majesty has 
given such strict orders for the well guarding the 
caravans and merchants, that, if there are any Tar- 
tars heard of in the country, detachments of the 
garrisons are always sent to see the travellers safe 
from station to station. And thus the governor of 
Adinskoy, whom I had an opportunity to make a 
visit to, i3y means of the Scots merchant, who was 
acquainted with him, offered us a guard of fifty men, 
if we thought there was any danger, to the next 
■station. 

I thought, long before this, that as we came 
nearer to Europe we should find the country better 
inhabited, and the people more civilised ; but I found 
myself mistaken in both ; for we had yet the nation 
of the Tongueses to pass through, where we saw the 
same tokens of paganism and barbarity as before ; 
only, as they were conquered by the Muscovites, 
thoy were not so dangerous ; but for rudeness of 
manners, and idolatry, no people in the world ever 
went beyond them ; tliey are clothed all in skins of 
beasts, and their houses are built of the same ; you 
know not a man from a woman, neither by the rug- 
gedness of their countenances nor their clothes ; and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 295 

in the winter, when the ground is covered with 
snow, they Uve under-ground in vaults, which have 
cavities going from one to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a 
whole village or country, these had idols in every 
hut and every cave : besides, they worship the stars, 
the sun, the water, the snow, and, in a word, every 
thing they do not understand, and they understand 
but very little ; so that every element, every uncom- 
mon thing, sets them a-sacrificing. I met with 
nothing peculiar to myself in all this country, which 
J reckon was, from the desert 1 spoke of last, at least 
four hundred miles, half of it being another desert, 
which took us up twelve days severe travelling with- 
out house or tree ; and we were obliged again to 
carry our own provisions, as well water as bread. 
After we were out of this desert, and had travelled 
two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city 
or station on the great river Janezay, which, they 
told us there, parted Europe from Asia. 

Here I observed ignorance and paganism still pre- 
vailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons ; all the 
country between the river Oby and the river Janezay 
is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, 
as the remotest of the Tartars : nay, as any nation, 
for aught I know, in Asia or America. I also found, 
which 1 observed to the Muscovite governors whom 
I had an opportunity to converse with, that the 
poor pagans are not much wiser, or nearer Chris- 
tianity, for being under the Muscovite government, 
which they acknowledged was true enough; but 
that, as they said, was none of their business ; that 
if the czar expected to convert his Siberian, Tonguese, 
or Tartar subjects, it should be done by sending 
clergymen among them, not soldiers ; and, they 
added, with more sincerity than I expected, that they 
found it was not so much the concern of their 



296 ADVENTURES OF 

monarch to make the people Christians as it was to 
make them subjects. 

From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed 
a wild uncultivated country, barren of people and 
good management, otherwise it is in itself a most 
pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What in- 
habitants we found in it are all pagans, except such 
as are sent among them from Russia: for this is 
the country, I mean on both sides the river Oby, 
whither the Muscovite criminals that are not put 
to death are banished, and from whence it is next 
to impossible they should ever come away. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular 
affairs till I came to Tobolski, the capital city of 
Siberia, where I continued some time on the follow- 
ing occasion. 

We had now been almost seven months on our 
journey, and winter began to come on apace; where- 
upon my partner and I called a council about our 
particular affairs, in which we found it proper, as 
we were bound for England, and not for Moscow, 
to consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told 
us of sledges and rein deer to carry us over the snow 
in the winter time ; and, indeed, they have such 
things that it would be incredible to relate the par- 
ticuhu's of, by which means the Russians travel 
move in the winter than they can in summer, as in 
these sledges they are able to run night and day ; 
the snow being frozen, is one universal covering to 
nature, by which the hills, vales, rivers, and lakes, 
are all smooth and hard as a stone, and they run 
upon the surface, without any regard to what is 
underneath. 

But I iiad no occasion to push at a winter journey 
of this kind ; I was bound to England, not to Mos- 
cow, and my route la}' two ways ; either I must go 
on as the caravan went, till 1 came to Jaroslaw, and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 297 

then go off west for Narva, and the gulf of Finland 
and so to Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my 
China cargo to good advantage ; or I must leave 
the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from 
whence I had but six days by water to Arch-angel, 
and from thence might be sure of shipping either to 
England, Holland, or Hamburgh. 

Now, to go any of these jourr.eys in the winter 
would have been preposterous ; for as to Dantzic, 
the Baltic would have been frozen up, and I could 
not get passage ; and to go by land in those coun- 
tries was far less safe than among the Mogul Tar- 
tars ; likewise, to go lo Archangel in October, all 
the ships would be gone from thence, and even the 
merchants who dwell there in summer retire south 
to Moscow in the winter, when the ships are gone ; 
so that I could have nothing but extremity of cold 
to encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must 
lie in an empty town all the winter : so that, upon 
the whole, I thought it much my better way to let 
the caravan go, and make provision to winter where 
I was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of 
about sixty degrees, where 1 was sure of three 
things to wear out a cold winter with, viz. plenty 
of provisions, such as the country afforded, a warm 
house, with fuel enough, and excellent company. 

I was now in a quite different climate from my 
beloved island, where 1 never felt cold, except when 
I had my ague ; on the contrary, 1 had much to do 
to bear any clothes on my back, and never made 
any fire but without doors, which was necessary for 
dressing my food, &c. Now 1 made me three good 
vests, with large robes or gowns over them, to hang 
down to the feet, and button close to the wrists ; 
and all these lined with furs, to make them suffi- 
ciently warm. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly dis- 



298 ADVENTURES OF 

liked our way in England of making fires in every 
room in the house in open chimneys, which, when 
the fire was out, always kept tlie air in the room 
cold as the climate ; but taking an apartment in a 
good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be 
built like a lurnace, in the centre of six several 
rooms, like a stove ; the funnel to carry the smoke 
went up one way, the door to come at the fire vvcnt 
in another, and all the rooms were kept equally 
warm, but no fire seen, just as they heat the ba- 
gnios in England. By this means, we had always 
the same climate in all the rooms, and an equal 
heat was preserved ; and how cold soever it was 
without, it was always warm within ; and yet we 
saw no fire, nor were ever incommoded with smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it 
should be possible to meet with good company here, 
in a country so barbarous as that of the most north- 
erly parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean, within 
but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla. But this 
being the country where the state criminals of Mus- 
covy, as I observed before, are all banished, this city 
was full of noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers, and cour- 
tiers of Muscovy. Here was the famous prince Gal- 
litzen, the old general llobostiski, and several other 
persons of note, and some ladies. By means of my 
Scots merchant, whom, nevertheless, I parted with 
here, I made an acquaintance with several of these 
gentlemen ; and from these, in the long winter 
nights in which I staid here, I received several very 
agreeable visits. 

It was talking one night with prince , one 

of the banished ministers of state belonging to the 
Czar of Muscovy, that the discourse of my particu- 
lar case began. He had been telling me abundance 
of fine things of the greatness, the magnificence, 
the dominions, and the absolute power of tlie em- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 299 

peror of the Russians: I interrupted him, and told 
him I was a greater and more powerful prince than 
even the Czar of Muscovy was, though my domi- 
nions were not so large, or my people so many. 
The Russian grandee looked a little surprised, and 
fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder 
what i meant. I told him his wonder would cease 
when I liad explained myself. First, I told him I 
had absolute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all 
my subjects; that notwithstanding my absolute 
power, I had not one person disaffected to my go- 
vernment, or to my person, in all my dominions. 
He shook his head at that, and said, there, indeed, 
I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I told him that all 
the lands in my kingdom were my own, and all my 
subjects were not only my tenants, but tenants at 
will ; that they would all fight for me to the last 
drop ; and that never tyrant, for such I acknow- 
ledged myself to be, was ever so universally beloved, 
and yet so horribly feared by his subjects. 

After amusing him with these riddles in govern- 
ment for a while, I opened the case, and told him 
the story at large of my living in the island; and 
how I managed both myself and the people that 
were under me, just as I have since minuted it 
down. They were exceedingly taken with the story, 
and especially the prince, who told me, with a sigh, 
that the true greatness of life was to be masters of 
ourselves; that he would not have exchanged such 
a state of life as mine to be Czar of Muscovy; and 
that he found more felicity in the retirement he 
seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found 
in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of 
his master the czar ; that the height of human wis- 
dom was to bring our tempers down to our circum- 
stances, and to make a calm within, under the 
weight of the greatest storms without. When he 



300 ADVENTURES OF 

came first hither, he eaid he used to tear the hair 
from liis head, and the clothes from his back, as 
others had done before him ; but a httle time and 
consideration had made him look into himself, as 
well as round him, to things without: that he found 
the mind of man, if it was but once brought to re- 
flect upon the state of universal life, and how little 
this world was concerned in its true felicity, was 
perfectly capable of n\aking a felicity for itself, fully 
satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends 
and desires, with but very little assistance from the 
world ; the air to breathe in, food to sustain life, 
clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise, in or 
der to health, completed, in his opinion, all that 
the world could do for us ; and though the great- 
ness, the authority, the riches, and the pleasures 
which some enjoyed in the world, had much in them 
that was agreeable to us, yet all those things chiefly 
gratified the coarsest of our aftV'Ctions, such as our 
ambition, our particular pride, avarice, vanity, and 
sensuality ; all which being the mere product of the 
worst part of man, were in themselves crimes, and 
had in them the seeds of all manner of crimes; but 
neither were related to, nor concerned with, any of 
those virtues that constituted us wise men, or of 
those graces that distinguished us as Christians ; 
that being now deprived of all the fancied felicity 
which he enjoyed in the full exercise of all those 
vices, he said he was at leisure to look upon the dark 
side of them, where he found all manner of de- 
formity, and was now convinced that virtue only 
makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and pre- 
serves him in the way to a superior happiness in a 
future state ; and in this, he said, they were more 
happy in their banishment than all their enemies 
were, who had the full possession of all the wealth 
and power they had left behind thum. Nor, sir,

says he, do I bring my mind to this politically, by 
the necessity of my circumstances, which some call 
miserable; but, if I know any thing of myself, I 
would not now go back, though the czar my ma- 
ster should call me, and reinstate me in all my for- 
mer grandeur: I say, I would no more go back to it 
than 1 believe my soul, when it shall be delivered 
from this prison of the body, and has had a taste of 
the glorious state beyond life, would come back to 
the gaol of flesh and blood it is now inclosed in, 
and leave heaven, to deal in the dirt and crime of 
human affairs. 

He spoke this with so much warmth in his tem- 
per, so m.uch earnestness and motion of his spirits, 
that it was evident it was the true sense of his soul; 
there was no room to doubt his sincerity. I told 
him I once thought myself a kind of monarch in my 
old station, of which 1 had given him an account ; 
but that I thought he was not only a monarch, but 
a great conqueror; for that he that has got a vic- 
tory over his own exorbitant desires, and the ab- 
solute dominion over himself, whose reason entirely 
governs his will, is certainly greater than he that 
conquers a city. But, my lord, said I, shall I take 
the liberty to ask you a question? — With all my 
heart, says he. If the door of your liberty was 
opened, said I, would you not take hold of it to 
deliver you from this exile ! — Hold, said he ; your 
question is subtile, and requires some serious, just 
distinctions, to give it a sincere answer; and I will 
give it you from the bottom of my heart. Nothing 
that 1 know of in this world would move me to de- 
liver myself from this state of banishment, except 
these two ; first, the enjoyment of my relations ; 
and secondly, a little warmer climate : but I pro- 
test to you, that to go back to the pomp of the 
court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a minis- 

VOL. XVII. 2 D 



302 ADVENTURES OF 

ter of state; the wealth, the gaity, and the plea- 
sures of a courtier ; if my master should send me 
word this moment that he restores me to all he ba- 
nished me from, I protest, if I know myself at all, 
I would not leave this wilderness, these deserts, and 
these frozen lakes, for the palace of Moscow. — But, 
my lord, said I, perhaps you not only are banished 
from the pleasures of the court, and from the power, 
authority, and wealth you enjoyed before, but you 
may be absent too from some of the conveniences of 
life ; your estate, perhaps, confiscated, and your ef- 
fects plundered; and the supplies left you here may 
not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life. — 
Aye, says he, that is as you suppose me to be a lord, 
or a prince, &c.; so, indeed I am; but you are 
now to considerme only as a man, a human crea- 
ture, not at all distinguished from another; and so 
I can suffer no want, unless I should be visited with 
sickness and distempers. However, to put the ques- 
tion out of dispute, you see our manner ; we are, 
in this place, five persons of rank; we live perfectly 
retired, as suited to a state of banishment; we have 
something rescued from the shipwreck of our for- 
tunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity of 
hunting for food; but the poor soldiers, who are 
here without that help, live in as nmch plenty as 
we, who go into the woods and catch sables and 
foxes; the labour of a month will maintain tiieni a 
year; and, as the way of living is not expensive, so 
it is not hard to get sufficient to ourselves. So that 
objection is out of doors. 

1 have not room to give a full account of the most 
agreeable conversation 1 had with this truly great 
man; in all which he showed that his mind was so 
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so 
supported by religion, as well as by a vast share of 
wisdom, that his contempt of the world was really 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 303 

as much as he had expressed, and that he was always 
the same to the last, as will appear in the story I 
am going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dread- 
ful winter, I thought it ; the cold so intense that I 
could not so mucli as look abroad without being 
wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur before my face, 
or rather a hood, with only a hole for breath, and 
two for sight: the little day-light we had was, as 
we reckoned, for three months, not above five hours 
a-day, and six at most ; only that the snow lying 
on the ground continually, and the weather clear, 
it was never quite dark. Our horses were kept, or 
rather starved, under-ground, and as for our ser- 
vants, whom we hired here to look after ourselves 
and horses, we had every now and then, their fin- 
gers and toes to thaw and take care of, lest they 
should mortify and fall off. 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses 
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and 
the glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh 
of deer, dried and cured iu the season; bread good 
enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of seve- 
ral sorts, and some flesh of mutton and of the buf- 
faloes, which is pretty good meat. All the stores of 
provisions for the winter are laid up in the summer, 
and well-cured: our drink was water, mixed with 
aqua-vitae instead of brandy; and for a treat, luead 
instead of wine, which, however, they have excel- 
lent good. The hunters, who venture abroad all 
weathers, frequently brought us in fine venison, and 
sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not much care 
for the last. We had a good stock of tea, with which 
we treated our friends, as, above, and we lived very 
cheerfully and well, all things considered. 

It was now March, the day grown considerably 
longer, and the weather at least tolerable ; so the 

2 D 2 



304 ADVENTURES OF 

Other travellers began to prepare sledges to carry 
them over the snow, and to get things ready to be 
going; but my measures being fixed, as I have said, 
for Archangel, and not for Moscovy or the Baltic, 
I made no motion ; knowing very well that the ships 
from the south do not set out for that part of the 
world till May or June, and that if 1 was there by 
the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any 
ships would be ready to go away ; and therefore I 
made no haste to be gone, as others did: in a word, 
I saw a great many people, nay all the travellers, 
go away before me. It seems, every year they go 
from thence to Muscovy for trade, viz. to carry furs, 
and buy necessaries, which they bring back with 
them to furnish their shops: also others went on 
the same errand to Archangel; but then they all 
being to come back again, above eight hundred 
miles, went all out before me. 

In the month of May I began to make all ready 
to pack up; and, as I was doing this, it occurred to 
me that, seeing all these people were banished by 
the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet, when they 
came there, were left at liberty to go whither they 
M^oukl, why they did not then go away to any part 
of the world, wherever they thought fit; and I be- 
gan to examine what should hinder them from mak- 
ing such an attempt. But my wonder was over 
when I entered upon that subject with the person I 
have mentioned, who answered me thus: Consider, 
first, sir, said he, the place where we are; and, 
secondly, the condition we are in; especially the 
generality of the people who are banished hither. 
We are surrounded with stronger things than bars 
or bolts; ou the north side an unnavigable ocean, 
where ship never sailed, and boat never swam; every 
other way, we have above thousand miles to pass 
through the czar's own dominions, and by ways ut- 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 305 

terly impassable, except by the roads made by the 
government, and through the towns garrisoned by 
his troops; so that we could neither pass undisco- 
vered by the road, nor subsist any other way ; so 
that it is in vain to attempt it. 

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that 
they were in a prison every jot as secure as if they 
had been locked up in the castle at Moscow : how- 
ever, it came into my thoughts that I might cer- 
tainly be made an instrument to procure the escape 
of this excellent person ; and that whatever hazard 
1 ran, I would certainly try if I could carry him off. 
Upon this I took an occasion one evening, to tell 
him my thoughts. I represented to him that it was 
very easy for me to carry him away, there being no 
guard over him in the country: and as I was not 
going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I 
went in the retinue of a caravan, by which I was 
not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the de- 
sert, but could encamp every night where I would, 
we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel, 
where I would immediately secure him on board an 
English ship, and carry him safe along with me; 
and as to his subsistence, and other particulars, it 
should be my care, till he could better supply 
himself. 

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly 
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his 
very face that what I said put his spirits into an 
exceeding ferment ; his colour frequently changed, 
his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it 
might be even perceived in his countenance; nor 
could he immediately answer me when I had done, 
and as it were hesitated what he would say to it : 
but after he had paused a little, he embraced me, 
and said, How happy are we, unguarded creatures 
as we are, that even our greatest acts of friendship 

2d3 



S06 ADVENTURES OF 

are made snares unto us, and we are made tempters 
of one another! My dear friend, said he, your offer 
is so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disin- 
terested in itself, and is so calculated for my advan- 
tage, that I must have very little knowledge of the 
world if I did not both wonder at it, and acknow- 
ledge the obligation I have upon me to you for it. 
But did you believe I was sincere in what 1 have 
often said to you of my contempt of the world? Did 
you believe I spoke my very soul to you, and that I 
had really obtained that degree of felicity here that 
had placed me above all that the world could give 
me ? Did you believe I was sincere when I told you 
I would not go back, if 1 was recalled even to be 
all that I once was in the court, with the favour of 
the czar my master? Did you believe me, my friend, 
to be an honest man; or did you believe me to be 
a boasting hypocrite? Here he stopped, as if he 
would hear what I would say ; but, indeed, I soon 
after perceived that he stopped because liis spirits 
were in motion, his great heart was full of struggles, 
and he could not go on. I was, I confess, astonish- 
ed at the thing as well as at the man, and I used 
some arguments with him to urge him to set him- 
self free; that he ought to look upon this as a door 
opened by Heaven for his deliverance, and a sum- 
mons by Providence, who has the care and dispo- 
sition of all events, to do himself good, and to rea- 
der himself useful in the world. 

He had by this time recovered himself; How do 
you know, sir, says he warmly, but that instead of 
summons from Heaven, it may be a feint of another 
instrument; representing in alluring colours to me 
the show of felicity as a deliverance, which may in 
itself be my snare, and tend directly to my ruin ? 
Here I am free from the temptation of returning to 
my former miserable greatness ; there I am not sure 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 307 

but that all the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and 
luxury,which I know remain in nature, may revive and 
take root, and, in a word, again overwhelm me; and 
when the happy prisoner, whom you see now master 
of his soul's liberty, shall be the miseraable slave of 
his own senses, in the full possession of all personal 
liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in this blessed con- 
finement, banished from the crimes of life, rather 
than purchase a show of freedom at the expense of 
the liberty of my reason, and at the future happiness 
which I now have in my view, but shall then, 1 fear, 
quickly lose sight of: for I am but flesh ; a man, 
a mere man ; have passions and atlections as likely 
to possess and overthrow me as any man: O be not 
my friend and tempter both together! 

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, 
and stood silent, looking at him, and, indeed, ad- 
miring what I saw. The struggle in his soul was 
so great, that though the weatlier was extremely 
cold, it put him into a most violent sweat, and I 
found he wanted to give vent to his mind; so I said 
a word or two, that 1 would leave him to consider 
of it, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew 
to my own apartment. 

About two hours after, I heard somebody at or 
near the door of my room, and I was going to open 
the door, but he had opened it, and came in. My 
dear friend, says he, you had almost overset me, but 
I am recovered. Do not take it ill that I do not 
close with your offer; 1 assure you it is not for want 
of sense of the kindness of it in you-, and I came 
to make the most sincere acknowledgment of it to 
you ; but I hope I have got the victory over my- 
self — My lord, said I, I hope you are fully satisfied 
that you do not resist the call of Heaven. — Sir, said 
he, if it hpd been from Heaven, the same power 
would have influenced me to have accepted it : but 



308 ADVENTUHES OF 

I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven 
that I declined it: and I have infinite satisfiiction 
in the parting, that you shall leave me an honest 
man still, though not a free man. 

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make 
professions to him of my having no end in it but a 
sincere desire to serve him. He embraced me very 
passionately, and assured me he was sensible of 
that, and should always acknowledge it ; and with 
that he offered me a very fine present of sables, too 
much, indeed, for me to accept from a man in his 
circumstances, and I would have avoided them, but 
he would not be refused. 

The next morning I sent my servant to his lord- 
ship with a small present of tea, and two pieces of 
China damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, 
which did not all weigh above six ounces or there- 
about, but were far short of the value of his sables, 
which, when I came to England, 1 found worth 
near two hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, 
and one piece of the damask, and one of the pieces 
of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan 
coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of it, 
but would not take any more; and he sent word by 
my servant that he desired to speak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me I knew what 
had passed between us, and hoped I would not move 
him any more in that affair; but that, since I had 
made such a generous offer to him, he asked me if 
1 had kindness enough to offer the same to another 
person that he would name to me, in whom he had 
a great share of concern. I told him that I could 
not say I inclined to do so nmch for any but him- 
self, for whom I had a particular value, and should 
have been glad to have been the instrument of his 
deliverance; however, if he would please to name 
the person to me, I would give him my answer. He 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. S09 

told me it was his only son; who, though I had not 
seen him, yet he was in the same condition with 
himself, and above two hundred miles from him, on 
the other side of the Oby ; but that if I consented, 
he would send for him. 

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. 
I made some ceremony in letting him understand 
that it was wholly on his account ; and that seeing 
1 could not prevail on him, I would shew my respect 
to him by my concern for his son; but these things 
are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the 
next day for his son ; and in about twenty days he 
came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven 
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which in the 
whole amounted to a very great value. His servants 
brought the horses into the town, but left the young 
lord, at a distance, till night, when he came incognito 
into our apartment, and his father presented him to 
me, and, in short, we concerted the manner of our 
travelling, and every thing proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, 
black fox skins, fine ermines, and such other furs 
as are very rich, in that city, in exchange for some 
of the goods I had brought from China ; in par- 
ticular for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold 
the greatest part here, and the rest afterwards at 
Archangel, for a much better price than I could 
have got at London ; and my partner, who was sen- 
sible of the profit, and whose business more par- 
ticularly than mine was merchandise, was mightily 
pleased with our stay, on account of the traffic we 
made here. 

It was the beginning of June when 1 left this re- 
mote place, a city, 1 believe, little heard of in the 
world ; and, indeed, it is so far out of the road of 
commerce, that 1 know not how it should be much 
talked of. We were now reduced to a very small 



310 ADVENTURES OF 

caravan, having only thirty-two horses and camels 
in all, and all ot" them passed for mine, though my 
new guest was proprietor of eleven of them: it was 
most natural also that I should take more servants 
vi^ith me than I had before; and the young lord 
passed for my steward; what great man I passed for 
myself, 1 know not, neither did it concern me to 
inquire. We had here the worst and the largest 
desert to pass over that we met with in our whole 
journey; I call it the worst, because the way was 
very deep in some places, and very uneven in others; 
the best we had to say for it was, that we thought 
we had no troops of Tartars or robbers to fear, 
and that they never came on this side the river Oby, 
or at least but very seldom ; but /e found it other- 
wise. 

My young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, 
who was perfectly acquainted with the country, and 
led as by private roads, so that we avoided coming 
into the principal towns and cities upon the great 
road, such as Tumen, Soloy Kamskoi, and several 
others; because the Muscovite garrisons which are 
kept there are very curious and strict in their ob- 
servation upon travellers, and searching lest any of 
the banished persons of note should make their 
escape that way into Muscovy; but by this means, 
as we were kept out of the cities, so our whole jour- 
ney was a desert, and we were obliged to encamp 
and lie in our tents, when we might have had very 
good accommodation in the cities on the way : this 
the young lord was so sensible of, that he would not 
allow us to lie abroad when we came to several 
cities on the way, but lay abroad himself, with his 
servant in the woods, and met us always at the ap- 
pointed places. 

We were just entered Europe, having passed the 
river Kama, which in these parts is the boundary 



, ROBINSON CRUSOE. 311 

between Europe and Asia, and the first city on the 
European side was called Soloy Kamskoi, which is 
as much as to say, the great city on the river Kama; 
and here we thought to see some evident alteration 
in the people; but we were mistaken; for as we 
had a vast desert to pass, which is near seven hun- 
dred miles long in some places, but not above two 
hundred miles over, where we passed it, so till we 
came past that horrible place, we found very little 
difference between that country and the Mogul Tar- 
tary: the people are mostly pagans, and little bet- 
ter than the savages of America; their houses and 
towns full of idols, and their way of living wholly 
barbarous, except in the cities, as above, and the 
villages near them, where they are Christians, as 
they call themselves, of the Greek church; but have 
their religion mingled with so many relics of super- 
stition, that it is scarce to be known in some places 
from mere sorcery and witchcraft. 

In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must 
(after all our dangers were to our imagination 
escaped, as before) have been plundered and robbed, 
and perhaps murdered, by a troop of thieves ; of 
what country they were I am yet at a loss to know, 
but they were all on horseback, carried bows and 
arrows, and were at first about forty-five in number; 
they came so near to us as to be within two musket- 
shots, and asking no questions, surrounded us with 
their horses, and looked very earnestly upon us 
twice: at length they placed themselves just in our 
way; upon which we drew up in a little line, before 
our camels, being not above sixteen men in all ; and 
being drawn up thus, we halted, and sent out the 
Siberian servant, who attended his lord, to see who 
they were: his master was the more willing to let 
him go, because he was not a little apprehensive 



312 ADVENTURES OF 

that they were a Siberian troop sent out after him. 
The man came up near them with a flag of truce, 
and called to them; but though he spoke several of 
their languages or dialects of languages rather, he 
could not understand a word they said ; however, 
after some signs to him not to come nearer to them, 
at his peril, the fellow came back no wiser than he 
went ; only that by their dress, he said, he believed 
them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Cir- 
cassian hordes, and that there must be more of them 
upon the great desert, though he never heard that 
any of them were seen so far north before. 

About an hour after, they again made a motion to 
attack us, and rode round our little wood to see 
where they might break in; but finding us always 
ready to face theiii, they went off again; and we 
resolved not to stir for that n'ght. 

This was small comfort to us; however, we had 
no remedy: there was, on our left hand, at about a 
quarter of a mile distance, a little grove, and very 
near the road ; I immediately resolved we should 
advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well 
as we could there ; for, first, 1 considered that the 
trees would in a great measure cover us from their 
arrows ; and, in the next place, they could not come 
to charge us in a body; it was, indeed, my old Por- 
tuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this ex- 
cellency attending him, that he was always readiest 
and most a|)t to direct and encourage us in cases of 
the most danger. We advanced immediately, with 
what speed we could, and gained that little wood ; 
the Tartars, or thieves, for we knew not what to 
call them, keeping their stand, and not attempting 
to hinder us. When we came thither,- we found, to 
our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy piece 
of ground, and on the one side a very great spring 



nOBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

of water, which running out in a Httle brook, was, 
a httle farther, joined by another of the like size ; 
and was, in short, the source of a considerable river, 
called afterwards the Wirtska: the trees which grew 
about this spring were not above two hundred, but 
very large, and stood pretty thick, so that as soon 
as we got in we saw ourselves perfectly safe from 
the enemy, unless they attacked us on foot 

While we staid here waiting the motion of the 
enemy some hours, without perceiving they made 
any movement, our Portuguese, with some help, 
cut several arms of trees half off, and laid them 
hanging across from one tree to another, and in a 
manner fenced us in. About two hours before night 
they came down directly upon us : and though we 
had not perceived it, we found they had been joined 
by some more of the same, so that they were near 
fourscore horse ; whereof, however, we fancied some 
were women. They came on till they were within 
half shot of our little wood, when we fired one 
musket without ball, and called to them in the Rus- 
sian tongue to know what they wanted, and bade 
them keep off; but they came on with a double 
fury up to the wood side, not imagining we were so 
barricaded that they could not easily break in. Our 
old pilot was our captain, as well as our engineer, 
and desired us not to fire upon them till they came 
within pistol-shot, that we might be sure to kill ; 
and that when we did fire we should be sure to take 
good aim ; we bade him give the word of command, 
which he delayed so long, that they were some of 
them within two pikes length of us when we let fly. 
We aimed so true that we killed fourteen of them, 
and wounded several others, as also several of their 
horses ; for we had all of us loaded our pieces with 
two or three bullets at least. 

VOL. XVII. U E 



314 ADVENTURES OF 

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and 
retreated immediately about one hundred rods from 
us, in which time we loaded our pieces again, and 
seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and 
catched four or five of their horses, whose riders we 
supposed were killed : and coming up to the dead, 
we judged they were Tartars, but knew not how 
they came to make an excursion such an unusual 
length. 

We slept little, you may be sure, but spent the 
most part of the night in strengthening our situa- 
tion, and barricading the entrances into the wood, 
and keeping a strict watch. We waited for day- 
light, and when it came, it gave us a very unwel- 
come discovery, indeed ; for the enemy, who we 
thought were discouraged with the reception they 
met with, were now greatly increased, and had set 
up eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if they were 
resolved to besiege us ; and this little camp they 
had pitched uj)on the open plain, about three quar- 
ters of a mile from us. We were, indeed, surprised 
at this discovery; and now, I confess, I gave myself 
over for lost, and all that I had ; the loss of my ef- 
fects did not lie so near me, though very consi- 
derable, as the thoughts of falling into the hands 
of such barbarians, at the latter end of my journey, 
after so many difficulties and hazards as I had gone 
through, and even in sight of our port, where we 
expected safety and deliverance. As to my partner, 
he was raging, and declared that to lose his goods 
would be his ruin, and that he would rather die than 
be starved ; and he was for fighting to the last 
drop. 

The young lord, a gallant youth, was for fighting 
to the last also ; and my old pilot was of the opinion 
we were able to resist them all in the situation we

were then in ; and thus we spent the day in debates 
of what we should do : but towards evening we 
found that the number of our enemies still increas- 
ed, and we did not know but by the morning they 
might still be a greater number ; so 1 began to in- 
quire of those people we had brought from Tobolski, 
if there were no private ways, by which we might 
avoid them in the night, and perhaps retreat to some 
town, or get help to guard us over the desert. The 
Siberian, who was servant to the young lord, told 
us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight, he 
would engage to carry us off in the night, to a way 
that went north, towards the river Petrou, by which 
he made no question but we might get away, and 
the Tartars never the wiser : but, he said, his lord 
had told him he would not retreat, but would rather 
choose to fight. I told him he mistook his lord ; 
for that he was too wise a man to love fighting for 
the sake of it ; that I knew his lord was brave enough, 
by what he had showed already ; but that his lord 
knew better than to desire seventeen or eighteen 
men to fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable 
necessity forced them to it ; and that, if he thought 
it possible for us to escape in the night, we had no- 
thing else to do but to attempt it. He answered, if 
his lordship gave him such orders he would lose 
his life if he did not perform it : we soon brought 
his lord to give that order, though privately, and we 
immediately prepared for the putting it in practice. 
And, first, as soon as it began to be dark, we 
kindled a fire in our little camp, which we kept 
burning, and prepared so as to make it burn all 
night, that the Tartars might conclude we were 
still there ; but as soon as it was dark, and we could 
see the stars (for our guide would not stir before), 
having all our horses and camels ready loaded, we

followed our new guide, who I soon found steered 
himself by the north star. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it 
began to be lighter still ; not that it was quite dark 
all night, but the moon began to rise, so that, in 
short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be ; 
but by six o'clock the next morning we were got 
above thirty miles, having almost spoiled our horses. 
Here we found a Russian village, named Kerma- 
zinskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing of the 
Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours before 
night we set out again, and travelled till eight the 
next morning, though not quite so hard as before ; 
and about seven o'clock we passed a little river, 
called Kirtza, and came to a good large town in- 
habited by Russians, called Ozomoys ; there we heard 
that several troops of Kalmucks had been abroad 
upon the desert, but that we were now completely 
out of danger of them, which was to our great sa- 
tisfaction. Here we were obliged to get some fresh 
horses ; and having need enough of rest, we staid 
five days ; and my partner and I agreed to give the 
honest Siberian who brought us thither the value of 
ten pistoles. 

In five days more we came to Veuslima, upon the 
river Wirtzogda, and running into the Dwina : we 
were there, very happily, near the end of our tra- 
vels by land, that river being navigable, in seven 
days' passage, to Archangel. From hence we came 
to Lawrensky the 3d of July; and providing our- 
selves with two luggage-boats, and a barge for our 
own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived 
all safe at Archangel the 18th ; having been a year 
five months and three days on the journey, includ- 
ing our stay of eight months at Tobolski. We were 
obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival

of the ships and must have tarried longer had not 
a Hamburgher come in above a month sooner than 
any of the Enghsh ships ; when, after some consi- 
deration that the city of Hamburgh might happen 
to be as good a market for our goods as London, 
we all took freight with him ; and, having put our 
goods on board, it was most natural for me to put 
my steward on board to take care of them; by 
which means my young lord had a sufficient oppor- 
tunity to conceal himself, never coming on shore 
again all the time we staid there ; and this he did 
that he might not be seen in the city, where some 
of the Moscow merchants would certainly have seen 
and discovered him. 

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of 
August, the same year ; and after no extraordinary 
bad voyage, arrived safe in the Elbe the ISth of 
September. Here my partner and I found a very 
good sale for our goods, as well those of China as 
the sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the pro- 
duce, ray share amounted to 3475^. 175. oil. in- 
cluding about six hundred pounds worth of dia- 
monds which I purchased at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and 
went up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of 
Vienna, where he I'esolved to seek protection, and 
could correspond with those. of his father's friends 
who were left alive. He did not part without 
testimonies of gratitude for the service I had done 
him, and his sense of my kindness to the prince his 
father. 

To conclude, having staid near four months in 
Hamburgh, I came from thence by land to the 
Hague, where I embarked in the packet, and ar- 
rived in London the 10th of January, 1705; hav- 
ing been absent from England ten years and nine

months. And here I resolved to prepare for a 
longer journey than all these, having lived a life 
of infinite variety seventy-two years, and learned 
sufficiently to know the value of retirement, and 
the blessing of ending our days in peace.
