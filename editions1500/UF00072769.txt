I was born in York, in the year 16-12, and
brought up to the law; but, being of a ram-
bling disposition, resolved to go to sea; and
. happening one day to meet an acquaintance,
whose father was master of a ship, bound for
London, I went on board with him, unknown
to my parents, and without their blessing.
We had no sooner left the Plumber astern,
than a terrible storm arose, and afier six days
incessant toil and sickness, our ship sunk;
but some'collier saved the crew, and landed
us at Cromer, fi'om whence we walked to
Yarmouth, where I parted from the rest, and
walked up to London. Having obtained PS40
from home, the captain who engaged me told me
how to lay it out; and on my return from that
voyage, I had cleared PS200, sterling.

My captain died soon after our return, and
I embarked again with the mate; butWe were
taken by a Sallee Rover, and carried slaves

to the Canary Islands. The captain liking
me, kept me as his slave; and a young Mo-
rocco boy and me used to row the boat, and
divert him with fishing: at other times send-
ing me with a kinsman of his to catch fish.
One day, having persuaded them to go and
shoot curlews, when out at sea, I took an op--
portunity to throw my master's kinsman over-
board, threatening to shoot him if he came
near the boat, and made the boy swear by
Mahomet to be true to me. We sailed five
days, during which we killed some creatures
which were very good food, when we made
Cape de Verd Islands, and by good fortune
fell' m with a Portuguese ship, the master of
which bought the boat and the boy of me, and
soon after landed me at Brazil. Here I served
a planter some years ; when a merchant whom
I was connected with, having fitted a ship out
for Guinea, I agreed to go as commander. I
sailed on the first of September, 1650, being
the same day eight years that I left my father
and mother; but we had not long left, when
a dreadful storm arose, which lasted for twelve
days; when having made shift to get into our
boat, a wave capsized it, when close to shore,

and all hands perished but me.nonmsox causon. 5

I now thanked God for this deliverance, but
saw no prospect but starvation, or being eaten
by wild beasts, having nothing but a knife,a
pipe, and a tobacco-stopper. That night I
slept' in a tree, and next morning, the storm
having abated, I swam to the wreck, and he-
ving made a raft of some loose planks, loaded
it with two good fowling-pieces, two pistols,
some powder and shot, two swords, two ham-
mers, and an axe, and reached the shore in
safety. Having taken a survey from the tree,
and found myself on an island, encom
by the ocean, I began to construct a but; and

returning to the wreck next day, I brought
back two or three bags of nails, a screw-jack,
' a grindstone, and a hatchet: in short, by de-
grees, Igot what was necessary out of the
ship, and then proceeded to finish my habita-
tion, covering it entirely with a sail, and bar-
ricading the door with my chest. I had also
saved some good books, particularly a Bible,
which greatly consoled me, - but having no pen
and ink, I carved this sentence with my knife
on a cross, I had erected, on the shore: "I
landed here Sept. 30, 1650, " and upon the
sides of the cross I daily made a notch, thus
keeping a reckoning of time; comforting my-

self, in my solitary situation, with the convic-
tion that God's goodness would some day set
me free again, and that I did not want.

I employed my time constantly in improving
the advantages given me: I moved my but
to a more eligible spot, fenced it round, made
shelves and a dresser for the inside, and built
a strong wall with pieces of rock all round the
garden. I searched the island, and brought
home some wild goats and pigeons, which I
tamed and reared stock of; curing the goat's
flesh, like bacon, and making candles with the
fat and some oakum. I also occasionally shot
wild-duck; and constantly had abundance of
fish, both dried and fresh, whilst the garden
yielded plenty of vegetables, fruit, and corn,
and the goats supplied milk and butter. A
long ladder, (which I could remove at plea-
sure,) to ascend the wall with, kept me from
a sudden surprise, either from man or beast;
and I kept my fire-arms loaded, and ready, as
if it were a castle expecting to be attacked.

As it would be too tedious to mention every
day's transactions, I shall merely observe, that
fishing and hunting were my delight during
six days in each week, and reading the \Vord
of God, and praying, was my employment on
the Sabbath. I had now been here a consi-
derable time, without exploring much of my
island, fearing to quit home for any length of
time; but gaining courage, I now set out, and
ascending a high hill, espied pleasant meadows,
covered with verdure, arriving at which, I found
the cassive root, the Indians make their bread
of, and plants of aloes and sugar-canes, but
wild for want of cultivation. Going further,
I found the place adorned with several delight~
ful w;oods and getting up into a tree, I rested
there all night. '-'~-
During next day's journey, I found the
country so charming, that I often wished my
habitation had been0 pitched there, and conti-
nued my tour for a whole month, when return-
ing to my castle, I found a cat, which had left
me soon after I caught her, returned, with
three kittens at her heels. Besides her, I had
a dog, which I brought from the ship, and a
parrot, which I had caught, and learnt to say,
Poor Robinson Crusoe! I now made earthen
jars for water, and bins for corn, of which I
had a good stock; and my clothes being worn
out, I made a suit of the skins of four-footed
beasts, with a cap of the same : and it would
have made any one smile, to see me thus ac~
centred, a sword without a scabbard at my
side, and a gun on each shoulder. I next
made a little canoe, resolving to sail round the
island; but narrowly escaping drowning with
it, I laid it by, and abandoned my intention.
\Valking on the shore, shortly after this, I
espied the print of a man's foot, which sorely
frightened me, concluding that the savages
must have landed, which was soon confirmed
by my finding near it several skulls and bones.
Upon this, I resolved to lay wait and destroy
them ; and always went out well armed. One
morning, going out as usual, I saw two canoes
on the shore, and eleven savages just landing,
having another with them whom they were
going to devour, who, making _a sudden leap
from them, ran for his life towards my castle,
two of them following; I beckoned to him,
but, never having seen a white man before, he
was as much afraid of me as of them. How-
ever, running between them, I knocked one of
his pursuers down, on which the other bent
his bow to shoot me, when instantly levelling
my piece, I dispatched him, and the others,
ten ified took to their canoes, and uttering the
most appalling vells, hurried a" av. The poor
fellow w horn 1 had saved now fell at my feet,<<0815303 causon. 9

when I placed my foot on his neck, in t: ken
of his becoming my slave for ever.

I took him home, and placed him in aplace
of security, as yet not daring to trust him ; and
named him Friday, it being on that day I res-
cued him. But he ever proved faithful; and
I learnt the story of his life by tokens. He
soon understood my language, and worked at
any thing I desired him; I clothed him like
myself, and fed him at my own table, but
when going to shoot, he would fall at my feet,
and by signs entreat me not to kill him; and
at other times, would pray to the gun not to
shoot, thinking it understood him. In short,
he became at last so sensible, that I taught him
the knowledge of God and our Saviour, Jesus
Christ, and described to him the religion, cus-
toms, and manners of other countries; and I
verily believe, the riches of the universe would
not have tempted him to desert me.

It was now the twenty-seventh year of my
captivity, when one day having sent Friday to
seek some turtle on the shore, he speedily re-
turned, telling- me there were two or three
canoes coming to land; they brought with
them a Christian slave, whom they were on

the point of sacrificing, when I fired, killing10 1103121501: cavson.

three, and wounding five, the rest escaping in
their canoes. We unbound the poor victim,
who told me, that he and sixteen Spaniards
had been shipwrecked, five only saving them-
selves in the boat; that be, staying behind,
was seized by the savages, who no doubt would
have eaten him, but for my assistance. One
of the wounded savages turned out to be Fri-
day s father, on discovering which the poor
fellow kissed him, sung, hallooed, laughed,

cried, and capered round him so long, that it
was with great difficulty I could get an answer
from him as to who he was; but, on learning
the fact, I took them all home with me, enter-
taining them as my subjects. \Ve now kept
guard, lest any more canoes should come; but
there 11 as no danger, those 11 ho had escaped

fits, and that it 11 oul'd be burnt to ashes 1n a
little time.

to me one morning, crying they 11 ere coming ,
when, taking mv glass, I espied an Entrlish
ship, and the long-boat coming on shore; :)and
11 hen they landed? I beheld three men, unarm~
ed and bound, closel1 surrounded by four or
five armed men. However, they soon left their
prisoners, to ramble in the woods; when I ad-
lressed them, asking them what they were.
1' hey were indeed surprised to hear me speak

their own tongue, no less than at my appear-
ance; but one of them said, he was master of

the ship, and that his sailors had mutinied;
on hearing which, I promised to assist him, on
two conditions: first, that he should not pre-
tend to any authority in the island; and next, ,
that he should transport me and my men, g
tis, to England. Having joyfully agreed, I
fumished him and his companions with arms,
and following the five men, found them asleep,
on which we dispatched the two 1ingleaders,
the captain promising pa1don to the others, if
they proved true in recovering the ship. We
then 11 aited quietly, till the rest of the crew,
wondering at their comrades' stay, sent out a
boat to halloo for them; we answered, from
one hill to another, till 11e decayed them into
the wood, when we fell upon them, destroy mg
the boatswain, who was at their head. The
rest then offered to surrender, on condition of
being pardoned; when, waiting till it was
dark, we boarded the vessel, and the captain
having shot the pirate chief through the head,

the rest yielded, and order was restored.12 nonwsou causes.

The captain then thanking me for his deli--
verance, offered me the use of the ship, and
his services; which having accepted, I went
back to my castle, and falling on my knees,
returned my fervent thanks to Heaven for my
release. I then took on board my clothes,
umbrella, parrot, dog, and many other things,
together with the treasure I had saved from
the wreck; and every thing being ready, the
ship sailed for England.

I kept my eyes fixed on the island, where
I had passed twenty-eight years, and where I
had experienced and surmounted such great
difficulties, till the very summit of my favou-
rite hill had disappeared, when Iretired to my
cabin, ove1 nhelmed 11 1th emotion. The ship,
after a rapid passage, arrived safely at Ports-
mouth; vrhen I instantly set 03' for my na-
tive place, and found my parents both dead,
which deeply affected me. I now abandoned
all furthei desire to iove, and lived contented
and grateful on my paternal estate
