PREFACE.
The merit and esteem in which this
admired work of the truly . celebrated
Daniel de Foe has been held, will need no
other encomium than the numerous editions
through which it has passed. At this period
-the work is read with avidity, desire, and
pleasure: the younger branches may be said
to read it from their cradle, and the more
advanced can find amusement for their leisure
hotfrs in these events; the circumstances'it
contains engage the mind, and its principles
of instruction are founded on Virtue and
Religion; yet they are conveyed in such a
pleasing manner, that you are imperceptibly
led through a wonderful history t4 a system
of morality.' %
Among the many editions presented the
Public, some are too extravagant a pur-
chase;
chase; others printed in a manner inconsist-
ent with trie liberality which should have
supported a work. of this kind.
It is therefore presumed this edition, which
is well printed, on good paper, enriched and
embellilhed with curious descriptive plates,
and offered for sale at a very moderate price,.
. will be supported by a generous and discern-
ing Public.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES

ROBINSON CRUSOE.
-. i

IWAS born in the year 1652, in the city 0s York,
os a good samily, though not of that country, my
sather being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at
Hull.—He got a good estate by merchandise; and,
leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from
whence he had married my mother, whose relations
were named Robinson, a very good samily in that
county, and from whom I was called Robimon Kreutz-
naer; but, by the usual corruption of words in Eng-
land, we are now called, nay, we call ourselves, and
write our name, Crusoe; and so my companions always
called me. ^
I had two elder brothers, one of whom was a lieute-
nant-colonel ip an English regiment of foot in Flanders,
vox. i. a formerly

formerly commanded by the samous' Colonel Loekhart,
and was killed at a battle near Dunkirk, against the
Spaniards. What became of my second brother I
never knew, any more than my sather or mother did
know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the samily, and npt bred to
any trade, my head began to be filled very early with
rambling thoughts. My sather, who was very ancient,
had given me a competent share of learning, as sar as
house education, and a country free-school generally
goes, and designed me for the law; but I would be sa-
tisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my inclina-
tion to this led me so strongly against the will, nay,
the commands of my sather, and against all the intreaties
and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that
there leemed to be something satal in that propension
of nature, tending directly to the lise of misery which
was to besal me.
My sather, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my
design. He called me one morning into his chamber,
where he was consined by the gout, and expostulated
very warmly with me on this subject. He asked me,
what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination,
I had for leaving my sather's house and my native coun-
try, where I might be well introduced, and had a pros-
pect of raising my fortune by application and industry,
with a lise of er.se and pleasure. He told me it was
men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring
superior fortunes on the other, and who went abroad
upon adventures, to rise by enterprise; and make them-
selves samous in undertakings of a nature out of the
common road; that these things were all either too sar
above me^or too sar below me; that mine was the
middle stare, or what might be called the upper station
of low lise, which he had found, by long experience,
was the best state in the world; the most suited to hu-
man happiness; not exposed to the miseries and hard-
ships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part
of mankind, and not embarraised with the pride,' lux-
ury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind.
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3
He.told me 1 might judge of the happiness of this state
by this one thing, viz. that this was the state of lise
.< which all other people envied; that kings have fre-
quently lamented the miserable consequences of being
born to great things, and wished they had been placed
in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean
and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to
this, as the just iwtndard of true selicity, when he prayed
to have neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should always sind, that
the calamities of lise were shared among the upper and
lower part of mankind; but that the middle station
had the sewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many
vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind ;—
nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and
uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were, who,
by vicious Irving, luxury, and extravagancies on one
hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean
or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distempers
upon themselves by the natural consequences of their
way of living ; 'that the middle station of lire was cal-
culated for all kind of virtues, and all kind of enjoy-'
.ments; that peace and plenty were the .hand-maids of
a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quiet-
ness, health, society, all agieeable diversions, and all
desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the
middle station of lise ; that this tVay men went silently and
smooths- through.the world, and comfortably out of it;
not embarrassed with the labours of the hands, or of the
head; not soid to a lise of slavery for daily bread, or
hammed with perplexed circumHar.ccs? which rob the
foul of peace, and the body of rest ; not enraged with the
. pastipn of envy, or the secret burning luli of ambition for
-great things; but in easy circumstances, sliding gently
through the world, and senl:l)ly tailing th»sweets of liv-
ing without the bitter ; seeiing that they arc happy, and
learning, by every day's experience, to kn<.w it more
sensibly.
.After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most af-
sectionate manner, not to play the young man, or to
precipitate myself into miseries, which nature, and the
station of lise 1 was born in, seemed to have provided
against; that I was under no necessity of seeking rrly
B 2 <- bread;
tread; that he would' do well for me, and endeavour to
enter me sairly into the station of lise which he had
been just recommending to me; and that if I was not
very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere
sate, or sault, that must hinder it; and that he mould
have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his
duty in warning me against measures which he knew
would be to my hurt. In a word, that as he would do
very kind things for me, if I would stay and settle at
home, as he directed, so he would not have so much
hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encourage-
ment to go away: and, to close all, he told me I had iny
elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the
same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into
the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young
desires prompting him to run into the army, where he
was killed; and though he said he would not cease to
pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if
1 ctid take this foolish step, God would not bless me;
and I would have.leisure hereafter to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel when there might be noneto assist
in my recovery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though I suppose my sather did not
know it to be so himself; Isay, I observed the tears run
down his sace very plentisully, especially when he spoke
of my brother who was killed; and that when he spoke
of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he
was so moved,,that he broke off the discourse, and told
me his heart was so fall, he could say no more to me.
I was sincerely afflicted with this discourse, as indeed
who could be otherwise? and 1 resolved not to think of
going abroad any more, but to settle at home according
to my sather's desire: but, alas! a sew days wore it all
off; and, in short, to prevent any of my sather's sarther
•importunities, in a sew weeks after I resolved to run
quite away from him. However, I did not act so
hastily neither as the first heat of my resolution prompt-
ed; but I took my mother, at a time when I thought
her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and toUl her that
my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the
world, that 1 should never settle to any thing with reso-
lution
5
lution enough to go through with it; and my sather had.
better give me his eonsent, than force me to go without
it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too
late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney;
that I was sure, if I did, 1 should never serve out my
time, but I should certainly run away from my mailer
before my time was out, and go to lea; and if she
would speak to my sather to let me go one voyage
abroad'if I came home again, and did not like it, I
would go no more, and I would promise, by a double
diligence, to recover the time that I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion: she told
me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my
sather upon any such subject; that he knew too well
-what was my interest to give his consent to any thing Ib
much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could
think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with
my sather, and such kind and tender expressions as the
knew my sather had used to me; and that, in short, if I
would ruin myself, there was no help for me, but I
might depend I should never have their consent to it;
that, for her part, she would not have so much hand in
my destruction; and I should never have it to say that
my mother was willing, when my sather was not.
Though my mother resused to move it to my sather,,
yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse
to him; and that my sather, after shewing a great con-
cern at it, said to her, with a sigh, that boy might be
happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad,
he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born;
I can give no consent to it.
It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the mean time I continued obstinately-
deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and frequently
expostulating with my sather and mother about their
being so positively determined against what they knew
my inclinations prompted me to. But being one day at
Hull, whither i went casually, and without any pur-
pose of making an elopement that time; but I say,
being there, and one of my companions being going
by sea to London in his sather's ship, and prompting
me to go with him, with the common allurement of a
i 3 , seafaring
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
seasaring man, that it should cost me nothing for my
passage, I consulted neither sather nor mother any more,
nor so much as sent them word of it, but leaving them
to hear of it as they might, without asking God's bless-
ing, or my sather's, without any consideration of cir-
cumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God
knows, on the first of September, 175!, I went on board
aship bound for London. Never any young adventurer's
misfortunes I believe began sooner, or continued longer,
than mine; the ship was no sooner got out of the H um-
ber, but the wind began to blow, and the sea to rise in a
most frightsul manner; and,-as I had never been at sea
before, 1 was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified
in mind. I began now seriously, to reflect upon what I
had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judg-
ment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my sather's
house, and abandoning my duty; all the good counsel
of my parents, my sather's tears, and my mother's entrea-
ties, came now fresh into my mind ; and my conscience,
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardiness which it
has been since, reproached me with the contempt of ad-
vice, and the breach of my duty to God and my sather.
All this while the storm increased, and the lea went
very high, though nothing like what I have seen many
times since, no nor what 1 saw a sew days after; but it
was enough to aff ect me then, who was but a young sai -'
lor, and had never known anything of the matter, t
expected every wave would have swallowed us up,' and
that every time the ship sell down, as 1 thought it did, in
the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise
more. In this agony of mind !made many vows and
resolutions that, if it would please God to spare my life
in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry
land again, I would go directly home to my sather, and
never let it into a ship again while 1 lived; that I would
take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries
as these any more.v Now I saw plainly the goodness of
his observations about the middle station of lise, how
easy, how comfortably he had lived all his days, and
never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on
shore; and, in short, I resolved that I would, like a true
repenting prodigal, go home to my sather.
I These
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while
the storm continued, and indeed some time after; but
the next day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer,
and I began to be a little inured to it. However, I was
very grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick
still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the
wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening folj
lowed; the sun went down persectly clear, and rose so
the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a
smooth sea, the sun mining upon it, the light was, as 1
thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was no .more sea-
sick, but very cheersul; looking with wonder upon the
sea, that was so rough and terrible the day before, and
could be so calm and so pleasant info little a time after.
And now, lest ray good resokltions should continue, my
companion, who had indeed enticed me away, comes to
me, Well, Bob, says he, clapping me upon the moulder,
how do you do after it? I warrant you were frighted,
were not you, last night when it blew but a cap sull of
wind? A cap sull, do you call it? said I, 'twas a ter-
rible storm. A storm, you fool you! replies he; do
you call that a storm? Why it was nothing at all: give
us but a good ship, and sea room, and we think nothing
of such a squall of wind as that; but you are but a fresh
water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch,
and we'll forget all that; do you see what charming wea-
ther it is now? To make short this sad part of my story,
we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made, and
I was made half drunk with it; and in that one night's
wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reslec-
tions upon my past conduct, all my resolutions for the
suture. In a word, as the sea was returned to its smooth-
ness of sursace, and settled calmness, by the abatement
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over,
my sears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the
sea being forgotton, and the current of my former desires
returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that I
made in my distress, i sound indeed some intervals of
reflection, and the serious thoughts did, as it were,
endeavour to return again sometimes; but 1 shook them
off, and roused myself from them, as it were from a
b 4 distemper;
distemper; and applying myself to drinking and com-
pany, soon mastered the return of those fits (for so I
called them); and I had, in five or six days, got as
complete a victory over my conscience as any young
sellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could
desire. But I was to have another trial for it still; and
Providence, as in such cases it generally does, resolved
to leave me entirely without excuse; for I would not
take this for a deliverance, the next was to be such an
one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us
would consess both the danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea , we came into Yar-
mouth roads; the wind having been contrary, and the
weather calm, we had made but little way since the storm.
Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we
lay, the wind continuing. contrary, viz. at south-west,
for seven or eight days; during which time a great v
many ships from Newcastle came into the same roads,
as the common harbour where the ships might wait for
a wind for the river.
• We had not however, rid here so long but we should
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too
fresh; and after we had lain four or five days, blew very
hard. However, the roads being reckoned as good as
an harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground tackle
very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not the
•least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest
and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth
day in the morning, the wind increased, arid we had all
hands at work to strike our topmasts, and make every
thine; snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as
possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and
our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we
thought once or twice our anchor had come home;
upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor;
so that we rode with two anchors a-head, and the cables
veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now
I began to tee terror and amazement in the saces even of
the seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in
the business of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and
out of his cabin by me, I could hear him, softly to
self, say several times, Lord me mercisul to us! we shall
be all lost, we shall be all undone, and the like. During
these first hurries, I was stupid, lying still in my cabin,
which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my tem-
per. I could ill resume the first penitence which I had so
apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself against;
I thought the bitterness of death had been past, and that
this would be nothing too, like the first. But when the
master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said
we should be all lost, 1 was dreadsully frighted: I got
up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal
sight I never saw; the sea went mountains high, and
broke upon us every three or four minutes: when lEould:
look about, I could see nothing but distress round us;
two ships that rid near us we found had cut their masts
by the board, being deep laden; and our men cried :out,
that a ship which rid about'a mile ahead of us, was
soundered. Two more ships, being driven from their an-
chors, were run out of the roads to sea at all adventures,
and that not with a- malt standing: The light: ships-
sared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea, but
two or three of them drove, and came close by. us, run-
ning avyay with only th sir sprit tail out, before the wind.
Towards the evening, the mate and boatswain begged
the matter of our ship to let them cut away the foremast,
which he was very unwi ling to do; but trse boatswain
protesting to him that, if he did not, the ship would
founder, he consented; and when they had cut away the
foremast, the mainmalt stood so loose, and shook the
ship so much, they were obliged to cut her. away also,.
and make a clear deck.
Any one must judge what a condition I must be in at.
all this, who was but a.young sailor, and who had been
in such a fright before at but a little. But if 1 can express
at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time,
I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of
my former convictions, and the having returned from
them to the resolutions 1 had wickedly taken at first, than
I was at death itself; and these, added to the terror of
the storm, put me into such a condition, that I can b
no words describe it. But the worst was not come
the storm continued with such sury, that the f-aeiV
themselves acknowledged they had never seen f even
B 5 *,,' killed.
We had a good ship, but she was deep loaden, and wal-*
lowed in .the sea, that the seamen every now and then
criedout, she wouldfounder. It wasmy advantagein one
respect, that I did not know what they meant by founder,
till I enquired. However, the storm was so violent, that
I saw what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain,
and some others, more sensible than the rest, at their
.prayers, and expecting every moment that the ship would
go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under
all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had
been down On purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a
leak; another said, there was four seet water in the
hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that
very word, my heart, as 1 thought, died within me; and
1 sell' backwards upon the side of the bed where I sat,
into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told
me, that i that was able to do nothing before, was as well
able to pump as another; at which I stirred up, and went
to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was
doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who, not able
to ride out the storm, were obliged to flip and run away
to the sea, and would come near us, ordered to sire a gun
as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing of what they
meant, was so surprised, that I thought the the ship had
broke, or some dreadsul thing happened. In a word, I
was so surprised, that! sell down in a swoon. As this was
a time when every body had his own lise to think of,
nobody minded me, or what was become of me; but
another roan stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me
aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking 1 had been dead;
and it was a great while before I came to myself. '.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold,
it was apparent that the ship would founder; and though
the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not pos-
sible she could swim till we might run into any port, so
the master continued firing guns for help; and a light
ship, who had rid it out just a head of us, ventured a
, boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard the
boat came near us; but it was impossible for us to get
H board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side; till
ft the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
save ours, our men cast them a rope over the
'a stern,
r
stern, with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great-
length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took
hold of, and we hawledthem close under our stern, and
got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them
or us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching
to their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only
to pull her in towards shore as much as we could: and
our master promised them, that if the boat was staved
upon shore, he would make it good to their master: so
partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat went away
to the northward, sloping towards the shore, almost as
sar as Wirctertonnesse.
We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our ship, when we saw her smk; and then I under-
stood, for the sirst time, what was meant by a ship foun-
dering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes
to look up, when the seamen told me she was sinking;
for, from that moment they rather put me into the boat,
than that I might be said to go in; my heart was as it
'were dead within me, partly with fright, partly with
horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before
me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet labour-
ing at the oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could
see (when, our boat mounting the .waves, we were able
to see the more) a great many people running along the
strand, to assist us when we should come near :. but w.e
made but stow way towards the shore; nor were we
able to reach the shore, till being past the light-house at.
Winterton, the shore salls off to the westward towards
Cromer; and so the land broke off a little the violence of
the wind. Here we got in; and, though not without
much difficulty, got alLsate on shore, and walked after-
wards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men,
we were used with great humanity, as well by the ma-
gistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as
by particular merchants and'owners of ships; and had
money given us sufficient to carry us either to-Loadon,.
or back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull,.
and have gone home, I had been happy ; and my sather,
an emblem of our blelscd Saviour's parable, had even
s 6 . killed:
killed the satted calf for me; for, hearing the ship I went
away in was cast away in Yarmouth road, it was a great
while before he had anyassurances thatl was not drowned.
But my ill sate pushed me on now with an obstinacy
that nothing could relist; and though I had several times
loud calls from my reason, and my more composed judg-
ment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know
not what to call this; nor will I urge that it is a secret
over-ruling decree that hurries us on to be the instru-
ments of our own destruction, even though it be before
us, and that we push upon it with our eyes open. Cer-
tainly nothing but some such decreed, unavoidable mi-
sery attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm
reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts,
and against two such visible instructions as I had met
with in my first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me before,
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were at
Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we
were separated in the town to several quarters; 1 say,
the first time he law me, it appeared his tone was
altered; and looking very melancholy, and sbaking his
head, asked me how 1 did? and telling his sather who I
was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial,
in order to go sarther abroad; his sather, turning to me,
. with a very grave and concerned tone, Young man, says
he, you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought
to take this for a plain and visible token, that you are
not to be a seasaring man. Why, Sir, said 1, will you
go to sea no more? That is another case, said he ; it is
my calling, and therefore my duty: but as you made
this voyage for a> trial, you see what a taste Heaven has
given you of what you are to expect if you persist: per-
haps all this has besallen us on your account, like Jonah
in'the ship of Tarshish. Pray, continues he, what are you?
and on what accpunt did you go to sea? Upon that I
told him some of my story; at the end of which he burst
out with a strange kind of passion; What have I done,
says he, that such an unhappy wretch should come into
my ship? I would not set my foot in the same ship with
thee
I
thee again for a thousand pounds. This indeed was, as
1 said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agi-
tated by the fense of his loss; and was surther than he
could have authority to go. However, he afterwards
talkexl very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to
my sather, and not tempt Providence to my ruin j told
me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against me.
And, young man, said he, depend upon it, if you do
not .go baclf, wherever you go, you will meet with
nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your
sather's words are sulfilled upon you.
We parted soon aster, for I made him little answer,
and I saw him no more; which way he went I know
not. As for me, having some money in my pocket, 1 tra-
velled to London by land, and there,as well as on the road,
had many struggles with myself what course of lise I .
should take, and whether. I should go home or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best motions
that ossered to my thoughts; and it immediately oc-
cured to me how I should be laughed at among the
neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my sather
and mother only, but even every body else ; from whence
I have since often observed how incongruous and irra-'
tional the common temper of mankind is, especially of
youth, to that reason that ought to guide them in such
cases; viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are'
ashamed to repfiit; not ashamed osthe action for which
they ought justly to be esteemed fools; but are ashamed
of the returning, which only can make them esteemed'
wise men.
1n this state of lise, .however, I remained some time,
uncertain what measures to take, and what course of lite
to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to going
home: and as I staid awhile, the remembrance of the
distress I had been in wore osf; and as that abated, the
1ittle motion I had in my desires to return, wore osf with
it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and
looked out for a voyage.
That evil influence, which carried me first away from
my sather's house, which hurried me into the wild and
indigested notion of raiting. niy fortune, and that im-
pressed those conceits so forcibly. upon me 4S to make me
deaf to all good advice, arid' to fne entreaties, and even
the
1,4
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
the commands of my sather;—I say, the same influence,
whatever it was, presented the molt.unfortunate of all
enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel
bound to the coast ot' Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly
call it, a voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune, that in all these adven-
tures I did not -ship myself as a sailor; whereby, though
I mjght indeed have worked a little harder than ordi-
nary, yet at the same time 1 had learned the duty and
ofsice of a foremastman, and in time might have qualified
myself for amate or lieutenant, if not fora master. But
as it was always my sate to chuse for the worse, so I did
here j for, having money in my pocket, and good clothes
on my back, I would always go on board in the habit of
a gentleman; and so I neither had any business-in the
ship, nor learned to do any. \
'It was my lot sirst of all to sall into pretty good com-
pany in London, which does not always happen to such
loose and unguided young sellows as I then was, the devil
generally not omitting to lay some snare for them very
early; but it was not so with me. 1 first sell acquainted
with the mister of a ship who had been on the coast cf
Guinea, and who, having had very good success there,
was resolved to go again: this captain, taking a sancy to
my conversation, which. was not disagreeable at that
time, hearing me Iky I had a mind to see the world,
told mi, if I would go the voyage with him, I should be
at no expence, I should be his meffraate, and his compa-
nion; and if I would can y any thing with me, 1 mould
have all the advantage of it that the tradewould admit;.
and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.
I embraced the offer; and, entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest, plain
dealing man, went the voyage with him, and carried a
small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested
honesty of my friend, the captain, I increased very con-
siderably; for I carried about 401. in such toys and
trifles as the captain directed me to buy l this 401.1 had
mustered together by the assistance of- some of my rela-
tions, whom I corresponded with, and who, 1 believe,
got my sather, or at least my mother, to contribute so
much as that to my first adventure.' '.
This was the only royage which I may say was suc-
cesssul in all my adventures, and which 1 owe to the
integrity and honesty of my friend, the captain; under
whom I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics,
and the rules of navigation; learned how to keep an
account of the ship's course, take an observation, and,
in short, to understand some things that were needsul to
be understood by a sailor; for, as he took delight, to
introduce me, I took delight to learn: and, in a word,
this voyage made me both a sailor and'a merchant; for
I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for
my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my re-
turn, almost 3001.; and this filled me with thole aspiring
thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. . ,
Yet, even in this voyage, 1 had misfortunes too; par-
ticularly that I was continually sick, being thrown into
a violent calenture by the excessive heat os the climate;
our principal trading being upon the coast, from the
latitude of 15 degrees north, even to the line itself.
I was now set up fora Guinea trader; and my friend,
to my-great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, 1
. resolved to go the same voyage again; and I embarked
in the same vessel with one who was his mate in the
former voyage, and had now got the command of the
ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man
made \. for though j did not carry quite 1001. of my
- new gained wealth, so that I had 2001. left, and which
I lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to
me, yet I sell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage;
and the first w%s this, viz. Our ship, making her course
towards the Canary islands, or rather between those
islands and the African shore, was surprised in the grey
of the morning by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave
chace to us with all the sail she could make. We
crowded also as much canvass as our yards would spread,
or our masts carry, to have got clear: but finding the
pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up
with us in a sew hours, we prepared to fight, our ship
having twelve guns, and the rover eighteen. About
three in the afternoon he came up with us; and, bring-
ing to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of
athwart our Item, as he intended, we brought eight of
©ur
our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside
upon him, which made him sheer off again, after return-
ing our fire, and pouring in also his small shot from near
two hundred men which he had on board. However, we
had not a man touched, all our men keeping close. He
prepared to attaGk us again* and we to desend ourselves;
but laying us on board the next time upon our other quar-
ter, he entered ninety men upon our decks, who imme-
diately sell to cutting and hacking the decks and rigging.
We plied them with small shot, half pikes, powderchefts,.
and such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. How-
ever, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our
ship being disabled, and three of our men killed and eight
wounded, we wereobliged to yield, and were carried all
prisoners to Sallee i a port belonging to the Moors.
The usunge 1 had there was not so dreadsul as at first
I apprehended; nor was I carried up the country, to the
F.mperor's court, asthe rest of our men were, but was
kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize, and
made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his-
business. At this surprising change of my circumstances,
from a merchant to a miserable ilave, I was persectly
overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my sather's
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable,
and have none to relieve me; which I thought was now
so essectually brought to pass, that 1 could not be worse;
and now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I
was undone without redemption. But, alas! this'was
but a taste of the misery 1 was to go through, as wilt
appear in the sequel of this story.
. As my new patron or matter had taken me home to
his house, so I was in hopes that he would take me with
him when he went to sea again, believing that it would
be some time or other his sate to be taken by a Spanish or
Portugal man of war, and that then 1 should be set at
liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away; for
when he went to sea, he left me on shore to look after
his littlegarden; and do the drudgery of slaves about his
house; and when he came home again from his cruize,
he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look after the flaip.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what
method I might take to effect it; but found no way that
had
had the least probability in it; nothing presented to.make
the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to com-
municate it to, that would embark with me; no sellow
slave, no Englishman, Irishmen, or Scotsman there, but
myself; so that for two years, though 1 often pleased
myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least
encouraging prospect of putting it in practice,
x After about two years an odd circumstance presented
itself, which put the old thoughts of making some.
attempt for my liberty again in my head: my patron
lying at home longer than usual, without fitting out hi*-
ship, which, as I heard, was for want of money, he used
constantly once or twice a week, sometimes ostener, if
the weather was sair, to take the ship's pinnace and go
but into the road a fishing s and as he always took me
and a young Maresco with him, to row the boat,we made
him very merry, and I proved very dextrous in catching
fish; insomuch that sometimes he would tend me with
a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth Maresco, aa
they called him, to catch a dish of sish for him.
, It happened one time, that going a fishing with him hi
a calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we
were not half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it;
and rowing we knew not whither, or which way, we
laboured all day, and the next night; and when the
morning came, we found we had pulled off' to sea,
instead of pulling in for the shore, and that we were at
least two leagues from the land. However, we got well
in again, though with a great deal of labour, and some
danger; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the
morning; but particularly we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to
take more care of himself for the suture; and having
lying by him the long-boat of our English ship which
he had taken, he resolved he would not go a fishing any
more without a compass and some provision. {So he-
ordered the carpenter of his ship, who was also an Eng-
lish flave^to build a little state room, or cabin, in the
middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a
place to stand behind it to sieer, and hawl home the
main sheet; and room before for an hand or two to
stand and work the sails. She sailed with what we
call a shoulder of mutton sail; and the boom jibbed over
13
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
the top 'of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and
had in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a
table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in some
bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink; parti-
cularly his bread, rice, and cofsee.
We were frequently out with his boat a fishing, and
as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never
went without me. It happened one day that he had
appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or
for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction,
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily ; and had
therefore tent on board the boat over night a larger store
of provisions than usual; and had ordered me to get
ready three susils/with powder and shot, which were on
board his ship, for that they designed some sport os
fowling as well as sishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed,- and waited
the next morning with the boat washed clean, her an-
cients and pendants out, and every thing to accommo-
date his guests; when by and by my patron came on
board alone, and told me his guests had put off going,
upon some business that sell out; and ordered me, with
the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and
catch them some fHh, for that his friends were to sup at
his house: he commanded me too, that as soon as I had
got some fish, I should bring it home to his house; all
which I prepared to do. - '-
This moment my former notions of deliverance darted
into my thoughts, for now 1 sound I was like to have a
little ship at my command; and my master being gone,
I prepared to surnish myself, not forfishing business, but
for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did 1 so much
as consider whither 1 would steer; for any where to get
'out of that place was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak
to this Moor to get something for our subsistence on
board; for I told him we must not presume to eat of our
patron's bread; he laid that was true: so he brought a
large basket of rusk, or biscuit of their kind, and three
jars with fresh water, into the boat. I knew where my
ipatron'scase of bottles stood, which itwas evident by the
make were taken out of some English-prize, and I con-
i - <: veyed
veyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore,
as it they had been there before for our master. I'con-
veyed alto a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, which
weighed about half an hundred weight,-with a parcel of
twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all
which were of great use to us afterwards, especially
the wax to make candles. Another trick 1 tried upon
him, which he innocently came into alto: his name was
Ifmaei, whom they call Muley, orMoloy; so 1 called to
him, Moloy, said I, our patron's guns are all on board
the boat, can you not get a little powder and shot? it
may be we may kill some aleamies (a fowl like our cur-
lew), for ourselves; for I know he keeps the gunner'*
stores in the ship. Yes, said he,Tll bring some; accord-
ingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held about
a pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and
another with shot, that had five or lix pounds, with some
bullets, and put all into the boat: at the lame time I
had . found some powder of my master's in the great
cabin, with which I filled one of the large bottles in the
case, which was almost empty, pouring what was in it
into another; and thus surnished with every thing need-
sul, we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which
was at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and
took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out
of the port before we hawled in our sail, and sat us down
to fish. The wind blew from the N. N. E. which was
contrary to my destre; for had it blown southerly, I had
been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least
reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were,
blow which way it would, I would be gone from that
horrid place where I was, and leave the rest to sate.
After we had fished some time and catched nothing
(for when I had fish on my hook I would not pull them
up, that be might not see them), I said to the Moor,
This will not do, our master will not be thus served; we
must stand sarther off': he, thinking no harm, agreed;
and being in the head of the boat, set the sails; and as I
had the helm, I ran the boat out near a league sarther,
and then brought her to as if 1 would fish; when, giving
the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor
was, and making as if 1 stooped for something behind
him,
him, I took him by surprise with myarm underhis twift,
a»d tossed him clear overboard into the sea: he rose
immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me^
begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over the
world with me. He swam so strong after the boat,
that he would have reachedgne very quickly, there being
feut little wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin,
and setching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at
him, and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he
would be quiet, I would do him none. But, said I,
you swim well enough to reach the shore, and the sea is
calm; make the best of your way to the shore, and I
will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat, I
will shoot you through the head; for 1 am resolved to
have my liberty. So he turned himself about, and swam
for the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with
ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was no
venturing to trust him. When he was gone, I turned to
the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him, Xury,
if you will be saithsul to me, I will make you a great
man; but if you will not stroke your sace to be true to
me, that is, swear by Mahomet, and his sather's beard,
I must throw you into the sea teo. The boy smiled ht
my sace, and spoke so innocently, that I could not mis-
trust him, and swore to be saithsul. to me, and go all
ove.r the world with me.
'While I was in the view of the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea, with the boat rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me gone
towards the Streight-mouth (as indeed any one that had
been in their wits must have been supposed to do), for
-who would have supposed we were sailed on to the south-
ward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations
of negroes were sure to surround ms with their canoes,
and dellroy us; where we could never once go one shore,
but we lliould be devoured by savage beasts, or more
merciless savages of human kind!
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed
my course, and steered directly south and by east, bend-
ing my course towards the east, that I might keep
i*
in with the shore; and having a sair fresh gale of wind,.
and a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail, that I believe
by the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when
I first made the land, I could not be less than one hun-
dred and fifty miles south of Sallee, quite beyond the
Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any
other King thereabouts, for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and
the dreadsul apprehensions I had of salling into their
hands, that I' would not stop, or go on shore, or come to
an anchor, the wind continuing sair, till I had sailed in
that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the
southward, 1 concluded also, that if any of our vessels
rvere in chace of me, they also would now give over; so
'1 ventured to make the coast, and came to an anchor in
the mouth of a little riverj 1 knew not what or where,
neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or
what river. I neither saw, nor desired to see any people;
the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We
came Into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim
on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the coun-
try: but as loon as it was quite dark, we heard such
dreadsul noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of
•wild creatures of we knew not what kinds, that the
• poor boy was ready to die with sear, and begged of mi
not to go on shore till day. Well,Xury, said i, then I
won't; but it may be we may see men by day, who will
be as bail to us as those lions. Then we may give them
the shoot gun, says Xury, laughing, make them run
away: such F.nglish Xury spoke by conversing among
us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy so cheer-
sul, and I gave him a dram out of our patron's case of
bottles to cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was
good, and 1 took it. We dropped oc little anchor,
Tind lay still all4night—I say still, for we slept none;
for in two or three.hours we saw vast great creatures,
we knew not what to call them, of many sorts, come
down to the sea shore, and run into the water, wallow-
ing and washing themselves, for the pleasure of cooling
themselves; and they made such hideous bowlings and
yellings, that I ne,ver indeed heard the like.
Xury
Xury was dreadsully frighted, and indeed so was I
too. But we were both worse frighted when we heard
one mighty creature come swimming towards our boat;
we could not see him, but we might hear him by his
blowing, to be a monstrous, huge, and surious beast;
Xury said it was a lion, and it might be for ought I
know. Poor Xury cried out to me to weigh the anchor,
and row away- No, says I, Xury, we can ssip our cable
with a buoy to it, and go to sea, they cannot follow us
sar. 1 had no sooner said so, but I perceived the crea-
ture, whatever it was, within two oars length, which
something surprised me. However, 1 immediately
stepped to the cabin door, and saking up my gun, fired
at him ; upon which he immediately turned about, and
swam towards the shore again.
But it was not possible to describe the horrible noises
and hideous cries and howlings that were raised, as well
upon the edge o: the lhore as higher within the coun-
try, upon the noise or report of a gun, a thing 1 have
some reason to believe those creatures had never heard
before. This convinced me that there was no going on
store for us in the night upon thai coast; and. how to
venture on shore in the day, was another question too;
for to have sallen into the hands of any of the savages,
had been as bad as to have sallen into the paws of lions
and tigers; at least we were equally apprehensive of the
danger of it.
Be that as it^ivould, we were obliged to go on shore
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint
Wt in the boat; when or where to get to it was the
point. Xury said if 1 would let him go on shore with
one of the jars, he would find if there was any water,
and. bring some to me. 1 asleed him why he would go,
why 1 should not go, and he stay in the boat? The boy
answered with so much affection, that made me love
him ever after. Says he, if wild mails come, they eat
me, you go away. Well, Xury, said ], we will both
go, and it the wild mans come, we will kill them; they
shall tat neither of us. So i gav e Xury a piece of rusk-
bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of
bottles, which I mentioned before, and we hawled the
boat io as near the shore as we thought was proper,
and waded on shore, carrying nothing but our arms, and
two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, searing
the coming of the canoes with savages down the river:
but the boy, seeing a low place about a mile up the
country, rambled to it; and by and by I saw him coma
running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some
savage, or frighted by some wild beast, and I ran for-
ward towards him to help him; but when 1 came nearer
to him, I law something hanging over his shoulders,
which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but
disserent in colour, and longer legs: however, we were
very glad of it, and it was very good meat- but the great
joy that poor'Xury came with, was to tell me he had
found good water, and had seen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take such
pains for water, for a little higher up the creek where
we were, we found the water fresh when the tide was
out i which Sows but a little way up; so we filled our
jars, and seasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared
to gi) on our way, having seen no footsteps o£any human
creature iathat part of the country..
As 1 had been one voyage to this Coast. bef< iv, I knew
very well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Ctipe
de Verd islands also, lay not sar ofs' from the coast; but
as I had no instruments to take an observation, to know
what latitude we were in, and did not exactly know, or at
least nor remember what latitude they were in, I knew
not where to look for them, or when to siaud off to sea
towards them, otherwise 1 might now easily have found
some of these islands. Hut my hope was, that if I stood
along this coalttilll came to that part where the t.ng-
lith traded, 1 should find some ot their vessels upon their
usual deiign of trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where I now
was, must be that country which, lying between the
Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the negroes, lies
waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the ne-
groes having abandoned it, and gone surther south for
.tear of the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it worth
inhabiting by reason of its barrenness; and indeed both
forsaking it because os the prodigious numbers of tigers,
lions,
lions, leopards, and other surious creatures which har-
bour there; so that the Moors use it for their hunting
only, where they go like an army, two or three thou-
sand men at a time: and indeed for near an hundred
miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a
waste uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing
but howlings and roarings of wild beads by night.
Once or twice in the day time 1 thought 1 saw the
Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the mountain
Teneriffe, in the Canaries ;' and had a great mind to
venture out in hopes of reaching thither; but having
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the
sea also going too high for my little vessel; so I resolved
to pursue my first design, and kept along the shore.
Several times we were obliged to land for fresh water,
after we had left this place; and once in particular,
being early in the morning, we came to an anchor under
a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the
tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go sarther in.
Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it seems
mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me, that we had
best go sarther off the shore; For, says he, look yonder
lies a dreadsul monster, on the fide of that hillock, sast
asleep. I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadsul
monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion, that lay
on the side of the shore, Under the shade of a piece of the
hill, that hung as it were a little over him. Xury, said
I, you'shall goon ftore and kill him. Xury looked
frighted, and said, Me kill! he eat me at one mouth ; one
mouthsul- he meant. However, I said no more to the
boy, but bade him be still, and took our biggest gun,
which was almost musket bore, and loaded it with a
good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it
down; then 1 loaded another gun with two bullets, and
the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with five
smaller' bullets. I took the best aim I could with the
sirst piece to have shot him in the head; but he lay so,
with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slug
hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He
started up, growled at first; but finding his leg broke,
sell down again, and then got up upon three legs, and
gave the most hideous roar that 1 ever heard. 1 was a
little
25
little surprised that I had not hit him on the head: how-
ever I took up the second piece immediately, and though
he began to' move off, fired again, and shot him into the
head, and had the pleasure to see him drop; and, making
but little noise, he lay struggling for lise. Then Xury
took heart, arid would have me let him go on shore.
Well go, said I. So the boy jumped into the water, and
taking the little gun in one hand, swam to the shore with
the other hand; and coming close to the creature, put
the muzzle of the piece to. his ear, and shot him into the
head again, which dispatched him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food;
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and
shot upon a creature that was good for nothing to us.
However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he
comes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet.
For what, Xury f laid I. Me cut off his head, said he.
However, Xury could not cut off his head, but he cut off
a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous
great one.
I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of
him might one way or other be of some value to us ; and
I resolved to take off hisskin if I could. So Xury and I
went to work with-him; but Xury was much the better
workman at it; for I knew very ill how to do it. 'Indeed
it took us up both the whole day: but at last we got off
the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our cabin,
the sun effectually dried it in two days time, and it'after-
wards served me to lie upon.
After this stop we made on to the southward continu-
ally for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our
provisions, which began to abate very much, and going
no oftener into the shore than we were obliged to for
fresh water. . My design in this was to make the river
Gambia, or Senegal; that Is to say, any where about the
Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some
European ship : .antrifT' did not, I knew not what course
1 hadtot^ke, but to seek for the islands, or perish there
among .the negroes.' I knew. that all the ships from
Europe, which satied either to the coast of Guinea, or
to BrasiliOr to the East Indies, made this cape, or those
islands; and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune^
voi.. i, c uP°^y
upon this single point, either that I must meet with some
ship, or must perish. ,
When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I said, I began to see that the land was inha-
bited; and in-two or three places, as we sailed by, we
saw people stand upon the shore, to look at us; we could
also perceive they were quite black, and stark naked. I'
was once inclined to have gone on shore to them ; but
Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me, No go,
no go* . However, I hawled in nearer the shore, that I
might talk to'them; and I found they ran along the shore
by me a good way. I observed they had no weapons in
their hands, except one, who had a long slender slick,
which Xury said was a lance, and that they could throw
them a great way with good aim ; so I kept at a distance,
'but talked with them by signs as well as I could, and
particularly made signs for something to eat. They
beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would setch
me some meat. Upon this I lowered the top of my sail,
and lay by; and two of them ran up into the country,
and in less than half an hour came back, and brought
-with them two pieces of dried flesh, and some corn, such
as is the produce of their country; but vye neither knew
<what the one nor the other was; however, we were wil-
ling to accept it. But how to come at it was our next
dispute; for I was not for venturing on shore to them, and
they were as much afraid of us; but they took a sase way
for us all; for they brought it to the shore, and laid it
down, and went and stood a great way off', till we setched
it on board, and then came close to us again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing
to make them amends; but an opportunity ossered that
very instant to oblige them wondersully; for while we
were lying by the shore, came two mighty creatures, one
pursuing the other, as we took it, with great sury, from
the mountains towards the sea; whether it was the male
pursuing the semale, or whether they were in sport, or in
rage, we could not tell, any more than we could tell
whether it was usual or strange; but I believe it was the
latter, because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures
seldom appear but in the night; and in the second place,
we found the. 'people ternbly affrighted, especially the
. i i women.
women. The man that had the lance to dart did not fly
from them, but the rest did. However, as the two crea-
tures ran directly into the water, they did not seem to off er
to sall upon the negroes,but plunged themselves into the sea,
and swam about as if they had come for their diversion.
At last one of them began to come nearer our boat than
i. first expected; but I lay ready for him; for I had
loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade
Xur^-load both the others. As soon as he came sairly
wifriilrt my reach, I fired, and shot him directly into the
head: immediately he sunk down into the water, but
rose instantly, and plunged up and down as struggling for
lise, and so indeed he was: he immediately made to the
shore; but between the wound which was his mortal
hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just before
he reached shore.
It is irnpossible to express the astonishment of these
poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun; some of
them were ready even to die with sear, and sell down
us dead with the very terror. But when they saw the
creature dead, and sunk into the water, and that I made
signSito them to come to the shore, they took heart,
and came to the shore, and began to search for the cYea-
ture. 1 found him by his blood staining the water, and
by the help of a rope which 1 slung round him, and
gave the negroes to hawl; they dragged him on shore,
ajjfad found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted and
•fine to an admirable degree; and the negroes held up their
hands with admiration to think what it was I killed him
with. 1
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire,
and the noise of the gun, swam to the shore, and ran
up directly to-the mountains from which they came,
nor could I at that distance know what it was. I found
quickly the negroes were for eating the flesh of this
creature; so 1 was willing to have them take it as. a
savour from me; .which, when I made signs to- them.
that they might take it, they were veiy thanksul for.
Immediately they sell to work with him , and though they
had no knise, yet, with a sharpened piece of wood they
took off' his skin as readily, nay much more readily than
we would -have done with a knise; they ossered me some
... c 2" of
of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would give
it them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave
me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their
•.provision, which, though I did not understand, yet I
accepted. Then I made signs to them for some water,
and held out one of my jars to them, turning its bottom
upward, to shew that it was empty, and that I wanted
to have it filled. They called immediately to some of
their friends, and there came two women, and brought a
great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as 1 suppose, in the
sun; this they set down for me, as* before, and I sent
Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three.—
The women were as stark naked as the men.
I was now surnished with roots and corn, such as it
was, and water; and leaving my friendly ^eajroes, I
made forward for about eleven days more, without offer-
ing to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a great
length into the sea, at about the distance of sour or five
'leagues before me; and the se^ being very calm, I kept
a large offing to make this point. At length, doubling
the point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw
plainly land on the other side, to sea-wards; then I con-
cluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this was the
Cape de Verd, and those the islands, called from thence
Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at a great
distance, and 1 could not well tell what I had best to do;
for if I should be taken with a fresh gale of wind, I might
neither reach one nor the other. w
in this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into -
- <the cabin, and set me down, Xury having the helm ;—
when on a sudden the boy cried out, Master, master, a
ship was a sail! and the foolish boy was frighted out of
his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master's
ships sent so pursue us, when I knew we were gotten sar
enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin,
and immediately saw, not only the ship, but what she was,
viz. that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was
bound to the coast of Guinea for negroes. But when I ob-
served the course she steered, I was soon convinced they
w.ere bound some other way, and did not design to go any
nearer the shore; upon which I stretched out to sea as
much as I could, resolving to speak with them, if possible.
With
With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be
able to come in their way, but that they would be gone
by before I could make any signal to them,; but after I
had croudedto the utmost, and began to despair, they, it*,
seems, law me by the help of their perspective-glasses,
and that it was some European boat, which they sup-
posed must belong to some ship that was lost; so they
shortened sail to let me come up. 1 was encouraged with
this ; and as I had my patron's ensign on board, I made
a waft of it to them, for a signal of distress, and fired a-
gun, both of whick they saw; for they told me they saw
the smoke, though they did not hear the gun; upon these
signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me,
and in about three hours time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, in Spanish,'
and in French, but I understood none of them; but at
last a Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me, and
1 answered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that
had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at
Salee; then they bid me come on board. and very kindly
took me in, and all my goods.
It was an ine^presiible joy to me, any one will believe,
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a
miserable, and almost hopeless condition as I was in; I
immediately offered all 1 had to the captain of the ship,,
as a return for my deliverance; but he generously told
me he would take nothing from me, but that all 1 had
should be delivered sase to me when I came to the Brasils;
for, says he, I have saved ydur lise on no other terms,
than as I would be glad to be saved myself; and it may
one time or other be my lot to be taken up in the same
condition. Besides, when I carry you to the Brasils, so
great a way from your own country, if I should take from
you what little you have, you will be starved tfaerey ani
then I only take away that lise I have given. No, no,
Signior Inglese (Mr. Englishman) I would carry yc*a
there in charity; and these things will help you to buj*
your subsistence there, and your passage home again.
As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in
the persormance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen,
that none should offer to touch any thing I had; then he
took every thing into his own possession, and gave me
c 3 back
back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them
again, even so much as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he
few, and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's
use, and asked me what I would have for it. I told him
he had been so generous to me in every thing, that 1 could
not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely
to him; upon which he told me he would give me a
note of his hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at
Brasil; and when it came there, if any one offered to
give more, he would make it up. He offered me also
iixty pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I
was loath to take; not that 1 was unwilling to let the
Captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor
boy's liberty, who had assisted me so saithsully in pro-
curing my own. However, when I let him know my
reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me this me-
dium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set
him free in ten years, if he turned Christian. Upon this,
and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the
Captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and arrived
in the bay de Todos los Santos, or All Saints Bay, in
about twenty-two days after. And now I was onCe more
delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of lise,
and what to do.next with myself I was to consider.
The generous treatment the Captain gave me I can
never sufficiently remember; he would take nothing of
me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's
skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had in the
boat; and-caused every thing I had in the strip to be
punctually delivered me; and what I was willing to sell
he bought ; such as the case of bottles, two of my guns,
and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I had made
candles of the rest. In a word, I made about two hun-
dred and thirty pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with
this stock I went on shore in the Brasi!s.
i had not been long here, but being recommended to
the houie of a good honest man like himself, who had an
ingenio, as they call it, that is, a plantation, and a sugar-
house, I lived with him some time, and acquainted
myself, by that means, with the manner of their plant-
ing and making sugar; and seeing how well the planters
lived,
31
lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved, if 1
could get a licence to settle there, I would turn planter
among them; resolving, in the mean time, to find out
some way to get my money, which I had left in London,
remitted tome. To this purpose, getting a kind of a
letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land, that
was uncured, as my money would reach; and formed a
plan for my plantation and settlement, and such an one
as might he suitable to the ttock which I proposed to my-
self to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born
of English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much
such circumstances as I was, I call him neighbour, be-
cause his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on
very sociably together; my stock was but low, as well
as,his; and we rather planted for food than any thing
else, for about two years. However,we began to increase,
and our land began to come into order; so that the third
year we planted some tobacco, and male each of us a
large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the
year to conrte; but we both wanted help; and now I
found more than before, I had done wrong in paiting
withjny boy Xury.
--—•But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was
no great wonder; I had no remedy but to go on ;• 1 was
gotten into an employment quite remote to my genius,
and directly contrary to the lise I delighted in, ant! for
which I forsook my sather's house, and broke through all
his good advice. Nay, 1 was coming into the very mid-
dle station, or upper degree of low lise, which my sather
advised me to before, and which, if I resolved to go on
with, I might as well have staid at home, and never sa-
tigued myself in the world, as I have done: and i used
often to say to myself, I could have done this as well in
England among my friends, as have gone five thousand
miles off, to do it among Grangers and savages, in a wil-
derness, and at such a distance as never to hear from any
part of the world that had the least knowledge of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition with
the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with but
now and then this neighbour; no work to be done but
by the labour of my hands; and L used to say, I lived
c 4 just
ADVENTURES OT ROBINSON CRUSOE.
just like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that
had nobody there but himself: but how just has it been,
and how should all men reflect, that when they compare
their present condition with others that are worse, heaven
may oblige them to make the exchange, and be con-
vinced of their former selicity, by their experience! I
saw how just it has been, that the truly solitary lise I re-
flected on in an island, or mere desolation, should be my
lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the lise
which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in
all probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich!
I was in some degree settled in my measures for carry-
ing on the plantation, before my kind friend the Captain
of the ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the
ship remained there in providing her loading, and pre-
paring for her voyage, near three months; when telling
him what little stock I had left behind me in London,
he gave me this friendly and sincere advice :—Signior
Inglese, says he (for so he always called me), if you will
give me letters, and a procuration here, in form to me,
With orders to t'ne person who has your money in Lon-
3.*11, to send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I
shall direct, and in such goods as are proper for, this
country, I will bring y.u the produce of them, God will-
ing, at my return; but since human affairs are all sub-
ject to changes and disasters, 1 would have you give
orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which you
lay is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the
first J so that if it comes sase, you may order the rest the
same way; and if it miscarries, you may have the other
half to have recourse to for your supply.
This was such wholesome advice, and looked so friend-
ly, that I could not but be convinced it was the best
course I could take; so I accordingly prepared letters to
the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and
a procuration to the Portuguese Captain, as he desired.
I wrote the English Captain's widow a sull account
of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I
had met with the Portugal Captain at sea, the humanity
of his behaviour, and what condition 1 was now in, with
all other necessary directions for my supply; and when
this honest Captain came to Lisbon, he sound means, by
some
some of the English merchants there, to send over not
the order only,' but a sull account of my story to a mer-
chant at London, who presented it efsectually to her ;—
whereupon , she not only delivered the money, but out
of her own pocket sent the Portugal Captain a very hand--
lome present forhis humanity and charity to me.-
The merchant in London vested this hundred pounds in
Engiish goods, such as the Captain had written for; sent
them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all
sase to me to the Brasils: among which, without my.
direction (for I was too young in my business to think of
them), he had taken care to have all forts of tools, iron-
work, and utensils necessary for my. plantation,- and
which were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made,
for I was surprized with the joy of it; and my good
steward, the Captain, had laid out the five pounds which
my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to
purchase, and bring me over a servant,. under bond
sor six years service, and would not accept of any consi-
deration, except a little tobacco^ which I would have
him accept, being of my own produce.-
Ncither was this all; but my goods, being all English
manusactures, such as cloth, stusfs bays, and things par-
ticularly valuable and desirable in the country, 1 found
means to sell them to a very great*advantage; so that I.
may say I had more than four times the value of my first
cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my poor neigh-
bour, I mean in the advancement of my plantation; for
for the firll thing I did, I bought me a Negro slave, and
an European servant also; I mean another betides that
which the'Captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very
means of our greatest adversity, so was it with me. I.
went on the next year with great success in my planta-
tion; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco, on my own-
ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among
my neighbours; and these fifty rolls being each of above
one hundred pounds weight, were well cured, and laid
by, against the return of the fleet from Liibon. And now
increasing in business and wealth, my head bt:gan to be
sull of projects and undertakings beyond my reach;—-
c&' " such
such as are indeed often the ruin of the best heads in
business. .'
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet besallen me, for
which my sather so earnestly recommended a quiet re-
tired lise, and which he had so sensibly described the
middle station of lise to be sull of; but other things at-
tended me; and I was still to be the wilsul agent of all
my own miseries; and particularly to increase my saults,
and double the reflections upon myself, which in my su-
ture sorrows I should have leisure to make: all these
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate
adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad;
and pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the
clearest views of doing myself good in a sair and plain
pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of lise,
which nature and Providence concurred to present me
with, and to make my duty.
As I had once dor^e this in breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must go
and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and
thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a
rash and immoderate desire of rising saster than the na-
ture of the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself down
again into the deepest gulph of human misery that ever
man sell into, or perhaps could be consistent with lise, and
a state of health in the world.
To come then, by just degrees, to the particulars of
this part of my story; you may suppose, that having
now lived almost four years in the Brasils, and beginning
to thrive and prosper very well upon my plantation, I
had not only learned the language, but had contracted
acquaintance and friendship among my sellow planters,
as well as among the merchants at St. Salvadore, xvhich
was our port; and that, in my discourse among them, I
had frequently given them an account of my two voyages
to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the
negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the
coast, for trifles (such as beads, toys, knives, fciflars, hat-
chets, bits of glass, and the like) not only gold dust,
Guinea grains, elephants teeth, &c. but negroes for the
service of the Brasils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my discourses
on those heads, but especially to that part which related
to the buying negroes, which was a trade at that time not
only not sar entered into, but, as sar as it was, had been
carried on by the Affientos, or permission of the king of
Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock;
so that sew negroes were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company one day with some
merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of those things very earnestly, three of them came to me
the next morning, and told me, they had been musing
very much upon what I had discoursed os with them the
last night, and they came to make a secret proposal to
me; and,-after enjoining me secrecy, they told me that
they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; thi'.t
they had all plantations as well as I, and were streight-
ened for nothing. so much as servants; that as it was a
trade that could not publicly sell the negroes when they
came home, so they desired to make but one voyage,
to bring the negroes on shore privately, and divide them
among their own plantations; and, in a word, the ques-
tion was, whether I would go their supercargo in the
ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of
Guinea? And they offered me, that 1 should have my
equal share os the negroes, without providing any part
of the stock.:
This was a sair proposal,-it'must be consessed, had it
been made to any one that had not had a settlement and-
plantation of his own to look after, which was in a sair
way of coming to be very considerable, and with a good
slock upon it. But for me, that was thus established, and
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for three or
four years more,- and to have sent for the other hundred.
poundsfrom England, and whoin that time, and with that
little additipn^ could scarce have sailed of being worth'
three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing
too; forme to think of such a voyage, was the molt
preposterous thing that ever man, in such circumstances,
could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,. could
no more resist the offer than I could restrain my first
rambling designs, when my sather's good counsel was
c 6 lost
lost upon me. In a word, I told them 1 would go with
all my heart, if they would undertake to look after my
plantation in my absence, and would dispose of.it to such
as I should direct, if I miscarried. This they all en-'
gaged to do, and entered into writings, or covenants, to
do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of my plan-
tation and essects, in case of my death, making the Cap-
tain of the ship that had saved my lise, as before, my uni-
versal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my efsects as I
had directed in my will; one half of the produce being
to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.
In snort, I took all possible caution to preserve my ef-
sects, znd to keep up my plantation. Had I used half as
much prudence to' have looked into my own interest, and
have made a judgment of what I ought to have done,
and n'ot to have done, I had certainly never gone away
from so prosperous an undertaking; leaving all the pro-
bable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone upon a
voyage to sea, attended with all its common .hazards ;—
to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular
misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates
of my sancy, rather than my reason; and accordingly
the ship being fitted out, and the cargo finished, and all
things done as by agreement, by my partners in the voy-
age; I went on board in an evil hour again, the 1st of
September, 1659, being the same day eight years that I
went from my sather and mother at Hull, in oi\.er to act
the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own
interest.
Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons bur-
then, carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the mas-
ter, his boy, and myself. We had on board no large
cargo of goods, except such toys as were fit for.our trade
with the negroes j such as beads, bits of glatsj^shells, and
odd trifles; especially little looking-glasses, .'kriives, scis-
sors, hatchets, and the like.
The same'day I went on board we set sail, standing
away to the northward upon our own coaits, with design
to stretch over for the African coast, when they*.fcame in
about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which,
it seems, was the manner of their courlewl those days.—
3 We
We had very good weather, only excessive hot, all the
way upon our own coast, till we came to the height of
Cape St. Augustino ; from whence, keeping sarther off
at sea, we loll sight of land< and steered as if we were
bound for the isle Fernand de Noronba, holding ovsr
course N. E, by N. and leaving those isles on the East.
In this course we passed the line in about twelve day's
time, and were, by our last observation, in seven degrees
twenty-two min. northern latitude, when a violent tor-
nado or hurricane took us quite out of our knowledge; it
began from the south-east, came about to the north-west,
and then settled in the north-east, from whence it blew
in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together
we could do nothing but drive; and scudding away be-
sore it, let it carry us wherever fete, and the sury of the
winds, directed; and during these twelve days I need not
say that I expected every day to be swallowed up; nor
did any in the ship expect to save their lives.
1n this distress we had, besides the terror of a storm,
one of our men died of the calenture, and a man and a
boy washed over-board. About the twelfth day, the
Xveather abating a little, the master made an observation
as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven
degrees of north latitude, but that he was twenty-two
degrees of longitude difference west from Cape St. Au-
gustino, so that he found he was gotten upon the coast
of Guiana,. or the north part of Brasil, beyond the river
Amazones, towards that of the river Oroonoque, com-
monly called the Great River; and now he began to
consult with me what course he should take, for the ship
was leaky, and very much disabled; and he was for
going directly back to thecoast of Brasil.
I was positively against that, and, looking over the
charts of the sea coast of America with him, we concluded
there was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to,
till we came within the circle of the Caribbee Islands, and
therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes, which,
by keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraught of the bay
or gulph of Mexico, we might easily persorm, as we
hoped, in about fifteen days sail; whereas we could not
possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without
lbme assistance both to our ship and to ourselves.'
With
With this design we changed our course, and steered
away N. W. by W. in order to reach some of our Eng-
lish islands, where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was
otherwise determined ; for, being in the latitude of twelve
deg. eighteen min. a second storm came upon us, which
carried us away with the seme impetuosity westward,
and drove us so out of the very way of all human com-
merce, that had all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we
were rather in danger of being devoured by savages, than
ever returning to our own country.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one
of our men early one morning cried out land; and we
had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes
of seeing whereabouts in the world we were, but the ship
struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being
so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner that
we expected we mould all have peristed immediately;
and we were even driven into our close quarters, to shel-.
ter us from tne very foam and spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in tha
like condition, to describe or conceive the consternation
of men in such circumstances; we knew nothing where
we were, or upon what land it was we were driven ;.
whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or
not inhabited; and, as the rage of the wind was still .
great, though rather less than at first, we could not so
much as hope to have the ship hold out many minutes -
without breaking in pieces, unless the winds, by 'a kind
of miracle, mould turn immediately about. In a word,
we sat looking one upon another, and expecting death
every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as
preparing for another world; for there was little or
nothing more for us to do in this. That' which was
our present comsort, and all the comfort we had, was,
that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did not
break yet, and that the master said the wind began to
abate.
Now, though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship, having thus struck upon the land,
and iticking too sast for us to expect her getting off, we
were in a dreadsul condition indeed, and had nothing to
do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could.—
We had a boat at our stern just before the storm; but
file was first staved by dashing against the ship's rudder,
and, in the next place, she broke away, and either sunk,
or was driven off to sea; so there was no hope from her:
we had another boat on board, but how to get her off into
the sea was a doubtsul thing. However, there was no
room to debate; for we sancied the ship would break in
pieces every minute; and some told us she was actually
broken already.
In this distress the mate of our vessel lays hold of the
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men, they got
her flung over the ship's side ; and getting all into her, let
go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in number, to
God's mercy and the wild sea; for though the storm was
abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadsully high
upon the shore, and might well be called Uen wild Zee,
as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all
saw plainly that the sea went so high, that the boat
could not escape, and that we should be inevitably
drowned. As to making sail we had none, nor, if we
had, could we have done any thing with it: so we
worked at the oar towards the land, though with heavy
hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew that
-when the boat came near the shore, she would be dashed
in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea.' However,
we committed our souls to God in the most earnest man-
ner; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we
hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling, as
well as we could, towards land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation was,
if we might happen into some bay or gulph, or the mouth
of some river, where by great chance we might have run
our boats in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps
made smooth water. But there was nothing of this
appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore,
the land looked more frightsul than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league
and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-
like
like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly bid us expect
the coup de grace. In a word, it took us with such a
sury, that it overset the boat at once; and separating us as
well from the boat as from one another, gave us not time
hardly to say, O God! for we were all swallowed up in
a moment.
Nothing can describe the consusion of thought which
i selt when I sunk into the water; for though 1 swam
very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves
so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me, or
rather carried me a vast way on towards the shore, and
having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land
almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I
had so much presence of mind, as well as breath left,
that, seeing myself nearer the main land than-1 expected,
1 got upon my seet, and endeavoured to make on to-
wards the land as sast as I could, before another wave
should return and Kike me up again. But I soon found
it was.impossible to avoid it; for i law the sea come after
me as high as a great hill, and as surious as an enemy,
which I had no means or strength to contend with: my
business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon
the water, if I could, and so by swimming to preserve my
breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible;
my greatest concern now being, that the wave, as it
would carry me a great way towards the shore when it
came on, might not carry me back again with it, when it
gave back towards the lea.'
The wave that came upon me again, buried meat once
twenty or thirty seet deep in its own body, and I could
seel myself carried with a mighty force and swiftness
towards the shore a very great way; but. I held my
breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with
all my might. I was ready to burst with holding my
breath, when, as 1 found myself rising up, so, to my
immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot
out above the sursace of the water; and though it was
not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so,
yet it relieved me greatly; gave me breath and new
courage. I was Covered again with water a good
while, but not so long but I held it out: and finding the
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck
forward
forward against the return of thfe waves, and selt
ground again with my seet. I stood still a sew moments
to recover breath, and till the waters went from. me, and
then I took to my heels, and ran with what strength I
had sarther towards the shore. But aeither would this
deliver me from the sury of the sea, which came pouring
after me again, and twice more I was lifted up by the
waves, and carried forwards as before, the shore being
very flat.
The last time of these two had well near been satal
to me; for the sea, having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of a
rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless, and
indeed helpless, as to mine own deliverances; for the
blow, taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it
were quite out of my body; and had it returned again
immediately, 1 must have been strangled in the water;
but I recovered a little before the return of the waves;
and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I
resolved to hold sast by a piece of the rock, and so to
nold my breath, if possible, till the wave went back.
Now as the waves were not so high as at first, being
near land, I kept my hold till the waves abated; and
then setched another run, which brought me so near the
shore, that the next wave, though it went over me, yet
did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the
next run I took I got to the main land, where, to my
great comfort, I clambered up the clifts of the shore, and
sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite
out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and sase on shore, and/began to
look up and thank God, that my lise was laved in a,
case wherein there was, some minutes before, scarce any
room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express to the
lise what the extasies and transports of the soul are
when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the very grave;
and I do not ^wonder now at that custom, viz. that
when a malesactor, who has the halter about his neck,
is tied up, and just going to be turned otf', and has a
reprieve brought to him; I lay I do not wonder that
they bring a surgeon with if, To let him blood that very
moment they tell him 0f it^ that the surprise may not
drive
drive the animal spirits from the heart, and overwhelm
him.
For sodden joys, like griefs, confound at first.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands,
and my whole being, as 1 may lay, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe, rcfle6ting
upon all my comrades that were* drowned, and that there
should not be one foul saved but myself j for as for them
I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of them, except
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not
sellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach
and froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it
lay so sar off; and considered, Lord, how was it possible
1 could get on shore!
After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me to see
what kind of place I was in, and what was the next to
be done; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that,
in a word, I had a dreadsul deliverance; for 1 was wet,
had no clothes to shift me, nor any thing either to eat or
drink to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect be-
fore me but that of perishing with hunger, or being. de-
voured by wild beasts. And that which was particu-
larly asflicting to me was, that I had no weapon either to
hunt or kill any creature for my sustenance, or to desend
mytelf against any other creature that might desire to kill
me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a
knise, a tobacco pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this
was all my provision, and this threw me into terrible
sgonies of mind, that for a while 1 ran about like a mad-
man. Night coming upon me, I began, with an heavy
heart, to consider what would be my lot, if there were
any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night they
always come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that
time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but
thorny, which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit
all night, and conlider the next day what death I should
tdie;
4?
die; for as yet I saw no prospect of lise. I walked
about a surlong from the shore, to see if I could find any
sresh water to drink, which I did, to my great joy;
and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth,
to prevent hunger, I went to the tree; and, getting up
into it, endeavoured to place myself so as that, if I
should sleep, I might not sall; and, having cut me
a short stick like a truncheon for my desence, I took up
my lodging; and having been excessively satigued, I sell
sall asleep, and slept as comfortably as I believe sew
could have done in my condition; and found myself the
most refreshed with it, that I think I ever was on such an
occasion.
When I awaked it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and
swell as before. But that which surprised me most was,
that the ship was lifted off in the night from the sand
where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was
driven up almost as sar as the rock, which I sirst men-
tioned, where I had been so bruised by the dashing me
against it: this being within about a mile from the shore
where I was, and the ship seeming to stand up still, I
wished myself on board, that at least I might have some
necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I
looked about me again; and the first thing I found was
the boat, which lay as the wind and the sea had tossed
her upon the land, about two miles to my right hand. I
walked as sar as I could upon the shore to have got to
her; but found a neck or inlet of water between me and
the boat, which was about half a mile broad; so I came
back for the present, being more intent upon getting at
the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present
subsistence.
A 1ittle after noon I found the sea very calm, and
the tide ebbed so sar out, that I could come within a
quarter of a mile of the ship. And here i found a fresh
renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently, that if we.
had kept on board, we had been all sase; that is to say,
we had all got sase on shore, and I had not been so mi-
serable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and
company as I how was. This forced tears from my
eyes
eyes again; but as there was little relief in that, I re-
solved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled osf my
clothes (for she weather was hot to an extreme) and took
to the water; but when I came to the ship, my difficulty
was still greater to know how to get on board; as she
lay aground and high out of the water, there was no-
thing within my reach, to lay hold of. 1 swam round
her. twice, and the second time I espied a small piece of
rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hang dowa,
by the fore-chains, so low, as with great difficulty 1 got
hold of it; and, by the help of that rope, got up into
the forecastle of the ship-. Here I found -that the ship
was bilged, and a great deal of water in the hold ;. but
that slie lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or
rather earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank,
and her head low almost to the water; by this means all
her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was
dry; for you may be'sure my work was to search, and
to see what was spoiled, and what was free. And first t
found that all the ship's provisions were dry, and un-
touched by the water; and, being very well disposed to
eat, I went to the bread-room, and filled my pockets with
biscuit, and eat it as I went about other things, for I bad
no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin ,
of which I took a large dram, and which 1 had indeed
need enough of, to spirit me for what was before me.
Kow 1 wanted nothing but a boat to surnish myself with
many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to
me.
It was in vain to sit still, and wish for what was not
to be had; and this extremely roused my application.
We had several spare yards, and two or three large
spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the
Biip; I resolved to sall to work with these, and Hung
as many of the.» overboard as I could manage for their
weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might
hot drive away. When this was done, I went down
the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of
them' sast together at both ends as well as I could, in
the form of a raft; and laying two or three short
pieces of plank upon them crofsways, I found I could
-walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear
any
any great weight, the pieces being too light. So \ went
to work, and with a carpenter's saw I cut a spare top-
mast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with
a great deal of labour and pains; but the hope of sur-
nishing myself with neceflaries, encouraged me to go be-
yond what I should have been able to have done upoa
another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any reason-
ableweight; my next care was what to load it with,
and how to preserve what I laid upon it from the surge
of the sea. But I was not long considering this; I first
laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get;
and having considered well what I most wanted, I first
got three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken
open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my
raft; the first of these I filled with provisions, viz.
bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried
goat's flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little
remainder of European corn, which had been laid by
for some fowls which we brought to sea with us, but
the fpwls were killed; there had been some barley and
wheat together; but, to my great disappointment, I
found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it
all. As for liquors, \ found several cases of bottles
belonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial
waters, and in all about five or six gallons of arrack;
these I stowed by themselves, there being no need to
put them into the chest, or any room for them. While
I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though
very calm; and I had the mortificction to lee my coat,
shirt, and waistcoat, which 1 had left on 'shore upon
the sand, swim away: as for my breeches, which were
only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on board in them
and my stockings. However, this put me upon rum-
maging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took
no more than I wanted for the present uso, for 1 had other
thing's which my eye was more upon ; as first, tools
to work with on shore; and it was after long search-
ing that I found out the carpenter's chest, which was
indeed a very usesul prize to me, and much more valu-
able than a snip laden with gold would have been at that
time. I got it down to my raft, even whole as it was,
without
without losing time to look into it, for I knew in gene-
ral what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and arms:
there were two very good fowling pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols; these I secured first, with some
powder horns, a small bag of shot, and two old rusty
swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in
the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed
them; but with much search I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken water; these two I
got to my raft, with the arms. And now I thought
myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I
should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar,
nor rudder; and the least capsull of wind would have
overset all my navigation. -
I had three encouragements: sirst, a smooth and calm
sea; second, the tide rising and setting in to the' shore;
third, what little wind there was blew me towards the
land. And thus, having found two or three broken oars
belonging.to the boat, and besides the tools which were
in'the chest, 1 found two saws, an axe, and a hammer;
and with this cargo 1 put to sea. Fora mile, or there-
abouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it drive
a little distant from the place where I had landed before;
by which I perceived that there was some indraught of
the water, and consequently I hoped to find some creek of
the river there, which 1 might make use of as a port to
get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before irtft
a little opening_of the land; I found a strong current of
'the tide sot into it, so I guided my raft as well as I
could to keep in the middle of the stream. But here I
had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if
I had, I think verily would have broken my heart; for,
knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at
one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at
the other end, it wanted but a little that all my' cargo
had ssipped ast'towards that end that was afloat, and ib
sallen into the water. I did my utmost by setting my
back against the chests to keep them in their places,
but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength;
neither durst I stir from the posture 1 was in, but holding
up
*ip the chests with all my might, stood in that manner
near half an hour; in which time the riling of the water
brought me a little more upon a level: and a little after,
the water still riling, my raft floated again, and I thrull
her offwith the oar I had into the channel; and then
driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth
of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong
current of tide running up. I looked on both fides for a
proper place to get to shore; for I was not willing to be
driven too high up the river, hoping in time to lee some
ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near
the coast as I could.'
At length 1 espied a little cove on the right shore of
the creek, to which, with great pain and disficulty, I
guided my raft; and at last got so near, as that, reach-
ing ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in.
But here I had like to have dipped all my cargo in the
sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep, that is to
say, sloping, there was no place to land, but where one
end of the float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and
the other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger
my cargo again. All that I could do was to wait till
the tide was at. the highest, keeping the raft with my
oar, like an anchor, to hold the side of it sast to the
shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the
water would flow over, and so it did. As soon as 1 found
water enough (for my raft drew about a foot of water),
I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there
sastened, or moored her, by sticking my two broken oars
into the ground; one on one side near one end, and one
on the other side near the other end - and thus I lay till
the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo
safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and seek a
proper place for my habitarion, and where to stow my
goods, to secure them from whatever might happen.
Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the conti-
nent, or on an island ; whether inhabited, or not inhabited;
whether in danger of wild beasts, or not. There was a
hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very steep
and high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills
which lay as in a ridge from it northward. I took out
one
48
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
one of the fowling pieces, and one of the pistols, and a
horn of of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for dis-
covery up to the top of that hill, where, after I had with
great labour and difficulty got up, I immediately saw my
sate, to my great affliction; viz. that^ was in an island
environed every way with the sea, no land to be seen ex-
cept some rocks, which lay a great way off, and two
small islands less than this, which lay about three leagues
to the weft.
I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as
I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild
foeasts, of which, however, I saw none; yet I saw abun-
dance of fowls, but knew not their kinds; neither when I
killed them, could I tell what was fit for food, and what
not. At my coming back, I shot at a great bird which
I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a large wood: I
believe it was'ihe first gun that had been fired there since
the creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, but
from all- the parts of the wood there arose an extraordi-
nary number of fowls of many sorts, making a consused
screaming and crying, every one according to his usual
note; but not one of them of any kind that I knew: as
for that creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a
-hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no
talons or claws more than common; its flesh was carrion,
and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft,
and sell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took
me up the rest of the day. What to do with myself at
night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest; for I was
afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some
-wild beast might devour me; though I afterwards found
there was really- no need for those sears.
However, as weW as J could I barricadoed myself round
with the chests and boards that I had brought on shore,
and made a kind of an hut for that night's lodging. As
for food, I yet saw not which way to supply myself, ex-
cept that I had seen two or three creatures like hares run
out of the wood where I mot the fowl.
1 now began to consider that I might yet get a great
many things out of the ship, which would be usesul
to me, and particularly some of the rigging and sads,
and
and such other things as might come to hand; and I re-
solved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if pos-
sible: and as I knew that the first storm that blew must
necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all
other things apart, till I got every thing out of the ship
that I could get. Then I called a council, that is to say,
in vny thoughts, whether I should take back the raft; but
this appeared impracticable; so I resolved to go as before
when the tide was down; and I did so, only that I
stripped before I went from my hut, having nothing on
but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, and a pair
of pumps on my seet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second
raft; and having had experience of the jirst, 1 neither
made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard; but yet I
brought away several things very usesul to me; as first,
in the carpenter's store I found two or three bags sull of
nails and spikes, a great screw jack, a dozen or two of
hatchets, and, above all, that most usesul thing called a
grindstone. All these 1 secured, together with several-
things belonging to the gunner, particularly two or three
iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, feven
muskets,, and another fowling piece, with some small
quantity of powder more, a large bag sull of small shot,
and a great roll of sheet of lead; but this3:ist was so heavy
I coukl not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that
I could find, and a. spare fore-top sail, hammock, and
some bedding; and with this I loaded my second raft,
and brought them also all sase on shoreT to my very great
comfort.
I was under some apprehensions, during my absence
from the land, that at least my provisions might be de-'
voured on short; but when I came back, I found no sign
of any visiter, only there sat a creature like a wild cat,
upon one of the chests, which, when 1 came towards it,
ran away to a little distance, and then stood stiil; she sat
-very composed and unconcerned, and looked sull in my
face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I
presented my gun at her, but she did not understand it.;
she was persectly unconcerned at it, 'nor did she ost'er to
stir away; upesn •which 1 tossed her a bit of-biscuit,
vol. I. O thougii
though, by the way, I was not very free of it, for my store
was not great. However, I spared her a bit, I say, and
ilie went to it, smelled of it, and eat it, and looked (as
pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could spareno
more, so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore (though I was
sain to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by
parcels, for they were too heavy, being large casks), I
went to work to make a little tent wi{h the sail and some
poles which I cut for that purpose; and into this tent 1
brought every thing that I knew would spoil either with
rain orsun: I piled all the empty chests and casks up in
a circle round the tent, to sortify it from any sudden
attempt, eitherfrom man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with some boards within, and an empty chest set up
an end without; and spreading one of the beds upon the
ground, laying rny two pistols just at my head, and my
gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and
slept very quietly all night: I was vety weary and heavy,
for the night before I had slept but little, and had laboured
very hard all day, as well to setch those things from the
ship,' as to get them on shore.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever
were laid up, 1 believe for one man. But 1 was not satis-
sied stiil; for while the ship sat upright in that posture,
I thought I ought to get every thing out of her that I
could. So every day at low water 1 went on board, and
brought away something or other: but particularly the
third time I went, I brought away as much of the rig-
ging as I could; as also all the small ropes and rope-
twine 1 could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which
was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrels of
wet gunpowder; in a word, I brought away all the
sails sirst and last, only that I was sain to cut thern in
pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could; for they
were no more usesul to me for sails, but as mere canvas
only.
But that which comforted me more still was, that at
last of all, after I had made five or six such voyages as
these, and thought I had nothing more to expect from
the ship that was worth meddling with; I say, after
all
all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large
rundlets of rum, or spirits, a box of fine sugar, and a
barrel of sine flour; this was surprising to me, be-
cause I had given over expecting any more provisions,
except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied
the hogstiead of that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by
parcel, in pieces of the sails which I cut out; and, in a
word, I got all this sase on shore also, though at several
times.
The next day I made another voyage; and now, hav-
ing plundered the ship of what was portable, and fit to
hand out, I began with the cables, and cutting the great
^cables into pieces, such as I could move, 1 got two cables
and an hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I could
get; and having cut down the spritsail yard and the
mizen-yard, and every thing I could to make a large raft,
I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came away:
but my good luck began to leave me; for this rait was
Ib unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was entered
the little cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods,
not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other,
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo . into the
water: as for myself, it was no great harm, fqr 1 was near
the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost,
-especially the iron, which 1 expected would have been of
great use to me. However, when the tide was out, I got
most of the pieces of cable alhore, and some of the'iron,
though with insinite labour, for I was sain to dip for. it
into the water, a work which satigued me very much.
After this, I went everyday on board, and biought away
what I could get.
I had been thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven
tithes on board the ship; in which time I had brought
away all that one pair of hands could well be supposed
capable to bring; though I believe verily, had the cahii
weather held, I should have brought away the whole
ship, piece by piece: but preparing' the twelfth time
to go on board, 1 found the wind began to rise. How-
ever, at low water 1 went on board; and though I
thought I had rummaged the cabin so essectually as that
nothing more could be found, yet: discovered a locker with
<lrawers in it, in one of which I found two or three
D 2 razors.
razors, and, one pain of large scissars, with ten or a
dozen good knives and forks, in another I found about
thirty-six pounds value in money, some European coin,
some Brasil, some pieces of eight, some gold, and some
ijlver. i"
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. Oh
drug! said I aloud, what art thou good for? Thou art
not worth to me, no, not the taking off the ground; one
of those knives is worth ajl this heap; I have no manner
of use for thee; e'en remain where thou art, and go to
the bottom, as a creature whole lise is not worth saving.
However, upon second thoughts, I took it away; and
wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to think
of making another raft; but while I was preparing this,
I found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and
in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the
shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in vain
to pretend to make a raft, with the wind otfshore; and
that it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore
at all; accordingly I let myself down into the water, and
swam across the channel which lay between the ship and
the sand, and even that with difficulty enough, partly
with the weight of the things I had about me, and
partly the roughness of the water, for the wind rose very
hastily, and before it was quite high water, it blew a
storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay,
with all my wealth about me, very secure. It blew very
hard all that night; and in the morning, when I looked
out, behold no more ship was to be seen. I was a
little surprised, but recovered myself with this satissac-
tory reslection, viz. that I had loft no tim«, nor abated
any diligence to get every thing out of her that could
be usesul to me; and that indeed there was little left'
in her that I was able to bring away, if I had yet
more time. I now gave over any more thought os
the ship, or of any thing out of her, except what might
drive on shore from her wreck; as indeed divers pieces' os
her afterwards did, but thole things were of small use to
me.
My
My thoughts were nowwholly employed about secur-
ing myself against either savages, if any should appear, or
wild beasts, if any were in the island; and I had many
thoughts of a method how to do this, and what kind of
dwelling to make, whether I should make me a cave in
the earth, or a tent upon the earth; and, in short, I re-
solved upon both, the manner and description of which^t
may not be improper to give an account of.
I soon found the place I watf in was not for my settle-
ment, particularly because it was upon a low moorish
ground near the sea, and I believed would not be whol-
some, and more particularly because there was no water
near -it; so I resolved to find a more healthy and more
convenient spot of ground.
I consulted several things in my situation which I found
would be proper for me; first, health, and fresh water, as
I just now mentioned; secondly, shelter from the heat of
the sun; thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, whe-
ther man or beast; fourthly a view to the sea, that if
God sent any ship in sight-, I might not lose any advan-
tage of my deliverance, for which I was not willing to
banish my expectation yet.'
In search of a place proper -for this, I found a little
plain on the fide of a rising hill, whose form towards
this little plain was as steep as an house side, so that
nothing could come down upon me from the top. Oil
the side of this rock there was an hollow place, worn a
little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave, but
there was not really any cave or way into the rock at
all.
On the' flat of the green, just before this hollow place,
I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above
a hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and
lay like a green before the door, and at the end of it de-
scended irregularly every way down into the low grounds
by the sea-side. It was on the N. N. W. side of the hill,
so that it was sheltered from the heat every day, till it
came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which in
those countries is near the setting'.
Before 1 set up my tent, I drew an half circle before
the hollow places which took in about ten yards in its
D 3 semi-diameter
semi-diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its dia-
meter, from its beginning and ending.
1n this half circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes,
driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like
piles, the biggest end being out of the ground above five
feet and an half, and sharpened on the top; the two rows
did not stand above six inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in
the ship, and laid them in sows upon one another with-
in the circle, between those two rows of stakes, up tothe
top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning against
them, about two seet and a half high, like a'lpur to a
post; and this sence was so strong, that neither man nor
beast could get into it, or over it. This cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the
wood, bring them to the place, and drive them into the
earth..
The entrance into this place I made to be, not by, a
door, but by a short ladder to go over the top; which
ladder, when I was in, I listed over after me: and so
I was completely senced in and fortisied, as I thought,
from all the world, and consequently slept secure in the
night, which otherwise I could not have done; though,
as. it appeared afterwards, there was no need of all this
caution from the enemies I had apprehended danger
from.
Into this sence, or fortress, with infinite labour 1 car-
ried all rriy riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and.
stores, of which you have the account above: and I made
me a large tent also, to preserve me from the rains, that
in one part of the year are very violent there; I made it
double, viz. one smaller tent within, and one larger tent
above it; and covered the uppermost .part of it with a
large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which
I had brought on more, but in an hammock, which was
indeed a very good one, and belonged to the mate of the
ship. _ m
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every
thing that would spoil by the wet; and having thus in-
closed all my goods, I made up the entrance, which till
now
now I had left open, and so passed and repassed,asl said,
. by a short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way into
the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that 1 dug
down out through my tent, I laid them up within my
sence in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the
ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made
a cave just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar
to my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before all
these things were brought to persection; and therefore I
must go back to, some other things Which took up some
of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, after 1
had laid my scheme for setting up the tent, and making
the cave, that a storm of rain salling from a thick dark
cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and aster
that, a great clap ol^fhunder, as is naturally the effect
of it. I was not so .much surprised with the lightning,
as.I was with the thought which darted into my mind as
swift as the lightning itself.—Oh my powder! My very
heart sunk within me, when I thought that at one blast
all my powder might be destroj'ed, on which, not my de-
sence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, en-
tirely depended; I was nothing near so anxious about my
own clanger, though, had the powder took fire, I had
never known who had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that after
the storm was over, I laid aside all my work, my build-
ing, and fortifying, and applied myself to make bags
and boxes to separate my powder, and to kvep it a little
and a little in a parcel, in hopes that, whatever might
come, it might not alrtake sire at once, and to keep so
apart, that it soould not be possible to make one part fire
another. I finished this work in about a fortnight; and
1 think my powder, which in all was.about one hundred
and forty pounds weight, was divided into less than an
hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I
did not apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it in
my new cave, which in my sancy I called my kitchen';''
and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the rocks,
so that no wet might come to it, marking very caresully
-where I laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I went
out at least once every day with my gun, as well to di-
vert myself, as to see if I could kill any thing fit for
food, and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself with
what the island produced. _ The first time I went out, I
presently discovered that there were goats in the island,
which was a great satissaction to me; but then it was
attended with this misfortune to me, viz. that they
were so shy, so subtle, and so swift a foot, that it was
the most difficult thing in the world to come at them;
but I was not discourage:! at this, not doubting but I
might now and then shoot one, as it soon happened; for
after I had sound their haunts a little, I laid wait in this
manner for them:—1 observed, if they saw me in the
valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would
run away as in a terrible fright; but if they were seed-
ing in the valleys, and I was' upon the rocks, they took
no notice of me: from whence I concluded, that by the
position of their optics, their sight was so directed down-
ward, that they did not readily see objects that were
above them. So afterwards I took this method; I al-
ways climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and
then had frequently a sair mark. The first shot I made
among these creatures, 1 killed a she goat which had a
little kid by her which she gave suck to, which grieved
me heartily; but when the old one sell, the kid stood
stock still by her till I came and took her up; and not
only so, but when I carried the old one with me upon
my moulders the kid followed me quite to my inclo-
sure; upon which 1 laid.down the dam, and took the
kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes
to have bred it up tame, but it would not eat-, so I was
forced to kilt it, and eat it myself. These two supplied
me with flesh a great while, for I eat sparingly, and saved
my provisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly I
could.
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it abso-
lutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and
suel to burn; and what I did for that, as also how I
enlarged my cave, and what conveniencies I made, I
shall give a sull account of in its place; but I must first
give some little account of myself, and of my thoughts
, about
abaut living, which it may be well supposed were not a
sow.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was
not cast away upon that island, without being driven, as:
is said, by a violent storm, quite out of the course of our
intended voyage, and a gr^at way, viz. some hundreds of
leagues out of the ordinary course of the trade of man-
kind, I had great reason to consider it as a determination
of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate
manner, I mould end my lise. The tears would run plen-
tisully down my sace when I made these reflections; and
sometimes I would expostulate with myself, why Provi-
dence mould thus completely ruin its creatures, and ren-
der them so absolutely miserable, so without help aban-
doned, and so entirely depressed, that it could hardly bfr
rational to be thankful for i'uth a lise.
But something always returned swift upon me to check
these thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly one
day, walking, with my gun in my-hand, by the sea side^
I was very pensive upon the subject of my present condi-
tion, when reason, as it were, put in, expostulating with
me t'other way, thus:—Well, you are in a desolate
condition *tis true; but pray remember where are the rest
of you? Bid not there come eleven of you into the .boat?
Where are the ten? Why were nut they saved, and you
lost? W hy are you singled out? Is it better to be here or
there? And then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be
considered with the good that is in them, and with whit
worse attended them.
Then it occurred to me again how well I was surnithed
for my subsistence, and what would have been my case
if it had not happened, which was an hundred thousand
to one that the ship floated from the place where first the
struck, and was driven so near to the shore, that I had
time to get all these things out of her! What would
have been my case, if I had been to have lived in the
condition in which I first came on shore, wuhout ne-
cessaries of lise, or any means to supply and procure
them? Particularly said I aloud, though to myself, what
would I have done without a gun, without ammunition,
without any tools to make any thing, or to work with }
» 5 • Without
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner of co-
vering? And that now I had all-these to a susficient quan-
tity, and was in a sair way to provide myself in such a
manner, as to live without my gun when my ammuni-
tion was spent; Ib that 1 had a tolerable view of subsisting
without any want as long as I lived; for I considered,
from the Beginning, how I should provide for the acci-
dents that might happen, and far the time that was to
come, even not only after my ammunition should be spent,
but also after my health or strength should decay.
I consess I had not then entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my
powder being blown up by lightning; and this made the
thoughts of it surprizing to me, when it lightened and
thundered, as I observed just now.
And now, being to enter into a melancholy relation of
a scene of silent lise, such perhaps as was never heard of
in the world before; I shall take it from its beginning,
and continue it in its order. It was, by my accounts the
SOth of September, when, in the manner as above saidr
I first set foot upon this horrid island, when the sun being
to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over
my head; for 1 reckoned myself, by observation, to be
in the lotitude of 9 degrees and 22 minutes south os' the
line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came
into my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time
for want of books, and pen, a*ul ink, and should even
forget the sabbath days from the working days: but to
prevent this, 1 cut it with my knise upon a large post in
capital letters, and making it into a great cross, I set it
up on the shore where I first landed, viz. I came on shore
here, the 30fh of September, 1659. Upon the sides of
this square post 1 cut every day a notch with my knise,
and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and
every first day of the month as long again as that long
one; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly,
and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place we are to observe, that among the
many things that I brought from the ship in the seve-
ral voyages which, as above mentioned, 1 made to it, I
got
got several things of less value, but not at all less usesul
to me, which 1 omitted setting down before; as in par-
ticular pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the cap-
tain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, three
or four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials,
perspectives, charts, and books of navigation, all which
1 huddled together, whether I might want them or not.
I also found three very good bibles, which came to me
in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up
among my things; some Portuguese books also, and
among them two or three popish prayer-books, and seve-
ral other books, all which 1 caresully secured. And I
must not forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two
cats, of whole eminent history I must have occasion to say
something in its place; for I carried both the cats with
me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of
himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on
shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me
many years. I wanted nothing that he could setch me,
nor any company that he could make up to me; I only
wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could not do.
As 1 observed before, I found pens, ink, and paper, and
I husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall thew that,.
while my ink lasted, 1 kept things very exact, but after
that was gone, I could not; for I could not makeany
ink by any mi ans that 1 could get.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things,
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and of
these, this of ink is one; as also a spade, pick-axe, and
shovel, to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins, and
thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without
much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily; and it was near a whole year before 1 had en-
tirely sinished my little pale, or surrounded habitation.
The piles, or stakes, which were as heavyias I could
well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in
the woods, and more by sar in bringing home; so that
I spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home
one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the
ground; for which purpose 1 got a heavy piece of
wood at-first, but at last bethought myself of one of the
xi 6 iron
iron crows; which, however, though I found, it yet
made driving those posts, or piles, very laborious and
tedious work.
But what need I to have been concerned at the tedious-
ness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough
to do it in? Nor had I any other employment, if that had
been over, at least that I could foresee, except the rang-
ing the island to seek for food, which I did more or less
every day.
I now began seriously to consider my condition, and
the circumstances I was reduced to, and I drew up the
state of my affairs in writing; not so much to leave them
to any that were to come after me, for I was like to have
but sew heirs, as to deliver my thoughts from daily por-
ing upon them, and afflicting my mind. And as my
reason began now to master my despondency, I began to
comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the good
against the evil, that I might have something to distin-
guish my case from worse ; and I stated it very impartially,
like debtor and creditor, the comfort I enjoyed agai»ll
the miseries I suffered, thus :—

to, or relieve me. the ship in near enough the
shore, that I have gotten out
so many necessary things as
will either supply my wants,
• or enable me to supply my-
self, even as long as I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony,
that there was scarce any condition in the world so mi-
serable, but there was something negative, orsomething
• positive, to be thanksul in it; and let this stand as a,
direction from the experience of the most miserable of all
conditions in this world, that we may always find in it
something to comfort ourselves from, and to set in the
description of good and evil, on the credit side of the
account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my con-
dition, and giving over looking out to sea, to see if I could
spy a ship; 1 say, giving over these things, I began to
apply myself to accommodate my way of living, and to
make things as easy as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which was a
tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong
pale of posts and cables, but I might now rather call it
a wall; for I raised a kind of wall up against it of turss,
about two seet thick onlhe outside; and after some time,
I think it was a year and a half, I raised rafters' from
it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it with
boughs of trees, and such things as I could get to keep
out the rain, which I found at some times of the year very
violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my goods
into this pale, and into the cave which I had made be-
hind me. But I must observe too, that at lirst this was
3. a consused
a consused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order,
so they took up all my place; I had no room to run*
myself; so I set. myself to enlarge my cave, and worked
sarther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock,
which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it. And
so, when I found I was prestv sase as to beasts of prey,
I worked sideways to the right-hand into the rock, and
thenturning to the right-hand again, worked quite out,
and made my door^to come out on the outside of my pal*
or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a
back way to my tent, and to my store-house, but gave
me room to stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such neces-
sary things at I found I most wanted, particularly a chair
and a table; for without these I was not able to enjoy
the sew comforts I had in the world ; I could not write,
or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure, with-
out a table.
So I went to work: and here I must needs observe,
that as reason is the substance and origin of the mathe^
matics, so, by stating and squaring every thing by rea-
son; and by making the most rational judgment of
things, every man may be, in time, master of every me-
chanic art. I had never handled a tool in my lise, and
yet in time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I
found at last that I wanted nothing but 1 could have
made it, especially if 1 had had tools; However, 1 made
abundance of things even without tools, and some with
ho more toolsthan an adze and an hatchet, which per-
haps were never made that way before, and that with
infinite labour. For example^ if I wanted a board, I had
no other way but to cut down a tree, let it on an edge
before me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, tili
I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub
it smooth with my adze. It istrue, by this method I
could make but one board out-of a whole tree; but this
I had no remedy for but patience, any more than 1 had
for the prodigious deal of time and labour which it took
-me up to make a plank or board. But my time or labour
was little worth, and so it was as well employed one way
as another.
< However,
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
abvve, in the sirst place, and this I did out of the short
pieces of boards thatl brought on my raft from the ship.
But when I had wrought out some boards as above, I
made large shelves of the breadth of a foot and an half,
one over another, all along on one fide of my cave, to
lay all my tools, nails, and iron work; and, in a word,
to separate every thing at large in their places, that I might
easily come at them: I also knocked pieces into the wall
of the rock, to hang my guns, and all things that would
hang up.
So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a
general magazine of all necessary things; and I had every
thing so ready at hand, that it was a great pleasure to me
to see all riiy goods in such order, and especially to find
my stock of all necessaries so great.
And now it was when I began to keep a journal of
every day's employment; for indeed at first I was in too
much hurry, and not only an hurry as to labour, but in
too much discomposure of mind, and my journal would
have been sull of many dull things. For example, I
must have said thus: Sept. the 30th, after I got to shore,
and had escaped drowning., instead of being thanksul to
God for my deliverance, having first vomited with a great
quantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomach,
and recovering myself a little, 1 ran about the shore,
wringing my hands, and beating my head and sace, exr
claiming at my misery, and crying out I was undone,
undone! till tired and saint, I was forced to lie down on
the ground for repose, but durst not sleep for sear of being
devoured.
Some days after this, and after I had been on board the
ship, and had got all I could out of her, yet I could not
forbear getting up to the top of a little mountain, and
looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship; then sancy
at a vast distance I espied a sail, please myself with the
hopes of it, and then, after looking steadily till I was
almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a
child and thus increase my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things in some mea-
sure, and having settled my household stusf and habita-
tion, made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome
about
about me as I could, I began, I say,. to keep my journal,
of which I shall here here give you the copy, though in it
will be told all these particulars over again, as long as it
lasted; for at last, having no more ink, I was forced to
leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
SEPTEMBER 30, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson
Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a dreadsul storm in
the offing, came on shore on this dismal and unfortunate
island, which I call the island of Despair, all the rest of
the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost;
dead.
All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither
food, house, clothes, weapon, or place to fly to; and, in
despair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me,
either that I should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered
by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the
approach of night, I slept in a tree, for sear of wild crea-
tures but slept soundly, though it rained aH night.
• October 1. In the morning 1 saw, to my great surprise,
the ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven oh
ffiore again much nearer the island; which, as it was
some comfort, on one hand, for seeing her lit up-right,
and not broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I
might get on board, and get some food and necessaries
out of her for my relief; so, on the other hand, it renewed
my grief, at the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined,
if we had all staid on board, might have saved the ship,
or at least that they would not have been all drowned as
they were; and that, had the men been saved, we might,
perhaps, have built us a boat out of the ruins oftheship,
to have carried us to some other part of the world. I
spent great part of this day in perplexing myself on these
things: but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went
on the sand as near as I could, and then swam. on board.
This
This day also continued raining, though with no wind at
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these days
entirely spent in making several voyages to get all I could
out o/ the ship, which I brought on shore every tide of
flood upon rafts. Much rain also on these days, though
with some intervals of sair weather. But it seems this
was the rainy season.
Oct. 24. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had
got-upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things
being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the
tide was out.
Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some
~ gusts of wind, during which time the ship broke in pieces,
the wind blowing a little harder than before} and was no-
more to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that only
, at low water. I spent this day in covering and securing
the goods which.I had saved, that the rain might not spoil
them.
Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day to
find out a place to six my habitation, greatly concerned
to secure myself from any attack in the night, either from.
wild beasts or men. Towards night I fixed upon a proper
place under a rock, and marked out a semi-circle for my
encampment, which I resolved to strengthen with a work,
wall, or fortification, made of double piles, lined within
-with cable, and without with turs.
From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in cart
rying all my goods to my new habitation, though some
part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The- 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island
with my gun, to fee for some food, and discover the coun-
try, when I killed a she goat, and her kid followed me
home, which I afterwards killed also, because it would
not seed.
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the sirst night, making it as large as I could,
with stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon.
Nov. 5. I set up all my chests and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my raft, and with them
sormed a sence round me, a little within the place I had
marked out for my fortification,
Nov,
Nov. 3. I went outwith my gun, and killed two fowls
like ducks, which' were very good food. In the afternoon
went to work to make me a table.
Nov. 4. This morning 1 began to order my times of-
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and
time of diversion; viz. every morning I walked out
with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain;
then employed myself at work till about eleven o'clock;
then cat what I had to live on; and from twelve to two
I lay down to sleep, the weather being exceffive hot,
and then in the evening to work again. The working
part of this day and the next were wholly employed in
making this table, for I was but yet a very sorry work-
man, though time and necessity made me a complete na-
tural mechanic soon after, as 1 believe it- would do any
one else.
Nov. 5. This dayT went abroad with my gun and
dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft, but her
flesh good for nothing: every creature I killed I took oft
the skins, and preserved them. Coming back by the sea
shore, 1 saw many sorts of sea fowls'which I did not un-
derstand; but was surprised, and almost affrighted with
two or three seals, which while I was gazing at, not well
knowing what they were, got into the sea, and escaped'
me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my morning walk, 1 went to work with
my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking;
nor was it long before I learned to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled sair weather. The
7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th
was Sunday, according to my reckoning), I took wholly
up to make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to'
a tolerable shape, but never to please me j and even in
the making I pulled it to pieces several times.—Note, I
soon neglected keeping Sundays; for omitting my mark
for them on my post, 1 forgot which was which.
Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me ex-
ceedingly, and cooled the earth; but it was accompanied
with terrible thunder and lightning, which frightened me
dreadsully for sear of my powder. As soon as it was over,
I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as many
little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.
Nov.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making
little square chests or boxes, which might hold about :i
pound, or two pounds at most, of powder; and so put-
ting the powder in, 1 stowed it in places as secure and
remote from one another as possible. On one of these
three days 1 killed a large bird that was good to eat, but
1 knew not what to call it.
Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent
into the rock, to make room for my sarther conve-
niency.—Note» three things I wanted exceedingly for this
work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, and, a wheel-barrow,
or basket; so I deiisted from my work, and began to
consider how to supply that want, and make me. some
tools. As for the pick-axe, I made use of the iron
crows, which were proper enough, though heavy; but
the next thing was a shovel, or spade; this was so ab-
solutely necessary, that indeed I could do nothing efsec-
tually without it; but what kind of one to make 1 knew
not.
Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the Bralils
they call the iron tree, for its exceeding hardness ; of this,
with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a
piece, and brought it home with difsiculty enough, for it
was exceeding heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no
other way, made me a long while upon this machine; for
I worked it effectually, by little and little, into the form
of a shovel, or spade, the handle exactly shaped like ours
in Llngland, only that the broad part having no iron shod
upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long; how-
ever, it served well enough for the uses which I had occa-
sion to pot it to but never was a shovel, I believe, made
after that sashion, or so long a making.
I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or wheel-
barrow; a basket I could not make by any means, hav-
ing no such things as twigs that would bend to make
wicker-ware, at least none yet found out: and as to the
whcel-barrow, I sancied I could make all but the wheel,
but that I had no notion of, neither did 1 know how to
go about it: besides, I had no possible way to make iron
gudgeons for the spindle, or axis, of the wheel to run in;
so I gave it over: and so, for carrying away the eartll
•which I dug out of the cave, \ made me a thing like a
hod, which the labourers carry mortar inwhen they serve
the bricklayers.
This was not so disficult to me as the making of the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and ti:<- attempt
which I made in vain to make a wheel-barrow, took me
up. no less than four days; I mean always, excepting my
morning's walk with my gun, which I seldom sailed;
and very seldom sailed also of bringing home something
fit to eat.
Nov. 23. My other work having stood still, because
of my making these tools'; when they were sinished, I
went on, and working every day ns my strength and time
allowed, I spent-eighteen days entirely in widening and
deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods com-
modiously.
Note.—During all this time I worked to make this
room, or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a
warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and
a cellar; as for a lodging, I kept to the tent, except that
sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained so
hard, that I could not keep myself dry; which caused
me afterwards to cover all my place within my pale with
long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock,
and load them with flags, and large leaves of trees, like
thatch.
Dec. 10. I began now to think my cave, or vault,
finished, whenon a sudden (it seems I had made it too
large) a great quantity of earth sell down from the top
and one fide, so much, that in short it frightened me, and
not without reason to; for if I had' been under it, I had
never wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster 1 had a
great deal of work to do over again; for I had the loose
earth to carry out, and, which was of more importance>
I had the cieling to prop up, so that I might be sure no
more would come down. ''
Dec. 11. This day 1 went to work with it accordingly,
and got two shoars, or posts, pitched upright to the top,
with two pieces of board across over each post; this I
finished the next day; and setting up more posts with-
boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured,
and
and the posts standing in rows, served me for partitions
topart of the house.
Dec. 17. From this day to the 20th, I placed shelves,
and knocked up noils in the' posts, to hang every thing
on that could be hung up: and now I began to be in
some order within doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave, and
began to surnish my house, and set up some pieces of board
like a dresser, to order my victuals upon; but board began
to be very scarce with me: I also made me another table.
Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no stirring out.
Dec. 25. ~Ram all day.
Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler than
before, and pleasanter.'
'Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so
that I catched, and led it home in a string: when I had
it home, I bound and splintered up its leg which was
broke'. —N. B. I took such care of it that it lived, and
the leg grew well, and as strong as ever: but by nursing
it so long it grew tame, and sed upon the green at my
door, and would not go away. This was the first time
that I entertained ?. thought of breeding up some tame
creatures, that 1 might have food when my powder and
shot was all spent.
Dec. 28, 23, 30. Great heats, arid no breeze; so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for
sood. This time 1 spent in putting all my things in order
within doors.
January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early and
late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day.
This evening, going surther into the valleys, which lay
towards the center of the island, I found there was plenty
of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to come at:
however, 1 resolved to try if 1 could not bring my dog to
hunt them down.
Jan. 2, Accordingly the next day I went out with
my <h)g, and set him at the goats; but I was mistaken,
for they all saced about upon the dog, and he knew his
danger too well, for he would not go near them.
Jan. 3. I began my sence, or wall, which, being still
jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to
make very thick and strong.
N. B. This
N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely
omit what was said in the Journal; it is sufficient
to observe, that 1 was no less time than from the
3d of January to the 14th of April, working, sinish-
ing, and persecting this wall, though it was no more
than about twenty-four yards in length, being an half
circle, from one place in the rock to another place
about eight yards from it, the door of the cave being
in the center behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering
xat many days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I
thought I should never be persectly secure till this wall
was finished; and it is scarcely credible what inexpres-
sible labour every thing was done with, especially the
bringing piles out of the wood, and driving them into the
ground, for 1 made them much bigger than 1 needed to
have done. ,
When this wall was finished, and the outside double-
senced with a turs wall raised up close to it, I persuaded
myself, that if any people were to come on shore there,
they would not perceive any thing like an habitation:
and it is very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter,
upon a very remarkable occasion.
During this time, 1 made rounds in the woods for game.
every day, when the rain permitted me, and made fre-
quent dilcoveries in those walks of something or other to
my advantage; particular!)', I found a kind of wild
pigeons, which build not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but
rather as house-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks; and
taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them up
tame, and did so; but when they grew older, tfuy all
flew away, whfch perhaps was at first for want of seed-
ing. them, for 1 had nothing to give them. . However, I
frequently found their nests, and got their young ones,
which, was very good" meat.
'And now, in the managing my household affairs; I
found myscif wanting in many things, which I thought
at sirst it was impossible for me to make, as indeed as to
some of them it was: for instance, 1 could never make a
cask to be hooped; I had a small rh-ndlet or :wo, as 1 ob-
served before, but I could never arrive to the capacity of
making one by them, though 1 spent many weeks about
it:
I could neither put in the heads, nor join the staves so
true to one another as to make them hold water; so I
gave that also over.
In the next place I was at a great loss for candles;
so that as soon as it was dark, which was generally by
seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remem-
bered the lump of bees-wax with which I made candles
in my African adventure; but I had none of that now:
the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a
goat, I saved the tallow, and with a little dim made
of clay, which I baked in the sun, to. which I added a
wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this
gave me light, though not fi clear steady light like a
candle. • In the middle of all my labours it happened,
that rummaging my things, I found a little bag, which,
as I hinted before, had been silled with corn for the seed-
ing of poultry, not for this voyage, but before, as I sup-
pose, when the ship came from Lisbon; what little re-
mainder of corn had been in the bag was all devoured by
the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust;
and being willing to have the bag for some other use (I
think it was to put powder in, when I divided it for sear
of th.e lightning, or some such use), I shook the husks
of corn nut of it on one side of my fortification under the
rock.
it was a little before the great rains, just now men-
tioned,. that I threw this stufs away, taking no notice of
any thing, and not so much as remembering that I had
thrown any thing there; when about a month after, or
thereabouts, I law some sew stalks of something green
shooting upon the ground, which I sancied might be
some plant 1 had not seen; but I was surprised,,and per-
sectly astonished, when aster a little longer time, I saw
about ten or twelve ears come out, which were persect
green barley, of the same kind as our European, nay, as
our English barley.
It is impossible to express the aston'lhment and con-
fusion of my thoughts on this occalion; I had hitherto
acted upon no religious foundation at all; indeed. I
had very sew notions of religion in my held, nor
had entertained any lense of any thing that had besallen
me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as we lightly fay,
what
what pleases God, without so much as enquiring into the
end of Providence in these things, or his order in govern-
ing events in the world. But after I saw barley grow
there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,
and especially as I knew not how it came there, it startled
me strangely; and 1 began to suggest, that God had mi-
raculously caused this grain to grow without any help of
seed sown, and that it was so-directed, purely for my
sustenance in that wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out
of my eyes, and I began to bless myself, that such a pro-
digy of nature should happen on my account; and this
was the more strange to me, because I saw near it still,
all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling
stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which I
knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa when I was
ashore there. /
I not only thought these the pure productions of Pro-
vidence for my support, but not doubting but that there.
was more in the place, I went all over that part of the
island where I had been before, peeping into every cor-
ner, and under every rock, to see for more of it, but I
could not find any. At last it occured to my thoughts
that I had shaken the bag of chicken's meat out in that
place, arid the wonder began to cease; and I must con-
sess my religious thanksulness to God's providence began
to abate upon discovering that all this was nothing but
what was common; though 1 ought to have been as
thanksul for so strange and unforeseen a Providence as if
it had bee$ miraculous; for it was really the work of
Providence as to me, that should order to appoint, that
ten or twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled,
when the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it bad been
dropped from heaven: as also, that I should throw it out
into that particular place, where, it being in the shade of
an high rock, sprang up immediately: whereas, if 1 had
thrown it any where elte at that time, it had been burnt
up and destroyed. . .
I caresully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure,
in their season, which was about the end of June; and
laying up every grain, 1 resolved to sow them all again,
hoping in time to have some quantity, sufficient to supply
me
me with bread; but it was not till the fourth year that I
would allow myself the least grain of this corn-to eat, and
even then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its
order; for I loft all I lowed the first season, by not ob-
serving the proper time; for. I sowed it just before the drv
season, so that it never came up at all, at least njit as it
would have done; of which in its place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or
thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care,
and - whose use was of the same kind, or to the same
purpose, viz. to make me bread, or rather food;
for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though
1 did that also after some time. But to return to my
journal. - .
I worked excessive hard these three or four months, to
get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up,
contriving to go into it, not by a door, but over a wall by
a ladder, that there mi<>ht be no sum on the outside' of mv
.... a - o j
habitation.
April lsi. I finished the ladder; so I went up with it
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it
down on the inside. This was a complete inclosure to
me; for within I had room enough, and nothing could
come at me from without, unless it could first mount my
wall. .
The very next day after this wall was finished, I had
almost had all my labour overthrown at once, and mv-
1'elf killed; the cause was thus: as I was busy in the
inside- of it, behind my tent, just in the entrance into
ray cave, I was^terribly frightened with a molt dreadsul
.surprising thing indeed; for all on a sudden I found the
earth came tumbling down from the roof of my cave,
and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two
of the polls I had set up in the cave cracked in a fright-
ful manner. I was heartily scared, but thought nothing
of what really was the cause; only thinking that the top
of my cave was salling in, as some of it had done before;
and for sear I should be buried in it, I ran forwards to
my ladder, and not thinking myself sase there neither,
I got over my wall' for sear of the pieces of the hill,
-which I expected might roll down upon me. I was no
sooner stepped down upon the sirm ground, but I plainly
vol. i. e law
saw it was a terrible earthquake; for the ground I stood
-on shook three times, at about eight minutes distance,
-with three such shocks as would have overturned the
strongest buildings that could be supposed to have? stood
upon the earth; and a great piece os the top os lhe rock,
-which stood at about half a mile from me, next the sea,
sell down with such a terrible noise as I never heard in all
my lise. I perceived also the very sea was put into a
violent motion by it; and I believed the shocks were
stronger under the water than on the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never selt
the like, or discoursed with any one that had, that'I was
like one dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth
made my stomach tick, like one that is tossed at sea: but
the noise of the salling of the rock awaked me, as it were,
and rousing mefrom theshipified condition I was in, filled
me with horror, and I thought of nothing then but the
liil| salling upon my tent, and all my household goods,
and burying all at once; and this sunk my veiy foul
-within me p. second time.
After the third thock was over, and ! selt no.more for
some time, I began to take courage; and yet 1 bad not
heart enough to get over my wall again, for sear of being
Buried alive; but still sat on the ground, greatly cast
<lown, and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All
this while I had not the least serious religious thought,
nothing but the common, Lord, having have mercyjfpon
me! and when it was over, that went away too. V-
While I sat thus, 1 found the air over-cast, and it grew
cloudy, as if it would rain; and inlets than half an hour
it blew a moil dreadsul hurricane of wind. The sea all
on a sudden was covered with foam and froth, the shore
was covered with the breach of the water, the trees were
torn up by the roots, and a terrible storm it was; and
this held about three hours, and then began to abate;
and then in two hours more it was calm, and began to
rain vqry hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground very much terri-
sied and dejected, when on a sudden it came into my
thoughts that these winds and rain being the conseepjence
pf the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and
over, and I might venture into my cave again. With
\ . this
-this thought my spirits began to revive, and the rain
helping-also to persuade me, I went in, and sat me down
in my tent; but the rain was so violent, that my tent was'
ready to be beaten down with it, and I was forced to go
into my cave, though ver)' much afraid and uneasy tot
sear it should sall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to rfut
a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the
water out, which would else have drowned my cave.
After I had been in my cave some time, and found still net
more shock of the earthquake follow, 1 began to be more
composed. And now, to compose my spirits, which
indeed wanted it very much, I wens to my little store,
and took a small sup of rum, which howeYerl did then,
and alway* very sparingly, knowing 1 could have no
more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great part of
the next day, so that I could not stir abroad • but my
mind being more composed, I began to think os what I
had best to do: concluding, that if the island was sub*
ject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for
me in a cave, but I must think of building me some
little hut in an open place, which I might surround with
a wall, as I had done here, and so make myself secure
from ^wild beasts or men; but concluded if I (laid where
I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried
alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to move my tent
from the place where it stood, which was just under the
hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it should be
stiaken again, would certainly soil upon my tent: and
1 spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of
April, in contriving where and how to remove my habi-
tation.
The sear of being swallowed up alive affected me so,
that I never slept in quiet'J and yet the apprehensions of
Lying abroad, without any sence, were almost equal to
it. But still, when I looked about and law how everv
thing was put in order, how persectly concealed I
was, and how sase from danger, it made me loth to
remove.
e 2 In
In the mean time it occurred to me, that it wou]d re-
quire a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must
be contented to run the venture where 1 was, till 1 had
formed a camp for myself, and had secured it so as to re-
move to it. So with this resolution 1 composed myself
for a time; and resolved that I would go to work with all
speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in a
circle, as before, and set my tent up in it when it was
finished ; but that 1 would venture to stay where I was till
it was finished and fit to remove to.—This was the 21st.
'April 22. The next morning I began to consider of
means to put this resolve in execution; but I was at a
great loss about my tools: I had three 1arge axes, qnd
abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets 'sot
traffic with the Indians) but with much chopping and
cutting knotty hard wood, they were all sull of notches,
and dull; and though I had a grindstone, I could not turn
it and grind'my tools too. This cost me as much thought
as a statesman would have bestowed on a grand point -
of politics, or a judge upon the lise and death of a cri-
minal. At length I contrived a wheel, with a string to
turn-it with my foot, that I might have both my hands
at liberty. - Note, I had not seen any such thing in Eng-
land, or at least not to tajee notice how it was done;
though since I have observe'cl it was very common there:
besides that, my grindstone was very large and heavy.
This machine cost me a sull week's work to bring it to
persection.
April 23, 21. These two whole days I took up in
grinding my tools ;. my machine for turning my grind-
itone persorming very well.
April 30. Waving perceived my bread had been low
a great while, I now took a survey of it, and reduced
myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made my heart
very heavy.
May 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea-lide,
the title being low, I saw something lie on the snore
bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a cask: when I
came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or three
pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on
shore by the late hurricane: and looking towards the
wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the
5 water
77 .
water than it used to do. I examined the barrel which
was driven onshore, and soon-found it to be a barrel ot
gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the powder
was caked as hard as a stone. However, I rolled it sar-
ther on the shore for the present, and went on upon the
sands as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look
for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely
removed; the fore-castle, which lay before buried in
sand, was heaved up at least six feet; and'the stem, which
was broken to pieces, and parted from the it t by the
force of the sea, soon aster I had left rummaging her,
was tossed as it were up, and cast on one tide and the
sand was thrown so high on that side next lhe stern, that
whereas there was a great place of water before, so that
I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck
without swimming, I could now walk quite up to her
when the tide was out. I was surprised at this at first,
but soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake;
and as by this violence the shi* was more broke open
than formerly, so many things came daily oh shore which
the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water
rolled by degrees to land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the deiign of
removing my habitation; and I busied myself mightily,
that day especially, in searching whether I could make
any way into the ship; but I found nothing was to be
expected of the kind, foj- that all the inside'oj: the s'lip was
chcmkert up with. sand. LL,,v~.-er, as I had learned not.
to despair of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing to
pieces that I could of the snip, concluding that every
thing I could get from her would be of some use or other
to me.
May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a
beam through, which I thought held some of the upper
part, or quarter deck together; and when I had cut it
through, I cleared away the sand as well as 1 could from
the side whieli lay highest: but the tide coming in, 1 was
obliged to give it over for that time.
May 4 1 went a fishing, but caught but one fish that
I durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when just
going to leave off, I caught . a young dolphin.' I had
£ 3 made
made me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no
^iooks, yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I
cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun, and eat them
dry. . i
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam asun-
der, and brought three great sir planks offfrom the decks,
which I tied together, and made swim on shore when the
tide of flood came on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts
out of her, and other pieces of iron-work; worked very
hard, and came home very much tired, and had thoughts
of wiving ft over.
May ,'. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent
not to work; but found the weight of the wreck had
broken itself dawn', the beams being cut, that several
ju 'ces of the ship seemed to.lie loose, and the inside of the
hold lay so open, that I could see into it, but almost sull
os water and sand.
May '8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow
to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the
water or.sand. I wrenched open two planks, and brought
them on snore also with the tide.' I lest the iron crow in
the wreck for the next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made
way into the body of the wreck, and selt several casks,
and loosened them with the crow, but could not break
them up; I selt also a roll of English lead, and could stir
~it, T7oi-4i4yi!S t0° heavy to remove.'
May 10, 11, ^-Went every day to the wr*ek,
and got a great deal of pieces of timber and boards, or
planks, and two or three hundredweight of iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not
cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one
hatchet, and dri-ving it with the other; but as it lay about
a foot and a half in the water, I could not make any blow
to drive the hatchet.
May 16. It had blowed hard in the,night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the force of the water;
but 1 staid so long in the woods to get pigeons for food,
that the tide prevented me going to the wreck that day.
May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on
shore at a great distance, two miles osf me, but resolved
to
to see what they were, and found a piece of the head, but
too heavy for me to bring away.
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on the
wreck; and with much labour I loosened some things so
much with the crow, that the first flowing tide several
calks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests. Hut the
wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that
day hut pieces of timber, and an hogshead' which had
some Bralil pork in it, but the salt water and the land had
spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of June,
except the time necessary to get food, which 1 always-ap-
pointed, during this part of my employment, to be when
the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed
out; and by this time had gotten timber and plank, and
iron-work enough to have built a good boat, if I had
known how: and I also got, at teveral times, and in
several pieces, near one hundred weight of the sheet lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a large
tortoise, or turtle; this was the first I had seen, which, it
seems, was only my misfortune, not any desect of the
place, or scarcity; for had I happened to be on the other
iide of the island, 1 might have had hundreds of them
everyday, as 1 found afterwards; but perhaps have paid
dear' enough for them.
June 17, I spent in cooking the turtle; I found in her
threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me, at that time,,
the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my lise,
having had no sjeshbut of goats and fowls lince I landed
in this horrible place.
June 18. Rained all the day, and I staid within; I
thought at this time the rain selt cold, and I was some-
what chilly, which I knew was not usual in that latitude.
June 19. Very ill and shivering, as if the weather had'
been cold.
June 20. No rest all night; violent pains in my
head, and severish.
June 21. Very ill; frighted almost to death with the
apprehensions of my sad condition—to be sick, and no
• help. Prayed to God for the first time since the storm off
Hull; but scarce knew what I said or why, my thoughts
being all consused.

ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUSOE.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadsul appre-
hensions of sickness.
June 23. Very bad again ;. cold and shivering, and
then a violent head-ach.
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An ague, very violent; the sit held me seven
hours; cold fit and hot, with saint sweats after it.
'June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took
my gun, but found myself very weak. However, I killed
a the goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and'
broiled some os it, and eat: I would sain have stewed it,
and.made some broth, but had no pot.
June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay a-bed
all day, and neither eat nor drank. I was ready to pe-
nsh with thirst, but so weak I had no strength to stand
• up, or get myself any water to drink. Prayed to God
again, but was light-braded; and when 1 was not, I
was so ignorant that I knew not what to say; 1 only lay
nnd cried, Lord look upon me! Lord pity me! Lord
have mercy upon ine !. 1 suppose I did nothing else for
two or three hours, till the fit wearing off, 1 sell asteep,
anddid not awake till sar in the night. When 1 awaked,
I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceed-
ingly thirsty: however, as I had no water in my whole
. habitation, 1 was forced to lie till morning, and -went
to steep again. In this second fleep I had this terrible
dream :—
1 thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the
outside of my wall, where 1 sat when the storm blew
alter the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from
:i great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light
upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a flame,
so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his
countenance was most inexpressibly dreadsul, impossible
for words to describe. When he stepped upon the ground
with his seet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had
done before in the earthquake; and all the air looked, to
my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flathes of
sire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved
forwards towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his
haiid, to kill me ; and when he came to a rising ground at
some
some distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a voic< so t&?~
rible, that it is impossible to express the terror of it . 5//
that I can say I understood was this, Seeing all thcfe-
things have not -brought thee to repentance, now thou
shalt die! At which words, I thought he listed up the
spear that was in his hand to kill me.
No one that shall ever read this account, will expect
that I should be able to describe the horrors of my foul
at this terrible vision; I mean, that even while it was a
dream, I even dreamed of those horrors; nor is it any
more possible to describe the impression that remained
upon my mind when I awaked and found it was but a
dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had re-
ceived by the good instruction of my sather, was then
worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of
fea-saring wickedness, and a constant conversation with
none but such as were like myself, wicked and prosane
to the last degree. I do not remember that I had in all
that time one thought that so much as tended either to
looking upwards towards God, or inwards towards a re-
flection upon my own ways; but a certain stupidity of
foul, without desire of good, or conscience of evil, had
entirely overwhelmed me; and I was all that the most
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our com-
mon sailors can be supposed to be, not having the least
sense of the sear of God in dangers, or of thanksulness to
God in deliverances. -- .. .
In relating what is already past of my story, this wijl
be the more easily believed, when I shall add, that through
all the variety of miseries that had to this day besalUn
me, I never had so much as once thought of its being the
hand of God, or that it was a just punishment for my sins,
my rebellious behaviour against my sather, or-ray present
ilns, which were great; or' so much as a punishment for
the general course of my wicked lise. When I was qn
the desperate expedition on the desart shores of Asrica5-I
never had so much as one thought of what would become
of me, or one wish to God to direct me whither 1 lhculd
go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently
surrounded me, as well from voracious creatures, as cruel
savages: but 1 was merely thoughtless of God, or a
L 0 . 'providence;
providence; I acted like a mere brute, from the prin-
ciples of nature, and by the dictates of common sense only,
and indeed hardly that.
When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the Por-
tugal captain, well used and dealt justly and honourably
-with, as well as charitably, I had not the least thanksul-
ness jn my thoughts. When again I was shipwrecked.,
ruined, and in danger of drowning on this island, I was
as sar from remorse, or looking on it as a judgment; I
only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog,
and born to be always miserable. q-/ .-~y
It is true, when I got onshore first heife, andvfound all
my ship's crew drowned, and myseMM|wred, I was sur-
prised with a kind of ecstacy, and some transports of foul,
which, had the grace of God assisted, might have came up
to true thanksulness; but it ended where it began, in a
mere common flight of joy; or, as I may say, being glad
. I was alive, without the least reflection upon the distin-
guishing goodness of the hand which had preserved me,
and singled meout to be preserved, when all the rest were
destroyed; or an enquiry why Providence had been thus
mercisul to me; even iult the same common fort of joy
which seamen generally have, after they have got safe
ashore from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the
next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is
over, and all the rest of my lise was like it.
Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration,
made sensible of roy condition, how I was cast on this
dreadsul place, out of the reach of human kind, out of
all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption; as loon as
I saw a probability of living, and that I should not starve
and perish for hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore
off,-and I began to be very easy, applied myself to the
works proper for my preservation and supply, and was
sar enough from being afflicted at my condition, as a
judgment from Heaven, or as the hand of God against me ^
these were thoughts that very seldom entered into'my
head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my jour-
nal, had at first ibme little influence upon me, and be-
gan to afsect me with seriousness, as long as I thought
it
it had something miraculous in it; but'as Ibon as ever
that part of thought was ' removed, all the impscffiou
which was raised from it, wore osf also, as I have rioted
already. 'v
Even the earthquake;. though nothing could be more
terrible in its nature, or more immediately directing to the
1nviiible.Power which ajone directs such things; yet no.
sooner was the first fright over, but the impreifion.it had
made went offalso. I had no more sense os God, or his:
judgment, much less of the present affliction of my'cir-
cumftsmees being from his hand, than if, I had been in.the
most prosperous condition in lise.
But now, when I began.to be lick, and a leisurely view
os the miseries of death came to place itself before me;:
when my spirits began to link under the burthen of %
strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with the vio--
lence of the sever; conscience, that had slept so long,
began to awake, and I began to reproach myself with.my
past lise, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon.
wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me under
uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a.
manner. ,
These reflections oppressed me from the second or third:
day of my distemper, and in a violence, as well of the
seier, as of the dreadsul reproaches of my conscience,. ex~
torted some words from. me, like praying to God, though,
I cannot say they were either. a prayer attended with
desires, or with hopes; it was rather the voice os mere-
fright- aud distress.: my thoughts were consuted, the con-,.
• victrons great upon my mind, and the horror of dying irt
such a hiiserable condition, raised vapours into my head
with'fhe mere apprehensions; and in. these hurries of my
foul, 1 knew not what my tongue might express: but it
was rather exclamation, such as, Lord what a. miserable-
creature am I! Is I should be sick, I shall certainly die-
sor wajit of help, and what will become of me? Then the
tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more agood
while. ^
In this interval, the good advice of my sather came to.
my mind, and presently his prediction, which I men-.
tioned in the beginning of this. story, viz. Tljat if I did
take this foolish step,.God would not bless me, and 1. would
£ (i have-
have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his
counsel, when there might be none to assist me in my
recovery. Now, said 1 aloud, my dear sathers words
are come to pass; God's justice has overtaken me, and
I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the voice of
Providence, which had mercisully put me in a posture
or station of lise wherein 1 might have been happy and
easy; but I would neither see it myself, nor learn to
know the blefiing of it from my parents; I left them to
mourn over my foiljr, and now I am left to mourn under
the consequences of it. I resused their help and assist-
ance, who would have lifted me into the world, and would
have made every thing easy to me; and now I have dif-
ficultiesto struggle with, too great for even nature itself
to support, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no
advice. Then I cried out, Lord be my help, for I am in
great distress!
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that I
had made for many years. But I return to my Journal.
June 28. Having been something refreshed with the
sleep 1 had taken, and the fit being entirely off, I got up;
and though the fright and terror of my dream was very
great, yet I considered that the sit of the ague would re-
turn again the next day, and now was my time te gat
something to refresh nnd support myself when I should
be ill: and the first thing I did, I filled a large square case
bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of
my bed : and to take off the chill or aquifh disposition of the
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and
mixed them together; then I got me a piece of the goat's.
flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little.
I walked about, but was very weak, and withal, very
sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of my miserable con-
dition, dreading the retnrn of my distemper the next day.
At night I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs,
which 1 roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the
• shell; and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked
God's blessing to, even, as I could remember, in iny
whole lise.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myself sb
weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for I nover went
out
out without that)* so 1 went out but a little way, and
sat down upon-the ground, looking out upon the sea,
which was just before me, and very calm and imooth.
As I sat here, some thoughts, such as these, occurred to
me.
What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen so
much? Whence is it produced? And what am 1, and
all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal,
whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who is
that i
Then it followed most naturally, It is God that has.
made it all. Weil, but then it came on strongly, if God
has made all these things, he guides and governs them all,
and all things that concern them ; for the Being that could
make all things, must certainly have power to guide and
direct them.
1fso, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his
works, either without his knowledge or appointment.
And if nothing happens without his. knowledge, he
knows that I am here, and in a dreadsul condition ; and
if nothing happens without his appointment, he has ap-
pointed ail this to besal me.
Nothing occured to my thoughts to .contradict any
of these conclusions; and therefore it rested Upon me
with the greater force, that it must needs be that God
had appointed all this to besal me; that I was brought
to this miserable circumstance by 'his direction* he
having the sole power, not of me only, but of eVery
thing that happened in the world. Immediately it fol-
lowed,
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to
be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that enquiry,
as if.I had blasphemed; and methought it spoke to me
like a voice, Wretch ! dost thou ask what thoii hast done?
look back upon a dreadsul mis-spent lise, and ask thy-
self what thou hast not done? Ask, why it is that thou
wert not long ago destroyed? W hy wert thou not
drowned in Yarmouth Roads? Killed in the sight when
the ship was taken by the Sallee man of war? Devoured
by
3 si
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
by the wild beasts of the coast of Africa? Qr drowned
here, when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost thou
ask, What have I done? .
I was struck dumb with these reflections as one asto-
nished, and had not a word to say, no, not to answer to
myself; but rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my
retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had been going
to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and 1 had
no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and
lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the
apprehensions of the return of my distemper. terrified me
very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brnfilians
take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers;
and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests,
which was quite cured, and some also that was green,
and not quite cured.
I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this
chest 1 found a cure both for soul and body. I opened
the chest, and found" what I looked for, viz. the to-
bacco: and as the sew books I had saved lay there to,
I took out one of the bibles which I mentioned before,
and which, to this time, I had not sound leisure, or so
much as inclination, to look into; 1 say 1 took it out,
and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the
table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to
my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no; but-
1 tried several experiments with it, as if I was resolved
it mould hit one way or other. I first took a piece of a
leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which indeed at first
almost stupified my brain, the tobacco being green and
strong, and that 1 had not been much used to it; then I
took some, and steeped it an hour or two in rum, and re-
solved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly,
I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close
over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as well
for the heat as the viitue of it, and I held almost to suffo-
cation.
In the interyarof this operation, I took up the Bible,.
and began to read; hut my head was too much disturbed
with/the tobacco to bear reading, at le^st at that timS, only
having'opened the book casually, the sirst words that
occurred
occured to me were these, Call on me in the day of lraitlile,
and 1 will deliver, and thouJliah glorify me.
The words were very apt to my cal'e, and made some
impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading
them, though not so much as they did afterwards.; for
.as for being delivered: the word had no found, as 1 may
say, to me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in
my apprehension of things, that I began to say, as ^be
children of Israel did, when they were promised flesh ~tp
eat, Can God spread a table in the wilderness P So I began
to say, can God himself deliver me from this place?
And as it was not for many years that any hope ap-
peared, this prevailed very often upon my thoughts:
but however, the words made a very great impression
upon me, and I mused upon them very-often. It grew
now late, and the tobacco had, as I laid, dozed my head
so much, that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp
burning in the cave, lest I should want any thing in ths
night, and went to bed; but before I lay down, I did
wliat 1 never had done in all my lise; I kneeled down
and prayed to God to sulfil the promise to me, that if I
called upon him in the day of trouble, he would deliver
me. Aster my broken and impersect prayer was over, I
drank the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco,
which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that in-
deed I could scarce get it down. Immediately upon thie
I went to bed, and 1 found presently it flew up into my
head violently; but I sell into a sound flee1), and waked
no more, till by the sun it must necessarily be near three
o'clock in the afternoon the next day ; nay, to this hour
I am partly of the opinion, that I slept all the next day
and night, and till almost three the next day after; for
otherwise I knew not how I should lose a day out of my
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some
years after 1 had done; for if I had kill it by crossing and
re-crossing the line, I should hav* lqst more than a day;
but in my account it was loft, and 1 never knew which.
way.
Be that however one way or other, when I awaked,
I sound myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits
lively and cheersul; when 1 got up, I was stronger; than
J was the day before, and my stomach better; for 4
6 iva»
was hungry; and, in short, I had no fit the next day,
but continued.much altered for the better: this was the
2Sth.
The 30th was my well day of course, and I went
abroad %'ith my gun, but did not care to travel too sar.
1 killed a sea fowl or two, something like a brand goose,
and brought them home, but was not very forward to
eat them; so I eat some more of the turtle's eggs, which
were very good. This evening 1 fenewed the medicine
which 1 had supposed did. me good the day before, viz.
the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take so
much as before, nor did 1 chew any of the leaf, or hold
my head over the smoke. However, I was not so well
the next day, which was the 1st of July, as I hoped I
should have been; for I had a little spice of the cold fit,
but it wasnot much. • -
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dozed myself with it at sirst, and doubled the quantity
which I drank.
July 3. i missed the fit for good and all, though I did
not recover my sull strength for some weeks after.
While I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran
exceedingly upon this scripture, I will deliver thee; and
the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my
mind, in bar of my ever expecting it. But as I was dis-
couraging myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my
mind, that I pored so much upon my deliverance from
.the main afssiction, that I disregarded the deliverance I
had received; and I was, as it were, made to ask myself
such questions as these; viz. Have I not been delivered,
and wondersully.too, from sickness? from the most dis-
tressed. condition^ t-hafc'could be, and that was so frightful
to me? and wh'at»nfc?(ee had I taken of it? had I done
my part? God had delivered me, but I had not glorisied
him; that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful
for that as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater
deliverance?
This touched my heart very much, and immediately I
kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud for my reco-
very from my sickness.
July 4. ' 1n the morning 1 took the Bible, and begin-
ning at the New Testament, 1 began seriously to read it;
and
89
and imposed upon myself to read a while ever}- morn-
ing and every night, not tying myself to the number of
chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage me.
It was not long after I set seriously to this work, but I
found my heart- most deeply and sincerely affected with
the wickedness of my past lise; the impreffion of my
dream revived, and the words Ail these tiiings have not
brought thee io repentance, ran seriously in my thoughts.
I was earnestly begging of God to give me repentance,
when it happened providentally the very day, that,
reading the scripture, 1 came to these words, He is ex-
alted a Prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to
give remijfion. I threw down the book, and with my
heart as well as my hand lifted up to .Heaven, in a kind
of ecstacy of joy, I cried out aloud, Jesus, thou son of
David, Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me
repentance!
This was the first time that I could say in the true sense
of the words, that I prayed in all my lise; for now I
prayed with a sense of my condition, and with a true
Jcripture view of hope, founded on the encouragement of
the word of God: and from this time, I may say, 1 began
to have hope that God would hear me.
Now 1 began to construe the words mentioned above,
Call on me, and I will deliver thee, in a disserent senie
from what I had ever done before; for then I had no
notion of any thing being called deliverance, .bat- :>vy be-
ing delivered from the enptivity I was in; for though I
was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was cer-
tainly a prison to me, and that in the worst sense in the
world; but now 1 learned to take it in another sense.
Now I looked back upon my past lise with such horror,
andmylins appeared so dreadsul, that my foul sought
nothing of God, but deliverance from the load of guilt
that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary lise,
it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be deli-
vered from it, or think of it; it was all of no considera-
tion in comparison of this: and 1 added this part here,
to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they
come to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance
from fin a much greater bldiing, than deliverance from
asfliction.
But
But leaving tJtiis part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not less miser-
able as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind;
and my thoughts being directed, by a constant reading
the scripture, and praying to God, to things of a higher
. nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which till
now I knew nothing of. Also as my heallh and strength
returned, 1 bestirred myself to surnish myself with every
thing that I wanted, and make my way of living as regu-
lar.as I could: ,
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly em-
ployed in walking about with- my gun in my hand, a little
and a little at a time, as a man that was gathering up his
$rength after a fit of sickness -; for it is hardly to be ima-
gined, how low 1 was, and to what weakness I was re-
duced. The application which I made use ef, was per-
sectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an ague
before; neither can 1 recommend it to any one to prac-
tise by this experiment; and though it did carry orf'the
fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me; for I had
frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some
time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that being abroad
in the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my
-health that could be, especially in those rains which came
attended with storms and hurricsiM?? t,f wind; for as
the rain which came in a dry season was always moil
accompanied with such storms, so I found this rain was
much more dangerous than the rain which sell in Sep-
tember and October.
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten
months; all possibility of deliverance from this condi-
tion seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I firmly
believed that no human shape had ever set foot upon
that place. Having now secured my habitation, as I
thought, sully to my mind, I had a great desire to make
a more persect discovery of the island, and to see what
other productions I might find, which yet I knew nothing
It was the 15th of July that I began to make a more
particular survey of the island itself; I went up the creek
first, where as I hinted, I brought. my rafts on shore. I
- found, after T came about two miles up, that the tide did
not flow any higher, and that it 'was no more than a little
brook of running water, and very fresh and good; but
this being the dry season, there was hardly any water in
in some parts of it, at least not enough' to run into any
stream, so as it co«ld be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant savan-
nas, or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass;
and on the rising parts of them nest to the higher grounds,
where the water, as it might be supposed, never over-
flowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and grow-
ing to a great and very strong stalk: there were divers
other plants which I had no notion of, or understanding
about; and might perhaps have virtues of their own
.which I could not find out.
I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians in
all that climate make their bread of, but I could find none.,
I saw large plants of aloes, but did not then understand
them . i law several sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want
pf cultivation, impersect. I contented myself with these
discoveries for this time, and came back, musing with my-
self what course I might take to know the virtue and
goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should
discover, but could bring it to no conclusion: for, in
ijiort, I had made so little observation while I was in the
Brasils, that I knew,iittle of the plants of the field, at least
very little that might serve me to any purpose, now in my
distress.
The next day, the lGth, I went up the same way
again; and, after going something sarther than I had
done the day before, I found the brook and the savannas
began to cease, and the country became more woody
than before. In this part I found different fruits, and
particularly I found melons upon the ground in great
abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the vines had
spread indeed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes
were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich.
This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding
glad of them; but L was warned by my experience
to eat sparingly of them, remembering that, when I
was ashore in Karliary, the eating of grapes killed seve-
ral of our Englishmen who were slaves there, by throw-
ing them into fluxes and severs. But I found an excel-
lent use for these grapes, and that was to cure or dry
them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raitins
are kept; which I thought would be, as indeed they
were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat, when no
grapes might be had.
1 spent all that evening there, and went not back to my
habitation, which, by the way, was the first nigh% as I
might say, 1 had lain from home. In the night i took my
first contrivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept
well, and the next morning proceeded upon rny discovery,
travelling near four miles, as I might judge by the length
of the valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills
on the south and north side of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening, where
the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little
spring of fresh water, which issued out of the side of the
hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due east; and. the
country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every
thing being in a constant verdure,-or flourish of spring,
that it looked like a planted garden.
I descended a little on the side of that delicious valley,
surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed
with other asflicting thoughts) to think that this was ail
my own, that I was king .and lord «f this country ind^.
seasibly, and had a right of possession; and if I could
convey it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as
any lord of a manor in England. 1 saw here abundance
of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon, and citron trees ', but
all wild, and sew bearing any fruit, at least not then:
.however, the green limes that 1 gathered were not only
pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their
juice afterwards with water, which made it very whole-
some, and very cool and refreshing.
I found now I had business enough to gather and carry
home; and resolved to lay up a store, as well Qf grapes
as limes and lemons, to surnish mj self for the wet season,
winch 1 knew was approachins.
In
93
In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in
one place, and a lesser heap in another place, and a great
parcel of limes and lemons in another place; and taking
a sew of each with me, I travelled homeward, and resolved
to come again, and bring a bag or lack, or what I could
make, to carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I
came home (so I must now call my tent and my cave);
but before I got thither, the grapes were spoiled ; the rich-
ness of the fruit, and the weight of the juice, having
broken them, and bruised them, they were good for little
or nothing; as to the limes they were good, but I could
bring but a sew.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home nty harvest. Bu(
I was surprised, when coming to my heap of grapes,
which were so rich and fine when 1 gathered them, I
found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces, aud dragged
about, feme here, some there, and abundance eaten anil
devoured: by this I concluded there were some wild
Creatures thereabouts, which had done this, but what
they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them up on
heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one
way they would be destroyed, and the other way they
would be crushed with their own weight, 1 took another
course; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and
hung them upon the out branches of the trees, that they
might cure and dry in the fun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I contemplated
with great pleasure the fruitsulness of that valley, and
the pleasantness of the situation, the security from storms
on that side of the water and the wood; and con-
cluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode,
which was by sar the worst part of the country. Upon
the whole, I began to consider of removing my habitation,
and to look out tor place equally sase as where 1 now
was situate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitsul part of
the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was ex-
ceeding sond of it for some time, the pleasantness of the
'• • place
-
place tempting me; but when I came to a nearer view of
it, and to consider that I was now by the sea lide, where
it was at least possible that something might happen to
my advantage, and that the same ill sate that brought me
hither, might bring tome other unhappy wretches to the
same place; and though it was scarce probable that any
such thing mould ever happen, yet to inclosemyself among
the hills and woods, in the centre of the island, was to
anticipate my bondage, and to render such an affair not
only improbable, but impossible; and that therefore I
ought not by any means to remove.
However, I was so enamoured with this place, that I
spent much of my time there for the whole remaining
part of the month of July; and though, upon second
thoughts, I resolved as above, not to remove, yet I built
me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at- a dis-
tance with a strong sence, being a double hedge, as high
as I could reach, well staked, and silled between with
brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or
three nights together, always going over it with a ladder,
as before: so that I sancied now I had my country-iiouse,
and my sea-coast house; and this work took me up to
the beginning of August.
I had but newly finished my sence, and began to enjoy
my labour, but the rains came on, and made me stick
close to my first habitation; sor though I had made me a
tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and spread it
very well, yet I had not the shelter of an hill to keep me
from storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when
the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, J had finished
my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The third of
August i found the grapes I had hung up were persectly
dried, and indeed were excellent good raisins of the
sun; so 1 began to take them down from the trees, and
it was very happy that 1 did so, for the rains which fol-
lowed would have spoiled them, and 1 had lost the best
part of my winter sood^ for I had above two hundred
large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them
all down, and carried most of them home to my cave,
but it began to rain; and from thence, which was
the fourteenth of August, it rained more or less every
day
(lay till the middle of October; and sometimes so -vio-
lent!y, that I could not stir out of my cave sor several
days.
In this season I was much surprised with the increase of
my samily.. i had been concerned for the loss of one of
my cats, who ran away from me, or, as 1 thought, had
been dead; and I heard no more tale or tidings of her,
till to my astonishment she came home about the end of
August, with three kittens. This was the more strange
to me, because, though I had killed a wild cat, as I called
it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a quite different
kind from our European cats.; yet the young cats were
the same kind of house breed like the old one; and both
my cats being semale?, I thought it very strange. But
from these thiee cats, I afterwards came to be so pestered
with cats, that 1 was forced to hill them like vermin', or
wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as
possible.
From the fourteenth of August to the twenty-sixth, in-
cessant rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very
caresul not to bemuen wet. In this confinement 1 began
to be streightened for food; but venturing out twice, I
one day killed a goat; and the last day, which was the
twenty-sixth, found a veiy large tortoise, which was a
treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: 1 eat a
bunch of raisins for my breaksast, a piece o* the goat's
N flesll, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for to my
great misfortune i had no vessel to boil or stew any thing),
and two or three of the turtle's eggs for supper.
During this consinement in my cover by the rain, I
worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave;
and, by degrees, worked it on towards one lide, till I came
to the outside of the hill, and made a door or way out,
which came beyond my sence or wall; and so I came in
and out this way : but I was not persectly easy at lying so
open; sor as I had managed myself before, I was in a per-
sect inclosure, whereas now 1 thought 1 lay exposed ; and
yet 1 could not perceive that there was any living thing
to sear, the biggest creature that 1 had yet seen upon the
island being a goat.
September the thirtieth, I was now come to the un-
happy anniversary of my landing; I cast up the notches
on
.pamy post, and found I had been on shore three hundred
tind sixty-five days. 1 kept this day as a solemn sast, setting
it. apart to a religious exercise, prostrating myself to the
ground with the most serious humiliation, consessing my-
fels to God, acknowledging his righteous judgment upon
me,' and praying.him to have mercy on me through Jesus
Christ; and having net tasted the least refreshment for
twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then
cat a biscuit-cake, and a bunch of grapes, and went to
bed, siniiliing the day as I began it.
I had all this time observed no iabbath-day; sor as at
first 1 had no sense of religion upon my mind, 1 had after
sometime omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a
longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath-day, and so
did not really known what any of the days were; but
now having cafe up the days as above, I found I had
been there a year; so 1 divided it into weeks, and set
apart every seventh day for a sabbath; though I found
at the end of my account I had lost a day or two of my
reckoning.
A little aster this my ink began to sail me, and so I
contented. myself to use it more sparingly, and to write
down only the most remarkable events os my lise, without
continuing a daily memorandum of other things. •
The rainy season, aud the dry season, began now to ap-
pear regular^o me, and I .learned to divide them so as to
provide for them accordingly. But I bought all my ex-
perience before I had it; and this I am going to relate,
was one of the most discouraging experiments that 1 made
at all. I have mentioned that i had saved the sew ears of
barley aud rice which I had so surprisingly found spring
up,'as I thought of themselves, and believe there were
about thirty tlalks of rice, and about twenty of barley;
and now I thought it a proper time. to low it after the
rains, the sun being in its southern position going from rne.
Accordingly 1 dug up a piece of ground as well as I
could with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two
parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sewing, it cafully
occurred to my thoughts, that I would not sow it all at
first, because 1 did not know when was the proper time
for it; so I sowed about two-thirds of the seeds, leaving
an handsul of each. .
'. Jt was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so,
for not one grain Of that I sowed this time came to any
thing; for the dry months following, the earth having
had no rain after the seed'was sown, it had no moisture
to assist its growth, and never came up at all till the wet
season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been
newly fown< i
Finding my first seed did not grow-, tyhich I eassty
imagined was*by the drought, 1 sought for a moister
piece of grounds to make another trial in 5 and I dug up
fa piece of ground near my new .bower, and sowed the
•.,''"teft' of myjseed in February, a little .before the vernal
equinox'; and this* having the rainy months of March
-and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and
yielded a very good'crop; but having part of the ieed
left only, and not daring-to sow all that I had yet, I had
but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not amount-
ing to above half a peck of each kind.
Hut by this experience 1 was made master of my busi-
ness, add knew exactly when the proper season was to
soK£'-and that 1 might expect two seed times and two
harvests every year.. '..
While this torn was growing, I made a little disco-
f 'very, which was of use to me afterwards. ;As soon as
the rains were over, and the weather began to settle,-
which was about the mor.rh of November, I made a
visit up the country to thy bower, where, though I had
not been some months, yet I found all things just as I left
the,m. The circle or double hedge that 1 had made
was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had
out off of some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot
out, and grown with. long branches, as much as a wil-
low -tree usually shoots the sirst .year after lopping its
:h.ead. 1 could not tell what tree to call it, that-these
stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well
pleased to see the young trees grow; and I pruned them,
and led them up to grow as much a:ike as I could; and
it is scarce credible, how beautisul afigurethey grew into,
in three years; so that, though the hedge made a circle of
about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for
such 1 might now cull them, soon covered it, and itSvas a
compleat shade, sufficient to lodge under all the dry season.
vol. 1. F This
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and
•• make me an hedge like this in a semicircle round my
wall, 1 mean that of mv first dwelling, which 1 did ;—
and, placing the trees pr stakes in a doubie row, at above
eight yards distance from my first sence, they grew pre-
sently, and were at first a line cover to my habitation,
and afterwards served for a desence also, as I mall ob-
serve in its order.
I found now that the seasons of the year might general-
ly be divided, hot into summer and winter, as in Europe,
but in the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were
generally thus :-—

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter. as
the winds happened to blow; but this was the general
observation 1 made. After I had sound, by experience,
the ill consequence of being abroad in the rain, I took
care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I
might not be obliged to go out; and I sat within doors
as much as possible during the wet months.
In this time I found much employment (and very
suitable also to the time), for 1 found great occasion os
many things which I had no way to surnish myself
with, but by hard labour, and constant application ;—
particularly, I tried many wavs to make myself a
basket;
'basket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpose
proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It proved
'of excellent advantage to me' now, that, when I was a
boy, i used to take great delight in standing at a basket-
maker's in the town where my sather'lived, to see them
make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually
are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the
manner how they worked those things, and sometimes
lent an hand, I had by this means so sull knowledge o£
the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the mate-
rials; when it came into my mind, that the twigs of that
tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew, might'pos-
,sih!y be as tough as the fallows, and willows, and osiers,
in England; arid I resolved to try.
Accordingly, next day, I went to my country-;
house, as I called it, and cutting some of the smaller
twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I couldj
desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared with
an hatchet to cut down a quantity, which 1 soon found,
for' there was a great plenty of them: these I set up to
dry within my circle or hedges; and when they were
fit for use, I carried them to my Cave; and here, during;
the next'season, I employed myself in making (as welV
as I could) a great many baskets, both to carry earth,
or to carry or lay up any thing,' as 1 had occasion; and,
though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet t
made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose; and
thus afterwards I took care never to be without them }
and as my wicker-iware decayed, I made more; espe-
cially I made strong deep baskets to place my corn in»
instead of lacks, when I should come to have any quan-
tity of it. '4' '.
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed 3
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if pos-
sible, how to supply two wants. I had no vessels to
hold any thing that was liquid, except two rundlets,
tL'hich were almost sull Of rum, and some glass bottles,
fbme of the common size, and others which were casc-
frottles, square, for the holding of waters, spirits, &c.
Fhad not so much as a pot to boil any thing in, except
a :great kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which'
-was too big for such uses as I desired it for, vizi to
J % make
make broth, and slew a bit of meat by itself. The se-
cond thing i would sain have had was a tobacco pipe,
but it was impossible for me to make one; however, I
found a contrivance for that too at lalt,
I employed myself in planting my second rows of slakes
of piles, and in this wicker work, all the summer, or
dry season; when another business took me'up more
fime than it could be imagined I could spare.
. I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the'
whole Island, and that I had travelled up the brook, 'and
so on to where I built my bower, and where i had an
opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island.
1 now resolved to travel quite across .tp the sea shore on
(hat side-; so taking my gun and hatchet,' and my dog,
and a laTger quantity of powder and shot than usual,
with two biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in
my pouch, for my.store^ I began my journey. W hen I
had palsed the vale where my bovver Hood, as above, I
came within view of the sea, to the wfsl; and jj being a
very clear day, I sairly descried land, whether an island
^•continent I could not tell .; but it lay very high, ex-
tending from the vyest to the W..S.W. at a very great dis-
tance.; by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or
tvvPnty leagues off. - . ,
'I could not tell what part of the world this might be,
Otherwise than that I knew k must be part of America;
jmd, as I concluded by all my observations, must be near
the Spanish dominions, and- perhaps was all inhabited
by savages, where, if f should have landed, 1 had been
in a worse condition than I was now j and therefore!' ac-
quiesced in the dispositions of Providence, which. I began
now to own-, and to believe, ordered every thing for the
best; I say, I quieted my mind with this, and left afflict-
ingmyself wish fruitless wishes of being there. . ,
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered,
that if this land was the lipanish coast, I should certainly^
one time or other, see tome vessels pass or repals One way
or otner; but -inot, then it was the sa' age coast betweejji
the Spanish country aril Brasil, which were indeed thi»
worst of savages; for they are cannibals, or men eatery
air'. fiii.n^t to murder and devour all the human bodies
that tall into their hands.
-•; with
With these considerations I walked very leisurely for-
ward; I found that side of the island where I now was
much pleasanter than mine, the open or savanna fields
sweet, adorned with flowers and grai's, and sull of very
fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and sain would
I have caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame,
and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some pains-
taking, catch a young parrot; for I knocked it down
with a stick, and having recovered it, brought it home,
but it was some years before t coHild make him speak.—-
However, at last 1 taught him to call me by my name very
familiarly J but trie accident that followed, though it be
a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.
1 was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I found,
in the low grounds, hares, as 1 thought them to be,
and foxes, but they dissered greatly from all the other
kinds I had met with; nor could 1 satisfy myself to eat
them, though I killed several; but I had no need to be
venturous, for 1 had no want of food, and of that which
was very good too; especially these three. sorts, viz.
goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise; which, added to
my grapes, Leadenhall-market could not have surnished
~a better table than I, in proportion to the company.—.
And though my case w^s deplorable enough, yet 1 had
great cause for thanksulness, that I was not driven tp
any extremities for food; but rather plenty, even to
dainties. ',
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but 1 took so many
turns and returns to see what discoveries I could make,
that I came weary enough to the place where I resolved
to sit down for all night; and then either reposed myr
selt in a tree,' or surrounded myself with a row of stakes
fet upright in the ground, either from one tree to anop
'ther, or so as no wild creature could come at me withouf
waking me.
- As soon as I came to the sea shore, I was surprised to
see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the
island; for here indeed the shore was covered with in-
numerable turtles; whereas, on the other side, 1 had
-found but three in a year and a hals. Here was also an
iusinite number of fowls of many kinds, Ibrue of which
f 3 . I had
102 ADV^NTURrs OB^^QBINJDN CRUSO?.
I had not seen before, and many of them very goo<!
meat; but such as I knew not the names of, except those
called penguins.
I could have shot as many as 1 pleased, but was very-
sparing of my powder and shot; and therefore had more
mind to kill a she goat, if I could, which I could better
seed on; and though there were many goats here, more
than on the other side of the island, yet it was with much
more difficulty than I could come near them; the coun-
try being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner
than when I -<yas on the hillsi .
I consess this side of the country was much, pleasanter
than mine, but yet I bad not the leali inclination to re-
move, for as I was fixed in my habitation, it became
natural to me, and I seemed, all the while I was here, to
be, as it were, upon a journey, and from home. Howr
ever, I travelled along the shore of the sea towards the.
ealt, I suppose about twelve.miles, and then setting up.
a great pole upon. the wore for a mark, 1 concluded I
"would go home again; and the .next journey I toajc
should be on the ether side of the island, east from my
dwelling, and so round till 1 came to my poll again: as
which in its place.
'I took another way to come back than that I went*
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much in
'my view, that I could not miss finding my first dwelling
'by viewing the country, but I found myself mistaken;
for being come about two or three miles, I found mysels
descended into a very large valley; but so surrounded
-with hills, and those hills covered with wopds, that I
could not see which was the way by- any direction but
that of the sun, nor even then, unless ] knew very well
the position of the sun at that time of the day. ..
'It happened to my surther misfortune, that the wea-
ther proved hazy for three or four days, while I was ia
this valley, and not being able to see the sun, 1 wan-
dered. about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged
to find out the sea-side, look for my post, and corne
back the same way I went; and then, by easy journiea,
I'turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot^.
and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and- other things,
Very heavy. jf
In this journey my Jog surprised a young. kid, and
seised upon it; and I, running in to take hold of it,
caught it, and saved it alive from,the dog. I had a great
mind to bring it home, if I could, for I had often been
muling whether it might not be possible to get a kid or
two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, which might
supply me when my powder and shot mould be spent.
i made a collar to this little creature, and with a string,
-which I made of some rope yarn, which 1 always carried
about me, I led him along, though with some difficulty,
till 1 came to my bower, and there I inclosed him, and
left him, for 1 was very impatient to be at home, from
-whence 1 had been absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satissaction it was to me to
come to my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-
bed. This little wandering journey, without a settled
place of abode, had been so unpleasant. to me, that my
own house, as 1 called it to myself, was a persect settle-
ment to me. compared to that; and it rendered every
thing about me so comfortable, that I resolved 1 would
Beyer go a great way from it again, while it should be
my lot to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale my-
felf after my long journey; during which, most of the
time was taken up in the weighty assair of making
<jage for my poll, who began now to be a mere domestic,
$nd to be pretty well acquainted with me. Then I
began to think of the poor kid, which I had pent is\
'within my little circle, and resolved to go and setch it
home, and give it some food. Accordingly 1 went, and
found it where 1 left it, for indeed it could not get out,.
but was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut
boughs of trees and branches of such shrubs as I could
find, and threw it over, and having sed it, 1 tied it as I
did before, to lead it away i but it was so tame with.
being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it; for it
followed me like a dog; and as 1 constantly sed it,- the|
Creature, became so loving, lo gentle, and so fond, that it
became from that time one of my domestics also, tmd,
-would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season qf the autumnal equinox was now
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the same
•" r 4 solemn
solemn manner as before, being the anniversary of my
landing on the illand, having now been there two years,
and no more prospect of being delivered' than the first
day I came there. I spent the whole day in humble and
thanksul acknowledgments of the many wondersul mercies
which my solitary condition was attended with, and
without which it might have been infinitely more miser-
able. I gave humble and hearty thanks, that God bad
been pleased to discover to' me, even that it was possible
I might be more happy in this solitary condition, than I
should have been in a liberty of society, and in all the
pleasures of the world. That he could sully make up
to me the deficiencies of my solitary state, and the want
of human society, by his presence, and the communiea-
tion of his grace to my foul, supporting, comforting, and
encouraging me to depend upon his providence bele, and-
hope for his eternal presence hereafter.
It was now that 1 began sensibly to seel how muclv
more, happy the lise I now led was, with all its miserable
circumstances, than the wicked, cursed,'abominable life
I led all the past 1xirt- of my days: and now having:
changed both my sorrows an«t my joys/rhy very deli res
altered, my afsections changed their gust, and my de-
lights were persectly new from what they were at first
coming, or indeed tor the two years past.
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, op
for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul, at my
condition, would break out upon me on a sudden, and
my very heart would die within me, to think of the
woods, the mountains, the desarts I was in and how I
was a prisoner locked up, with the eternal bars and bolts
of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without re-
demption. In the midst of the greatest composures os
inv mind, this would break out upon me like a storm,
and make me wring my hands, and weep like a child.—
Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work,
and I would immediately sit down and' sigh, and look
vpon the ground for an hour or two together, and this
was still worse to me; for if I could burst out into tears,.
or vent myself by words, it would go off, and the grief
having exhausted itself, would- abate.
'' ' I
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts; I daily read the word of God, and applied alt
the comforts of it to my present state. One morning*
being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words, ,
"I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee.!" Im-
mediately it occurred that these words were to me; why
else should they be directed in such a manner, just at tha
moment when I% was mourning over my condition, as
one forsaken of God and man? Well, then, said 1, if'
God does not forsake me, of what ill consequence can' it'
be, or what matters it, though the world should all for-
sake me; seeing, on the other hand, if I had all the
world, and mould lose the savour and Wessing of God,'
there would be no comparison in the loss?
From this' moment 1 began to conclude in my mind,
that it was possible for me to be more happy in this for-
saken, solitary condition, than it was probable I should
have ever been in any other particular state in the world ;.
and with this thought I was going to give thanks to
God for bringing me to this place.
I know not what it was, hut something.shocked'my
mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.'
How canst thou be such a hypocrite, said I, even aun
«libly, to pretend to be thanksul for a condition, which,
however thou mayest endeavour to be contented with,thou
wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from? So I
stopped there; but though I could not say I thanked God
lor being there, yet 1 iincerely gave thanks to God for
opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting Providences, to
see the former condition of my lise, and to mourn for
my wickedness, and repent. 1 never opened the Bible
or shut it, but my very foul within me bieised God for
directing my friend in 1ingland, without any order of
mine^to pack it up among my goods; and for assisting.
me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, 1 began my
,third year; and though 1 have not given the reader the
trouble of so particular an account of my works this.
year as the first, yet in general it may be observed, that
I wasi very seldom idle; having regularly divided my.
-time, according to the several daily employments
that were before me; such as—First, iVly duty to God,.
J": . . f 5 and;
and reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart
some time for, thrice every day.—Secondly, The going
abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me
up three hours in every morning, when it did not rain.
Thirdly, The ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking
what 1 had killed or catched for my supply—theje took
up great part of the day.—Also, it is to be considered,
that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the
zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out,
so that about four hours in the evening was all the time I
could be supposed to work in, with this exception, that
sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working,
and went to work in the morning, and abroad with my
gun in the evening.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may ..
be added, the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the
many hours, which, for want of tools, want of help,
want of skill, every thing that I did took up out of
my time. For example, I was sull two and forty days
making me a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in
my cave ; whereas two sawyers, with their tools and
iaw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree
in half a day.
My case was this—It was to be a large tree which
'was to be cut down, because .my board was to be.a
broad one. The tree I was three days in cutting down,
and two more cutting osf the boughs, and reducing it
to a log, or piece of timber. With Inexpressible hack-
ing and hewing, I reduced both thesides of it into chips,
till it began to be light enough to move; then I turned
it, and made one side of it smooth and flat, as a board,
from end to end. Then turning that side downward,
cut the other side till i brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one'
may judge of the labour of my hands in such a piece of
-work; but labour and patience carried me through that
and many other. things. I only observe this m particu-
lar to thew the reason why so much of my time went
away with so little work, viz. That what might be a
little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour,
and .required a prodigious time to do alone, and by
hand. .. . •
But
•'
But notwithstanding this, with patience and' labour I
went through many things, and indeed every thing that
my circumstances made necessary for me to do, as will
appear by what follows;
1 was now in the months of November and December,
expecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I
had manured or dug up for them was not great; for as
I obterved, my seed of each was not above the quantity
of half a peck; for I had lost one whole crop by sowing
in the dry season; but now my crop promised very well,
when on a sudden I found I was in danger of losing it
all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce
possible to keep from it. As, sirst, the goats, and wild
creatures, which I called hares, who, tasting the sweet-
ness of the blade, lay in it all night and day, as soon as
it came up, and ea\t it so close, that it could get no time
to shoot up into stalks.
This I saw no remedy for, but by making an inclosure
about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of
toil; and the more, because it required a great deal of
speed; the creatures daily spoiling my corn. However,
as my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got
it totally well senced in about' three weeks time; and
shooting some of the creatures in the day time, J set my
dog to guaed it in the night, tying him up to a stake at
the gate, where he could stand and bark all night long;
so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the
corn grew very strong, and well, aiid began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while'my corn was
in the blade, lo the birds were as likely to ruin me now,
when it was in the ear; lor going along by the place, to
see how it throve, I saw my little crop surrounded with
fowls of I know not how many sorts, which ilood as it
tvere watching till I should be gone. I immediately let
fly among them, for i had always my gun with me.—
I had no sooner shot than there arose up a little cloud os
fjewls, which 1 had not seen at all, from among the corn
itself.
This touehed me sensibly, for I foresaw, that in a sew-
days they would devour all my hopes: that I mould be
starved, and never be able to raise a crop' at all, and
•what to do i could not tell. However, 1 resolved not tai
s 6 fcs*
lose rny corn, if possible, though I should watch it night
and day. In the first place, 1 went among it to see what
damage was already done, and found they had spoiled
a good deal of it; but that, as it was yet too green for
them, the loss was not so great, but the remainder was
like to be a good crop, if it could be saved.
I staid by it, to load my gun, and then, coming away*
I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees
about me, as if they only waited till 1 was gone away;
and the event proved it to be so; for as I walked ofs as
if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight, but they
dropt down, one by one, into the corn again. 1 was so
provoked, that I could not have patience to stay till more
came on, knowing that every grain that they eat now
was, as might be said, a peck loaf to me in the conse-
quence; but coming^up to the hedge, I fired again, and
killed three of them. This was what I wished for; so I
took them up, and served them as we serve notorious
thieves in England, viz. hanged them in chains for a
terror to others. It is almost impossible to imagine, that
this should have such an essect as it had; for the fowls
-would not only not come at the corn, but in short they
forsook that part of the island, and-I could never see a
bird near. the place as long as my scarecrows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about
the latter end of December, which was our second har-
vest in the year, I reaped my corn.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a fickle to cut it
down, and all I could do was to make one as well as I
could, out of one of the broad swords, or cutlasses,
which I saved among the arms out of the ship. How-
ever, as my crop was small, I had no great difficulty.
to cut it down. In short, I reaped it my way, for I cut
nothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great
basket which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my.
hands; and at the end of all r8y harvesting, I found,
that out of my half peck of seed, 1 had near two bushels
of rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley,.
that is to say, by my guess, for I had no measure at that
time. . • •/
However, this was a great encouragement to me '-t~
and I foresaw, that in time it would plea/e God to sup-
ply
ply me with bread; and yet here I was perplexed again?,-
for I neither knew how to grind, or make meal .of my'
corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor if made
itito meal, how to make bread of it; and7 if how to
make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These things
being added to -my desire of having a good quantity for
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to
taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed
'gainst the next season, and in the mean time to employ
all my study, and hours of working, to accomplish this
great work of supplying myself with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that I now worked for my
bread. It is a little wondersul, and what I believe sew^
people have thought much upon, viz. the strange multi-
tude of little things necessary in the providing, produc-
ing, curing, dressing, making and finishing this one
article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made more
and more sensible of it every hour, even after I got the
first handsul of seed corn, which, as I have said, came up
unexpectedly, and indeed to my surprise.
First, I had no plow to turn up-the earth, no spade or
(hovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a
wooden spade, as I observed before;. but this did my
work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost me a
great many days to make k, yet, for want of iron, it not
only wore out the sooner, but made my work the harder,:
and made it be persormed much worse.
However, this I bore with too, and was content to-
work it out with patience, and bear with the badness of
the persormance. When the corn was sowed, I had no
harrow,- but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a
great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch the earth,
as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it.
When it was growing or grown, I' have observed al<-
ready how many things I wanted—to sence it, secure it;
rflow, or reap it, cure or carry it home, thresh, part it
from the chart, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to
grind itS sieves to dress it, yelt and salt to make it into
bread, and an oven to bake it in; and all these things
I'did-without,. as shall be observed; and yet the com
. :u< was
was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me too;
but all this, as I said, made every thing laborious and
tedious to me, but that there was no help for; neither
was my time so much loss to me, because I had dividell
it; a certain part of it was every day appointed to these
works; and as I resolved to use none of the corn for
bread, till I'had a greater quantity by me, I had the next
six months to apply myself wholly by labour and inven-
tion, to surnish myself with utensils proper for the per-
forming all the operations necessary for the making the
corn, when I had it, sit for rny use.
But first I had to prepare more land, for I had now
seed enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I
did this, I had above a week's work to make me a spade,
which, when it Was done, was a very sorry one indeed,
and very heavy, and required double labour to work
with it; however, I went through that, and sowed my
seeds in two large flat pieces of ground, as near my house
as I could find them to my mind, and senced them in
with a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut osf
that wood which I had let before, which I knew would
grow:, so that in one year's time I knew I should have a
quick, or living hedge, that would want but little re-
pair. This work was not so little as to take me up less
than three months, because great part of that time was
the wet season, when I could not go abroad.
Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not
go out, Lfound employment on the following occasion:
Always observing, that all the while I was at work I
diverted myself with. talking to my parrot, and teaching
him to speak,- and I quickly learned him to know his
own name; and at last to speak it pretty loud, Poll;
which was the first word I ever heard spoken inthe island,
by any mouth but my own. This therefore was not my
work, but an assistant to my work; for now, as Isaid,
1 had a great employment upon my hands, as follows,
viz. T had long studied, by some means or other, to>
make myself some earthen veflels, which indeed I want-
ed sorely, but knew not where to come at them; how-
ever, considering the heat of the climate, I did not
doubt but, if I could find out any such clay, I might
batch up some such pot as might, being dried by the
-sun, be hard enough, and strong enough, to bear bandn
ling, and to hold any thing that was dry, and required
to be kept so; and as this was necessary in preparing
cOrn, meal, &c. which was the thing I was upcrn, I re-
solved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to
stand like jars, to hold.what I should put into them.
It would make the reader, pity me, or rather laugh at
me, to tell_how many aukward ways I took to raise this
paste, what odd mis-shapen ugly things I made, how
many of them sell in, and how many sell out, the clay
not being stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many
cracked by the over violent heat of the sun, being set out
too hastily; and how many sell to pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were dry ed; and, in
a word, how, after having laboured hard to rind the clay,
tadig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I
could not make above two large earthen ugly things, I
cannot call them jars, in about two months labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set them down
again in two great wicker baskets, which 1 had made on
purpose for them, that they might not break; and, as
between the pot and the basket, there was a little room
to spare, I stusfed it sull of the rice and barley straw
and these two pots being to stand always dry, I thought
would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the nfteal, when
the corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for large
pots, yet I made several smaller things with better suc-
cess; such as little round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and
pipkins, amt any thing my hand turned to; and the
heat of the sun baked them strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which was to
get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the
fire, which none of these could do. It happened, after
some time, making a prfctty large sire for cooking my
meat, when 1 went to put it out, after 1 had done with
it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthen wire
vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a
tile. i was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to
myself, that certainly they might be made to burn whole,
if they would burn irokea. <'.
3 This
This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to
make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln,
such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them with
lead, though I had.some lead to do it with; bus I
placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots, in a
pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood all
round it, with a great heap of embers under them: I
plied the fire with fresh suel round the outside, and upon
the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red hot quite
through, and observed that they did not crack at all :—-
when 1 law them clear red, I let them stand in that heat
about five or six hours, till I found one of them, though
it did not ccack, did melt or run; for the sand which
was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the
heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone on;
so 1 slackened my fire gradually, till the pots began to
abate of the red colour; and watching them all night,
that I might not let the fire abate too sait, in the morn-
ing I had three very good, I will not say handsome, pip-
kins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could
be desired; and one of them persectly glazed with the
running of the sand.
Aster this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no-
fort of earthen ware for my use; but 1 must needs say, as
to the shapes of them, they were very indifserent, as any
one may suppose, when 1 had no way of making them,
but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would
make pies that never learnt to raise paste.
No joy, at a thing of so mean a nature, was ever equal <
to miiie, when I found I had made an earthen pot that
would bear the fire , and I had hardly patience to stay
till they were cold, before I let one upon the fire again,
with some water in it, to-boil me some meat, which I
did admirably well; and with a piece of a kitl 1 made
some very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal,. and
feveral other ingredients requisite to make it so good as. I
would have had it. •
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to
stamp or beat some corn in; for as.to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that- persection of art
with one pair of hands. To supply . this want, 1 was
at a great loss; for of all trades- ia the world I was as
- i <' 'persectly
persectly unqualified for a stone-cutter as for any what-
ever ; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I spent
many a day to sind out a great llone, big enough to cut-
hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none
at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I
had no way to dig or cutouts nor indeed were the rocks
in the island of hardness sufficiaht, but were all of a sandy
crumbling stone, which would neither bear the weight
of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without
filling it with sand: so, after a-great deal of time lost in
searching fora stone, 1 gave it over, and resolved to look
out a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed
much easier; and getting one as big as I had strength to
itir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my
axe and hatchet; and then, with the help of fire and in-
finite labour, made an hollow place in it, as the Indians
in Brasil make their canoes. After this, I made) a great
heavy pestle or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood,
and this 1 prepared and laid by against 1 had my next
crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grinds or ra-
ther pound, my com or meal to make my bread.
- My next difficulty was to make a sieve or fierce,. to
strels my meal, and part it from the bran and the husk,
without which I did not see it possible. I could have any
bread. This was a most difficult thing, so much as but
to think on; for to be sure 1 had nothing like the ne-
cessary things to make it with; I mean fine thin canvass,
or stuff to fierce the meal through. And here I was at
a sull stop for many months; nor did I really know
-what to do; linen L.had none left but what was mere
rags; I bad goat's'hair, but neither knew I how to
weave or spin dt; and had I known how, here were no
tools'to work it with; all the remedy that I found for
this was, that at last I did remember 1 had among the
feamen's clothes, which were saved out of the thip, some
. neckcloths of callico or muslin; and with some pieces of
these I made three small sieves, but proper enough for tha
work; and thus I made shift for some years; how I
did afterwards, I shall shew in its place. ''
'The baking part was the next thing to be considered,
and how 1 should make bread when I came to have
'corn; for, first, I had no yest: as to that part, as
there
there was no supplying the want, so I did not concerns
myself much about it. But for an oven,. I was indeed in
great pain. At length I found out an experiment for
that also, which was this; I made some earthen vessels
very broad, but not deep; that is to .ay, about two seet
diametei, and not above nine inches deep; these I burnt
in the fire as I had done the other, and laid them. by ^—
and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon
the hearth, which I -had paved with some square tiles of
- my own making and burning also; but I mould not call
them square. ... .. .
When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals* I drew them forward upon this
hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I let them)
lie, till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away all
the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves; and whelm-"
ing down the earthen pot upon <-jcm, drew the embers
all round the outside of the pot, to keep in, and add to
the heat: and thus, as well as in the best oven in the
world, I baked my barley-loaves, and became in a little
time a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for I made
myself several cakes of the rice, and puddings; indeed I
made no pies, neither had I any thing to put into them,
sunposins 1 had, except the slesh either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these. things took
me up most part of the third year ot my abode here ;—.
for it is to be observed, that in the intervals of these
things I had my new harvest and husbandry to ma-
nage; for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried
it home as well as I could, and. laid it up in the ear,
in my large baskets, till I bad time c to.rub it out; for
I had no floor to thresh it on, or instrurflgnt to thresh it
with. i ,- . , - . - i, -
And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, I really
wanted to build my barns bigger;. I wanted a place tot
lay it up in; for the increase of the.com now yielded me
so much, that I had of the barley about twenty bushels^
and of the rice as much, or more; insomuch that I now
resolved to begin to use it freely, for my bread had beelv
quite gone a.. great while f also I resolved to see what
quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, and to
low hut once a year.
- •' Upon
TJpon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could consume in
a year; so I resolved to sow just the same quantity every
year that 1 sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity
would sully provide me with bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you may be sure
my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of the
land which I had seen from the other side of the island;
and I was not without secret wishes, that I was on shore
there, sancying, that ieeing the main land, and an inha-
bited country, 1 might sind some way or other to convey
myself sarther, and perhaps at last find some means of
escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers
of such a condition, and how I might sall into the hands
of savages, and perhaps such as I might have reason to
think sar worse than th.e:)ious and tigers of Africa: that
if I once came into their power, I should run an hazard
more than a thousand to one of being killed, and per-
haps of being eaten; for 1 had heard that the people of
the Caribean coalrs were cannibals, or men-eaters; and
J knew, by the latitude, that I could not be sar off from
that more: that, suppose they were not cannibals, yet
they might kill me, as many Kuropeans, who had sallen
into their hands, had been served, even when they had
been ten or twenty together, much more 1 that was but
one, and could make little or no desence. All these
things, I say, which I ought to. have considered well
of, and 1 did cast up rhy thoughts afterwards, yet
took none of my apprehensions at sirst; and my head
ran mightily upon the thoughts of getting over to that
ihore. '. - -.i
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat,
with the shoulder of mutton sail, with which i sailed
Above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but this
•was in vain. Then I thought I would go and look on
.our ship's boat, which, as: 1 baye-said, was blown up
jBpon the shore a great way in the storm, when we were
first cast away. She lay almost where she did at first,
but not quite, and was turned by the force of the waves
and the winds, almost bottom upwards, against the
high ridge of beachy rough land, but no water about her
-fit before. . .
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have
launched her into the water, the boat would have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the Brasils
with her easy enough; but I might have easily'foreseert,
that I could no more turn her, and set her upright upon
her bottom, than I could remove the island.' However,
1 went to the wood, and cut leaves and rollers, and
brought them to the boat, resolved to try what I could
do; suggesting to myself, that if I cotild but turn her
down, I might easily repair the damage she bad re-
ceived, and she would be a very good boat, and I might
go to sea in her very easily.'
I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil,
and spent, 1 think, three or four weeks about it. At last,
finding it impossible to heave it Up with my little strength,
I sell to digging away the sand to undermine it; and so
to make it sall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust
and guide it right in the sall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up-
again, or Co get under it, much le^'s to move it fonvard3
towards the water; so I was forced to give it over; andx
yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my desire
to venture over for the main increased, ravher than de-
creased, as the means for it seemed impossible.
This at length set rae upon thinking whether it was
not possible to make myself a canoe or periagua, such as
the natives of those climates make, even without tools,
or, as 1 might say, without hands, viz. of. the trunk
of a g-ceat tree. This 1 not only thought possible, but
easy; and pleased myself extremely with my thoughts
of making it, and with my having much more conve-
nience for it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not
at all considering the particular mconveniencies which
1 lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want of
hands to move it into the water, when it was made ;-—
a difficulty < much harder for me to surmount than all
the consequences of want of tools could be to them :—-
for what was it to me, that when I had chosen a vaft
tree in the woods, I might with great trouble cut it
down, if, alter 1 might be able with my tools to hew
and dub the outside into-a proper shape of a-boat, and
burn or cut the inside to make it hollow, so to make
a boat of it, if, after all this, I mast leave it just there
», where
'where I found it, aud was not able to launch it into the
water.
One would have thought 1 could not have had the
least reslection upon ray mind of ray circumstance, while
I was making this boat, but I should have immediately
thought how I could get it into the sea; but my thoughts
•were so intent upon my voyage over the :ea in it, that
I never orice considered how I should get it oss of the
land; and it was really in its own nature more easy for
me to guide it over foity-five miles of lea, than about
forty-five sathom of land, where it lay, to let it afloat in
the water. ,
,1 went to work upon this boat the most Nlike a fool
that ever man did, who had any ef his senses awake. —
I pleased myseif with the design, without determining
whether I was ever able -to undertake it; not but that
the ^difficulty of launching my boat came often into my
head; but 1 put a stop to my own inquiries into it by
this foolish answer, which 1 gave myself.) Let me first
make it; I'll warrant I'll find some way or other to gat
it aiong, when it is done. -'•
This was a most preposterous method; but the eager-
lie ss of my sancy prevailed, and to work I went, and
f«llcd a <jedar-tree.; 1 question much whether Solomon
ever had such an one for the building the temple at
Jerusalqni; it was five seet ten inches diameter at tha
lower part next the stump, aud four seet eleven inches
diameter at the end of twenty-two seet, after-.which it
lessened for a while, and then parted into branches. —
It was not without infinite labour that 1 selled this
tree: I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at
the bottom; 1 was fourteen more getting the branches
and lkabs, and the vatt spreading head ,0s it, cut off',
which I hacked and hewed through with my axe and
hatchet, with inexpreflible labour: After this it cost me
a month to shape it, and dub it to a proportion, and to
something like the bottom of a boat, that it might
swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three
months more to cl.:ar the inside, and work it out fd
as to make an exact boat, of it. This 1 did indeed with-
out fire, by' mere mallet and chissel, and by the dint of
hard labour; till I had brought it to be a very Isind-
lbme
Ilk AttVENTUntS OP fcoBlNSOV CRUSOE. •
some periagua, and big enough to have carried six and
twenty men, and consequently big enough to have ear-*
tied me and all my cargd.
When I had gone through this work, I was extremely
delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger thm
I ever saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree,
in my lise^ many a weary stroke it had colt, you may be
sure, for there remained nothing but to get it into the wa-
ter; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no ques-
tion but I should have begun the madest voyage, arid the
tnoft unlikely to be persormed, that ever was undertaken.
But .all my devices to get it into the water sailed me,
though they cost insinite labour too; it lay about one
hundred yards from the water, and not more ; but the
first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek.
Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to
dig into ti e sursace of the earth, and so make a decli-
vity; this I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of
pains: but who grudge pains that have their deliverance
in view? But when this was worked through, and this
difficulty managed,it was still much as one; for I could
no more stir the cano^than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of the ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to
the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to
the water: Well, I began this work; and when I began
to enter into it, and calculated how deep it was to be
due, how broad, how the ttufftobe thrown out, 1 found,
that by the number of hands 1 had, being none but my
own, it must have been ten or twelve years before I
should have gone through with it; for the shore lay'
hiffh, so that at the upper end it must have been at least
twenty seet deep; so at length, though with great reluc-
tancy, I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too'
late, the folly of beginning a work before we count the
cost, and before we judge rightly of our own strength to
go through with it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year
in tbis place, and kept my anniversary with the same
devotion, and with as.much coinfort, as ever before;
for by a constant stuely, and serious application of the
word
*word of God, and, by the assistance of his grace, I
gained a different knowledge from what 1 had before;
1 entertained different notions of things; 1 looked now
upon the world as a 'thing remote, which I had nothing
to do with, no expectation from, and indeed no desires
about: In a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it,
nor was ever like to have; so 1 thought it looked as we
may perhaps look upon it hereaster, viz. as a place I
had lived in, but was come out of it; qnd well I might
say, as sather Abraham to Dives, between me and thee
there is a great gulph fixed.
. 1n the first place, I was removed from all the wicked-
ness of the world here: 1 had neither the lust of the
flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of lise: I had no-
thing to covet, for I had all I was now capable of enjoy-
ing: I was lord of tne whole manor; or, if 1 pleased, I
might call myself king or emperor over the whole coun-
try which I had possession of: There' were no rivals :—
1 hod no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or com-
mand with me. I might have railed ship loadings of
corn, but 1 had no use tor it; so .1 let as little grow as I
thought enough for my occalion; I had t9rtoises or tur-
tles enough; but now and^/hen one was as much as I
could put to any use: 1 h^ad timber enough to have built
a fleet of ships; I had/ grapes enough to have made
wine, or to have cure^Ji into raisins, to have loaded that
fleet when they had \"<fn built.
But all 1 couki misuse of vws-ali that was valuable:
I had enough to eat, and to supply my wants, and what
was all the rest to me? If 1 killed more flesh than I
could eat, the dog must eat it, -or the vermin: if 1 sowed
more corn than 1 could eat, it must be spoiled: The trees
that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground, I could
make no more use of them than for suel, and that I had
no occasion for, but to dress my food'.
in a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me upon just reflection, that all the good
things of this world are no sarther good to us than
they are for our use; and that whatever we may heap
up indeed to give to others, we enjoy as much as we can
use, and no more. The most covetous griping miser in
the world would have been Cured of the vice of
covetousness,
•covetousness, if he had been in rhy case; for I possessed
infinitely mpre than I knew what to do with. _I had no
room for desire, except it wai of things which I had not,
and they were but trifles, though indeed of great use to
me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well
.gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas!
there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay. I had no man*
ner of business for it; and I often thought with myself,
that I would have given an handsul of it for a gross of
tobacco-pipes, or for a'hand-mill to grind my corn ; nay,
I would have given it all for sixpenny-worth of turnep
and earrot feed out of England* or for an handsul of
peafc and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had
not the least advantage by it, or benesit from it; but there
it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of j
the cave, in the wet season; and if 1 had had the drawer
-sull of diamonds, it had been the same case; and they had'
been of no manner of value to me, because of no use.
: I had now brought my state of lise to be much casier
jn itself than it was at first, and much easier to my mind,
as well as to my body. 1 frequently .sat down to my
meat with thanksulness, and admired the hand of God's
providence, which bad 'Cifcis spread my table in the
wilderness: I learned to look more upon the bright side
of my condition, and loss npo\; the dark side; and to
.consider what d enjoyed, ratherVharJ what I wanted;
and this gave me sometimes luch, *''cret comforts, that I
cannot express.theni-WK&d whieB—*£ake notice of here,
to put those discontented people in mind of it, who can-
not enjoy comfortably what God hath given them, be-
cause they see and covet something that he has not given
them. All our discontents about what we want, ap-
peared to me to spring from the want of thanksulness for
what we have. .
Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubt-
less would be so to any one that should sall into such
distress as mine was; and this was, to compare my pre-
sent condition with what I at first expected it should be;
nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good
providence of God bad not wondersully ordered the ship
to be cast up nearer to the shore,. where I not only
could come at her, but could bring what I got out ot'
her to the Hhore for my relief and comfort; without
which I had wanted tools to work, weapons for desence,
or gunpowder and shot for getting my food.
i spent whole hours, I may say, whole days, in repre-
senting to myself, in the molt lively colours, how I must
have acted, if I had got nothing but of the ship; how I
could not have so much as got any food, except fish and
turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of
them, I must have perished first - that I should have lived,
if I had not perished, like a mere savage: that if I had
killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no way
to flay or open the?n, or part the flesh from the skin and
the bowels, or to cut it up, but must gnaw it with my
teeth, and pull it with my claws, like a beast.
These reflections made me very sensible of the good-
ness of Providence to me, and very thanksul for my. pre-
sent condition, with all ife hardships and misfortunes:
and this part also I cannot but recommend to the reflec-
tion of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, Is any
affliction like mine? Let them consider how much worse
the cases of some people are, and what their case might
have been, if Providence had thought fit.
1 had another reflection which aflisted me also to
comfort my mind with hopes, and this was, comparing
ray present condition with what 1 had deserved, and had
therefore reason to expect from the hand of Providence:
I had lived a dreadsul lise, persectly destitute of the
knowledge arid sear of God: I had been well instruc-
ted by my sather and mother; neither had they been
wanting to me in their early endeavours, to insuse a
religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my
duty, and of what the nature and end of my being
required of me: but alas! salling early into the sea-
saring lise, which of all the lives is the most destitute
of the sear of God, though his terrors are always before
them- I say, salling early into the sea-saring lise, and
into sea-saring company, all that little sense of religion
-which I had entertained, was laughed out of me by my
,nesiirvites; by an hardening despising of dangers, aud
the views of death, which grew habitual to me; by
my long'absence from all manner of opportunities to
converse with any thing but.what was like myselt,
vol.i. e or
'
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
or to hear any thing of what was good, ox tended to-
wards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the
least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the
greatest deliverance I. enjoyed, such as my escape from
Salee, my being taken up by the Portuguese master of
the ship, my being planted so well in Brasil, my receiv-
ing the cargo from England, and the like, I never once
had the word thank God, so much as on my mind, or in
my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so much
thought as to pray to him; nor so much as to say, Lord
have mercy upon me! No, not to mention the name of
God, unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on account of
my wicked and hardened lise past; and when I looked
about me, and considered what particular providences
had attended me, since my coming into this place, and
h w God had dealt bountisully with me; had not only
punilied me less than my iniquity deserved, but had so
plentisully provided for me; this gave me great hopes
that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet
mercies in store for me.
With these reslections I worked my mind up, not pnly
to resignation to the will of God in the present dispo-
sition of my circumstances, but even to a sincere thank-
sulness of my condition ; and that 1, who was yet a living
man, ought not to complain, seeing I. had not the due
punishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies,
which I had no reason to have expected in that place;
that I ought never more to repine at my condition, but
to rejoice, and to give daily thanks sor that daily
bread, which nothing hut a cloud of wonders could have
brought: that I ought to consider I had been sed even
by a miracle, even as great as that of seeding Elijah by
ravens; nay, by a long series of miracles; and that I
could hardly have named a place in the uninhabited part
of the world where 1 could have been cast more to my
advantage: a place, where, as I had no society, which
-was my asfliction on one hand, so 1 found no ravenous
beasts, no surious wolves or tygers, to threaten my
life; no venomous creatures, or poisonous, which i might
have
liave sed on to my hurt, no savages to murder and de-
vour me.
In a word, as my lise was a lise of sorrow one way, so
it was a lise of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to
make it a lise of comfort, but to be able to make my
sense of God's goodness to me, and care over ne in this
condition, be my-daily consolation; and after 1 made a
jult improvement of these things, I went away, and was
'no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that my things, which I
brought on shore for my help, were either quite gone,
or very much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time,
'all but a very little, which I eked out with water a
little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce left any ap-
pearance of black-upon the paper. As long as it lasted,
I made use of it to minute down the days of the month
on which any remarkable thing happened to me; and
first by casting up times past, I remember that there was
a strange concurrence of days, in the various providences
which besel me, and which, if 1 had been superftitiouily
inclined to observe days as satal or fortunate, I might
have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal
of curiosity.
First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke
away from my sather and my friends, an i ran away to
Hull in order to go to sea, the same day afterwards I was
taken by the Sallee man of war, and made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck
of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that lame day of the year
afterwards I made my escape from Sallee in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the
20th of September, the same day I had my lise so mira-
culously saved twenty-six years after, when I was cast
ashore in this island; so that my wicked lise, and soli-
tary lise, both began on a day.
she next thing to my ink's being wasted was that of
my bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the
ship: this 1 had hulbanded to the last degree, allowing
myself but one xake of bread a day, for above a year;
and yet I was quite without bread for a year before I
got any corn of my own; and great reason I had to be
c 2 thankful
thanksul that I had any atall, the getting it being, as has
teen already observed, next to miraculous.
My clothes, too, began to decay mightily. As to linen,
I had none a go d while, except some checquered shirt*
which 1 sound in the chests ot' the other seamen, and
•which I carefully preserved, because many times I could
bear no other clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very
great help to me, that I had, among sill the men'sclothes
of the ship, almost three dozen of shirrs. There were also
several thick watch-coats of the seamen, which were left
behind, but they were too hot to, wear ; and though it is
true> that the weather was so violent hot, that there was
no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite naked; no,
though I had been inclined to it, which I was not; nor
could I abide the thoughts of it, though I was all alone.
One reason why I could not ,go quite naked was, I
could not bear the heat of the sun so vveil when quite
. naked, as with some clothes on; nay, the very heat fre-
quently blistered my skin; whereas, with a shut on, the
air itself made some motion, and whistling under the
shirt, was twofold cooler than without it • no more could
I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the sun with-
out a cap or an hat; the heat of the sun beating with
such violence as it does in that place, would give me the
head-ach presentiy, by darting so directly on my head,
without a cap or hat on, so that I could not bear it ;—
whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go away.
Upon these views 1 began to consider about putting
the sew rags I had, which 1 called clothes, into some
order; 1 had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my
business was now to try if I could not make jackets out
of the great watch-coats which 1 had by me, and with
such-other materials as I had; so I set to work a taylor-
ing, or rather indeed a botching J\ for I made most pite-
ous work of it. However, I made shift to make two or
three waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great
while: as for breeches or drawers, 1 made but sorry shift
indeed, till afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the
creatures that I killed; 1 mean four-footed ones; and I
had hung them up, stretched out with sticks in the sun;
by which means some of them were so dry and hard,.that
they
they were fit for little; but others, it seems, were very
usesul. The sirlt thing I maJe of these was a great cap
sor my head, with the hair on the outside to shoot oss the
rain; and this I persormed so well, that after this 1 made
a suit of clothes wholly of those Ikins; that is to say, a
-waistcoat and breeches open at the knees, and both.
loose; for they were rather wanting to keep me cool,
than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknow-
ledge, that they were wretchedly made; for if 1 was a
bad carpenter, I was a worse taylor. However, they
were such as 1 made a very good shist with; and when
I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the ha'ir of the
waistcoat and cap being outmost, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a deal of time and pains to make me
an umbrella: I was indeed in great want of one, and
had a great mind to make one. 1 had seen them made in
the Brasils, where they are very usesul in the great heats
which are there; and Iselt the heats every jqt as great
here, and greater too, being nearer the equinox. Besides,
as I was Obliged to be much abroad, it was a most use-
sul thing to me, 'as,w<Hl for the rains as for heats. I
took a world of pains at it, and was a great while before
I could make any thing likely to hold. I^ay, after I
thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before
I made one to my mind; but at last I made one that an-
swered indifserently well: the main dissiculty I found
was to make it to let down, 1 could make it to spread;
but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it would aiot
be portable for me any way, but just over my head,
which would not do. However, at last, as I said, I made
one to auswer; I covered it with skins, the hair upwards,
so that it cast off the rain like a penthouse, and kept off
the sun ib effectually, that I could walk out in the hot-
est of the weather, with greater advantage than I could
before in the coolest; and when 1 had no need of it, I
could close it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed, by resigning to the will of God, and
throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his provi-
dence. This made my lise better than sociable; for
when I 'began to regret the want of conversation, I
would ask myself, whether thus converting mutually
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope, I may say, with
even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions, was not
better than the utmost enjoyment of human society in
the world?
1 cannot say, that^ after this, for five years, any ex-
traordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on in the
same course, in the same posture and place, just as be-
fore. The chief thing I was employed in, besides my
yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and
curing my raisins, of both which I always kept up just
enough .to have susficient stock of the year'si provisions
beforehand: I say, besides this yearly labour, and my
daily labour of going out with my gun, I had one la-
bour to make me a canoe, which at last I finished. So
that by digging a canal to it six seet wide, and four seet
deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half a mile.—
As for the first, that was so vastly big, as I made it
without considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how
I should be able to launch it; so never being able to
bring it to the water, or bring the water to it, I was
obliged to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to
teach me to be wiser next time. Indeed the next time,
though I could not get atr.ee proper for it, and was in a
place whe^e 1 could not get the water to it, at any less
distance than, as I have laid, of near half a mile; yet as
I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged
my labour, in hopes of haying a boat to go off to tea at
last.
However, though my little pariagua was finished, yet
the size of it was not at all answerable to the design
which 1 had in view, when I made the first; 1 mean of
venturing over to the Terra Firma, where it was above
forty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my
boat assisted to put an end to that design, and now I
thought no more of it. But as 1 had a boat, my next de-
sign was to make a tour round the island; for as I had
been on the other side, in one place, crossing, as I have
already delcribed it, over the land, lb the discoveries I
made in that journey made me very eager to see the other
parts ot the coast; and now 1 had a boat, I thought of
-nothing but sailing round the island,
For this purpose, and that I might do every thing with
discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to
my boat, and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces
of the ship's sails, which lay in store, and of which I
had a great store by me.
Haying fitted^ny mast and sail, and tried the boat, I
found she would fail very well. Then I made little
lockers and boxes at either end of my boat, to put pro-
visions, necessaries, and ammunition, &c. into, to be kept
dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea; and a little
long hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat, where
I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over
it to keep it dry.
I sixed my umbrella also in a step at'the slern, like a
m,ast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the
sun off me like an awning; and thus 1 every now and
then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never went
sar out, nor sar from the little creek: but at last, being
eager to view the circumserence of my little kingdom, I
resolved upon my tour, and accordingly I vi6tualled my
ftiip for the voyage, putting in two dozen of my loaves
(cakes i mould rather call them) of barley bread; 'an
earthen pot sull of parched rice, a food I eat a great deal
of, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder with
shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of
those which, as I mentioned before, 1 had saved out of
, the seamen's chests: these I took, one to lie upon, and
the other to cover me in the night.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or my captivity, which you please, that 1 set out
on this voyage and I found it much longer than I- ex-
pected; for though the island itlelf was not very large,
yet when I came to the east side of it, I: found a great
ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea,
some above water, some under it; and beyond this a
shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more; so that I
was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double thiat
point.
When I first discovered them, I was <roin<r to eive
over my enterprise, and come back again, not knowing
how sar it might oblige me to go out to sea, and above
all, doubting how. I thould get back again; so I came
a. 4k to
to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of an anchor
with a piece of broken grappling, which J got out of the
lhip.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun; and went
onshore, climbing up an hill, which seemed to over-
look that point, where I saw the sull extent of it, and
resolved to venture.
In my viewing .the sea from that hill where I stood, I
perceived a strong, and indeed a most surious current,
which ran to the east, even came close to the point; and
1 took the more notice of it, because I saw there might be
some danger, that when I came into it, I might be car-
ried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to
make the island again. ' And indeed, had I not gotten
first upon this hill, I believe it would have been so; for
there was the same current on the other lide of the island,
only that it sef off ' at a sarther distance; and 1 saw there
was a strong eddy under the shore; sol had nothing to
do but to get out of the first current, and I should pre-
sently be in an eddy,.,.^ -.!'• "''- ''
1 lay here, however, two days; because the wind,
biowing pretty fresh (E. at S. E. and that being just
contrary to the said current), made a great breach of the
fea upon the point; so that it was not sase for me to
keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to go too
sar off because of the stream.
The third day, in, the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the sea was calm, and I ventured;
but I am a warning-piece again to all rash and ignorant
pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when
even I was not my boat's length from. the shore, but
I sound myself in a great depth of water, and a cur-
rent like a sluice of a milL. It carried my boat along
with it with such violence, that aU I' could do could
not keep her so much as on the edge of it; but I found
it hurried me sarther and sarther out from the eddy,
which was on the left hand. There was no wind stir-
ring to help me, and all that I could do with my pad-
dles signified nothing; and I now began to give my-
felf over for lost; for, as the current was on both sides
the island, I knew. in 'a sew leagues distance, they
fnust join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone;
nor
n6r did I see any poffibilitjr of avoidingit; so that I had
no prospect before me but of perishing; not by the sea,
for that was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I
had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as ,
I could lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a
great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen
pots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast
ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no main
land or island for a thousand leagues at least!
And now 1 saw how easy it was for the providence os
God to make the molt miserable condition that man-
kind could be in, worse. Now I looked back upon my
desolate solitary island as the most pleasant place in the
world, and all the happiness my heart' could wish for
was to be there again. 1 stretched out my hands to it
with eager wishes. Oh happy desart, said I, I shall
never see thee more. Oh miserable creature, laid I, whi-
ther am I going! Then 1 reproached myself with my un-
thanksul temper, ana how 1 had repined at my solitary
condition; and now what would I give to be on shore
there again? Thus we never see the true state of our
condition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries;
nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want
of it; it is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I
was now in, being driven from my beloved island (for
so it appeared tome now to be) into the wide ocean,
almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever
recovering it again. HoweVer, I worked hard, till in-
deed my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my
boat as much to the northward, that is, towards the
side of the current which the eddy lay on, as poffibly
1 could.; when about noon, as the sun passed the me-
ridian, I thought I selt a little breeze of wind in my
sace, springing up from the S. S. E. This cheered my
heart a little, and especially when in about half an hour
more it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By this time
1 was gotten at a frightsul distance from the island ;-^
and, had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I
had been undone another way too; for I had no com-
pass on board, and should never have known how to
have steered towards the-island, if I had but once lost
light of it; but the weatber continuing clear, I applied'
G 5 myself
myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail,
standing away to the north as much as .possible, to get
©ui of the current.
Just as 1 had set my mast and sail, and the boat began
to stretch away, I saw, even by the clearness of the wa-
ter, some alteration of the current was near; for \vhere
the current was so strong, the water was foul; but per-
ceiving the water clear, I found the current abate, and
presently I sound to the east, at about half a mile, a
breach of the sea upon some rocks: these rocks I found
caused the current to part again; and £ts, the main stress
of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-eiist, so the other returned by the repulse of the
rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back again to
the north-west with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought
to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves
just going to murder them, or who have been in such
like extremities, may guess what my present surprise of
joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream
of this eddy; and the wind also freshening, how gladly I
spread my sail to it, running cheersully before the wind,
and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way back
again directly towards the island, but about two leagues
more towards the northward than the current lay, which
carried me away at first; so that when I came near th*
island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it,
that is to say, the other end of the island, opposite to
that which I went out from.
When I had made something more than a league of
way by the help of this current or eddy, I found it was
spent, and saved me no sarther. However, I found that
being between tire two great currents, viz. that on the
south-side, which had hurried me away, and that on the
north, which lay about two leagues on the other side; I
say, between these two, in the west of the island, I found
the water at least still, and running no way; and having
still a breezeof wind sair for me, I kept on steering di- j^j
rectly for the island, though not making such fresh way'
as 1 did before. ,. , -)
About sour o'clock in the evening, being then within CA
3 about (,
about a league of the island, I found the point of the
rocks which occasioned this distance stretching out as is
described before, to the southward, and, casting osf the
current more southerly, had of course made another*
eddy to the north, and this I found very strong, but not
directly setting-the way my course lay, which was due
west, but almost sull north. However, having a frefli
gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north west, and
in about an hour came within about a mile shot'of the
shore, where, it being smooth water, 1 soon got to land.
When I was on shore, 1 sell on my knrfs, and gave
God thanks tor my deliverance, rel'olvilj- to lay aside'
all thoughts of my deliverance by my bo*j and refresh-
ing myself with such things as 1 had, I brought my boat
close to the shore, in a little cove that 1 had espied under
some trees, and laid me down -W sleep, being quite spent-
with the labour and satigue of the voyage.
I was now at a great loss which way to get home with
my boat; I had ran so much hazard, and knew too-
much the case to think of attempting it by the way I
went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean
the west-side) T knew not, nor had I any mind to run
any more ventures: so I only resolved in the morning to
make my way westward along the shore, and to see if
there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in
sasety, so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three miles, or thereabouts, coasting -the shore, I came
to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet, or brook,
\ where I found a convenient harbour fofc my boat, and
where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on
purpose for her. Here 1 put in; and having. stowed my
. boat very sase, I went on shore to look about- me, and
see where 1 wasV
1 soon found 1 had but a little passed by the place
•where 1 had been before, when I travelled on toot to that
shore; so taking nothing out of my boat but my gun
and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hat, I began my
march. The way was.comfortable enough after such a
voyage as I had^been upon, and 1 reached my old bower
in tl,e"evening, where I found every. thing standing as I
•l£st it; for 1 always kept it in good order, being, as I
laid before, my country-house. I got
. I.got over the sence,. and laid me down in the shade
to rest my limbs, for 1 was very weary, and sell asleep;
but judge you, if you Can, that read my story, what a.
surprize I must be in, when I was awaked out of my
sleep by a voice callrogfaie by my name several times,
Kobin, Robin, Robinlon Crusoe, poor Robinson Crusoe!
W hero are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are you ?. Where!
have you been i ',
I, was so dead asleep at first, being satigued with row-
ing' or paddling, .ns it is called, the first part of the day,
and walking the latter part, that I did not awake tho-
roughly; and dozing between sleeping and waking,
thought I dr/jamed^hat somebody spoke to me: but as,
the voice coy$mued'to repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin
Crusoe, at last 5 began to awake more persectly, and was
at first dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost
consternation; but no' tborier' were my eyes open, but I
saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and imme-
diately knew that this was he that spoke to me; for just
in such bemoaning language I bad used to talk to him,
and teach him; and he had learned it so persectly, that
he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my
sace, and cry, Poor Robin Crusoe, where are you ?—
Where have you been? How came you here? and such
things as 1 had taught him.
.However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and
that indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while
before! could compose myself. First, I wasamazed how
the creature got thither, and then how he should just
keep about the place, and no where else; but as I was
well satisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, 1 got it
over; and holding Out my hand, and calling him by his
l)ame, Poll, the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon
my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me,
Poor.Rcbin Crusoe, and, how did I come here? and,
where had 1 been? just as if he had been overjoyed to
see me again; and so 1 carried him home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some
time, and had enough to do for many days to sit still,
and reflect upon' the danger I had been in. 1 would
ha,ve been very glad to have bad my boat again on
my fide of the iiland, but I knew . not how it waa
practicable
practicable to get it about. As to the east side of the
jsland, which I had gone round, 1 knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart would •
shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of it:
and to the other side of the island 1 did not know how
it might be there; but supposing the current ran with
the jjarac force against the thore at the.east, as it passed
hy u on the other, I might run the same risque of being
driven down the stream, and carried by the island, as
I had been before of being carried away from it; so
with these thoughts I contented myself to be without
any boat, though it had been the product of many
months' labour to make it, and of so many more to get
it into the sea.
In this government of niy temper I remained near a
year, lived a-very sedate retired lise, as you may well
suppose; and my thoughts being very much composed,
as to my condition, and sully comforted in reisigning
myself to the dispositions of Providence, I thought 1 lived
really ver3' happily in all things, except that of society.
I irnproved myself, in this time, in all the mechanic
exercises which my necessities put me upon applying'
myself to; and I believe could, upon occasion, have
made a very good carpenter, especially considering how
sew tools 1 had. . . <
Belkles this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in
my earthen-ware, and contrived well enough to make
them with a wheel, which I found insinitely easier and .
better, because I made things round and shapeable, which
before were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think
I never was more vain of my own persormance, or mote
joysul for any thing I sound out, than for my being able
to make a tobacco-pipe: and though it was a very ugiy
clumsy thing when it was done, and only burnt red like
other earthen ware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would
draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it •
for I had always been used to smoke, and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing there:
was tobacco in the iiland ; and afterwards, when 1 search-
ed the ship again, i could not come at any pipes at all.
1n my wicker-ware 1 also improved much, and made
abundance of necessary baskets as well as my invention
site wed
shewed me, though not very handsome, yet convenient?
sor my laying things up in', or setching things home in*
For example, if 1 killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up:
in. a. tree, flay it, and dress it, and cut it in pieces, and
bring it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle; 1
could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece of t>.vo-
of the flesh, which was enough for me,. and bring them-'
home in a b sk t, and leave the relt behind me. Also
large deepb. fltJts were my receivers for my corn, which:
I always rubbed out as bon as it was dry, and cured;:
and kept it in great baskets instead of a granary.
I began now 'to perceive my powder abated consider-
ably ;. and this was a want which it was impossible for
me to supply, and 1 b gan s<rinufly to conlider what t
mult do when I should ha»e no more powder ;: that is to
say, how 1 should do to kill any goats. 1 had, as 1 ob-
ferved in the third year of mv being here, kept a young
kid, and bred uer up tame. I was in hopes of getting
a he kid, but I could not by any mea^s bring it to
pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I could never
find in my heart to kill her, till she died at last of mere
age.
Put being now in the eleventh year of my residence,.
and,- as 1 have said, my ammunition growing low, 1 set
myself to study some art to trap and snare the goats, to
see whether 1 could not catch some of them alive, and
particularly I wanted a she-goat great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them; and
believe they were more than once taken in them; but my
tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and always
found them broken, and my bait devoured.:
At length I resolved to try a pit-sall ; so I dug several
large pits in the earth, in places where I had observed
the goats used to seed, and over these pits I placed hurdles
of my own making too, with a great weight upon them,
and teveral times I.put ears of bailey, and dry rice, with-
out setting the trap; and 1 could easily perceive that the
goats had gone'in, and eaten up the corn, that I could
tee the mark of their seet. At length 1 set three traps
in ope night, and going the next morning, I found them
all standing, and yet the bait eaten<and gone. '1 his was
very dilcouraging ; however, I alteied my trap; and, not
to
to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to see
my traps, I found in one of them a large oki he goat; and,
in one of the other, three kids, a male and two semales.
• As to the old one, 1 knew not what to do with him ; he
was so fierce I durst not go into the pit to him; that is
to say, to go about to bring him away alive, which was
what I wanted. I could have killed him, but that was
not my business, nor would it'answer my end; so I e'en
let him out, and he ran away as if he had been fright-
ened out of his wits; but I did not then know what I
afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a lion. If
I had let him stay there three or Iour days without food,
and then have carried him some water to drink, and then
a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the
kids; for they are mighty sagacious tractable creatures,
where they are well used.
However, for the present 1 let him go, knowing no
better at that time; then 1 went to the three kids; and,
taking them one by one, I t'ed them with strings.toge-
ther; and with some difficulty brought them all home.
It was a good while before they would seed, but
throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and
they began to be tame: and now I found, that if I ex-
pected to supply myself with goats' flesh, when I had no
powder or shot lest, breeding some up tame was my only
way, when perhaps I might have them about my house
like a flock of sheep.
But'then it presently occurred to me, that I must keep
the tame from the wild, or else they would always run
wild when they grew up; and the only way for this was
to have some inclosed piece of ground, well senced either'
with hedge or pale, to keep them up so effectually, that
those within might not break out, or those without
break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands;
yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it,
my first piece of work was to find out a proper piece of
ground, viz. where there was likely to be herbage for
them to e:tt, water for them to drink, and cover to keep
them from the sun.
Those who understand such inclosures, will think I
had very little contrivance when 1 pitched upon a
place very proper for all these, being a plain open piece
of meadow-land or savanna (as our people call it in the
western colonies), which had two or three little drills of
sresh water in it, and at one end was very woody; I say
they will smile at my forecast, when I shall tell them 1
began my inclosing of this piece of ground in such. a-
manner, that my hedge or pale must have been at lead.
two miles about; nor was the madness of it io great as
to the compass; for if it was ten miles about, I was
like to have time enough to do it in; but I did not
consider, that my goats would be as wild in so much
compass, as if they had had the whole island; and I
should have so much room to cliace them in, that I:
should never c:,tch them. • . ...
My hedge was began and carried on, I believe, about
filty yards, when this thought occurred to- me; so 1 pre-
fently stepped stioit, and for the first beginning I resolved
to inclose a piece of about 150 yard? in length, and 100
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as many
as 1 should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock
increased, I could add more ground to my inclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and 1 went to
work with courage. I was about three months hedging
in the first piece; and, till I had done it, 1 tethered the
three kids in the best part of it, and used them to seed as
near me as possible, to make them samiliar; and very
often I would go and carry them some ears of barley, or
an handsul of rice, and feed them out of my hand ; so
that after my inclosure was finished, and I let them loose,
they would follow me up and down, bleating after me
for an handsul of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and a
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all;
and in two years more I had three and forty, besides
several that 1 took and killed for my food; and after
that I inclosed five several pieces of ground to seed them
in, with little pens to drive them into, to take them as
I wanted them, and gates out of one piece of ground
into another.
But this was not all; for now I only had goat's
flesh to seed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing
which indeed in my beginning I did not so much as think
of, and which, whea it came into my thoughts, was
really
teally an agreeable surprise,; for now I set up my dairy,
and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day.—
And as nature, who gives supplies of.food to every crea-
ture, dictates even naturally how to make use of it; so I,
that never milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw butter
or cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a
great many essays and miscarriages, made me both butler
and cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercisully can our great Creator treat his crea-
tures, even in those conditions in which they seem to
be overwhelmed in destruction! How can he sweeten
the bitterest providences, and give us cauie to praise him
for dungeons and prisons! What atabie was here spread
for me in a wilderness, whe^e I saw nothing at first but
to perish for hunger! . ''
It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and
my little samily sit down to dinner. There was my ma-
jesty, the prince and lord of the whole island; I had the
lives of all my subjedts at absolute command; I could
hang, draw, give lise and liberty, and take it away, and
no rebels among all my subjects.
Then to see how like a. king I dined too, all alone,
attended by my servants! Poll, as if he had been my
savourite, was the only person permitted to talk to me.—
My dog, which was now grown very old and crazy, and
found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always
at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side the
table, and one on the other, expecting now and then a
bit from my hand, as a mark of special savour.
But these were not the two cats which 1 brought on
shore at first; for they were both of them dead, and had
been interred near my habitation by my own hands ; but
one of them having multiplied by 1 know not what kind
of creature, these were two which I preserved tame;
whereas the rest ran wild into the woods, and became
indeed troublesome to me at last : for they would often
come into my house and plunder me too, till at last I
was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many.—
At length they left me with this attendance, and in this
plentiful manner I lived; neither could 1 be said to want
any thing but society, and of that, in some time after
this, 1 was like to have too much..
I was
I was something impatient, as I had observed, to havff
the use of my boat, though very loth to run any more
hazard: and therefore sometimes I lat contriving ways
to get her about the island, and at other times 1 sat my-
self down contented enough without her.' But I had a
strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of
the island, where, as 1 have said Sri my last ramble,- I
'went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the
current set, that I might see what I had to do. This in-
clination increased upon me every day, and at length I
resolved to travel thither by land, and following the edge
of the shore, I did so; but had, any one in England been
to meet such a man as 1 was, it mutt either have frighted
them, or raised a great deal of laughter; and as 1 fre-
quently stood still to look at myself, Icould not but smile
at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with
such an equipage, and, in such a dress. Be pleased to»
take a sketch of my figure, as follows :—
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's skin,
-with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the
fun from me, as to shoot the rain off from, running into
my neck; nothing being so hurtsul in these climates as
the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of my thighs; and a pair of
open-kneed breeches of the sime. The breeches were
made of afkin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down
such a length on either side, that, like pantaloons, it
reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes
I had none; but 1 had made me a pair of something., I
scarce knew what to call them, like buskins, to flap over
my legs, and lace on either side \i<e spatterdashes; but
©1 a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of
my clothes.
£ had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of-the lame, instead of
buckles; and in a kind of a frog on either side of
this, insteacl of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw
and a hatchet, one on one side, one on the other. I.
had another belt not so broad, and sastened in the same
manner, which hung over. my shoulder; and at the
end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both.
made
made of goat's skin too; in one of which hung my
powder, in the other my shot. At my back 1 carried
my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my head.
a great clumsy ugly goat's-skin umbrella, but which,
after all, was the most necessary thing 1 had about me,
next to my gun. As for my face, the colour of it was
really not so Mdflato-like as one might expect from a
man not at all caresul of it, and living within nine or
ten degrees of the Equinox. My beard I had once suf-
sered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long;
but as I had both seissars and razors sufficient, I had cut
it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which
I had trimmed intoa large pair of Mahometan^ whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some Turks, whom I saw at
Sallee: for the Moors did not wear such, though the
Turks did. Of these mustachios, or whiskers, 1 will not
say they were long enough to hang my hat upon them;
but they were of length and shape monstrous enough, and
such as in England would have passed for frightsul.
But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure, I had
so sew to observe me, that it was of no manner of con-
sequence; so I say no more to that part, la this kind of~
figure I went my new journey, and was out five or fix
days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to the
place where I first brought ,my boat to anchor, to get up
npon the rocks; and, having no boat now to take care
of, I went over the land a nearer way, to she lame
height that 1 was upon before; when, looking sorward to
the point of the rock which lay out, and which 1 was to.
double with my' boat, as i said above, I was surprized to
see the sea all smooth and quiet; rio ripling, no motion,
no current, any more there tlian in other places.
1 was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved
to spend some time in the observing of Lt, to see if nothing
from the sets of the tide had occasioned it.: but 1 was
presently convinced how it was, viz. that the tide of
ebb'setting from the west, and joining with the current
of waters from some great river on the shore, must be
the occasion of this current; and that, according as the
wind blew more forcible from the west, or from. the
north, this current came near, or went sarther from„
the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went
-up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb bein^
•made, I plainly saw the current again as before, only
that it ran sarther off', being near half a league from the
shore; whereas, in my case, it set close upon the shore,
and hurried me in my canoe along with it, which at
another time it would not have done.
This observation convinced me, that 1 had nothing
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the
tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about the
island again: but when I began to think of putting it
in practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits at the
remembrance of the danger 1 had been in, that I could
not think of it again with any patience ; but, on the con-
trary, I took up another resolution, which was more
sase, though more laborious; and this was, that I would
build, or rather make me another periagua, or canoe;
and sovhave one for one side of the island, and one for the
other. • .< -'
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call
it, two plantations in the island; one my little fortifica-
tion or tent, with the wall about it under the rock, with
the cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged
into several apartments or caves, one within another.—
.One of these, which was the driest and largest, and had
a door out beyond my wall or fortisication, that. ip -to
say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was all
silled up with the large eartht-n pots, of which 1 have
given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great
baskets, which would hold five or six bushels each,
where I laid up my stores of provisions, especially my
corn, some in the ear cut off short frorri the straw, and
the other robbed out with my hand.
A-s for my wall, made, as before, wish long stakes or
piles; thoie piles grew all like trees, and were by this
time grown so big, and spread so very much, that there
was not the least appearance, to any one's view, of any
habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little sarther within
the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of
corn-ground, which 1 kept duly cultivated and sowed,
and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season;
and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more
land adjoining as fit as that. '" "'' Besides
•vi
Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had now a
tolerable plantation there also: For first, 1 had my little
bow.er, as 1 called it, which 1 kept in repair; that is to
say,' I kept the hedge which circled it in, constantly sit-
ted up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in
the inside. I kept the trees, which at first were no tnore
than my stakes, but we're now grown very firm and tall;
1 kept them always so cut, that they might spread and
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable
shade, which they did essectually to my mind. In the
middle of this 1 had my tent always standing, being a
piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that purpose,
and which never wanted any repair or renewing; and
under this 1 had made me a squab or couch, with the
skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft
things, and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our
fea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat
to cover trie; and here, whenever! had occasion to be ab-
sent from my chief ieat, i took up my country habitation.
Acljoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle;
tbafisto say, my goats. And as I had taken an incon-
ceivable <Seal of pains to sence and inclpse this ground, I
was so uneasy to see. it kept entire, lest the goats should
break through, that 1 never left osf, till with insinite la-
bour I had stuck, the outside of the hedge so sull of small
stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather a
pale than an hedge, and there was scarce room to put
an hand through between them, which afterwards, when
those stakes grew, as they al! did in the next rainy season,
made the inclosure strong, like a wall.; indeed stronger
than .any wall.
This will testify for me that 1 was not idle, and that
I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared ne-
ceHary.l't'i' my comfortable support; for 1 considered the
keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand
wouhl' be a living magazine of flesh, nlilk, butter, and
cheese for me, as long as I lived in the place, il it were
to be' sorty' years'; ;ajndthat keeping them in my reach
deperuled entirely upon my persecting my inclosures to
such a degree, that'I might be sure of keeping them
together; which, by this method, indeed 1 so effectually
secured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I
had planted them so very thick, I was forced to pull some
•of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I,
principally depended on for my winter store of raisins,
and which 1 never sailed to preserve very caresully, as the
bett and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and
indeed they were not agreeable only, but physical, whole-
some, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.
As this wasalso about half-way between my other ha-
bitation and the place where I had laid up rrsy boat, I
generally staid and lay here in my way thither; for I
used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all things
about or belonging to her in very good order. Some-
times I went out in her to divert myself, but no more
hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a
stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive
of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the cur-
rents, or winds, or any other accident; but now I come
to a new scene of my lise.
.It happened one day, about noon, going towards my
boat, I was exceedingly surprized with the print of. a
man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to
be leen in the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or
as if I had seen an apparition; I listened, I looked round
me, I could hear nothing, nor see any thing; I went up
to a rising ground, to look sarther. I went up the shore,
and down the shore, but it was all one, I could see no
other impression butthat one. I went to it again to see
if there were any more, and to observe if it might not be
my sancy ;. but there was no room for that, for there was
exactly the very print' of a foot, toes, heel, and every
part of a foot. How it came thither I knew not, nor
could in the least imagine. But after innumerable stutter-
ing thoughts, like a man persectly consused, and out of
/myself, 1'came home to my fortification, not seeling, as
we say, the ground 1 went on, but terrified to the last de-
gree, looking behind me at every two or three steps, mis-
taking every bush and tree, and sancying /every stump
at a distance to be a man; nor is it possible to describe
how many various shapes an affrighted imagination re-
presented things to me in; how many wild ideas were
sormed every moment in my sancy, and what strange
unaccountable
-unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by the
way.'
When I came to my castle, far so I think I called it ever
after this, I fled into it like one pursued : whether 1 went
over by the ladder, as firli contri. ed, or went in at the
hole in the rock, which I called a door, I cannot remem-
ber; for never frighted hare ftVd to cover, or fox to earth,
with more terrdr of mind than I to this retreat.
I had no fleer) that night; the sarther 1 was from the
occasion or my fight, the greater my apprehensions
weTe, which is something contrary to the nature of such
things, and especially to the usual practice of all creatures
in sear. But I was so embarrassed with my own fright-
sul ideRs of the thing, that-I formed nothing but dismal
imaginations to myself, even though 1 was now a great
way off'it. Sometimes 1 sancied it must be the devil;
and reason joined in with me upon this supposition. For
how should any other thing in human shape come into
the place? Where was the vessel that brought them ?—
What marks were there of any other footsteps? And
how was it possible a man should come there? But then
to think that Satan should take human shape upon him,
in such a plarr, where there could be no manner of occa-
sion for it, but to leave the print of his foot behind him,
and that even for no purpose too (for he could not be
sure I should see it), this was an amazement the other
way. I considered that the devil might have found out
abundance of other ways to have terrified me than this
of the single print of a foot. That as I lived quite on
the other side of the island, he would never have been so
simple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou-
fand to one whether I should ever see it <5r not, and in
the sand too, which the first surge of the sea upon an high
wind would have desaced entirely. All this seemed in-
consistent with the thing itself, and with all notions we
usually entertain of the suhtlcty of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue
me out ot all apprehensions of its being the devil. And
I presently concluded, then, that it must be some more
dangerous creature, viz. That it must be some of the
savages of the main land over against me, who had
wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either driven
by
CRUSOE.
ADVENTURES OF
ROBINSON
by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made the
island; and had been on more, but were gone away again
to sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have staid in this deso-
late island, as 1 would have been to have had them. ,
W hile these reflections were rolling upon my mind,
1 was very thanksul in my thought, that I was so happy
as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that they did
not see my boat, by which they would have concluded
that some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps
h.av« searched sarther for me: then terrible thoughts
racked my imaginations about their having found my
boat, and that there were people here; and that if Ib,
I should certainly have them come again in greater num-
bers, and devour me: that if it should happen so that
they should not sind me, yet they would find my inclo-
sure, destroy all my corn, carry away all my flock of
tame goats, and I mould perish at last for mere want.
Thus my sear banished all my religious hope; all that
former contidence in God, which was founded upon
such' wondersul experience, as I had had of his good-
ness,. now vanished; as if he that had sed me by miracle
hitherto, could not preserve, by his power, the provision
which he had made for me b)r his goodness. 1 re-
proached myself with my easiness, that I would not sow
any more corn one year, than would just serve me till
the next season, as if no accident could intervene to pre-
vent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground:
and thi» 1 thought so just a reproof, that I resolved, for
the suture, to have two or three years' corn before-hand,
so that whatever might come, 1 might not perish. for
want of bread.
How strange a chetjuer-work of providence is the
lise of man! And by what secret difsering springs are
the assections. hurried about, as difsering circumstances
present! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate.; .tor
day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we de-
sire what to-morrow we iear; nay, even tremble at the
apprelienlions of. This was exemplified in me at tins
time in the /most lively manner imaginable; for I,
whose only affliction was, 'that 1 seemed banished from
human society-, that j was alone,' circumscribed by the
boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, ami condemned
to what I call a silent lise; that I was as one whom
Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the
living, or to appear among the rest of his creatures; that
to have seen one of -my own species would have seemed
to me a raising me from death to lise, and the greatest
blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing
of salvation, could bellow: I say, that I should now
tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man, and
was r«ady to sink into the ground, at but the shadow, or
silent appearance of a man's having set his foot on the
island.
Such is the uneven state of human lise; and it assord-
ed me a great many curious speculations afterwards,
when I had a little recovered my first surprise. 1 consi-
dered that this was the station of lise the insinitely wife
and good providence of God had determined for me ;—
that as I could not foresee what the ends of divine wisdom
might be in all this, so I was not to dispute his sove-
reignty, 'who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted'
right by creation to govern and dispose of me absolutely
as he thought fit; and who, as I was a creature wSo had
ossended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn
me to what punishment he thought fit; and that it was
my part to submit to bear his indignation, because I had'
finned against him.
I then reflected, that God, who was not only right-
eous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus to
punish and asflict me, so he was able to deliver me; that
if he did not think fit to do it, it was my unquestioned
duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his will.
And, on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in
him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the dictates and
directions of his daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I
may say, weeks and months; and one particular effect of
my cogitations on this occasion I cannot omit, viz. one
morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts
about my danger from the appearance of savages, I found
it discomposed me very much; upon which those words
of the Scripture. came into my thoughts—Call upon me
in the day of trouble, and J will deliver thee, and thou Jhalt
glorify mt, '.''''«
*ol. i: • a Vpdn
Upon this, rising cheersully out of my bed, my heart
was not only comforted, but I was guided and encou-
raged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance. When
I had done praying, 1 took up my Bible, and opening it
to read, the first words that presented to me were—Wail
oii the Lord, and he os good cheer, Und he Jhall strengthen
thy heart; Wait, Isay, on the Lord. 1f is impossible to
express the comfort this gave me; and, in return, I
thankfully laid down the book, and was no more sad, at
.least not on that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and
reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all
this might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this
foot might b the print of my own foot, when.l came on
shore from my boat. This cheered me up a litile too,
and I began to persuade myself it was all a delusion ;—
that it was nothing else but my own foot: and why
might 1 not come that way from the boat, as wsil as I
-was going that way to the boat r Again, 1 considered
also, that 1 could by no means tell for certain where I
had trod, and where I had not; aud that if at lati this
was only the print of my own foot, I had played the part
of those fools who strive to make stories of spectres
and apparitions, and then are themselves frighted at
them more than any body else.
Now 1 began to take courage, arid to peep abroad
again; for 1 had not stirred .out of my Cattle for three
days and nights, so that I began to starve for provision;
sor 1 had little or nothing within doors, but some barley-
cakes and water. Then 1 knew that my goats wanted
to be milked too, which usually was my evening diver-
sion; and the poor creatures were m great pain and in-
convenience for want of it; and indeed it almost spoiled,
some ofthem, and almolt dried up their milk.
Heartening myself, therefore, with the belief that this'
was nothing but the print of one of my own seet (and
so I might be truly laid to start at my own shadow),
I began to go abroad again, and went ta my country-
house to milk my flock; but to see with what sear
I went forward, how often 1 looked behind me, how is
was ready, every now and then, to lay down my ba',V
ket, and run for my lise, it would have made any ,on«^
tave
Ivave thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, of
that I had been lately most terrib'y frighted; and so in-
deed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three days,
and having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder,
and to think there was really nothing in it but my own
imagination but I could not persuade,. myselt. sully of;
this, till I mould go down to the shore again, and fee.
this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and sea.
if there was any similitude or fitness, that I niig'ut he>
assured it was my own foot. Rut when I came to tlu>
place sirst, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid:
up my boat-, I could not possibly be on fhor.z any whtere,'
thereabouts. Secondly, when I came to measure thfr.
mark with my own loot, I found my-foot.not so large by.
a great deal. Both these things filled :ny head withi>e.w.
imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to thq.
highest degree; so that I shook. .vith cold, like one in an
ague, and! went home again, filled with the belief, that-
some man or men had been on shore there; or, in short,
that the island was inhabited', and I' might.be surprised.
before I was aware; and what course.to take for my se-
curity 1 knew nos. ; .
.O what ridiculous: .resolutions men take, when pofr
sessed wit''! sea^pft deprives them of the use of those
me:ins which^rVajfin ossers for. their relief. 'the first-
tiiing 1 propoKjfte myself was, to throw down my in-
closures, rind japst all myte.me cattie wild into the woods,
that the enemy might not riud them, and then frequent
the Island in psaspect os the same, or the like booty ;—
then to the simple thing of digging up my two corn-
fields, that they might not sind such.a grain there, and
Cill to be. prompted to. frequent the island; then to demo-
lish my bower and teas, thafthey might not see anv ves--
tiges of my habitatL>a, and,:bo prompted to look sarther,
iii order to find out the p'erl'oris inhabiting.
These were the subjects of the first night's cogitation,
after 1 was come home again, while the apprehensions
-which had so over-run my mind were frcsh upon me, and
my head was sull of vapours, as above. . Thus tear iof
danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger
itself, when apparent to the eyes; and we find the burden
h2 . of
- o
%
of anxiety greater by much than the evil which we are
anxious about; but, which was worse, than all this, I
had not that relief in this trouble for the resignation I
used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, 1
thought, like Saul, who complained not onlv that the
Philistines were upon him, but that God had forsaken
him; for I did not now take due ways to compose my
mind, by crying to God in my distress, and resting upon
his providence, as I had done before, for my desence and
deliverance; which, if I had done, 1 had, at least, been
more cheersully supported under this new surprile, and
perhaps carried through it with more resolution.
This consuiion of my thoughts kept me waking all
night; but in the morning I sell asleep; and having, by
the amusement of my mind, been, as it were, tired, and
my spirits exhausted, 1 slept very soundly, and awaked
much better composed than I had ever been before. And
now I began to think sedately: and, upon the utmost
debate with myself, I concluded, that this island, which
was so exceeding pleasant, fruitsul, and no sarther from
the main land than as I had seen, was not so entirely
abandoned as I might imagine. That although-there
Were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot, yet that
there might sometimes come boats osf' from the shore,
who, either with design, or perhaps never but when they
were driven by cross winds, might come to this place.
That 1 had lived here fifteen years now, and bad not
met with the least shadow or figures of ahy people be-
fore; and that, if at any time they should be driven here,
it was probable they went away again as soon as ever
they could, seeing they had never thought sit to fix there
upon any occasion, to this time.
That the most 1 could suggest any danger from, was
from any such casual accidental landing of straggling
people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were
driven hither, were here against their wills; so they
made no stay here, but went osf again with all possible
speed, seldom staying one night on shore, lest they should
not have the help of the tides and day-light back again;
and that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider of
some sase retreat, in case I should see any savages land
upon the spot*
Now
Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave
so large, as to bring a door through again, which door,
as I said, came out beyond where my fortification joined
to the rock. Upon maturely considering this, therefore,
I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the same
manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, jolt
where I had planted a double row of trees about twelve
years before, of which I made mention. These trees
having been planted so thick before, there wanted but a
sew piles to be driven between them, that they mould be
thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall
was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and
every thing I could think of to make it strong; having
in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my
arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened my wall to
about ten seet thick, continually bringing earth-out of
my cave, and laying it at trie foot of the wall, and walk-
ing upon it; and through the seven holes 1 contrived t»
plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I got
seven on shore out of the ship; these, I say, I planted
like my cannon, and fitted them into frames that held
them like a carriage, that so 1 could fire all the seven
guns in two minutes time. This wall I was many a
weary month in finishing, and yet never thought myself
sase fill it w.as done. • . - -
When this was done, I stuck all the ground without
my wall, for a great way every way, as sull with stakes
or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to
grow, as they could well stand; insomuch that I believe
I might set in it near twenty thousand of them, leaving a
pretty large space between them and my wall, that I
might have room to see an enemy/ and they might have
no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to ap-
proach my outer wall.
Thus, in two years time, I had a thick grove and in
five or sis years time I had a wood before my dwelling,
grown so monttrous thick and strong, that it was in-
deed persectly impassable; and no man, of -what kind
soever, would ever imagine that there was any thing
beyond it, much less an habitation. As for the way I
proposed myself to go in and out (for L lest no avenue),„
u a -it
it was by setting two ladders; one to a part of the
Zrock which was low, and then broke in, and left r6om
to [dace another ladder upon that; so when the two
ladders were taken down, no man living could come
down to me without milchiefmg himself; and if they
had come down, they were iiill on the outside of my
outer wall.
Thus 1 took all the measures human prudence could
suggest ibr my own preservation; and it wiil be seen at
length, that they were not altogether without just rea-
son; though I foresaw nothing at that time more than
roy mere sear suggested.
While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of
rny other affairs; for 1 bad a great concern upon me for
my little herd of goats; they were not only a present
supply to me upon every occasion, and began to be suf-
ficient to me, without the expence of powder and shot,
but also abated the satigue of my hunting alter the wdd
nnes; and I was loath to lose the advantage of them,
and to have them all to nurse up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
think but of two ways to preserve them ; one was to find
another convenient place to dig a cave under ground,
and to drive them into it every night; and the other
was to inclose two or three little bits of land, remote
from one another, and as much concealed as I could,
where I might keep about half a dozen young goats in
each place , so that, if any disaster happened to the flock
in genera), I might be able to raise them again with
little trouble and time; and this, though it would re-
quire.a great deal of time and labour, I thought was the
roost rational design.
Accordingly 1 spent some time to find out the most
retired parts of the island, and 1 pitched upon one, which
was as private indeed as my heart could wish; for it was
a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the hol-
low and thick woods, where it is observed, I almost
lolt myself once before, endeavouring to come back
that way from the eallern part of the island. Here I
found a clear piece of land of near three acres, so lur-
rounded with woods, that it was almost an inclosure by
nature; at least it did not want near so much labour to
make
mslce it so as the other pieces of ground I had worked so
hard at.
1 immediately went to work with this piece of ground,
and in less than a month's time I had Ib senced it round,
that my- flock or herd, call it whichiyou please, which
were not so wild now 'as at first they might be supposed
to be, were well enough secuied in it. So without any
sarther delay, 1 removed ten she-goats and two be-goats
to this piece; and when theie, 1 continued to persect
the sence, till I bad made it as secure as the other, which',
.however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more
time by a great deal.
All this labour I was at the expence of purely from
my apprehenlions on the account of the print of a man's
foot, which 1 had seen; for as yet, I never saw any hu-
man crea ure come near the island, and 1 bad now lived
two years under these uneasinesses, which indeed made
my lise much less comsortable than it was before; as-
may well be imagined, by any -who know what it
is tq live in the constant snare of the sear of man; and
this I must observe with grief, too, that the discomposure
of my mind had too great impressions also upon the reli-
gious part of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of
salling into the hands of savages aud cannibals lay so
. upon my spirits, that I seldom sound myself in a due
temper tor application tp my Maker; at least, not with
the sedate calmness and resignation of foul which I was
wont to do. 1 rather prayed to God as under great af-
fliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger,
and in expectation every night oi being murdered and de-
voured before the morning; and I must testify, from my
experience, that a temper of peace, thanksulness,-love,
and afsection, as much more the proper frame for prayer
than that of terror and discomposure; and that, under
the dread os rcischief impending, a man is no more fit
for a comforting persormance ofthe duty of praying to
God, than he is for repeptance on a tick bed; for these
discomposures afsect the mind as the others do the body;
and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as
great a,disability as that ofthe body, and much greater,
praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not
ofthe body.
H 4 Eut
But to go on. After I had thus secured one part of
my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place, to make such ano-
ther deposit; when, wandering more to the west point of
the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to
sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great dis-
tance; I had found a perspective glass or two in one of
the seamen's chelis, which I saved out of our ship; but
I had it not about me, and this was so remote, that I
could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it
till my eyes were not able to look any longer; whether
it was a boat or not, I do not know; but as I descended
from the hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over;
only I resolved to go no more without a perspective glass
in my pocket.
When I was comedown the hill, to the end of the
island, where indeed I had never been before, 1 was pre-
sently convinced, that the seeing the print of; a man's
foot, was not such a strange thing in the island as 1 ima-
gined; and, but that it was a special Providence that I
was cast upon the side of the island, where the savages
never came, I should easily have known, that nothing
was more frequent than for the canoes from the main,
when they happened to be a little too sar out at sea, to
shoot over to that side of the-island for harbour; like-
wise, as they often met, and fought in their canoes, the
victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring them
over to this share, where, according to their dreadsul
customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat
them; of which hereafter.
When 1 was come down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being the S. W. point of the island, I was. per-
sectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me
to express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore
spread with Ikuils, hands, seet, and other bones of hu-
man bodies; and particularly I observed a place where
there had been a sire made, and a circle dug in the earth,
like a cock-pit, where it is supposed the savage wretches
had sat down to their inhuman seastings upon . the bodies
of their sellow-creatures.
. 1 was so astonished with the sight of these things, that
I entertained no notions of any danger to myself from
it,
it, for a long while; all my apprehensions were buried-
in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish bru-
tality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human na-
ture which, though I had heard of often-, yet I never
had so near a view of before y in stiort, I turned away-
my sace from the horrid spectacle;. my stemach grew
fiek, and I was just at the point ©f sainting, whennaturer
discharged the 'disorder from my stomach, and, having;
vomited with an uncommon violence, I was ai little
relieved, but could not bear to stay in the place a mo—
ment; so I got me up the hill again; with all the speed
I could, and walked on towards my own habitation..
When I came a little out of that part of the island,.
I stood still awhile as amazed; and then recovering;
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my
foul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God
thanks, that had ca* my first lot in a part of the world?
where I was distinguished from such dreadsul creatures,
as these; and that though I had esteemed m.y present
condition very miserable, had yet given me so many
comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks for
fhan to complain of; and this above all, that I had,
even in this miserable condition, been comforted with
the knowledge of himself, and the hope of his bless-
ing, which was a selicity more than susficiently equi-
valent to all the misery which I had suffered, os could
susser.
In this srame of thanksulness, I went home to. mjr-
Caftle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
sasety of my circumstances, than ever I was before;. so*
I observed, that these wretches never came to. this.
island in search of what they could get; perhaps not
feeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any thing here;
and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered
woody pact of it, without finding any thing to. theit
purpose: I knew I had been here now almost eighteen
years, and never saw the least footsteps of ai human!
creature there before; and might be bete eighteen
more as entirely concealed as 1 was now, if I did not
discover myself to them, which I had no manner of
occasion to do, it being my only business to keep my-
self entirely concealed where I was, unless X found a.
h 5 -• better
better fort of creatures than cannibals to make myself
known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eating
one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and
kept close within my own circle for almost two years
after this; when I say my own circle, I mean by it my
three plantations, viz. my Castle, my country-seat,
which I called my bower, and my inclosure in the
woods; nor did 1 look after this for any other use than
as an inclosure for my goats; for the . aversion which
nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such, that
I was as searsul of seeing them, as of seeing the devil
himself; nor did I so much as go to look after my boat
in all this time, but began rather to think of making
me another; for I could not think of ever making any
more attempts to bring the other boat round the island
to me, lest I should meet with some of those creatures .at
sea, in which, if I had happened to have sallen into their
hands, I knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satissaction I had that 1 was
in no danger of being discovered by these people, began
to wear off my uneasiness about them; and 1 began to
live just in the same composed manner as before; only
with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept
my eyes more about roe than 1 did before, lest I should
happen to be seen by any of them; and particularly, 1
was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them
on the ifland should happen to hear it; and it was there-
fore a very good providence to me, that I had surnished
myself with a tame breed of goats, that 1 had no need
to bunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them;
and if I did catch any more of them aster this, it was
by traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for
two years after this, I believe, I never fired my gun
once eff, though I never went out without it; and,
which was more, .as I had saved three pistols out of the
sliip, 1 always carried them out with me, or at least
two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt; 1 like-
wise burnished up one of the great cutlasses that 1 had
out of the sh p, and made me a belt to put it in also;
so
so that I was now a most formidable sellow to look at,
when I went abroad, if you add to the former descrip-
tion of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a great
broad sword, hanging at rny side in a belt, but without
a scabbard. '• - .
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time,
I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my
sormer sedate way of living; all these things tended
to mew 'We more and more how sar my condition was
irom being miserable, compared to some others; nay,
to many other particulars of lise which it might have
pleased God tp have made my lot. It put me upon
reflecting, how litt'e repining there would be among
mankind, at any condition with those that are worse in
order to be thanksul, than be always comparing them
with those which are better, to assist their murmurjngs
and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really-
many things which 1 wanted, so indeed I thought that
the frights I had been in about these savage wretches,
and the concern 1 had been in for my own preservation
had taken ofs the edge of my invention for my own con-
veniencies, and 1 had dropped a good design, which I had
once bent my thoughts upon; and that was, to try if I-
could not make some of my barley into malt, and then
try to brew myself lbme beer; this was really a whim-
sical thought, and 1 reproved myself often for the sim-
plicity of it; for I presently saw there would be the
want of several things necessary to the making my beer%
that it would be impossible for me to supply; as first,
casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have
observed already, 1 could neve/ compass; no, though
1 spent not many days but weeks, nay months, in at-
tempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I
had no hopes to make it keep, no yeast to make it work,
no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet had not all
these things intervened, I mean the frights and terrors
I was in about the savages, I had undertaken it, and
1wrhaps brought it to pass too; for 1 seldom gave any
thin"- over without accoirplishing it, -when I once had
it inmy head enough to begin it.
h 6 But
IJut my invention now ran quite another way; for
night and day I could think of nothing hut how I might
destroy some of these monsters in their cruel bloody
entertainment; and if possible, save the victim they
should bring hither to destroy. It would'fake up a larger
volume than this whole work is intended to- be, to
set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded
\ipon in my thoughts, for the destroying these iCjfeatures,
or at least frightening them, so as to prevent tnfflr com-
ing hither any more; but all was abortive, nothing
could be possible to take etf'ect, unless I was to be there
to do it myself; and what could one man do among
them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of
them together, with their darts, or their bows and ar-
rows, with which they could shoot. as true to a mark as
I could with my gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place
where they made their fire, and put in five or six pounds
of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their fire,
would consequently take fire, and blow up all that wa»
near it; but, as in the first place 1 mould be very loath
to waste so much powder upon them, my store being
now within the quantity of a barrel; so neither could I
be sure of its going off at any certain time, when it might
surprise them; and, at best, that it would little more
than just blow the fire about their ears, and fright them,
but not sufficient to make them forsake the place; so I
laid it aside, and then proposed, that I would place my-
self in ambufo, in some convenient place, with ray three
guns all double loaded, and in the middle of their bloody
ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kilt
or wound perhaps two or three at every shot; and then
salling in upon them with my three pistols, and my
sword, I make no doubt but that, if there were twenty,,
1 should kill them all; this sancy pleased my thoughts
for some weeks, and I was so sull of it that 1 often
dreamt of it; and sometimes* that I was just going to*
let fly at them in my sleep.
I went so sar with it in my indignation, that I em-
ployed myself several days to find out proper places to
put myself in ambuscade as I said, to watch for them j
and 1 went frequently to the place itself, which was
now
now grown more familiar to me; and especially while
my mind was thus filled with thoughts of reverse, and
of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the
sword, as I may call it; but the horror I had at the
place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches de-
vouringone another, abated my malice. —
WelLat length I found a place in the fide of the hill,
-where J§||as satissied I might securely wait tii! i saw any
of the Belts coming, and might then, even before they
would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen
into thickets of trees, in one of which th re was a
hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and where
I might sit, and observe all their bloody doings, and
take my sull aim at their heads, when they were Ib close
together, as that it would be next to impossible that I
should miss my thot, or that 1 could tail wounding three
or four of them at the first shot. i
In this place then I resolved to fix my design; and
accordingly I prepared two muskets, and my ordinary
fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace
of'slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about
the size of pistol bullets, and the fowling-piece I loaded
with near a" handful of swan-shot, of the largest fizej:
I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each ;.
and in this posture, well provided with ammunition for
a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my
expedition.
After 1 had thus laid the scheme for my design, and
in my imagination put it in practice, I continually made
my tour every morning up to the top of the bill, which
was from my Castle, as I called it, about three miles or
more, to see if I.could observe any boats upon the lea,
coming near the island, or standing over towards it ;. but
I began to tire of this hard duty, after I had sot two or
three months constantly kept my watch; but came al-
ways back without any discovery, there having not in alt
that time been the least appearance, not only on or near
the shore, hut not on the whole ocean, so sar as my eyes
or glasses could reach every way.
As long as I kept up my daily tour, to the hill to
lookout, so long also I kept up the vigour of my de-
sign, and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a suit-
able
able frame, for so putragequssan executi,cfl,..as.tb.e kill-
ing twenty or thirty nakedjfavages tor. an offence,' which
I had not at all entere<\ into a^'cn/lion of in my thoughts,
any surther than my passions were.. at sirst. fired by the
horror 1 conceived at .the -^unnatural cutfqm of the
people cf that country, who, it. seems, had been fyffered
by Providence, in his wise disposition. of the world, to
have no other guide than that of their own ajMsmiiKibie
and vitiated passions; and consequently werwpKt, and
perhaps had been for some ages, to act: such horrid
things, and receive such dreadsul customs, as nothing
but nature, entirely'abandoned of Heaven, and actuated
by some hellish degeneracy, could have run'them into i
but now, when, as I have said, 1 began to be weary of
the fruitless excursion which I had made so long, and
so sar, every morning in vain; so my opinion of the
action itself began to alter, and 'I began with cooler
and calmer thoughts to consider what it was I was go-
ing to engage in; what authority or call I had, to pre-?
tend to be iudge 'and executioner upon these men as
criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit for so many
ages to susser, unpunished, to go ony and to be, as it
were, the executioners of his judgments upon one an-
other; also how sar these people were offenders against
me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of
that blood which they shed promiscuously one upon an-
other; 1 debated this very often with myself thus: how
do I know what God himself judges in this particular
case? It is certain these people do not commit this as a
crime; it is not against their own consciences reproving,
or their light reproaching them. They do not know it
to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of di-
vine juttice, as we do in almost all the sins we commit.
They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken
in war, than we do to' kill an ox; nor to eat human.
flesh, than we do to eat mutton.
When t had considered this a little, it followed necessa-
rily, that 1 was certainly in the wrong in it; that these
peop'.e were not murderers in the sense that I had be-
fore condemned them in my thoughts, anymore than
those Christians were murderers, who often put to
death the prisoners taken ip battle, or more frequently,
upon
upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to the
sword, without giving quarter, though they threw
down their arms and submitted..'
In the next place it occurred to me that albeit the
usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in-
human, yet it was really nothing tome; these people
had done me no injury; that if they attempted me, or
1 saw it necessary for my immediate preservation to sall
upon them, something might be said for it; but that
I was yet out of their power, and they had really no
knowledge of me, and consequently no design upon me;
aud therefore it could not be juit for me to sall upon
them; that this would justify the conduct of the Spa-
niards, in all their barbarities practised in America,
where they destroyed millions of these people, who,
however they were idolaters and barbarians, and had
several bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such
as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as
to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the
rooting them out of the country is spoken of with the
utmost abhorrence and detestation even by the Spani-
ards themselves, at this time, and by all other Christian
nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and
unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God
or man; and such, as for which the very name of a
Spaniard is reckoned to be frightsul and terrible to all
people of humanity, or of Christian compassion; as if
the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the
product of a race of men, .who were without principles
of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the
iftiserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of a generous
temper in the mind^
These considerations really put me to a pause, and to
a kind of a sull stop; and 1 began by little and little to
be off' of my design, and to conclude I had taken wrong
measures- in my resolutions to attack the savages; that
it was not my business to meddle with them, unless they
first attacked me, and this it was my business, if possible,
to prevent; but that, if I were discovered and attacked,
then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely
to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to kill
t 'every
every one that not only should be on shore at that time,
but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one
of them escaped to tell their country-people what had
happened, they would come over again by thousands to
revenge the death of their sellows; and I should only
. bring upon myself a certain destruction, which at present
I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole I concluded, that neither in principles
nor in policy, I ought one way or oth?r to concern myself
in this affair; that my business was, by alt possible means
to conceal myself from them, and not to leave the least
signal to them to guess by, that there were any living
creatures upon the island; I mean, of human ftape.
Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was con-
vinced now many ways, that 1 was persectly out os my
duly, when I was raying all my bloody schemes for the
destruction of innocent creatures; I mean innocent as:
to me; as to the crimes they were guilty of towards
one another, I had nothing to do with them; they were-
national punishments to make a just retribution for
national offences; and to bring public judgments upon
those who offend in a public manner, by such ways as
best please God.
This apeared to me Co clear now, that nothing was a
greater satisfaction to me, than that I had not been suf-
sered to do a thing, which I now saw so much reason
to believe would have been no less a fin than that o£
wilsul murder, if I had committed it; and I gave most
humble thanks on my knees to God that had fhus.de-
Kvered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to.
grant me the protection of his providence, that I might
not sall into the hands of barbarians; or that I might
not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear
call from Heaven to.do it, in desence of my own lise.
In this disposition I continued for near a year after,
tbis; and so sar was I from desiring an occasion for sall-
ing upon these wretches, that in all that time I never
once went up the hill to see whether there were any of
them in sight, or to know whether any of them: had beenu
on shore there, or not; that I might not be tempted to.
renew any of my contrivances against them, or be pro—.
vok«d by any advantage which might present itself, to.
sall upon them; only this I did, I went and removed
my boat, which I had on the other fide of the island, and
carried it down to the east end of the whole island, where
I ran it into a little cove, which I found under some high.
rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the
savages durst not, at least would not come with their
boats, upon any account whatsoever.
With my boat I carried away every thing that I had
left there belonging to her, though not necessary for the
bare going thither; viz a mast and sail, which I had made
for her, and a thing like an anchor, but indeed, which
could not be called either anchor or grappling; however,
it was the best I could make of its kind. All these I re-
moved, that there might not be the least shadow of any
discovery, or any appearance of any boat, or of any
habitation upon the is and.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than
ever; and seldom went from my cell, other than upon
my constant employment, viz. to milk my she-goats,
. and manage my little flock in the wood; which, as it
was quite on the other part of the island, was quite out .
of danger; for certain it is, that these savage people,
'who sometimes haunted this island, ne^er came with any
thoughts of sinding any thing here, and consequently
never wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not, but
they might have been several times on shore, after my
apprehensions of them had made me.cautious, as well
as before; and indeed, 1 looked back with some horror
upon the thoughts of what my condition would have
been, if 1 had chopped upon them, and been discovered
before that, when naked anu unarmed, except with one
gun, and that loaded often only with small shot. I
walked every where, peeping and peering about the
island, to see what 1 could get; what a surprise should
I have been in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's
soot, I had instead of that seen sifteen or twenty savages,
and found them pursuing me, and, by the swiftness of
.their running, no possibility of my escaping them L
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very foul
-within me, and diltrefled my mind so much, that 1.could
pot soon recover it; to think what 1 should have done,
an4 how I not only should not have been able to resill
, them*
them, but even .should net have had presence of mind
enough to do what I might have done; much less, what
now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might
be able to do. Indeed, afteT serious thinking of these
things, I would be very melancholy, and sometimes it
would last a gn at while; but I resolved it at last all into
thanksulness to that Providence which bad delivered me
from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from
those mischiess, which 1 could no wv.y have been the
agent in delivering myself from; because I had not- the
least-notion os any such thing depending, or the least
supposition of its being possible. ,'
i bis renewed contemplation, which often had come
to my thoughts in former time, when sirst I began
to see the mercisul dispositions of Heaven, in the dan-
gers u?e run through in th'isdise; how wondersully we-
are delivered when we know nothing of it; how when
we are in a quandary, as we call it, a doubt or hesita-
tion-, whether to go this way, or that way, a secret,
hint shall direct us this way, when we intended to go,
another way; nay when sense, our own inclination,.and
perhaps business, has called to go the other way, yet a
strange impression upon the mind, from we know not
what spring, and by we know not what power, shall
over-rule. us to go this way; and it shall afterw-ards
appear, that had we gone that way, which we would have
gone, and even to our imagination- ought to have gone,
we should have been ruined and lost; u-pon ihese, and
many like reflections, I afterwards ma<le it a certain
rule with me, that whenever 1 found those secret hints,
or pressings of my mind, to doing or riot doing any
thing that presented, or to going this way or that way,
I never sailed to obey the secret dictate; though I knew
no other reason for it, than that such a prefluFe, or such a
hint, hung upon my mind; I could give many exam-
ples of the success of this conduct in the course of my
lise; but more especially in the latter part of my inha-
biting this unhappy island; besides many occasions
which it is very likely I might have taken notice of, if
I had seen with the same eyes then, that 1 saw with now;
but it is never too late to be wise; and 1 cannot bul; ad-
vise all considering men, whole lives are attended with
such
such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though
not so extraordinary, not to. ssight such secret intima-
tions of Providence, let them come from what invisible
intelligence they will; that I snail not discuss, and per-
haps cannot account foi>; but certainly they are a proof
of the converse of spirits, and the secret' communica-
tion between those embodied and those unembod.ed;
and such a-proof as can never be withstood; of whicli I
shall have occasion to give some very remarkable in-
stances, in the remainder of my solitary residence in
this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it strange, if
I consess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I
lived in, and the concern that was now upon me, put
an end. to all invention, and to all the contrivances
that I had laid for my future accommodations and
conveniences. I had the care of my sasety more now
upon my hands, than that of my food. 1 cared not
to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for sear
the noise I should make should be heard; much less
•would I fire a gun, for the fame season; and above
all, 1 was very uneasy at making any sire, lest the
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day,
-should betray me; and for this reason I removed that
part of my business, which required fire, such as burn-
ing ot pots and pipes, &c. into my new apartment in
the wood; where, after I had been some time, I found,
to my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave
in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I
dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it,
would be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would
any man elie, but one who, like me, wanted nothing
so much as a sase retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where, by mere accident, I would say, if
I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe all such
things now to Providence1, I was cutting down some
thick branches of trees to make charcoal; and before
I go on, I must observe the reason of my making this
charcoal which was thus: ,,
I was afraid of making a smokd about my habita*
tion, as I said before;' and yet I could not live there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c. so I
contrived
contrived to burn some wo id here, as I had seen done in
England under turs, till it became chark, or dry coal;
and then putting the fire out, 1 preserved the coal to
carry home, and persorm the other services, which fire
was wanting for at home, without danger of smoke.
But this by the bye; while I was cutting down some
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch
of low brush-wood, or underwood, there was a kind
of hollow place; I was curious to look into it, and
getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it
was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to
stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me; but
1 must consess to you, I made more hatie out than I did in;
when looking surther into the place, which was persectly
dark, 1 saw two broad shining eyes of some creature,
whether devil cr man, I knew not, which twinkled like
two stars, the dim light from the cave's mouth shining
directly in and making the reflection.
However, after some pause, 1 recovered myself, and
began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell myself,
that he that rwas afraid to see the devil, was not tit to
1ive twenty years in an island all alone, and that I durst
to believe there was nothing in this cave that was more
frightsul than myself; upon this plucking up my cou-
rage, I took up a large firebrand, and in I rushed again,
with the stick flaming in my hand: I had not gone
three steps in, but I was almost as much frightened as
I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of
a man in some pain; and it was followed by a broken
noise, as if of words half expressed, and then a deep
sigh again; 1 stepped back, and was indeed struck with
such a surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat;
and if I had had a hat on my head, I wii! not answer 'or
it, that my hair might not have listed it off. But still
plucking up my spirits as well as 1 could, and encou-
raging myself a little, with considering that the power
and presence of God was every wheœ, and was able to
protect me; upon this I stepped forward again, and by
the light of the firebrand, holding it up a litle over
my head, I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous
frightsul old he-goat, just making his will, as we say*
gaiping for lise, apd dying indeed of a mere old age.
I stirred
I stirred him -a little, to see if I could get him out, and
he assayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself;
ssnd I thought with myself, he might e'en lie there; for
if he had frightened me so, he would certainly fright any
or the savages, if any- of them should be so hardy as to
come in there, while he had any life in him.
• 1 was now recovered from my surprise, and began to
look round me, when I found the cave was but very
small ; that is to sav, it might be about'twelve seet over,
but in no manner of shape, either round or square, no
bands having ever been employed in making.it but thole
of mere nature. I observed also, that there was a place
at the sarther side of it that went in sarther,' but so low,
that it required me to creep upon my bands and knees to
get into it, and whither it went I knew not; so having
no candle, 1 gave it over for some time, but resolved to
come again the next day, provided with candies and a
tinder-box, which I had made of the lock os'one of the
muskets, with some wild fire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six
large candles of my own making, for I made very good
candles now of goat's tallow; and, going into this low*
place, I was obliged to creep. upon all fours, as I have
said, almost ten yards; which, by the way, 1 thought
was a venture bold enough, considering that 1 knew not
how sar it might go, or what was beyond it. When I
•was got through the llreight, I found the roof rose higher
up, I believe near twenty seet; but never was such a
glorious sight seen in the island, I dare fay, as it was, to
look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave. The
walls reflected an hundred thousand lights to me from my
I two candles. What it was in the iock, whether diamonds,
or any other precious stones, dr gold, which 1 rather sup-
posed it to be, I knew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or
grotto, of its kind, as-could be expected, though per-
fectly dark. The floor was dry and levels and had a sort
of small lobse gravel upon it; so that there was no nau-
seous creature to be seen; neither was there any damp
or wet on the fides of the roof. The only disficulty in
it was the entrance, which, however, as it was a place
of security, and such a retreat as 1 wanted, I thought
0 that
that was a convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at
the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring
some of those things, which I was mo.ll anxious about,
to this place; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my
magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz. two
fowling-pieces (for I had three In all) and three muskets
(for of them I had eight in all) ; so I kept at my Caltle
only five, which stood ready mounted, like pieces of
cannon, on my outmost sence; and were ready also to
take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I
was obliged to open the barrel of powder which 1 took
up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and I found
that the water had penetrated about three or four inches
into the powder on every side, which, caking and grow-
ing hard, had preserved the inside like a kernel in a-shell;
so that I had near sixty pounds os very goad powder in
the centre of the cask; and this was. an agreeable disco-
very to me at that time; sol carried all away thither,
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with.
pie in my Castle, for sear of a surprise of any kind. I
also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.
1 sancied myself now like one. of the ancient giants,
who were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks,
where none could come at them; for I persuaded myself,
while I was here,. if five hundred. savages were to hunt
pie,'they .could never find me. out; or .if they did, they
would n<-t venture to attack me here. ,
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the,
mouth of the cave, the next day after 1 made. this disco-
very; and 1 found it much easier. tp.dig a great hole
there, and throw..him \n, and .cover. him with earth, .than

1 was now in. my twenty third year of residence in this
island, and was so naturalized to.^he, place, and to the
Planner of living, that cquhl j( hare but enjoyed, the cer-
tainty that no savages would qome to tfye place to disturb

, j . ?. and
and amurements, which made the time pass more plea-
santly with me a great deal than it did before; as, first, I
had taught irly Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he
did it so samiliarly, and talked so articulately and plain,
that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived with me no
lei's than six and twenty years: How long he might live
afterwards, [ knew not; though I know they have a no-
tion in the Brasils, that they live an hundred years; per-
haps feme of my Polls may be alive there still, calling
after poor Robin Crusoe to this day. 1 wish no English-
man the ill luck to come there and hear them; but if he
did, he would certainly believe it was the devil. My
dog was a very pleasant and loving~comp«'.nion to me for
no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died ot'
mere old aje. As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have
observed, to that degree, that 1 was obliged to sboot seve-
ral of them at firit, to keep them from devouring me, and
all 1 had; but at length, when the two old ones I
brought with me were gone, and after some time conti-
nually driving them from me, and letting them have no
provision with me, they all ran wild into the woods, ex-
cept two or thiee savourites, which 1 kept tame, aud
whose young, when they -had any, 1 always drowned, and
these were part of my family. Besides these,'! always
kept two or three household kids about me, which I taught
to seed out of my hand; and I had also more parrots,
which talked pretty well, and would all call Kobin Cru-.
soe, but none like my sirst: nor, indeed, did 1 take the
pains with any of them that I had done with him. I had
also several tame seq-fowls, .whose names 1 know not,
which I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and
the little stakes^ which 1 .had planted before my castle
wall, being. now grown up to a good thick grove, these
sowls all 1ived among these low trees, and bred there,
wjiich .was verj? agreeable tOiine ; to that, as I said above,
I began to be yeuy yssH contented with the lise I led, if it
neighs but have b^en seeu/ed.frpm the dread of savages.
But it was otherwise directed; and it might not be
amiss' 'tor ,yepySjp wjhp Jhall.meet with my story, to*
roake^b^jult observation fi'pm it*.viz. How frequently,
in the course .e^yutyliy^s,, the .evil, which in jtjelf \\<n
leek iDpif .to shun, and which, wrien we are fallen into,
is the most dreadsul to us, is oftentimes the very means
or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be
railed again from the asfliction we are sallen into. I
could give many examples of this in the course of my
unaccountable lise; but in nothing was it more particu-
larly remarkable, than' in the circumstances of my last
years of solitary residence in this island.
It was now the month of December, as I said above,
in my twenty-third year; and this being the southern
solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was the particular
time ot' my harvest, and required my being pretty much
abroad in the fields; when, going out pretty early in the
morning;, even before it was thorough day-light, I wa»
surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore,
at a distance from me ot about two miles, towards the
end of the,island, where 1 had observed some savages had
been, as before, but not on the other side; but, to my
great affliction, it was on my side of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest 1 might
be surprised; and yet I had no more peace within, froni
the apprehensions I had, that if these savages, in ramb-
ling over the island, should find my corn standing, or
cut, or any of my works and improvements, they would
immediately conclude, that there were people in the
place, and would then never give over till they found me
out. In this extremity I went back directly to my Castle,
and pulied up the ladder after me, having made all things
without look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a
posture of desence. I loaded all my cannon, as 1 called
them, that is to say, my muikets, which were mounted
npon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and re-
solved to desend myself tp the last gatp^ not forgetting
seriously to recommend myself to the dWine protection,
and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the
hands of the barbarians; and in this posture I continued
about two hours, but began to be mighty impatient for
intelligence abroad, for 1 had no spies te send out.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
sliould do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting in
ignorance
ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of
the kill, where there was a flat place, as I observed be-
fore, and then pulling the ladder -up after me, I set it up
again, and mounted to the top of the hill; and'pulling
out my perspective-glass, which I had taken on purpose,
I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and be-
gan to look for'-the place; I presently found there were
no less than nine naked savages sitting round a small fire
they had made; not to warm them, for tkey had no tiecd
of that, the. weather being extreme hot; but, as I sup-
posed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human
flesh, which they had brought with them, whether ali^f
-or dead,' I conld not know.
'They had twoeanoes with them, which they had haul-
ed up upon the more; and as it was then tide of ebb,
they seemed to me to wait the retnrn of the flood to go
away again. It is not easy to imagine what confusion
this sight put me into/ especially seeing them come on
my side the island, and so near me koo: but when i
observed their coming must be always with the current
of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in my
-mind, being satisfied that I Anight go abroad with sasety
«11 the time of tide of flood, if they were not on more
before; and having made this observation I went abroad
about my harvest work 'with the more composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide
made to the westward, I sawtnem all take boat, and row
(or paddle as we-call it) all away; 1 should have ob-
served, that for an hour and more before they went olf",
they went to dancing, and I could easily. discern their
postures and gestures by my glasses; I could not perceive,
by mynicest observation, but that they were stark-naked,
and had not'the least covering upon them; but whether
they were men or women, that 1 could not diltinguith.
As soon as I-saw them shipped and gone, I took twa
guns upon ray shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle,
and my great sword by my side, without a scabbard;
and with all the (peed I was able to make, I went away to
the hill, where I had discovered the first appearance of all:
As soon as I got thither, which was not less than two hours
(for I could not go apace, being so loaded with arras-as
1 was), I peceived there had been three canoes more of
VOU i.' * savages
savages on that place; and looking out surther, I saw
they were all at sea together, making over for the main.
This was a dreadsul sight to me, especially when going
down to the shore, 1 could see the marks of horror, which
the dismal work they had been about had left behind it,
-viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of human
bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches, with mer-
riment and spoit. I was so filled with indignation at the
light, that I began now to premeditate the destruction of the
next that 1 saw there, let them be who or how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they
.thus made to this island, were not very frequent; for it
was above fifteen months before any more of them came
on shore there again; that is to say, I never saw them, or
anv footsteps or signals of them, in all that time; for as
to 'the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come
abroad, at least not'so sar; yet all this while 1 lived un-
comfortably, by reason of the conilant apprehensions I
was in of their criming upon me by surprise ; from whence
I observe that the expectation of evil is more bitter than
the sussering, especially if there is no room to shake off
that expectation or those apprehensions.
During all this time, I was in the murdering humour;
and took up most of my hours, which should have been
better employed, in contriving how to circumvent and
sall upon them the very next time I should see them;
especially if,they should be divided, as they were the last
time, into two parties; nor did I consider at all, that if
I killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was still the
next day, or week, or month, to kill another, and so
another, even ad injimlutn, till I should be at length no
less a murderer than they were in being men-eaters, and
perhaps much more so.
1 spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety
of mind, expecting that I mould one day or other sall
into the hands of those merciless creatures; if I did at
anv time venture abroad, it was not without looking
round me with the greatest care. and caulion imagina-
ble; and now 1 found to my great comfort, how happy
it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of
goats; for I durst not, u},on any account, fire my gun,
especially near that side of the island where they usually
came,
came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had
fled'from me now, I was sure to have them come buck
again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them, in a sew days, and then I knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months more
-before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I
found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true,
they might have been there once or twice, but either
they made no stay, or, at least, I did not hear them;
but in the month of May, as near as I could calculate,
and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange
encounter with them, of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or
sixteen months interval, was very great; 1 ilept unquiet,
dreamed always frightsul dreams, and often started out
of my sleep in the night; in the day great troubles.
overwhelmed my mind; in the night I dreamed often
of killing the savages, and the reasons why I might
joilify the doing of it; but to wave all, this for a while,
it was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I
think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would rec-
kon; for I marked all upon the post still; 1 say it was on
the sixteenth of May, that it blew a great storm of wind
ail day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and
a very foul night was after \t; 1 know not what was the
particular occasion of it; . but as I was reading in the
Bible, and taken up with serious thoughts about mv
present condition, 1 was surprised with the noise of a
gun, as I thought, fired at sea.
This was to be sure a surprise of a quite. difserent na-
ture from any I had met with before; for the notions
this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind, I
started up in the greatest hr.lie imaginable; and in a trice
clapped up my ladder to the middle place of the rock,
and pulled it after me, and mounting ic the second time,
got to the top of the hill; that very moment a slash of
fire bade me listen for a second gun, which accordingly
in about half a moment I heard, and by the sound knew
that it was from that part of the sea whsre I was driven
out with the current in my boat.
I immediately considered, that this must be some ship in
distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other
i 2 slsip
ship in company, and fired these guns for signals of dis-
tress, and to obtain help; I had this presence of mind
at that minute, as to think, that though I could not help
them, it may be they might help me; so I brought to-
gether all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making
a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill; the
•wood was dry, and blazed freely, and though the wind
blew very hard, yet it burnt sairly out, so that I was certain
if there was any such thing as a ship, they must need
fee it, and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire
blazed up, I heard another gun, and after that several
others, all from the some quarter. I plied my fire all
night long, till day broke; and when it was broad day,
and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great dis-
tance at sea, sull east of the island, whether a sail, or a
hull, I could not distinguish, no not with my glasses,
the distance was so great, and the weather still some-
thing hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.
I'looked frequently at it all that day, and soon per-
ceived that it did not move; so I presently concluded
that it was a ship at anchor; and being eager, you may
be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and
ran towards the south-east fide of the island, to the rocks
where I had been formerly carried away with the cur-
rent; and getting up there, the weather by this time
being persectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sor-
row, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night upon those
concealed rocks which 1 found when I was out in my boat;
and which rocks, as they checked the violence of the
stream, and made a kind ot counter-stream, or eddy, were
the occasion of my recovering then from the most desperate
hopeless condition that ever 1 had been in all my lise.
Thus, what is one man's sasety is another man's
destruction; lor it seems, these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks be-
in"' wholly under water, had been driven upon them in
the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E. N. E.
Kad they seen the island, as I must necessarily suppose
they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured
to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their
boat; but their siring of their guns for help, especi-
ally when they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me
with
with my thoughts; first I imagined, that, upon seeing
my .light, they might have put themselves into their
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore; but that
the sea going very high, they mis;ht have been cast
away; other times I imagined, that they might have loft
their boat before, as might be the case many ways; as
particularly by the breaking of the sea upon their ship,
which many times obliges men to stave, or take in pieces
their boat, and sometimes to throw it over-board with
their own hands; other times I imagined, they had
some other ship or ships in company, who upon the sig-
nals of distress they had made, had taken them up, and
carried them oss; other whiles I sancied they were all
gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by
the current that I had been formerly in', were carried
out into the great ocean, where there was nothing but
misery and perishing; and that perhaps they might by
this time think of starving, and of being in a condition
lo eat one another.
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the
condition I was in, I could do no more than look upon
the misery of the poor men- and pity them; which had
still this good-effect on my side, that it gave me rnoro
and more cause to give thanks to God, who had ib hap-
pily and comfortably provided for m: in my ..iesolate
condition; and that of two ships' companies who were
now cast away upon this part of the world, not one life
should be spared Jaut mine. 1 learnt here again to ob-
ferve, that it is very rare that the providence of God
casts us into any condition of lise so low, or any misery so
gr*at, but we may see something or other to be thanksul for,
and may see others in worse circumstances than our own.
Such certainly was the case of theie men, of whom I
could not so much as see room to suppose any of them were
saved; nothing could make it rational, so much as to with
or expect that they did not all perish there, except the
possibility only of their being taken up by another ship in
company; and this was but mere possibility indeed; foe
I sa w not the least signal or appearance of any such thing.
I cannot explain', by any possible energy of words,
what a strange longing, or hankering of delire, I selt
in my soul upon this light; breaking out sometimes
I 3 thus:
thus: Oh that there had been but one or two, nay, or but
one foul saved out of the ship, to have escaped to me,
that I might but have had one companion, one sellow-
creature, to have spoken to me, and to have conversed
-with! in all the time of my solitary lise, 1 never selt so
.earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my sellow-
creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it.
There are some secret moving springs in the affec-
tions, which, when they are set a going by some object:
in view, or be it some object though not in view, yet
rendered present to the mind by the power of imagina-
tion, that motion carries out the foul by its impetuosity
to such violent, eager embracings of the object, that
the absence of it is insupportable.
Such were these earnest wishings, that but one man
had been laved! Oh that it had been but one! 1 believe I
repeated the words, Oh that it had been but one 1 a thou-
sand times; and my desires were so moved by if, that
when 1 spoke the words, my bands would clinch together,
and my lingers press the palms of my hands, that if I
had had any soft thing in my hand, it would have crush-
ed it involuntarily; and my teeth in my head would
strike together, and set against one another so strong,
that for some time I could not part them again.
Let the naturalists explain these things, and the reason
nnd manner of them; all I can say of them is, to describe
the sact which was ever surprising to me when I found it;
tho' I knew not from what it should proceed; it was doubt-
less the eff ect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed
in my mind, realizing the comfort which the conversation
of one of my sellow-christians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their sate, or mine, ar
both, forbad it; for till the last year of my being on this
island, I never knew whether aoy were saved out of that
snip or no; and had only the affliction some days after,
to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore, at
the end of the island, which was next the shipwreck:
he had on no clothes, but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair
of open-kneed iinen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but
nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he
-was of: he had nothing in his pocket but two pieces ©f
eight, and a tobacco-pipe; the last was to me of ten
times more value than the first.
It
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture
out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might
find something on board that might be usesul to me; —
but that did not altogether press me so much, as the possi-
bility that there might be yet some living creature on
board, whose lise I might not only save, but might, by
saving that lise, comfort my own to the last degree.—
And this thought clung so to my heart, that 1 could not
be quiet night nor day, but I must venture out in my
boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to
God's providence, I thought the impression was so strong
upon my mind, that it could not be relisted, that it mult
come from some invisible direction, and that 1 stiould be
wanting to myself if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back
to my castle, prepared every thing for my voyage, took
a quantity of bread, a great pot for fresh water, a com-
pass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a great
deal of that left), a basket sull of raisins. And thus load-
ing myself with every thing necessary, I went down to
my boati got the water out of her, and got her afloat,
loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again
for more. My second cargo was a great bag sull of rice,
the umbrella to set up over my head for ashade, another
large pot sull of fresh water, and about two dozen ot my
small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, with a
bottle of goat's milk, and a cheese; all which, with great
labour and sweat, I brought to my boat; and praying
to God to direct my voyage, 1 put out, and rowing or
paddling the canoe along the shore, I came at last to the
utmost point of the island, on .that side, viz. N. E<—-
And now 1 was to launch out into the ocean, and either
to venture, or not to venture, I looked on the rapid cur-
rents, which ran constantly on both sides of the island, a£
p. distance, and which were very terrible to me, from
the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before,
and my heart began to sail me; for I foresaw, that if I
was driven into either of thole currents, 1 should be car-
ried a vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach,
or sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat
was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, L
should be inevitably lost. . , .
14 These
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began
to give over my enterprize; and having hauled my boat
into a little creek on the shore, I stepped' out, and sat me
down upon a little spot of rising ground, very pensive and
anxious, between sear and deiire, about my voyage;—
'when, as I was musing, 1 could perceive that the tide
-was turned, and the flood came on, upon which my
going was for so many hours impracticable. Upon this
it presently occurred to me, that I should go up to the
highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, if I
could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay, when the
flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven
another way home, with the same rapidness of the cur-
rents. This thought was no sooner in my head, but I
cast my eye upon a little hill, which sufficiently over-
looked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear
-view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which way
I was to guide myself in my return. Here I found that
as the current'of the ebb set out close by the south point
of the island, so the current of the flood set in dole by
the shore of the north-side; and that 1-had nothing to do-
but to keep to the north of the island in my return, and
I should do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolves' the next
morning to set out with • the sirst of the tids^^lnd re-
posing myself for that night in the canoe, under tne great
watch-coat 1 mentioned, i launched out: I made first a
little out to sea sull north, till I began to seel the benefit
of the current, which set eastward, and which carried me
at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the
southern side current had done before, and so as to take
from me all government of the boat; but having a
strong steerage with my paddle, I went, I say, at a great
rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I
came up to it. ,
1t was a dismal sight to look at. The ship, which, by
its building, was Spanish, stuck sast, j imbed in between
two rocks: All the stern and quarter of her was beaten
to pieces with the sea; and as her forecastle, which-
struck in the rocks, had run on with great violence,
htt main-mast and lore-mast were brought by the board,
that is to sav, broken short off; butcher bow-sprit was
found, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I
came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, which, see-
ing m" coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as I called
hirn, jumped into the sea to come. to me; and I took
him into the boat, but sound him almost dead for hun-
ger and thirst. Tgave him a cake of my bread, and he
- eat like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fort-
night in the snow. I then gave the poor creature some
fresti water, with which, if I would have let him, he
•would have burst himself. .
After this I went on board: the first sight I met with
was two men drowned in the cock-room, or forecastle^
of the ship, with their arms fyst about one another., I
concluded,' as is indeed probable, that when the ship
struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high, and
so continually over her, that the men were not able to
bear it, and were strangled with the constant rushing inv
of the water, as much as if they had been under water.—
Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that
had lise, nor any goods that I could see, but what were
spoiled by the water. There were some casks of liiyior,
whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in
the hold,- and which, the water being ebbed out, £
could ser "but they were too big to meddle with. I saw.
several .bests, which I believed belonged to some of the
seamen, and I got two of them' into the boat, without
examining what was in them.
Had the stern os'the ship been fixed, and the fore part
broken off, I am persuaded I might have made a good
voyage; for by what I sound 'in these two chests, 1 had
room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth ont
board; and if I may guess, by the course she steered, she-
must have been bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the
Rio de la Plata, in the South part of America, beyond
the Brafils, to the Havannah, in the gulph of Mexico,
and so perha-ps to Spain- She had, no doubt,.a great trea-
sure in her, but of no use, at that time, to any body and
what became of the relt of her people I then knew not.
1 found, besides these chetts, a little cask: sull of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
hoat withmuch difficulty. There were several musktts
i»
in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four
pounds of powder in it. As for the muskets, Iliad no
occasion for them, so I left them, but took the powder-
horn. I took a sire-shovel and tongs, which 1 wanted
extremely; as alto two little brat's kettles, a copper pot
to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo,
and the dog, 1 came away, the tide beginning to make
home again; and the same evening, about an hour
-within night, I reached the island again, weary and sa-
tigued to the b:st degree.
1 reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I
resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave,
not to cany it home to my castle. Aster refreshing my-
self, I got all my cargo on shore, and began to examine
the particulars. The caflaof liquor I found to be a kind
of rum, but not such as we had at the Brasils; and, in a
word, not at ail good; but when I came to open the
chests, I found several things which I wanted. For ex-
ample, 1 found in one a sine case of bottles, of an extra-
ordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, sine, and'
very good: the bottles held about three pints each, and
-were tippet! with silver. 1 found two pots of very good
succades, or sweetmeats, so sattened alto on the top, that
the salt water had not hurt them; and two more of the
same, which the water had spoiled. I found some very
good shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiess, and
coloured neckcloths. The former were also very welcome,
being exceeding refreshing to wipe my sace in a hot
day. Besides this, when I came to the till in the chests,
1'found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which
held about eleven hundred' pieces in all; and in one of
them, wrappedup in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and
some small bars,-or wedges of gold. I suppose they
might all weigh near a pound.
'The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of
little value; but, by the circumstances, it must have be-
longed to the gunner's mate, though there was no pow-
der in it, but about two pounds of glazed powder, in the
three slasks, kept, I suppose
i for C-Iisir'i^itheir fowlin^j^
pieces on occasion. L'pon the whole, I got very little by
this voyage that was of much use to me: for, as to the
money,
money, I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me
as the dirt under my seet; and I would have given it
all for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings,
-which were things I greatly wanted, but had not had on
my seet now for many years. I had, indeed, gotten two
pair of shdes now j which I took off the seet of the two
drowned men, whom I saw in the wreck; and I found
two pair more in one of the chests, which were very wel-
come to me; but they were not like our Englisli shoes,
either for ease or service,.being rather what we call pumps
than shoes. 1 found in the seaman's chest about fifty
pieces of eight in rials, but no gold. I suppose this
belonged to a poorer man than the other, which seemed
to belong to some officer.
Well, however, I lugged the money home to my cave,
and laid it up, as I had done that before, which I
brought from our own ship; but it was great pity, as I
said, that the other part of the ship had not come to my
share,-sor i am satissied I might have loaded my canoe
feveral times over with money, which, if I had ever
escaped to England, would have lain here sase chough
till I might have conn again and setched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and se-
cured them, 1 went back to'my boat, and rowed or pad-
dled her along the shore to her old harbour, where I laid
her up, and made the bett of my way to my old habita-
tion, where I found every thing sale and quiet; so 1 be-
gan to repose myself, live after my old sashion, and take
care of ray samily affairs: and for awhile I lived easy
enough; only that I was more \ igilant .th:m I used to
be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much:
And if at any time 1 did llir with any freedom, it was
always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty
well satisfied the savages never came, and where i could
go without so many precautions, and such a scad of arms
and ammunition, as I always carried with rqe, if 1 went
the other way. .. ,'.'''
I lived in this condition near two- years more; but
my unlucky'head, that was always to let me know it
was born to make my bod}' miserable, was all those two
years filled with projects and designs, how, if it were
possible, I might get away from this island; for some-
i d • times.
times I was for making another voyage to the wreck,
JLhough my reason, told me, that there was nothing left
Jhere worth the hazard of my voyage: sometimes for a
ramble one way, sometimes 'another: and I believe ve-
rily, if I had had the boat that 1 went from Sallee in, I
should have ventured to sea, bound any where, I knew
not whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to
those who are touched with that general plague of man-
kind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their mise-
ries flow; 1 mean that of not being satisfied with the sta-
tion wherein God and Nature hath placed them; for, not
to look bac. ipon my primitive condition, and the ex-
cellent advice of my sather, the opposition to which was,.
as I may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes
of the same kind have been the means of my coming into-
this miserable condition; for, had that Providence,
which so happily had seated me at the Brazils as a plant-
er, blessed me with confined desires; and could I have
been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have
been by this time, I mean in the tisje of my being on
this island, one of the most comfortable planters in the
Brazils : nay, I am persuaded, that, by the improvements
I had made in the little time I lived there, and the in-
crease I should probably have made, if I had stayed, £
might have been Worth an hundred thousand moidores;
and what business had I to leave a settled fortune, well-
itocked plantation, improving and increasing, to turn su-
percargo to Guinea, to setch negroes, when patience and.
time would have so increased our, stock at home, that we
could have bought them at our own doors, from those
whose businels it was to /etch them. And though it had
cost us something more, yet the difference of that price
was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the sate of young heads, so re-.
flection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily ,the exercise
of more years, or of the dear-bought experience of time;
and so it wns with me now ; and yet. so deep had the mjfr
take taken root in my temper, that 1 could not satisfy
inyself in my station, but was continually poring upon,.
the means and. possibility of my escape from this place;
and that I may j with the greater pleasure tet the reader,
5 bring
bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not be
improper to give some account ot my first conceptions on
'the subject of this.foolisti 'scheme for my escape; and
how, and upon what foundation, I acted.
I am now to be supposed to be retired into my castle,
after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up,
..4V^d secured under water as usual, and my condition re-
sstrfred to what it was before. I had more wealth indeed
'•flpOB.I had before, but 'was not at all the richer; for I
h%<& no more use for it than the Indians of Peru had be-
fore the Spaniards came thither.
It was one of the nights, in the rainy season in March,
the four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this
island of solitariness, I was lying in my bed or ham-
mock, awake, and very well in health, had no pain, no
distemper, no uneasiness of body, no, nor any uneasiness
of mind more than ordinary, but could by no means
close my eyes; that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink
all night long, otherwisethan as follows : —
It is as impossible as needless, to fet down the innu-
merable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that
great thoroughsare of the brain, the memory, in this
night's time. I ran over the whole history os my life
in miniature, or by abridgement, as 1 may call it, to my
coining to this island; and also of that part of my lise
since i came to this island; in my reflections up.on the
state of my case, since I came on shore on this island,
I was comparing the happy posture of affhirs, iruthe
first years of my habitation here, to that course of
anxiety, sear, and care, which I had lived in ever since
I had seen the print of a foot in the sand; not that I did
not believe the savages had frequented the island even
all the while, and might have been several hundreds of
them at times on (hore there; but as I had never known
it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about it,
iny satissaction was persect, though my danger was the
lime; and I was as happy in not knowing my danger*
as if I had never really been exposed to it; this surriished
my thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and
particularly this one, bow insinitely good that Provi-
dence is, whieh has settled in its government of man-
kind such narrow Bounds to his light and knowledge
-J
of things; and though h< <valks n thi midst of so many
thov'and dangers. the light of which, if discovered to
him. would distract his mind, and fink his spirits, he is
kept serene and calm, by having the events of things hid
from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which
surround him.
After these thoughts had for some time entertained me,
I came to. reflect seriously upon the real danger 2 had
been in-for sri many years in this very island; and how I
ha'! walk"d about in the greatest security, and with all
polsible tranrm'.llity, even perhaps when nothing but a
brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of
night. had bee.i between me and the' worst kind of de-
struction, viz. that os salling into the hands ot'cannibals
and savages, who would have seized on me with the
same view as I did on a goat or a turtle, and have
thought it no-more crime to kill 'and devour me, than I
did of a pigeon or a curlieu. I should unjustly slander
myself, if I Should say- I was not sincerely thankful to my
great Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknow-
ledged, with great humility, that all these unknown de-
liverances were due, and without which I should inevi-
tably have sallen into their merciless hands.
When these thoughts.were over, my head wat for
some rime taken up in considering the nature of these
'wretched creatures, I mean the savages: and how it
came to pass in the world, that the Wise Governor of all
things thould .:ive up any of his creatures to such inhu-
manity, nay, to something so much below even brutality
itself, as to devour its own kind; but as this ended in
some (at that time fruitless) speculations, it occurred to
me to enquire what part of the world these wretches
lived in; how sar off the coast was from whence they
came; what they ventured so sar from home so:; what
kind of boats they had; and why 1 might not ordei my-
self and my business so, that I might be as able to go
over thither as they were to come to me.
I never Ib much as troubled myself to consider what
I should do with myself when I came thither, what should
become of me, if I fell ii.to the hands of the savages, or
how I should esc ape from them, if they attempted me;
no, nor so much as how it was possible lor-me to reach the
coast,
Coast, and not be attacked by some or other of them,
without any possibility of delivering myself; and if I
should not sall into thfcir hands, what I should do for pro-
viiion, or whither I should bend my course; none of these
thoughts, I say, so much'as came in my way; but my
mind was wholly' bent upon the notion of my passing
over in my boat to the main land. I looked back upon
my preient condition as the moil miserable that could pos-
sibly be; that I was not able to throw myself into ar.y
thing but death that cou'd be called.j-.vorse; that is I
reached the shore of the main, 1 might, perhaps, meet with
relief; or I might coast along, as I d$tl on the shore of
Africa, till I came to some inhabited country, and where
I. might find some Christian ship that might take me in;
and if the worst came to the worst, I could but die, which
would put on end to all these miseries at once. Pray
note* all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind—an im-
patient temper, made, as it were, desperate by the long
continuance of my troubles, and the disappointments 1
had met in the wreck I bad been on board of, and where
I had been so near the obtaining of what 1 so earnestly
longed for, viz;, somebody lo speak to, and to leara
some knowledge from, of the place where I was, and' of
the probable means of my deliverance. 1 say, I was.
agitated wholly by these thoughts. All my c^I'm of
mind in my resignation to Providence, and waiting the
issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be suspend-
ed; and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts
to any thing but the project of a yoyage to the main,
which came upon me with such force, and such an im-
petuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted.
y. hen this had agitated my thoughts for two hours
or more, with such violence, that it set my very blood
into a serment, and my pulse beat as high as if I had
been in a sever, merely with the extraordinary ser-
vour of my mind about it, Nature, as if 1 had been
satigued and exhausted with the very thought of it,
threw me into a found steep. One would have thought
I should have dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of any
thipg relating to it; but I dreamed, that as I was going
out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, 1 saw
upon
upon the shore two canoes,. and eleven savages coming;
to land, and that they brought witbuhem another savage,
whom they were going to kill, in order to eat him ; when,
on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill
jumped away, and ran for his lise; then I thought in my
sleep, that he came running into my little thick- grove,.
before my fortification, to hide himself; and that I, see-
ing him alone, and not perceiving that the others fought
him that way, shewed myself to him, and smiling upon
him, encouraged him: that he kneeled down to me,
seeming to pray me to assist him; up^n which I shewed
my ladder, made him go up it, and carried him into my
cave, and he became my servant; and that as soon as [
had gotten this man, I said to myself, now I may certain-
ly venture to the main land; for this sellow will serve me
as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go
for provisions, and whither not to go for sear of being de-
voured, what places to venture into, and what to escape.
I waked with this thought, and was under such inex-
pressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape
in my dream, that the disappointments which 1 selt upon
coming to myself, and finding it was no more than a
dream, were equally extravagant the other way,. and
threw me into a very great dejection osfpirit.
Upon this, however, 1 made this conclusion, that my
only way to go about an attempt for an escape, was, if
possible, to get a savage in my possession; and, if pos-
lible, it should be one of their prisoners whom they had
condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill;
but these thoughts stili were attended with this dif-
ficulty, that it was impossible to effect this without at-
tacking a whole caravan of them, and killing them air ;.
and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and
might miscarry; but, on the other hand, i had greatly
scrupled the lawsulness of it to me, and my heart trem-
bled at the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though
it was for my dtliverance. 1 need not repeat the argu-
ments which occurred to me against this, they being the
fame mentioned before. But tuough, 1 had other reasons
to offer now, \ iz. that those men were enemies to my
lise, and would devour me, if they could; that it was-
felf-preservation in the highest degree, to deliver myself
front
from this death of a lise, and was acting in my own
desence, as much as if they were actually assaulting me,
and the like; I say, though these things argued for it,
yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliver-
ance were very terrible to me, and such as 1 could by
no means reconcile myself to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes with my-
self, and after great perplexities about it (for all these ar-
guments, on« way and another, struggled in my head a
longtirne), the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at
length mastered all the rest, and I resplved, if possible, to
get one of these savages into my hands, cost what it
would. My next thought then was to contrive how to
dp it; and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on:
but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I
resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when
they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking
such measures as the opportunity should present, let it be
what it would.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, 1 set myself
upon the scout as often as possible, and indeed' so often,
till I was heartily tired of it; for it was above a year and
a half that I waited, ,aud for a great part of that time
went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner
of the island, almost every day to see the canoes, but
none appeared. This was very discouraging, and be-
gan to trouble me much; though I can't say that it
did in this case as it had done some time before that, viz-,
wear off the edge of my desire to the thing; but the
longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager I was for
it.—In a word, I was not at first more caresul to shun
the light of these savages, and avoid being seen by them,
than 1 was now eager to be upon them.
Besides, Lsancied myself able to manage one, nay, two
or three savages, if I had them, so as to make them en-
tirely slaves to me, to do whatever 1 should direct them,
and to prevent their being able, at any time, to do me
any hurt. 'It was a great while that I pleased myself
with this affair, but nothing still presented; all my tau-
cies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came
near me for a great while. . »
About a year aud a half after I had entertained these
potions, and, by lonjj musing, had-, as it were, resolved
them
them all into nothing, for want of an. occasion to put
them in execution, I was surprised one morning early,
with seeing no less than sive canoes all on shore together,
on my side the island, and the people who belonged to
them all landed, and out of my sight. The number of
them broke all my measures r, for seeing so many, and
knowing that they always came four, or six, or some-
times more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty
men single-handed; so I lay still in my castle, perplexed
and discomforted: however, I put myself into all the
same postures for an attack that 1 had formerly provided,
and was just ready for action, if any thing had presented,
having waited a good while, listening to hear if they
made any noise; at length, being very impatient, I set my
guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the
top of the hill by my two stages, as usual; standing so,
however, that my head did not appear above the hill;
so that they could not perceive me by any means. Here
I observed, by the help of my perspective-glasi, that they
were no less than thirty in number; that they had a sire
kindled, and that they had meat dressed. How they
cooked it, that 1 knew not, or »hat it was; but they
were all dancing in I knew not how many barbarous
gestures and sigures, their own •ay, round the fire.
When I was thus looking on them, I perceivwl, by my
perspective, two miserable »retche* dragged from the
boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now
brought out for the slaughter. I peiceived one of them.
immediately sall, being knocked down, I suppose, with
a club or wooden sword, for that was their way; and
two or three others were at work immediately, cutting-
him open for their cookery, while the other victim was
left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him.
Inthat very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a
little at liberty, nature inspired him with hopes. of lise,
and he started away from them, aud ran with incredible
swiftness along the sands, directly towards me, I mean to-
wards that part of the coast where my habitation was.
1 was dreadsully frighted (that 1 must acknowledge)
when 1 perceived him to run my way; and especially
when, as 1 thought, I saw him pursued by the whole
body }
tody; and now I expected that part of my dream was
coming to pass, and that he certainly would take shelter
in my grove; but I could not depend, by any means,
upon my dream for the relt of it, viz. that the other sa-
vages would not pursue him thither, and find him there.
However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to re-
cover, when 1 found that there were not above three
men that followed him; and still more was I encou-
raged, when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly
in running, and gained ground of them; so that, if he
could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would
sairly get away from them all.'
There was between them and my castle the creek,
which 1 mentioned often at the first part of my story,
where 1 landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this I
knew he must necessarily swim over,-or the poor wretch
would be taken there. But when the savage escaping
came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was
then up; but plunging in, iwam through in about thirty
strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with exceed-
ing strength and swiftness. When the three pursuers
came to the creek, I found that two ot them could swim,
but the third could not, and that he, standing on the
other side, looked at the others, but went no sarther; and
soon after went softly back again, which, as it happened,
was very well for him in the main.
I observed that the two who swam were yet more
than twice as long swimming over the creek than the
sellow was that fled from them. It came now very
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that
now was my time to get me a servant, and perhaps a
companion or assistant, and that I was called pkinly
by .Providence to save this poor creature's lise. I im-
mediately got down the ladders with all possible expe-
dition, setched my two guns, for they were both at the
foot of the ladder, as i observed above'; and getting
up again with the same haste to the top of the hill,
I crossed towards the sea; aud, having a very thort cut,
and all down hill, clapped my selt in the way between
the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him
that sled, who, looking back, was at tirll perhaps as
much frighted at me as at them; but I beckoned with
my
my hand to him to come back, and in the mean time I
slowly advanced towards the two that followed; then rush-
ing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with
the stock of my piece. I was ioath to fire, because I would
not have the rest hear; though at that distance if would
not have been easily heard; and being out of sight of the
smoke, too, they would not have easily known what to
make of it. Having knocked this sellow down, the other
who pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened,
and I advanced apace towards him ; but as I came nearer,
1 perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was
fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to
shoot at him sirst, which 1 did, and killed him at the first
shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though
he saw both his enemies sallen, and killed (as he thought),
yet was so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece,
that he stood stock-still, and neither came forward nor
went backward, though he seemed rather inclined tts fly
still than to come on. I hallooed again to him, and made
signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and
came a little way, then stopped again, and then a little sar-
ther, and stopped again, and 1 could then perceive that he
stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and!'
had just been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I
beckoned him again to come to me, and gave him all the
signs of encouragement that I could think of; and he
came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or
twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his
lise. I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, andbeckon-
ed to him to come still nearer. At length he came close
to me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground-,
and laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the
foot, set my foot upon his head. This, it seems, was in
token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him
up, and made much of him, and encouraged him all I
could. But there was more work to do yet: for I per-
ceived the savage, whom 1 knocked down, was not
killed, but stunned with the blow, and began to come to
himself: so I pointed to him, and shewed him the savage,
that he was not dead; upon this he spoke some words to
me; and though 1 could not understand them, yet I
thought they were pleasant to hear, tor they were the sirst
- . souud
sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my own ex-
cepted, for above five-and-twenty years: but there was
no time for such reflections now: the savage, who was
knocked down, recovered himself so sar as to sit upon the
ground; and 1 perceived that my savage began to be
afraid; butwlien I saw that, I presented my other piece
at the man, as if I would snoot him. Upon this my sa-
vage, for so I call him now, made a motion to me to
lend him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my
lide: so I did. He no sooner had it, but he runs to his
enemy, and at one blow cut off' his head as cleverly, no
executioner in Germany could have done it sooner or bet-
ter, which I thought it very strange for one who, I had
reason to believe, never saw a sword in his lise before,
except their own wooden swords. However, it seems, as
I learned afterwards, they made their wooden swords so
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will
cut off heads even with them, aye, and arms, and that at
one blow too. When he had dyne this, he comes laugh-
ing tome in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword
again, and, with abundance of gestures, which 1 did not
understand, laid it down with the head of the savage that
he had killed just before me.
But that which aitonished him most was, to know how
Ihad killed the other Indian so far osf; so pointingtohim,
lie made signs to me to let him go to him; so I bade him
go, as well as I could. When he came to him, he ll6od
like one amazed, looking at him; turned him first on one
lide, then on the other; looked at the wound the bullet
had made, which it seems was just in his breast, where it
had made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had fol-
lowed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead.
Then he took up bis bow and arrows, and came back ; Ib
I turned to go away, and beckoned to him to follow me,
making signs to him, that more might come after them.
Upon this he signed to me, that he should bury them
with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if
they followed; and so .1 made signs again to him to do
so. He sell to work, and in an instant he had scraped a
hole in the sand with his hands, big enough to bury
the first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered
him, and did so also by the other. I believe he had
buried
buried them both in a-quarter of an hour; then calling
him away, 1 carried him not to my castle, but quite away
to my cave, on the sarther part of th$ island; so 1 did net
let my dream come to pals in that part, viz. that he came
into my grove for shelter.
Here 1 gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins to eat,'
and a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in
great distress for, by his running; and having refreshed
him, I made signs for him to go lie down and sleep,
pointing to a place where I had laid a great parcel of rice
itraw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon
myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay down, and
-went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome sellow, persectly well made,
-with straight long limbs, not too large, tall, and -well-
shaped, and, as 1 reckon, about twenty-six years of age.
He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly
aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his
sace, and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of an
European in his countenance, too, especially when he
smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like
wool; his forehead very high and large, and a great
vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour
of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet
not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians
and Virginians, and other natives of America are, but of
a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it some-
thing very agreeable, though not very easy to describe.—
His sace was round and plump, his nose small, not flat
like the negroes, a very good mouth, thin lips, and his
teeth fine, well-set, and white as ivory. After he had
slumbered, rather thaa slept, about half an hour, he wak-
ed again, and comes out ot the cave to me, for I had been
milking my goats, which I had in the inclosure just by.
Y\ hen he espied me, he came running to me, laying him-
self down again upon the ground, with all the possible
signs of an humble, thanksul disposition, making many
antick gestures to shew it. At last: he lays his head flat
upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot
upon his head, as he had done before; and after this,
made aH the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and sub-
naistlon imaginab!eS to let me knoVv how much he would
serve
serve me as long as he lived. l understood him in many
things, and let him know I was very well pleased with
him. In a little time I be^an to speak to him, and teach
him to speak to me; and first, I made him know his nan.e
should be Friday, which was the day I saved his lise;
and I called him for the memory of the time. I likewise
taught him to say master., and then let him know that
was to be my name. I likewise taught him to ay 'yes
and no, and to know the meaning of them. I gave bim
some milk in an earthen pot, Snd let him see me drink it
before him, and sop my bread in it. I gave him a'cake
of bread to do the like, which Jie quickly complied with,
and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it
-was day, I beckoned him to come on with me, and let
him know I would give him some clothes, at which he
feemed very glad, for he was stark-naked. As we went
by the place where we had buried the two men, he point-
ed exactly to the spot, and mewed me the murks, that he
had made to find them again, making signs to%ne that'?
-we mould dig them up again, and eat them. 'At this^
appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made
as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned
with my hand to him to come away, which he did im-
mediately, with great submission. 1 then led him up to
the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were gone, and
pulling out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place
where.they had been, but no appearauce of them, or of
their canoes; so that it was plain that they were gonej
and had left their comrades behind Them,"without any
search after them. • -
But -I was not content with this discovery; but hav-
ing now more courage, and consequently more curiolity,
I took my man, Friday, with me, giving him the sword in
his hand, with the bow and arrows at his Lick, which I
found he could use very dexterously, making him cairy
one gun for me, and I two for myself, and away we
marched to the place whsre these creatures had been;
for 1 had a mind now to get.some suller inteiiigence of
them. When I came to the place, my very blood ran
chill in my veins, aud my he:.rt sunk within me at the
horror of the lpectacle. Indeed it was a dreadsul light,
ut least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing of
it. 7 he place was covered with human bones, the ground
died with the blood, great pieces of flesh left here and
^there, half eaten, mangled, and scorchqd: and in stiort,
all the tokens of the triumphant seast they had been
making there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw
three Ikulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four
legs and seet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies;
and Friday, by his sigr.s, made me understand that they
brought over four prisoners to seast upon; that three of
them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself,
was the fourth; that there had been a great battle be-
tween them and their next King, whose subjects, it
seems, he had been one of; and that they had taken a
great number of prisoners, all which were carried to'
several places by those that had taken them in the sight,
in order to seast upon them, as was done here by these
wretches upon those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh,
and wft|evcr remained, and lay them together on a
'"'Rap, ancimake a great fire upon it, and burn them all
to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering stomach
after some of the fleuV, and was stiH'a' cannibal in his na-
ture; but I discovered 'so much abhorrence at the very
thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of it, that he
durst not discover it; for I had, by some means, let him
know, that I would kill him if he ofsered it.
When we had done this, weeame back to our castle,
and there I sell to work for my man Friday; and first of all,
I gave him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the
poor gunner's chest I mentioned, and which I found in
the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him
very well ; then I made him a jerkin of goat's stdn, as well
as my skill would allow, and I was now grown a tolera-
ble good tailor; and I gave him a cap, which I had
ma:!cofa hare-skin, very convenient, and sashionable
enough j and thus he was dressed, for the present, tolera-
bly well, and mighty well was he pleased to see himfelf
almost as well clothed as his master.N It is true he went
awkwardly in these things at first; wearing the drawers
was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat
galled his shouldcrs, and the inside of his arms; but a little
easing
casing them, where he complained they hurt- him, and
vising himself to them, at length he took to them very well.
The next day after I cWne home to my hutch with
him, I began to co/isider where 1 should lodge him; and
ihat I might do well for him, and yet be persectly easy
myself. I made a little tent for him in the vacant place
between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last,
and in the outside of the first. And as there was a door
or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal framed
tloor-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in
the passage, a little within the entrance \ and causing the
door to open on the inside, £ barred' it up in the night,
taking in my ladders too; so that Friday could no way
come at me in the inside of my innermost wall, without
making so much noise in getting over, that it must needs
awaken me; for my first wall had now a complete roof
over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning
up to the side of the hill, which was again laid cross with
small sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over a
great thickness with the rice straw, whiclfc^as strong
uke^raeds; and at the hole or place whi^^as left to
go inve«- out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap
door, which, if it had been attempted on the outside,
would not have opened at all, but would have sallen
rflown, and made a great noise; and as to weapons, I
Hook them all in to my tide every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution; for never
man had a more saithsul, loving, sincere servant, than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullenness, or, de-
. signs; persectly obliging and engaging; his very affec-
tions were tied to me, like those of a child to a sather;—r
and, I dare say, he would have sacrificed his lise for the
saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever: the many
testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt; and
soon convinced me, that I needed to use no precautions
as to my sasety on his account.
'? his frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that
with wonder, that, however it had pleased God in his
providence, and in the government of the works of, his
hands, to take. from so great a part of the world of his
creatures, the best uses to which their saculties, and the
powers of their fouls, are adapted; yet that he ha*
vol. i. k bestowed
bestowed upon them the same powers, the same reason, the
same affections, the same sentiments .of kindness and •
obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs,
the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all
the capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that
he has given to us; and that, when he pleases to ofser
them occasions of exerting these, they' are as ready, nay,
more ready to apply them to the right uses for which
they were bestowed, than we are. And this made me
very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several
occasions presented, how mean a use we make.of all
these, even though we have these powers enlightened by
the great lamp of instruction, the ipirit of God, and by
the knowledge of his word, added to our understanding;
and why it has pleased God to hide the. like saving know-
ledge from so many millions of fouls, who, if I might
judge by this poor savage, would make a much better
use of it than we did.
From hence I sometimes-was led too sar to invade the
sovereig^fcf Providence, and, as it were, arraign the
iusiice ofTo^rbitrary a disposition of things, that mould
hide that-light from some, and reveal it to others, and
yet expect a like duty from both : but I shut it up, and
checked my thoughts with this conclusion-:—First, that
we do not know by what light and law these should be
condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and by the
nature of his being, insinitely holy and just, so it could
not be; but that if these creatures were all sentenced to
absence from himself, it was on account of sinning against
that light, which, as the scripture' says, was a law; to
themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would
acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not
discovered to us.—And, secondly, that still, as we are all
.clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him,
Why hast thou formed me thus?
But to return to my new companion.—I was greatly
delighted with him, and made it my business to teach
him every thing that was proper to make him useful,
handy, and helpsul; .but especially to make him speak,
and understand me when I spoke; and he was the. aptest
scholar that ever was; and particularly was so merry,
so constantly dHigent, and so pleased when he could bat
understand
understand me, or make me understand him, that it was
very pleasant to me to talk to him; and now my lise
-began to be so easy, that I began to say to myself, that
c'ould-.l but have been sase from more savages, I cared i\ot
if I was never to remove from the place while I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to my cas-
tle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday off from his'
horrid way of seeding, and s rom the relish of a cannibal 's
stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh; so I took
him out with me one morning to the woods; I went in-
deed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and
bring it homie' and dress it; but as I was 'going, I saw a
she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids
sitting by her; I catched hold of Friday, hold, said I,
stand still; and made signs to him not to stir; immediately
I presented my piece, shot and killed one of the kids. The
poor-creature, who had at a distance, indeed, seen me kill
the savage his enemy, butxlid not know, nor could ima-
gine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled
and shook, and looked so amazed, that ^jfcought he
would have sunk down: he did not see tW kid I had
shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but ripped up his waist-
coat to seel if he was not wounded; and, as I found, pre-
sently thought I was resolved to kill him ; for he came and
kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a
great many things I did not understand, but I could easily
see, that his meaning was to pray me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him, that I would do:
him no harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed
at him, and, pointing to the kid which I had killed,
beckoned to him to run and setch it, which he did; and
while he was wondering and looking to see how'the
creature was killed, I loaded my gun, again, andby-and-
bye T saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon a tree with-
in shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what 1 would
do, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which
was indeed a parrot, though 1 thought it had -been a
hawk; I say, pointing to the parrot and to my gun, and
to the ground under the parrot, to let him lee 1 would
make him sall, I made him understand that I would shoot
and kill that bird; accordingly 1 sired, and bid him look,
and immediately he saw the parrot sall: he stood like
- k 2 - one
one frighted again, notwithstanding all. that I had said
to him; and 1 found he was the more' amazed, because
he did not see me put any thing into the guii ;_but thought
there must be some wondersul sund of death and destruc-
tion in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any.
thing near ot sar off; for the astonishment this created in
him, was such as could not wear off for a-long time;
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have
worshipped me and my gun ., as for the gun itself, he
would not so much as touch it for several days after ; but
-would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered
him,- when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards
learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.
Well: after his aitonishment was a little over at this,
I pointed jto him to run and setch the bird I had shot
which hewid, liut staid some time; for 'the parrot, not
being quite dead, was fluttered a good way off from the
pla-ce where she sell; however he found her, took her up.
and brought her to me; and, as I had perceived his ig-
norance ab«st the gun before, 1 took this advantage to
charge the gu% again, and not let him see me do it, that
I might be ready for any other mark that might present
out nothing more ofsered at that time; so I brought home
the kid; and the same evening I took the skin off, and
cut it out as well as I could, and having a pot for that
purpose, I boiled or slewed some of the flesh, and made
some very good broth; after I had begun to eat some, I
gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and
liked it very well: but that which was strangest to him,
was to see me, eat salt with it. He made a sign to me,
that the salt was not gcod to eat, and putting a little into
his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, aud would spit
and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water
after it; on the other hand, 1 took some meat in my
mouth without salt, and 1 pretended to spit and sputter
lor want of salt, as'sast as he had done at the salt; but
jt would not do, he would neves care for salt w.ith meat,
or in his broth; at least not for a great while, and then
but a very little.
Having thus sed him with boiled meat and broth, I
was resolved to least him the next day with roasting a
piece of the kid; this I did by hanging it before the
fire
fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in Eng-
land, setting two poles up, one on each side the sire,
and one across on the top, and tying the string to the cross
sticks letting the meat turn continually; this Friday
admired very much; but when he came to taste the flests,
he took so many ways to-tell me how well he liked it,
that I could not but understand him; and at last he told
me he would never eat man's flesh any more, which I
was very glad to hear.
The next day I set him to work to beating,some corn
out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as 1 ob-
served before; and he soon understood how to do it as
well as [, especially after he had seen what the meaning
of it was, and that it was to make bread of; for after
that I let him see me make my bread, and bake it too;
and in a little time. Friday was able to do all the work
for me, as well as I could do it myself.
I began now to consider, that having two mouths to
seed instead of one, I must provide more ground for' my
harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used
to do; sol marked out a larger piece of land, and began
the sence in the .same manner as before, in which Friday''
not only Worked very willingly, and very hard, but did it
very cheersully; and when 1 told him what it was for, that
it was for corn to make more bread, because he was now
with me, and that I might have enough for him and my-
self too, he appeared very senlible of that part, and let
me know, that he thought I had much more labour up-
on me on his account, than I had for myself, and that
he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him
what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all the lise I led in this
place; Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand
the names of almost every thing I had occasion to call
for^ and of every place I had to send him to, and talk a
great deal to me; so that in short, I began now to have
some use for my tongue again, which indeed I had very
little occasion for before; that is to say about speech:
besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular
satissaction in the sellow himself; his simple unseigned
honesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I
began really to love the creature; and on his side, I
K 3 believe
believe he loved me more than it was possible for him
ev£r to love any thing before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering incli-
nation to. his own country again; and having learned him
English so well, that he could answer me almost any ques-
tion; I asked him, whether the nation that he belonged
'to-never conquered in battle. At which he smiled, and
said, yes, yes,' we always sight the better; that is, he
meant, always get the better in sight, and so we began
the following discourse. You always sight the better,
said I; hew came you to'be taken prisoner then, Friday?
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Mailer. How beat? if your nation beat them, how
came you to be taken?
Friday. They more than my nation in the place where
me was; they take one, two, three, and me. My nation
over-beat then in yonder place, where me no was;
there my nation take one, two, great thousand.
Master. But why did not your side recover you from
- the hands of.your enemies then?
Friday. / They run one, two, three, and me, and make
go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.
Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do
with the men they take? Do they carry them away, and
eat them as these did?
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mens too, eat all up.
Master. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, 1 been here [Points to the N. W. side
of the island, which, it seems, was their side].
By this I understood, that my man Friday had formerly
been among the savages, who used to come on shore on the
sarther part of the island, oii the said men-eating occasions
that he was brought for; and some time after, when
1 took the courageMo carry him to that side, being the
same I formerly mentioned, he persectly knew the place,
and told.me he was there once when they eat up twenty
men, two women, and one child. He could not tell twenty
in English, -but he numbered them by laying so many
stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I ha vie
I have told this passage, because it introduces what fol-
lows; that after I had had this discourse with him, I asked
him how sar it was from our island to the shore, and
whether the canoes were not often lost. I le told me there
-was no danger, no canoes ever lost; but that after a little
way out to sea, there was a current, and a wind always
one way in the morning the other in the afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the lets of the
tide as going out or coming in; but I afterwards un-
derstood it was occasioned by the great draught and re-
flux of the mighty river Oroorioque; in the mouth of
which river, as I thought afterwards, our ifland lay;
and that this land, which I perceived to the W. and
N. W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river: I atked Friday a thou-
sand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the
sea, the coast, and what nations were near; he told me
all he knew, with the greatest openness imaginable;
I asked him the names of the several nations of his fort
of people, but could get no other name than Caribs;
from whence I easily understood, that these were the
Caribees, which our maps place on that part of Ame-
rica which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroono-
que to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha; he told me
that up a great way beyond the moon, that was, bejrond
the setting of the moon, which must be. W. from their
country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and
pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before;
and that they had killed much mans, that was his word;
by which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose
cruelties in America ,had been spread over the whole
countries, and were remembered by all the nations from
sather to son.
I enquired if hccould tell me how I might come from
this island, and get among those white men; he told me,
Yes, yes, 1 might go in two canoe; I could not under-
stand what he meant by two canoe; till at last, with
great difficulty, I found he meant, that it must be in a
large great boat as big as two canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse began to relisti with
me very well; and from this time 1 entertained some
hopes, that one time or other I might find an oppor-
k 4 tunity
tunity to make my escape from this place, and that this
poor savage might be a means to help me to do it.
During the long time that Friday had nqw been with
me, and that he began to speak to me and understand
me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious
knowledge in his mind, particularly, I asked h'mi one
time, who made him? The poor creature did not un-
derstand me at all, but thought I had asked who was his
sather; but 1 took it by another handle, and asked him
who made the sea, the ground he walked on, and the
hills and woods? He told me, it was one oki Benamuckee
that lived beyond all: he could describe nothing of this
great person, but that he was very old; much older, he
said, than the sea, or the land, than the moon or the
stars: I asked him then, if this old person had made all
things, why did not all things worship him?'He looked
very grave, and with a persect look of innocence said,
all things said O to him: I asked him, if the people who
died in his country, went away any where: he said, yes,
they all went to Benamuckee: then I asked him, whether
those they eat up went thither too? He said, yes.
From these things I began to instruct him in the know-
ledge of the true God. 1 told him, that the great maker
of all things lived there, pointing up towards heaven:
that he governs the world by the fame power and pro-
vidence by which he made it: that he was omnipotent,
could do every thing for us, give every thing to us, take
every thing from us; and thus by degrees, 1 opened his
eyes': he listened with great attention, and received with
pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to re-
deem us, and of the manner . of making our prayers to
God, and his being able to hear us, even into heaven:
as he told me one day, that if our God could hear us up
beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater God than
their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet
could not hear, till they went up to the great mountains,
where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him if he ever
went to speak to Benamuckee? He said, no, they never
went that were young men; none went thither but the
old men, whom he called their Oowookakee, that is, as I
made him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy;
and that they went to say O (Ib he called saying prayers)
.1
and then came back, and told them what Benarriuckee
said: by this I observed, that there is priestcraft even
amongst the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the world;
and the policy of making a secret religion, in order to
preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not
only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps among all re-*
ligions in the world, even among the most brutish and
barbarous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday;
and told him, that the pretence of their old men going up
to the mountains to say O to their god Benamuckee, was
a cheat; and their bringing word from thence what he
said, was much more so; that if thev met with any an-
swer, or spoke with any one there, it must be with an
evil spirit: and then I entered into a long discourse with
him about the devil, the original of him, his rebellion
against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his set-
ting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be
worshipped instead of God, and as God, and the many
stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their
ruin; how he had a secret access to our passions, and to
our affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations,
as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and to run
npon our own'destruction by our own choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in
his mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a
God: nature. assisted all my arguments to evidence to
him even the necessity of a great sirst cause, and over-
ruling governing power, a secret directing Providence,
and of the equity and justice of paying homage to him
that made us, and the like: but there appeared nothing
of all this in the notion of an evil spirit, of his original,
his being, his nature, and above all, of his inclination to
do evil, and to draw us in to do so too: and the poor
creature puzzled me once in such a manner, by a ques-
tion merely natural and innocent, that I scarce knew
what to say to him. 1 had been talking a great deal to
him of the power of God, his omnipotence, his dreadsul
aversion to fin, his being a consuming sire to the workers
of iniquity ; how, as he had made us all, he could cleitroy
us, and all the world, in a moment; and he listened with
great seriousness to me all the while.
- ' - Ko After
After this, I had been telling him.-how the devil was
God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his ma- -
lice and skill to deseat the good designs of Providence,
and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the workt, and the~
like: Well, says Friday, but you say, God is so strong,
so great, is he not much strong, much might. as the de-
vil? Yes, yes, said I, Friday, God is stronger than the
devil, God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to
God to tread him under our seet, and enable us to resist
his temptations, and quench his siery darts. But, says he
again, if God'much strong, much might, as the devil,
why God not kill the devil, so makehim no more wicked?
I was strangely surprised at his question, and after all,
though I was now an old man, yet I was but a young
doctor, and iil enough qualified for a casuist, or a solver
os difficulties: and, at fiist, I could not tell what to say;
so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what he
laid: but he was too earnest for an answer to forget his
question; so that he repeated it in the very same broken
words, as above. But this time I had recovered mysclsa
little, and I laid, God will at last punish him severely, he
is reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the
bottomless pit, te dwell with everlasting fire: this did
not satisfy Friday; but he returns upon me repeating my
words,. Reserve at last, me no understand: but why not
kill the devil now, not kill great ago? You may as well
?.fk me, said I, why Cod does not kill you and me, when
we do wicked things here that offend him: we are pre-
served to repent and be pardoned. He mules a while at
this; Well, well, savs he, mighty afsectionately, that well,
so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, God
pardon all: here I was run down again by him to the
last degree, and it was a testimony" to me, how the mere
notions of nature, though they will guide reasonable
creatures to the knowledge of a God, and of a worship
or homage due to the supreme being of Geld, as the
consequence of our nature; yet nothing but divine re-
velation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of
a redemption purchased for us: of a mediator; of 'anei*f
covenant; and of an intercessor at the footstool.of God's
throne, I say nothing but a revelation from heaven can
form these in the foul, and that therefore the Qpfpel of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, [ mean- the word of
God, and the spirit of God, promised for the guide and
ianctifier of his people, are the absolutely necessary in-
structors of the fouls of men in the saving knowledge of
God, and the means of salvation.
I therefore diverted the present discourse between me
and my man, rising up hastily, as.upon some sudden oc-
casion of going out; then sending him for something a
great way off, 1 -seriously prayed to God, that he would
enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage, assisting
by his Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant creature to
receive the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, re-
conciling him to himself, and would guide me to. speak
so to him from the word of God, as his conscience
might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved:
when he came again to me, I entered into a long dis-
course with him upon the subject of the redemption of
man by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine of
the Gospel preached from heaven, viz. of the repent-
ance towards God, and faith in our blessed Lord Jesus:
I then explained to him, as well as 1 could, why our
blessed Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels,
but the feed of Abraham, and how for that reason the
sallen angels had no share in the redemption; that he
Came only to the loll sheep of the house of Israel, and ther
like.
1 had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge, in
all the methods 1 took for this poorcreature's instruction:
and must acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon
the same principle will sind, that in- laying things open
to him, I really informed and instructed myself in many
things that either I did not know, or had not sully con-
.sidered before ; but which occurred naturally to my mind,
upon my searching into them, for the information of this
poor savage; and I had more afsection in my enquiry
after things upon this occasion, than ever I selt before;
so that whether this poor wild wretch was the better for
me or no, I had great reason to be thanksul, tha,t ever
he came to me: my grief sat lighter upon me, my ha-
bitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure: and
when I reflected, that in this solitary lise which I had
been consined to, I had not only been moved myself to
K (i look
look up to heaven, and to seek to the hand that brought
me thither, tut was now to be made an instrument, under
Providence, to save thelise, and, for aught I know, the
soul, of a poor savage, and bring him to the true know-
ledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine, that he
might know Christ Jesus, to know whom is lise eternal;
I say, when 1 reflected upon all things, a secret joy ran
through every part of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced,.
that ever I was brought to this place, which I had often
thought the most dreadsul of all afssictions that could
possibly have besallen me.
In this thanksul frame 1 continued all the remainder
of my time, and the conversation which employed the
hours betwsen Friday and me was such, as made the
three years which we lived there together persedtly and
completely happy, if any such thing as complete happi-
ness can be found in a sublunary state: the savage was
new a good Christian-, a much better than (; though I
have reason 'to hope, and bless God for it, that we were
equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents; we.
had here the Word of God to read, and no sarther off
from his Spirit to instruct, that if we had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the scripture, and
to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of what
I read; and he again, by his serious enquiries and ques-
tions, made me, as I said before, a much better scholar in
the scripture knowledge, thnn I should ever have been
by my own mere private reading : another thing I can-
not refrain from observing here also from experiences in
this retired part of my lise; viz. how insinite and inex-
pressible a blessing it is, that ihe knowledge of God, and
of the doctiine of salvation by Christ Jesus, is so plainly
laid down in the Woid of God, so easy to be received and
understood, that as the bare reading the scripture.made
me capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry
me directly on to the great work of sincere repentance?
for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for lise and
salvation, 'io a stated reformation in practice, and obe-
dience to all Gad's commands, and this without any
teacher or instructor (I mean, human),so the plain in-
struction sufficiently served to the enlightening this savage
creature, and bringing him to be such a Christian, as I
have known sew equal to him in my lise. As
205
As to the disputes, wranglings, strise, and contention,
whichhave happened in the world about religion, whether'
nicetiPs in doctrines, or schemes of church government,
they were all persectly useless to us, as,' for aught I can
yet see, they have been to all the rest in she world; we
had the sure guide to heaven, viz. the Word of God;
and we had, blessed be God, comfortable views of the
Spirit of God, teaching and instructing us by his Word,
leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and
obedient to the instruction of his Word; and I cannot see
the least use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed
points in religion, which have made such consusions in
the world, would have been to us, if we could have ob-
tained it; but I must go on with the historical part of
things, and take every part in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately acquaintedi
and that he could understand almost all 1 laid to him,
and speak fluently, though in broken English, to me; I
acquainted him with my own story, or at least so much
of it as related to my coming into the place, how I had
lived there, and how long; I let him into the mystery
(for such it was to him) of gunpowder and bullets, and
taught him how-to shoot; i gave him a knise, which he
was wondersully delighted with, and I made him a belt
with a srog hanging to it, such as in England we wear
hangers in; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I
gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a
weapon in some cases, but much more usesul upon many
occasions.
Tdescribed to him the countries of Europe, and parti-
cularly England, which I came from; how we lived,
how we worshipped God, how we beha.'-^d to one an-
other, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the
world; I gave him an account of the wreck which I had
been on board of, and shewed him, as near as I could,
the place where she lay; but she was all beaten in pieces
long before, and quite gone.
I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when
we escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole
strength then, but was now sallen almost all to pieces;
,upon seeing this boat, Eiday stood musing a great while,
and said nothing; I asked him what it was he studied
upon?
4 . •
upon? at last, says he, Me see such boat like come to
place at my nation.
I did not understand him a good while; but at last,
when I had examined surther into it, I understood by
him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore
upon the country where he lived ; that is, as he explained
it, was driven thither by stress of weather: I presently
imagined, that some European ship must have been cast
away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose, and
drive ashore; but was so dull j that I never once thought
of men making escape from a wreck thither, much less
whence they might come; so I only enquired after a de-
scription of the boat.
Friday described' the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand hiYn, when he adited,
with some warmth, We save the white mans from drown:
Then I presently asked him, if there were :'.ny white mans,
as he called them, in the boat: Yes, he said, the boat sull
of white mans: I asked him, how many? he told upon
his fingers seventeen: I asked him then what became of
them? he told me, They live, they dwell at my nation.
This put new thoughts into my head again ; for I
presently imagined, that these might be the men belong-
ing to the ship that was cast away in light of my island,
as I now call it; and who, after the ship was struck on
the rock, and they saw her inevitably tost, had saved
themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild
shore among the savages.
Upon this I enquired of him more critically, what.was
become of them; he assured me they lived still there,
that they had been there a'bout four years, that the savages
let them alone, and gave them victuals to live: 1 asked
him, how it came to pass they did not kill them, and
eat them? He said, No, they make brother with them:
that is, as I understood him, a truce: and then he add-
ed, Tliey eat no mans but when make the war sight:
that is to say, they never eat any men, but such as come
to sight with them, and are taken in battle.
It was after this, some considerable time, that being
on the top of the hill, at the east side of the island,
from whence', as 1 have said, I had in a clear day disco-
vered the mainor.continent of America; Friday, the wea-
'ther
ther being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the
main land, arid in a kind of surprise sails a jumping and
dancjng, and calls out to me, for I was at some distance
from him; I asked him what was the matter! Ojoy!
says he, O glad! these see my country, there my nation!
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared
in his sace, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance
discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to
be in his own country again; and this observation of
mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made
me at first not so easy about my new man Friday, as
I was before; and I made no doubt, but that if Friday
could get back to his own nation again, he would not
only forget all hi* religion, but all his obligations to
me; and would be forward enough to give his country-
men an account of me, and come back, perhaps with
an hundred or two of them, and make a seast upon me,-
at which he might be'' as merry as he used to be with those
of his enemies, when they were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much,
for which I was very sorry afterwards: however, as my
jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, I was a
little more circumspect, and not so samiliar and kind to -
him as before; in which I was certainly in the wrong
too, the honest gratesul creature having no thought
about it, but what consisted of the best principles, both
as a religious Christian, and as a gratesul friend, as ap-
peared afterwards to my sull satisliiction.
Whilst my jealousy of himlasted, you may be surel was
everyday pumping him to lee if he would discover any
of the new thoughts, which I suspected were in him; but
I found every thing hz said was so honest, and so innocent,
that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion: and,
in spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely
his own again ; nor did he in the least perceive that I was
uneasy ; and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.
One day walking up the same hill, but the wea-
ther being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the
continent, 1 called to him, and said, Friday, do not
you with yourself in your own country, your own na-
tion? Yes, he laid, 1 be much O glad to be at-my own
nation. What would you do there? laid I: would you
turn
turn wild again, eat m«ns flesh again, and be a savage
as you were before? He looked sull of concern, and,
shaking his head, said, No, no, Friday tell them*o live
good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattle-flesh, milk, no eat man again. Why then, said I to
him, they will kill you : he looked grave at that, and then
said, No, they no kill me^ they willing love learn; he
meant by this, they would be willing to learn; he added,
they learned much of the bearded mens that came in th»
boat: then I asked him, if he would go back to them?
He smiled afethat, and told me he could not swim so sar;
I told him I would make a canoe for him; he told me
he would go if I would go with him. I go! said I,
why they will eat me if I come there; No, no, says he,
me make them no eat you, me make they much love you;
he meant he would tell them how 1 had killed his ene-
mies and saved his lise, and so he would make them
love me; then he told me as well as he could, how kind
they were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he
called them, who came on shore in distress.
From this time I consess, I had a mind to venture
over, and see if I could possibly join with these bearded'
men, who 1 made no doubt, were Spaniards or Portu-
guese; not doubting but, if I could, we might find some
method to escape from thence, being upon the conti-
nent, and a good company together, better than I could
from an island forty miles ofs the' shore, and alone with-
out help: so, after some days, I took Friday to work
again, by way of discourse ; and told him, I.would give
him a boat to go back to his own nation; and accord-
ingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other
tide of the island; and having cleared it of water (for I
always kept it sunk in the water) I brought it out, shewed
it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous sellow at managing;
it, would make it go almoil as iwift and sast again as I
could; so when he was in, I said to him, Well, now
Friday, shall we go to your nation? He looked very
dull at my saying so, which, it seems, was because he
thought the boat too small to go so sar; I told him then
I had a bigger; so thenext day, I went to the place
wbere the first boat lay which 1 had made, but which I
could
.could not get into the water; he said that was big
enough; but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it
had lain two or three and twenty years there, the sun
had split and dried it, that it was in a manner rotten,
Fridaytold me, such a boat would do very well, and
would carry, 'much'enough vittle, drink, bread,' that
was his way of talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my
design of going over with him to the continent, that I
told him we would go and make one as big as that, and
he should go home in it. He answered not one word,
but looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was
the matter with him. He asked me again, thus, Why you
angry mad with Friday? what me done? I asked him
what he meant; I told him I was not angry with him at
all: No angry 1 no angry! says he, repeating the words
several times, Why send Friday home away to my na-
tion ? Why, said I, Friday, did not you say yon withed
you were there ? Yes, yes, says he, wish be both there, no
wish Friday there, no master there. In a word, he
would not think of going there without me. 1 go there,
Friday! said I, what sliould I do there? He turned very
quick upon me at this; You do great deal much good,
says he, you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans;
you tell them know God, pray God, and live new lise;
Alas, Friday, said I, thou knowest not what thou sayest;
I am but an ignorant man myself. Yes, yes, says he,
you teechee me good, you teechee them good. No, no,
Friday, said I, you shall go without me; leave me here
to live by myself, as I did before. He looked consused
again at that word, and running to one of the hatchets
which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives
it me. - What must I do with this? said I to him: you
take kill Friday, says he. What must I kill you for?
said I again. He returns very quick, What you send
Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday
away. This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tear^
stand in his eyes. - In a word, I ib plainly discovered
the utmost assection in him to me, and a firm resolu-
tion.in him, that 1 told him then, and often after, that
I would never send him away from me, if he was willing
to stay with me. . • -
210 advintur.es OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse, a
settled assection to me, and that nothing should part
him from me, so I found all the foundation of his de-
sire to go to his own country, was laid in his ardent af-
fection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them
good; a thing, which as I had no notion of myself, so
I had not the least thought, or intention, or desire of un-
dertaking it; but still I found a strong inclination to my
attempting an escape, as above, founded on the supposi-
tion gathered from the former discourse: viz. that there
were seventeen bearded men there; and therefore, with-
out 'any delay, I went to work with Friday, to find out
a great tree, proper to sell, and make a large periagua
or canoe, to undertake the voyage: there were trees
enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of
periaguas and canoes only, but even of good large ves-
sels.; but the main thing I looked at, was to get one so
near the water, that we might launch it when it was
made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first.
At last, Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he
knew much better than 1, what kind of wood was fittest
for it; nor can I tell to this day, what wood to call the
tree we cut down, except that it was very like the tree
we call sustick, or between that and the Nicaragua
wood, for it was much of the same colour and smell:
Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this
tree out, to make it into a boat: but I shewed him how
rather to cut it out with tools, which after I shewed him
how to use, he did very handily,-and in about a month's
hard labour we finished it, and made it very hand-
some, especially when with our axes, which 1 shewed
him how to handie,-we cut and hewed the outside into
the true shape of a boat; after this, however, it cost us
near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it were inch
by inch, upon great rollers into the water: but when'
she was in, me would have carried twenty men with great
«ase.
When she was in the water, and though she was so big,
it amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swist
my man Friday could manage her, turn her, and pad-
dle her along; so I asked him if he would, and if we;
might venture over in her: Yes, he laid, he venture over
ia
in her very well, though great blow wind; however, I had
a sarther design that he knew nothing of, and that was
to make a mail and sail, and to fit her with an anchor
and cable: as to a mast, that was easy enough to get;
so I pitched upon a strait young cedar-tree, which 'J
found hear the place, and which there was a great plenty
- of in the island: and I set Friday to work to cut it
down, a'nd gave him directions how to shape and order
it: bist as to the sail, that was my particular care;
-I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails
enough; but as I had them now twenty-six years by
me, and had not been very caresul to preserve them,
not imagining that I should ever have this kind of use
for them, I tlid not doubt'but they were all rotten; and
indeed molt of them were so; however, I found two
pieces which appeared pretty good, and with these I
went to work, and with a great deal of pains, and awk-
ward tedious stitching (you may be sure) for want of
needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing,
like what we call in England a moulder of mutton saj),
to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at
the top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with,
anv such as I knew best how to manage ; - because it was
such a one as I used in the boat in which I made my escape
from Barbary, as related in the first/part of my story.
I was near two months persorming this last work;
-viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finished
them very complete, making a .small stay, and a sail or
foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn to windward;
and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the
stem of her, to steer with; and though I was but a
bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the usesulness, and
even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so
much pains to do it, that at last 1 brought it to pass,
though xonsidering the many dull contrivances I had for
it that sailed, I think it cost me almost as much labour as
making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my boat;
for though he knew very well how to paddle the canoe,
he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a rudder,
and was the most amazed when he saw-me work the
- boat
boat to-and-again in the sea by the rudder, and how the
sail gybed, and filled this way or that way, as the course
we sailed changed; 1 say, when he saw this, he stood
like one astonished and amazed: however, with a little
use, I made all-these things samiliar to him, and he be-
came an expert sailor, except that as to the compass, I
could make'him understand very little of that: on the
other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather, and
seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there -was the less
occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to be
seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the
rainy seasons; and then nobody cared to stir abroad,
either by land or sea.
- I was now' entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of
my captivity in this place ; . though the three last years
that I had this creature with me, ought rather to be
left out of the account, my habitation being quite of
another kind than in all the rest of my time. I kept
the anniversary of my landing here with the same thank-
sulness to God for his mercies as at first; and jf I had
such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more
so now, having such additional testimonies of the care os
Providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being
essectually and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible
'impression upon my thoughts, that my deliverance was'
at hand, and that I should not be another year in ^his
place: however, I went on with my husbandry, digging,
planting, sencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my
grapes, and did every necessary thing, as before.
The rainy season was in the mean time upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times;
so I had stowed our new vessel' as sccitre as we could,
bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and
haling her up to the shore,' at high-water mark, I
made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough
for her to float in; and then when the tide was out,
we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the
water out;' and so she lay dry, as to the tide, from
the sea; and to keep the rain off, we laid a great
many boughs of trees so thick, that she was as well
thatched
thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the months
of November and December, in which I designed to-
make my adventure.
When the settled season began to come in, as the
thought of my design returned with the sair weather,
I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the sirst thing
I did was to lay up a certain quantity of provision, being,
the store for the voyage; and intended, in a week, or a
fortnight's time, to open the dock, and launch out our ,
boat. I was busy cne morning upon something of this
kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the sea-
stiore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing
which we generally got once a week, for the sake of the
eggs, as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone,
when he came running back, and flew over my outward
wall, or sence, like one that selt not the ground, orvthe
steps he set his seet on; and before I had time to speak
to him, he cried out to me, O master! O master ! O sor-
row ! .6 bad! What's the matter, Friday? said I. O
yonder there, says he, one, two, three, canoe! one, two,
three! By this way of speaking I concluded there were
fix; but on enquiry I found there were but three. Well,
Friday, said T, do not be frighted; so I heartened him up
as well as I could. However, 1 saw the poor sellow most
terribly scared; for nothing ran in his head but that they
were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces,
and eat him. The poor sellow trembled so, that I scarce
knew what to do with him. I comforted him as well as
1 could, and told him I was in as much danger as he,
and that they would eat me as well as him. But, said I,
Fridays we must resolve to-fight them. Can you fight,
Friday? Me shoot, says he, but there come many great
number. No matter- for that, said I again; our guns
will fright them that we do not kill. 'So I asked him,
whether, if I resolved to desend him, he would desend me,
and stand by me, and do just as I bade him? He said,
me die, when you bid die, master; so I went and setched
a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I had been so
good a husband of my rum, that 1 had a great deal left.
When he had drank it, I made him take the twp fowl-
ing pieces which weUlways.carried, and load them with
large swan shot, as big as t'raall jjiiiol-bulkts ; then I took
*-..?-:.< four
four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five
small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a
brace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspec-
tive glass, and went up to the fide of the hill, to see what
I could discover; and I found quickly, by my glass, that
thwe were one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and
three canoes: and that their whole'business seemed to be
the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies;
a barbarous seast indeed, but nothing more than as I had
observed was usual with them.
I observed also, that they were landed, not where they
had done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my
creek,-where the shore was low, and where a thick wood
came close almost down to the sea. This, with the ab-
horrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came
about, so silled me with indignation, that I came down
again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down
to them, and kill them all, and asked him if he would
stand by me. He was now gotten over his fright; and
his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given
him, he was very cheersul; and told me, as before, he
would die when I bid die.
In this fit of sury, I teok first and divided the arms
which I had charged, as before, between us. I gayeFri-
day one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon
his shoulder, and I took one pistol, and the other three
myself, and in this posture we marched out. I took a
small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a
large bag with more powder and bullet; and as to or-
ders, 1 charged him to keep close behind me, and not -to
stir, shoot, or do any thing till I bid him; and in the
mean time, not to speak a word. In this posture I setched
a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get
over the creek as to get into the wood; so that I might
come within shot. of them before I could be discovered,
which I had seen by my glass it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former thoughts
returning, 1 began to abate my resolution. I do not.rriean
that I entertained any sear of their number; for as they
were naked, unarmed wretches, 'tis certain I was superior
to
to them; nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred
to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much lets
what necessity I was in to go and dip my hands in blood,
to attack people who had neither done or intended me any
wrong, who, as to me, were innocent, and whose barba-
rous customs were their own disaster, being in them d
token indeed of God's having left them, with the other
nations of that part of the world, to such stupidity and
to such inhuman courses; but did not call me to take
upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an exe-
cutioner of his justice; that whenever he thought fit, he
would take the cause into his own hands, and by nation-
al vengeanse, punish them for national crimes; but that
in the mean time it was none of my business. That it
was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawsul for him to attack them; but I
couM not say the same with respect to me. These things
were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as
I went, that I resolved I would only go place myself near
them, that I might observe their barbarous seast, and
that I would act then as God should direct; but that un-
less something offered that was more a call to me than
yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the wood, and with
all possible wariness and silence (Friday following close
at my heels), I marched till I came to the skirt of the
wood, on the side which was next to them; only that
one corner of the wood lay between me and them.—
Here 1 called softly to Friday, and shewing him a great
tree, which was just at the corner of the wood, I bade
nim go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see.
there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and
came immediately back to me, and told me they might
be plainly viewed there; that they were all about the
fire, eating the stem of one of their prisoners; and that
another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them,
whom he said tfiey would kill next, and which fired the
very soul within me. He told me it was not one of their
nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had told
me of, who came to their country in the boat. I was
filled with horror at the very naming the white-bearded
man,
man, and, going to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glassy'
a white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his
hands and his seet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and
that he was ah. European, and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond its
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I
was, which, by going a little way about, I saw I might
come at undiscovered, and that then I should be within
half shot of them; so I with-held my passion, though I
was indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going back
about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which
held all the way till I came to the other tree, and then I
came to a little rising; ground, which gave me a sull view
of them, at the distance of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of the T.
dreadsul wretches sat upon the ground all close huddled';
together, and had just sent the other two to butchejjirthe
poor Christian, and bring him perhaps limb by lirn^.'to
their fire, and they were stooped down to untie the bands
at his seet. I turned to Friday. Now, Friday, said I, c/o
as I bid thee. Friday said he would. Then Friday, said k
do exactly as you see me do; sail in nothing. So.^l;set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon tsh«
.ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with theothefa**
musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him do tVg[M&'
like. Then asking him if he was ready, he said yes. TherSSff:
'fire at them, said I, and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the
side that he shot, he killed it wo of them, and wounded
three more; and on my side I killed oney and wounded
two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadsul conster-
nation ; - and all of them, who were not hurt, jumped i>§
upon their seet immediately, but did not know which way
to run, or which way to look, for they knew not,from
whence their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes
close upon me, that as I had bid him, he might observe i
what I did; so as soon as the first shot was made, I threy*'
down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and
Friday did the like; he sees me cock, and present; he. did
the same again. Are you ready, Friday? said I. Yfs»
says he. Let fly then, said I, in the name of God; and
with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and
so did Friday, and as our pieces were now loaden with
i'. what I called swan-shot, or small pistol bullets, we found
only two drop, but so many were wounded, that they
ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, ail
bloody and miserably wounded, most of them; whereos
three more sell quickly after, though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, said I, laying down the discharged piece*,
and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, follow
me, said I, which he did, with a deal of courage; upon
which I rushed out of the wood, and shewed myself, and
Friday close at my foot. As soon as I perceived they saw
me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so
too; and running as sast as I could, which, by the way,
was not very sast, being loaded with arms as 1 was, I made
directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, ly-
ing upon the beach or shore, between the place where
they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were just
going to work with him, had left him, at the surprise of
ourfirst fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side,and
had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest made
the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step
forwards, and fire at them. He understood me immedi-
ately, and running about forty yards to be near them, he
shot at them; as 1 thought, he had killed them all; for I
saw them all fall on an heap into the boat; though I saw
two of them up again quickly. However, he killed two
of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in
the bottom of the boat, as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my
knise, and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and
loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him,
in the Portuguese tongue, what he was! He answered,
rh Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and saint, that
he could scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of
my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that he should
drink, which he did; and I gave him a pjfce of bread,
which he eat. Then I asked him what countryman he
was-? and he said, Espagnole; and being a little reco-
• vered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly
make, how much he was in debt for his deliverance.—
Seignior, said I, with as much Spanish as I could make
up, we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now.—

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
If you have any strength left, take this pistol and sword,
and lay about you. He took them very thanksully; and
no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they
had put new vigour into him, he flew upon his murder-
ers like a sury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an
instant: for the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to
- them, so the poor creatures were so much afrighted with
'the noise of our pieces, that they sell down for mere
amazement and sear, and had no more power to attempt
their own escape than their flesh had to resist our shot;
and that was the case of the five that Friday shot in the
'boat; for as three of them sell with the hurt they re-
ceived, so the other two sell with the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being
willing to keep my charge ready, because I had given the
Spaniard my pistol and sword;—so I called to Friday, and
- bade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired,
and setch the arms, which lay there, that had been dis-
charged, which he did with great swiftness; and then
giving him my musket, I sat down myself to load all the
rest again, and bade them come to me when they wanted,
While I was loading these pieces, there happened a sierce
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages,
'who made at him with one of their greatwooden swords,
the same weapon that was to have killed him before, if I
'had not prevented it. The Spaniard who was as bold
end as brave as could be imagined, though weak, had
fought this Indian a good while, and had cut him two
; i;reat wounds in his head; but the savage being a stout
lusty sellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down,

when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting
hissword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage
'through the body, and killed him upon the spot, before

Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the flying
wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet;
'und with that he dispatched those three, who, as I sraid
before, w ere wounded at first and sallen, and all the rest
he could come up with; and the Spaniard coming to
me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with
which he pursued two of the savages, and wounded them

both: but as he was not able to run, they both got from
him into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and
killed one of them; but the other was too nimble for
him; aud though he was wounded, yet he plunged into
the sea, and swam, with all his might, osf to those w ho
were left in the canoe, which three in the canoe, with
one wounded, who we know not whether he died or no,
were all that escaped our hands of one aud twenty. The
account of the rest is as follows :—
3 Killed at our shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat
2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.
1 Killed by ditto, in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropt here and there of their
wounds, or killed by Friday in the chace os them.
4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not
dead.
21 in all.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out
of gun-shot; and though Friday made two or three shots
at them, I did not find that he hit any of them. Friday
•would sain have made me take one of their canoes, and
pursue them; and indeed I was very anxious about their
escape, lest, carrying the news home to their people,
they should come back, perhaps, with two or three
hundred of their canoes, and devour us by mere mul-
titudes; so I consented to pursue them by sea; and
running to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade
Friday follow me; but when I was in the canoe, I was
surprised to find another poor creature lie there alive,
bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the
slaughter, and almost dead with sear, not knowing
what the matter was; for.he had not been able to look
up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard, neck
and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had
really little lise in him.
h 2 lire
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, with
which they had bound him, and would have helped him
up, but he could not stand or speak, but groaned most
piteously, believing, it seems, still that he was only un-
bound in order to be killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him,
and tell him os his deliverance; and pulling out my bot-
tle, made him give the poor wretch a dram, which, with
the news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat
up in the boat ;'but when Friday came to hear him speak,
and looked in his sace, it would have moved any one to
tears, to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced
and hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped,
danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat
. his own sace and head, and then sung and jumped about
again, like a distracted creature. I was a good while
before I could make him speak to me, or tell me what
was the matter; but when he came a little to himself,
told me it was his sather.
It was not easy for me to express how it moved me; to
sec what extacy and filial assection had worked in this
poor savage at the sight of his sather, and of his being
delivered from death; nor indeed can I describe half the
extravagancies of his affection after this; for he went
into the boat and out of the boat a great many times.
When he went in to him, he would sit down by him,
open his breast, and hold his sather's head close t» his
bosom, half an hour together, to nourish it. Then. he
took his arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff
with the binding, and chased and rubbed them with his
hands; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him
some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which did
them a great deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe
with the other savages, who were now gotten almost out
of sight; and it was happy for us that we did not, for
it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they
could be gotten a quarter of their way, and continued
blowing so hard all night, and that from the north-
west, which was against them, that I could not suppose
their boat could live, or that they ever reached to their
own coast -• . .
But
But to return to Friday: he was so busy about his sa-
ther, that I could not find in my heart to take him offfor
some time; but after I thought he could leave him a lit-
tle, I called him to me, and he came jumping and laugh-
ing, and pleased to the highest extreme. Then I asked
him, if he had given his sather any bread? He shook his
head, and said, none; ugly dog eatall up self: so I gave
him a cake of bread out of a pouch I carried on purpose.
I also gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste
it, but carried it to his sather. I had in my pocket al 4a
two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave him a hand-
sul of them for his sather. He had no sooner given his
sather these raising, but I saw him come out of the boat,
and run awayas if he ha'd been bewitched. He ran at such
a rate (for he was the swiftest sellow of his seet that ever
I saw) I say he ran at such a rate that he was out of sight-
as it were in an instant; and though I called and hallooed
to him, it was all one; away he went, and in a quarter
of an hour I saw him come back again, though not so
sast as he went; and as he came nearer, I found his!
pace was slacker, because he had something in his hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been quite
home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring his sather some
fresh water; and that he had got two more cakes or
loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but the water
he carried to his sather. However, as I was very thirsty
too, I took a little sup of it. This water revived his fa-
ther more than all the rum or spirits I had given him,
for he was just sainting with thirst. When his sather
had drank, I called him, to know if there was any wa-
ter left. He said, yes; and I bade him give it to the
poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his
sather; and I sent one of the cakes that Friday brought
to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and
. was reposing himself upon a green place, under the
shade of a tree, and whose limbs were also very stiss,
and very much swelled with the rude bandage he had
been-tied with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming
to' him with the water, he sat up and drank, and took
the bread, and began eat, I went to him, and gave
him an handsul of raisins. He looked up in my sace with
all the tokens of gratitude and thanksulness that could
, - - l 3 appear
appear in any countenance; but was so weak, notwith-
standing he had so exerted himself in the sight, that he
could not stand up upon his seet: he tried to do it two
or three times, but was really notable, his ankles were
so swelled and so painsul to him; so I bade him sit
still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe
them with rum, as he had done his sather's. • •
I observed the poor affectionate creature every two
minutes, or less, all the while he was here, turned his
head about, to see if his sather was in the same place
aud posture as he left him sitting; and at last found he
was not to be seen; at which he started up, and without
speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that
one could scarce perceive his seet to touch the ground
as lie went; but when he came, he only found he had
laid himself down to ease his limbs: so Friday came
back to me presently, and I spoke to the Spaniard to
let Friday help him up, and lead him to the boat, and
then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would
take care of him: but Friday, a lusty young sellow,
took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried
him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the
side or gunnel of the canoe, with his seet on the inside of
it, and then lifted them quite in, and set him close to his
sather, and presently stepping out again, launched the
boat off, and paddled it along the shore saster than I
could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too; so
he brought them both sase into our creek, and leaving
them in the boat, runs away to setch the other canoe.
As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him whi-
ther he went? He told me, Go setch more boat; so away
he went, like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran
like him, and he had the other canoe in the creek almost
as soon as I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and
then went to help our new guests out of the boat, which
he did; but they were neither of them able to walk, so
that poor Friday knew not what to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and
calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank
while he came to me, I soon made a kind of hand-
barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them
up both together upon it between us; but when we got
them
AbvEtffuREs or lioBiNsbjf Crusoe. 22:^
them to the outside of our wall or fortification, we were
at a worse loss than before; for it was impossible to get
them over, and I was resolved not to break it down;
so I set to work again; and Friday aud I, in about two
hours time, made a very handsome tent, covered with
old sails, and above that with boughs of srees, being in
the space without our outward sence, and between that
aud the grove of young wood which I had planted;
and here we made two beds of such things as I had,
viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to
lie on, and another to cover them on each bed.
• My island was now peopled, and I thought myself
very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection which
I frequently made, how like a king I looked. First of
all, the whole country was my own mere property; so
that I had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly,
my people were persectly subjected. I was absolute lord
and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to me, aud were
ready to lay down their lives, if their had been occa-
sion for it, for me. It was remarkable too, I had but
three subjects, and they were of three disserent reli-
gions. My man Friday was a protestant; his sather a
pagan and a cannibal: and the Spaniard was a papist.
However, I allowed liberty of conscience through my
dominions; but this by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued priso-
ners, and given them shelter, and a place to rest them
upon, I began to think of making provision sor them:
and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a year-
ling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular
stock, to be killed; then I cut off the hinder quarter, and
chopped it into small pieces, I set Friday to work, to
boiling and stewing, and made them a very good dish, I
assure you, of flesh and broth; having put some bar-
ley and rice also into the broth, and as I cooked it with-
out doors, for I made no sire within my inner wallj so I
carried it all into the new tent; and having set a table
there for them, I sat dow n and cat my dinner also with
them; and, as well as I could, cheered them and en-
couraged them, Friday being my interpreter, especially
to his sather, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the
Spaniard spoke thq language of the savages pretty well.
U . After
A ft er we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Fri-
day to lake one of our canoes, and go and setch our mus-
kets and other firearms, which for want of time we had
left upon the place of battle; and the next day I ordered
him to go and bury the bodies of the savages, which lay
open to the sun, and would presently be offensive; and
I also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their
barbarous seast, which I knew were pretty much, and
v; hich I could not think of doing myself; nay, I could
not bear to see them, if I went that way: all which he
punctually performed, and desaced the very appearance
rf the savages being there; so that when I went again,
1 could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by
the corner of the wood pointing to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation with
»xy two new subjects; and first I setFridayto inquire of
his sather, what he thought of the escape of the savages
in that canoe, and whether he might expect a return of
them with a power greater than we could resist? His
fsrst opinion was, that the savages never could live out
(he storm which blew that night they Went off, but
n:ust of necessity be drowned or driven south to those
other shores, vbere they were as sure to bedevoured.as
they were to be drowned if they were cast away; but as
to what they would do if they came sase on shore, he
said, he knew not; but it was his opinion, that they were
i o dreadsully frighted with the manner of being attacked,
the noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell
their people they were all killed by thunder and light-
ning, and not by the hand of man; and that the two
which appeared (viz. Friday and I) were two heavenly
spirits or suries come down to destroy them, and not
men with weapons. This, he said, he knew, because he
heard them cry out so in their language to one another;
for it was impossible to them to conceive that a man
should dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a dis-
tance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now.
And this old savage was in the right, for, as I understand
since by other hands, the savages of that part never at-
tempted to go over to the island afterwards. They were
so terrified with the accounts given by those four men
(for it seems they did escape the sea) that they believed
whoever
whoever went to that enchanted island, would be de-
stroyed with fire from the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under
continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept al-
ways upon my guard, I and all my army; for as we
were now four of us, I would have ventured upon au
hundred of them sairly in the open field at any time.
In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing,
the sear of their coming wore off, and I began to take
my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into con-
sideration, being likewise assured by Friday's sather,
that I might depend upon good usage from their na-
tion on his account, if I would go.
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I had
a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I under-
stood, that there were sixteen more of his countrymen
and Portuguese, who having been cast away, and
made their escape to that side, lived there at peace in-
deed with the savages, but were very sore put to it for
necessaries, and indeed for lise. I asked him all the par-
ticulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish
ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata, to the Havanna,
being directed to leave their loading there, which was
chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back what Euro-
pean goods they could meet with there; that they had
five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out
of another wreck; that five of their own men were
drowned when first the ship was lost; and that these
escaped through insinite dangers and hazards, and ar-
rived almost starved on the Cannibal coast, where they
expected to have been devoured every moment.
He told me, they had some arms with them, but they
were persectly useless, for they had neither powder
nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled all their
powder but a little which they used at their sirst land-
ing to provide themselves some food.
I asked him what he thought would become of them
there; and if they had formed no design of making
any escape? He said, they had had many consultations
about it; but that having neither vessel, nor tools to
build one, nor provisions of any kind, their counsels
always ended in tears and despair.
1 5 I asked
I asked him how he thought they would receive a pro-
posal from me, which might tend towards an escape, and
whether, if they were all here, it might not be done 1 I
told him with freedom, I seared mostly their treachery
and ill usage of me, if I put my lise in their hands, for
that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of
man, nor did men always square their dealings by the
obligations they had received, so much as they did by
the advantages they expected: I told him, it would be
very hard that I should be the instrument of their deli-
verance, and that they should afterwards make me their
prisoner inNewSpain, where an Englishman was certain
to be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident
soever, brought him thither; and that I had rather be
delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than
sall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be car-
ried into the inquisition. I added, that otherwise I
was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with
so many hands, build a ba\k large enough to carry us
all away, either to the Brazils southward, or to the
islands or Spanish coast northward: but that if in re-
quital they should, when I had put weapons into their
hands, carry me by force among their own people, I
might be .ill used for my kindness to them, and make
my case worse than it was before. He answered with
a great dc»l of candour and ingenuity, that their con-
dition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of
it, that he believed they would abhor the thought of
using any man unkindly that should contribute to their
deliverance; and that, rf I pleased, he would go to
them with the old man, and discourse with them about
it, and return again, and bring me their answer; that
he would make conditions with them upon their solemn
oath, that they would be absolutely under my leading, as
their commander and captain; and that they should
swear upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be true to
me, and ga tv such Christian country as I should agree
to, and no other, and to be directed wholly and abso-
lutely by rcy orders till they were landed sasely in such
country as I intended; and that he would bring a con-
tract from them under their hands for that purpose.
Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself,
that
that he would never stir from me as long as he lived,
till I gave him order; and that he would take my sido
to the last drop of blood, if there should happen the
least breach of saith among his countrymen.
He told me, they were all of them very civil honest
men, and they were under the greatest distress imagin-
able, haviug neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food,
but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out of
all hopes of ever returning to their own country; and
that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief, they
would live and die by-me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to re-
lieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage and
this Spaniard over to them to treat; but when he had
gotten all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself
started an objection, which had so much prudence in it
on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand,
that I could not but be very well satisfied in it; and,
by his advice, put off the defiverance of his comrades
for at least half a year. The case was thus:
He had been with us now about a month; during
which time I had let him see in what manner 1 had pro-
vided, with the assistance of Providence, for my support;
and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice 1 had
lain up; which, as it was more than sufficient for my-
self, so it was not sufficient, at least, without gorid hus-
bandry, for my samily, now it was increased to number
four; but much less would it be sufficient, if his coun-
trymen, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive,
should come over; and least of all would it be snfficLmt
to victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a vo) age
to any of the Christian colonies of America. So he told
me, he thought it would be more adviseable, to let him
and the other two dig and cultivate some more land, as
much as I eoifd spare seed to sow ; and that we should
wait another harvest, that we might have a supo'v of
corn for his countrymen when they should come' for
want mi^ht be a temptation to them to disagrea, or not
to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of o::e
difficulty into another : you know, says lie, tho children
of srael, though they rejoiced at sirst at their being de-
livered out of Egypt, yet rebelled against Gcd himself,
that
that delivered them, when they came to want bread in
the wilderness.
His caution was so seasonable, and bis advice so good,
that I could not but be very well pleased with his propo-
sal, as well as I was satisfied with his fidelity: so we sell
to digging, all four of us, as well as the wooden tools we
were surnished with permitted; and in about a month's
time, by the end of which it was seed time, we had got-
ten as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed
twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice,
which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare ; nor
indeed did we leave ourselves barely sufficient for our
own food for the six months that we had to expect our
crop, that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our
s«ed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it
is six months in the ground in that country.
Having now society enough, and our numbers being
susficient to put us out of sear of the savages, if they had
come, unless their number had been very great, we went
freely all over the island, wherever we found occasion;
and as here we had our escape or deliverance upon our
thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the
means of it out of mine ; to this purpose, I marked out
/ several trees, which I thought fit for our work, and I set
Friday and his sather to cutting them down ; and then I
caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts
mi that afsair, to oversee and direct their work: I shewed
them with what indesatigable pains I had hewed a large
I rce into single planks, and I caused them to do the like,
fill they had made about a dozen large planks of good
oak, near two seet broad, thirty-five seet long, and from
two inches to four inches thick: what prodigious labour
it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time I contrived to increase my littleflock
of tame goats as much as I could ; and to this purpose I
made Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and my-
self. with Friday, the next day, for we took our turns,
and by this means we got about twenty young kids to
breed up with the rest; for whenever we shot the dam,
we saved the kids, and added them to our flock. But
above all, the season for curing the grapes coming on, I
caused such a prodigious quantity to be hungup in the
sun,' that I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the
raisins of the sun are cured, we should have filled sixty
or eighty barrels; and these with our bread, was a
great part of our food, and very good living too I assure
you; for. it is an exceeding nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order; it
was not the most plentisul I had seen in the island, but
however, it was enough to answer our end; for from
twenty-two bushels of barley,we brought in and threshed
out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like
in proportion of the rice, which was store enough for
our food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spa-
niards had been on shore with me; or, if we had been
ready for a voyage, it would very plentisully have vic-
tualled our ship, to have carried us to any part of the
world, that is to say, of America. When we had housed
and secured our magazine of corn, we sell to work to
make more wicker-work, viz. great baskets, in which we
kept it, and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous
at this part, and often blamed me, that I did not make
some things for desence, of this kind of work ; but I saw
no need of it: and now having a sull supply of food for
all the guests expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main, to see what he could do with those he
left behind him there: I gave him a strict charge in
writing not to bring any man with him who would not
first swear in the presence of himself and of the old sa-
vage, that he would no way injure, sight with, or
attack the person he should find in the island, who was
so kind to send for them in order to their deliverance;
but that they would stand by and desend him against
all such attempts; and wherever they went would be
entirely under, and subjected to his command: and
that this should be put in writing, and signed with
their hands. How we were to have this done, when I
knew they had neither pen nor ink, that, indeed, was
a question which we never asked.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old
savage (the Father of Friday) went away in one of the
canoes, which they'might be said to come in, or father
were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be
devoured by the savages.
• I gave
I gave each of them a musquet with a firelock on it,
and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging
them to be very good husbands of both, and not to use
either of them but upon urgent occasions.
This was a chearsul work, being the first measures
used by me in view of my deliverance for now 27 years
and some days ; I gave them provisions of bread, and of
dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and
sufficient for their countrymen for about eight days time;
and wishing them a good voyage, I let them go, agree-
ing with them about the signal they should hang out at
their return, by which I should know them again, when
they came back, at a distance, before they came on shore.
They went away with a sair gale on the day that the
moon was at the sull, by my account in the month of
October; but as for the exact reckoning of days, after
I had once lost it, I could never recover it again; nor
had I kept even the number of years so punctually, as
to be sure I was righf, though, as it proved, when I
afterwards examined my account, I found I had kept a
true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days' I waited for them, when
a strange and unforesoen accident intervened, of which
the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I
was sast asleep in my hatch one morning, when my man
Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, Master
master, they are come, they are come.
I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out
as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little
grove, which, by the way, was by this time grown to
be a very thick wood: 1 say regardless of danger, I
went without my arms, which was not my custom to do:
but I was surprised, when turning my eyes to the sea, I
presently saw a boat at about a league and an half's dis-
tance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder of mut-
ton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty sair
to bring them in: also I observed presently that they
did not come from that side which the shore lay on, but
from the southernmost end of the island: upon this I
called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these were
not the people we looked for, and that we did not
know yet whether they were friends or enemies.
In
*
In the next place, I went in -to setch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them; and having
taken the ladder out, I climbed outto the top of the hill,
as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any thing,
and to take my view the plainer without being dis-
covered.
I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye
plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about
two leagues and a half s distance from me, S. S. E. but
not above a league and a half from the shore. By my
observation it appeared plainly to be an English ship,
and the boat appeared to be an English long boat.
I cannot express the consusion I was in, though the
joy of seeing a ship, and one whom I had reason to
believe was manned by my own countrymen, and conse-
quently friends, was such as I cannot describe; but yet
I had some secret doubts hung about me, I cannot tell
from whence they came, bidding me keep upon my
guard. In the first place it occurred to me to consider
what business an English ship could have in that part of
the world; since it was not the way to or from any
part of the world where the English had any trasfick;
and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in
there, as in distress; and that, if they were really English,
it was most probable, that they were here upon no good
design; and that I had better continue as I was, than sall
into the hands of thieves and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of
danger which sometimes are given him when he may
think there is no possibility of its being real. That such
hints and notices are given us, I believe sew that
have made any observations of things can deny; that
they are certain discoveries of an invissible world, and
a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the
tendency of them seems to be to warn us of dan-
ger, why should we not suppose they are from some
friendly agent (whether supreme, or inserior and subor-
dinate, is not the question), and that they are given for
our good?
The present question abundantly confirms me in the
justice of this reasoning; sar had I not been made cau-
tious by this secret admonition, come from whence it
will,
will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a sar worse
condition than before, as you will see presently.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw
the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a
creek to thrust in at for the convenience of landing •/
however, as they did not come quite sar enough, they
did not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my
rafts, but ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at
about half a mile from me, which was very happy for
me; for otherwise they would have landed just, as I
may say, at my door, and would have soon beaten me
out of my castle, and, perhaps, have plundered me of
all I had.
When they were on shore, I was sully satisfied they
were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I
thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so: there
were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found
were unarmed, and as I thought bound: and when the
first four or five of them were jumped on shore, they
took those three out of the boat as prisoners : one of the
three I could perceive using the most passionate. ges-
tures of intreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind
of extravagance ; the other two, I could perceive, listed
up their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned in-
deed, but not to such a degree as the first.
I was persectly confounded at the sight, and knew not
what the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to
me in English, as well as he could, O master; you see
English mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans.—
Why, said I, Friday, do you think they are going to eat
them then? Yes, says Friday, they will eat them. No,
no, said I, Friday; I am afraid they will murder them
indeed: but you may be sure they will not eat them.
AH this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but stood trembling with the horror of the
sight, expecting every moment when the three prisoners
should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains
lift up his arm with a great cutlass (as the seamen call
it) or sword, to strike one of the poor men; and I
expected to see him sall every moment, at which all the
blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins.
I wished
233
V
'I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the savage
that was gone with him; or that I had any way to have
come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have
rescued the three men ; for I saw no sire-arms they had
among them; but it sell out to my mind another way.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of the
three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the sel-
lows ran scattering about the land, as if they wanted
to see the country: I observed also, that the three
other men had liberty to go where they pleased; but
they sat down all three upon the ground very pensive,
- This put me in mind of the first time when I came
on shore, and began to look about me ; how I gave my-
self over for lost, how wildly I looked round me, what
dreadsul apprehensions I had, and how I lodged in the
tree all night for sear of being devoured by wild beasts.
As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to
receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer
the land by the storms and tides, by which I have
since been so long nourished and supported, so these
three poor desolate men knew nothing how certain os
deliverance aud supply they were, how near it was to
them, and how effectually and really they were in a
Condition of sasety, at the same time they thought
themselves lost, and their case desperate.
So little do we see before us in the world, and so
much reason have we to depend chearfully upon the
great maker of the world, that he does not leave his
creatures so absolute destitute, but that in the worst
circumstances they have always something to be thank-
sul for, and are sometimes nearer their deliverance
than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their de-
liverance by which they seem to be brought to their
destruction.
It was just at the top of high-water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
parleying with the prisoners they brought, and partly
while they rambled about to see what kind of place they
were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide was spent,
and the water had ebbed considerably away, leaving
their boat aground.

They
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found
afterwards, having drank a little too much brandy, sell
asleep; however, one of them waking sooner than the
other, and rinding the boat too sast aground for him to
stir it, hallooed for the rest who were straggling about,
upon which they all soon came to the boat; but it was
past all their strength to launch her, the boat being very
heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft ousy sarid,
. almost like a quicksand.
In this condition, like true seaman, who are, perhaps,
the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave
it over, and away they strolled about the country again;
and I heard one of them say aloud to another (calling
them osf from the boat), Why let her alone Jack, can't
ye? she'll float next tide: by which I was sully consirmed,
in the main enquiry, of what countrymen they were.
All this while I kept myself close, not once daring to
stir out of my castle, any surther than to my place of
observation, near the top of the hill; and very glad
I was to think how well it was fortified: I knew it was
no less than ten hours before the boat could be on float
again, and by that time it would be dark, and I might
be more at liberty to see their motions, and to hear their
discourse, if they had any.
In the mean time I fitted myself up for battle, as be-
fore, tho' with more caution, knowing I had to do with
another kind of enemy than I had at first; I ordered Fri-
day also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with
his gun, to load himself with arms: I took myself two
fowling-pieces, and I gave him three musquets: my figure
indeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin
coat on, with the great cap I mentioned, a naked sword,
two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made
any attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock,
being the heat of the day, I found that in short they
were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I
thought. were all laid down to sleep; the three poor
distrsessed men, too anxious for their condition to get
any sleep, were however sat down under the shelter of
a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and
as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,and learn
something of their condition: immediately I marched in
the figure above, my man Friday at a good distance be-
hind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not mak-
ing quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as 1 could, and then
before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in
Spanish, What, are ye, Gentleman]
They started up at the noise, but were ten times more
confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth sigure
that I made: they made no answer at all, but I thought
I perceived them just going to fly from me, when I spoke
totheminEnglish. Gentlemen, said 1, do not be surprised
at me; perhaps you may have a friend near you when
you did not expect it: he must be sent directly from
heaven then, said one of them very gravely to me, and
pulling ofs his hat at the same time, for our condition is
past the help of man. All help is from heaven, Sir,
said I: but you can put a stranger in the. way how to
help you 1 For you seem to be to me in some great dis-
tress: I saw you when you landed; and when you
seemed to make application to the brutes that came with
you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you.
The poor man, with tears running down his sace,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, Am
I talking to God or man? Is it a real many.'or an angel?
Be in no sear about that, Sir, said I: if God had sent
an angel to relieve you, he would have come better
clothed, and armed after another manner, than you see
me in: pray lay aside your sears; I am a man, an Eng-
lishman, and disposed to assist you, you see; I have one
servant only; we have arms and ammunition? Tell us
freely, can we serve you? What is your case?
Our case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you, while
our murderers are so near; but in short Sir, I was com-
mander of that ship; my men having mutinied against
me, they having been hardly prevailed on not to murder
me, and at last have sent me on shore in this desolate place,
with these two men with me, one my mate, the other a
passenger, wheffe we expect to perish, believing the place
to be uninhabited, and know nos yet what to think of it.
• Where are those brutes, your enemies? said I; do
you
you know where they are gone? There they are, sir,
said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; my heart trem-
bles for sear they have seen us, and heard you speak; if
they have, they will certainly murder us all.
Have they any fire-arms? said I: he answered they
had only two pieces, and one which they left in the boat.
Well then, said I, leave the rest to me; I see they are all
asleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we
rather take them prisoners? He told me there were two
desperate villains among them, that it was scarce sase to
shew any mercy to; but if they were secured, he be-
lieved all the rest would return to their duty. I asked
him, which they were? He told me, he could not at that
distance describe them; but he would obey my orders ia
any thing I would direct. Well, said I, let us retreat
out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we
will resolve farther: so they willingly went back with
me, till the woods covered us from them.
Look you, sir, said I, if I venture upon your delive-
rance, are you willing to make two conditions with me?
He anticipated my proposals by telling me, that both
he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed
and commanded by me in every thing; and if the ship
was not recovered, he would live and die with me in
what part of the world soever I would send him; and
the other two men said the same.
Well, said I4 my conditions are but two: 1. That
while you stay on this island with me, you will not pre-
tend to any authority here ; and if 1 put arms into your
hands, you will upon all occasions give them up to me,
and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island,
and in the mean time to be governed by me 2. That
if the ship is or may be recovered, you will carry me
and my man to England, passage free.
He gave me all the'assurance that the invention and
faith of a man could devise, that he would comply with
these most reasonable demands, and besides would owe
his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions as
long as he lived.
Well then, said I, here are three musquets for you,
with powder and ball: jtell me what next you think is
proper to be done. He shewed all the testimony of his
gratitude
gratitude that he was able; but offered to be wholly
guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard ven-
turing any thing, but the best method 1 could think of,
was to fire upon them at once, as they lay; and if any
were not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit,
we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's
providence to direct the shot.
He said very modestly that he was loth to kill them,
if he could help it; but that those two were incorrigible
villains, and had been ,the authors of all the mutiny in
the ship; and if they escaped we should be undone still;
for they would go on board, and bring the whole ship's
company, and destroy us all. Well then, said I, neces-
sity legitimates my advice ; for it is the only way to save
our lives. However, seeing him still cautious of shed-
ding blood, 1 told him they should go themselves, and
manage as they found convenient. ,
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet.
I asked him if either of them were the men who he had
said were the heads of the mutiny? He said, no. Well
then, said 1, you may let them escape, and Providence
seems to have wakened them on purpose to save them-
selves: now, said I, if the rest escape, it is your sault.
Animated with this, he took the musquet I had given
him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and his two
comrades with him, with each man a piece in his hand.
The two men, who were with him going first, made some
noise, at which one of the seamen, who was awake,
turned about, and seeing them coming, cried out to the
rest, but it was top late then; for the moment he cried
out, they fired, I mean the two men, the captain wisely
reserving his own piece; they had so well aimed their
shot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed
on the spot, and the other very much wounded ; but not
being dead, he started up on his seet, and called eagerly
for help to the other; but the captain, stepping to him,
told him it was too late to cry for help; he should call
upon God to forgive his villainy; and with that word
knocked him down with the stock of his musquet, so
that he never spoke more : there were three more in the
company, and one of them was also slightly wounded.
By this time I was come; and when they saw their dan-
ger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged sor
mercy: the captain told them, he would spare their
lives, if they would give him any assurance of their ab-
horrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and
would swear to be saithsul to him in recovering the ship,
and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaca, from
whence they came: they gave him all the protestations
of their sincerity that Could be desired, and he wa9 wil-
ling to believe them and spare their lives, which I was
not against; only I obliged them to keep them bound
hand and foot while they were upon that island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring
away the oars and sail, which they did; and by and by
three straggling men, that were (happily for them) part-
ed from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns
fired; and seeing their captain, who before was their
prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be
bound also, and so our victory was complete.
I now remained that the captain and I should enquire
into one another's circumstances. I began first, and told
him my whole history, which he heard with an attention
even to amazement, and particularly at the wondersul
manner of my being surnished with provisions aud am-
munition; and indeed, as my story is a whole collection
ofwonders.itasFected him deeply; but when he reflected
from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been
preserved there on purpose to save his lise, the tears ran
down his sace, and he could not speak a word more.
After this communication was at an end, I carried
him and his two men into my apartments, leading them
in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the house;
where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had,
and shewed them all the contrivances I had made during
my long, long inhabiting that place.
All I shewed them, all I said to them, was persectly
amazing: but, above all the captain admired my for-
tification, and how persectly I had concealed my retreat
with a grove of trees, which having now been planted
near twenty years, and the trees growing much saster
than in England, was hecome a little wood, and so
thick
thick, that it was unpassable in any part of it, but at
that one side where I had reserved my little winding
passage into it:. this I told him was my castle, and my
residence; but that I had- a seat in the country, as most
princes have, whither I could retread upon occasion, and
I would show him that too another tirne^ but at present
our business was to consider how to recover the ship;
he agreed with me as to that; but told me, he was per-
fectly at a loss what measure to take: for that their
were still six and twenty hands on board, who, having
entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all
sorseited their lives to the law, would be hardened in it
now by desperation; and would carry it on, knowing
that if they were reduced they would be brought to the
gallows as soon as they came so England, or any of the
English colonies: and that therefore there would be no
attacking them with so small a number as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it was a very rational conclnsion, and that there-
fore something was to be resolved on very speedily, as
well to draw the men on board into some snare for their
surprize, as to prevent their landing upon us, and de-
stroying us: upon this it preseaitly occurred to me, that
iu a little while, the ship's crew, wondering what was
become of their comrades and of the boat, would cer-
tainly come on shore in their own boat to see for them:
and then perhaps they might come armed, and be too
strong for us: this he allowed was rational.
Upon this I told him the first thing we had to do,
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that
they might not carry her off ; and, taking every thing
out of her, leave her so sar useless as not to be fit to swim;
accordingly we went on board, took the arms which
were left on board of her, and whatever else we found
-there, which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum,
a sew biscuit cakes, an horn of powder, and a great lump
.of sugar in a piece of canvas: the sugar was five or six
pounds; all which was very welcome to me, especially
the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for
many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore, (the
oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat, were carried
away
away before, as above), we knocked a great hole in her
bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master
us, yet they could not carry off the toat.
Indeed it was net much in my thoughts that we
could be capable to recover the ship, but my view was,
that if they went away without the boat, I did not much
question to make her fit again to carry us away to the
Leeward islands, and call upon our friends the Spa-
niards, for I had them still in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and had
first, by main strength, heaved the boat up upon the
beach so high that the tide would not float her off at
high-water mark, and, besides, had broken an hole in
her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were sat
down musing what we should do, we heard the ship sire
a gun, and saw her make a waftwith her ancient, as a sig-
nalforthe boat tocomeon board; but no boat stirred,and
they fired several times, making other signals for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruit-
less, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them,
by the help of our glasses, hoist another boat out, and
row towards the shore; and we found, as they ap-
proached, that there was no less than ten men in her,
and that they had fire-arms with them. .
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore,
we had a sull view of them as they came, and a plain
sight of the men, even of their saces; because the tide
having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they
rowed up under shore, to come to the same place where
the other had landed, and where the boat lay.
By this means, 1 say, we had a sull view of them,
and the captain knew the persons and characters of all
the men in the boat; of whom, he said, there were
three very honest sellows, who, he was sure, were led
into this conspiracy by ihe rest, being overpowered and
frighted. But that for the boatswain, who, it seems,
was the chief officer amongst them, and all the rest,
they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew j and
were, no doubt, made desperate in their new enter-
prise ; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would
be teo powersul sorw.
I smiled
I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our cir-
cumstances were past the operations of sear: that seeing
almost every condition that could be was better than that
we were supposed to be in, weought to expect that the con-
sequence, whether death or lise, would be sure to be a de-
liverance. I actced him what he thought of the circumstan-
ces of my lise, and whether a deliverance were not worth
venturing for. And where, lir, said I, is your belief of my'
being preserved here on purpose to save your lise, which
elevated you a little while ago? For my part, said I, there
feems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.
What's that ? says he. Why, said I, 'tis that, as you say,
there are three or four honest sellows among them, which
should be spared; had they been all of the wicked part of
the crew, I should have thought God's providence had
singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for
depend upon it, every man of them that comes ashore,
are our own, andshall die or live, as they behave to us.
As 1 spoke this with a raised voice and chearsul coun-
tenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set
vigorously to our business: we had, upon the first ap-
pearance of the boat's coming from the ship, considered
of separating our prisoners, and had indeed secured them
effectually.
Two of themvof whom the captain was less assured than
ordinary, I lent with Friday, and one of the three delivered
men, to my cave, where they were remote enough, and
out of danger of being heard or discovered, or of sinding
their way out of the woods, if they could have delivered
themselves : here they left 'em bound, but gave 'em provi-
sions, and promised 'em, if they continued there quietly,
to give 'em their liberty in a day or two; but that, if they
attempted their escape, they should be put to death wsth-
put mercy. They promised saithsully to bear their con-
finement with patience, and were very thanksul that they
had such goqd usage as to have provisions, and a light hit
. 'em; for Friday gave 'em candles (such as we made our-
felves) for their comfort; and they did not know but that
he stood centinel over 'em at the entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage: two of them
Were kept pinioned indeed, because the captain was not
free to trust them; but the other two were taken into my

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
service upon their captain's recommendation, anc! upon
'their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so
with them and the three honest men, we were seven men
well ai med and I made no doubt we mould be able to
deal well enough with the ten that were a coming, con-
sidering that the'captain had said, there were three or four
honest men among them also. .-f,
'As soon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came
all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was
glad to see; for 1 was afraid they would rather have left
the boat at an anchor, some distance from the more,
with some hands^jn her to guard her; and so we should
not be able to setee the boat.
Being on shore* the first thing they did, they ran all
to the other boat ; and it was easy to see they were under
a great surprise, to find her stripped, as above, of all that
was in her, and a great hole in her bottom.
After they had muled awhile upon this, they set up two
or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to
try if they could'make their companions hear; but all was
to no purpose; they then came all close in a ring, and
fired a volley of their small arms, which indeed we'
heard, and the echoes made the woods ring; but it was
all one; those in the cave we were sure could not hear;
and those in our keeping, though they heard it well
enough, yet durst give no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as
they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board
again to their ship, and let them know there that the
men were all murdered, and the long-boat staved; ac-
cordingly, they immediately launched the boat again,
end got all of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even confound-
ed at this, believing they would go on board the ship
again, and set sail, giving their comrades for lost, and
so he should .still lose the ship, which he was in hopes
we should have recovered; but he was quickly as much
frighted the other way.
They had not been long p'ut ofs with the boat, but we
perceived them all coming on (here again; but with this
aew measure in their conduct, which, it seems, they con-
sulted
suited together upon, viz. to leave three men in the hoi r,
and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country
to look for their sellows.
This was a great disappointment to us; for now v e
•were at a loss what to do; for our seizing those sevf^n
men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let the
boat escape, because they would then row away to the
ship; and then the rest of them would be sure to weig h,
and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what
the issue of things might present: the seven men cai ne
on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put
her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to
an anchor to wait for them, so that itfcas impossible for
us to come at them in the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together, march-
ing towards the top os the little hill, under which my
habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though
they could not perceive us: we could have been vi:ry
glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we mij:ht
have fired at them; or that they would h_ave gone sarther
off, that we might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the hill,
where they'could see a great way in the valley :uid
woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till
they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to ven-
ture sar from the shore, nor sar from one another, they
sat down together under a tree, to consider of it: had
they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other
party of them had done, ihey had done the job for us;
but they were too sull of apprehensions of danger, to
venture to go to sleep, thoug'h they could not tell vsfhat
the danger was they had to sear neither.
The captain made a very just proposal to-me upon
this consultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps they
would all tire a volley. again, to endeavour to make
their sellows hear, and that we should all sally upon
them, just at the juncture when their. pieces were all
discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we
should have them without bloodshed: I liked the pro-
posal, provided it was done while we were near enough
M 2 to
t<i come up to them, before they could load their pieces -
again. , a
But this event did not happen, and we lay still a long
ti me, very irresolute what course to take; at length I
told them, there would be nothing to be done in my
opinion till night; and then, if they did not return to
the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between
them and the shore, and so might use some stratagem with
them in the boat, to get them on shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient, for
iheir removing, and were very uneasy: when, after long
co nsultations, we saw them all start up, and march down
towards the sea: it seems, they had such dreadsul appre-
htiisions.upoa tMfei of the danger of the place, that they
resolved to go onboard the ship again, give their compa-
nions over for loft, and so go on with their intended voyage
with the ship.
:As soon as I perceived them go' towards the. shore, I
imagined it to be as it really was; that they had given
over the search, and were for going back again; and the
captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to
sink at the apprehensions of it; but 1 presently thought of
a stratagem to<setch them back again, and which an-
swered my end to a tittle.
J ordered Friday and the captain's mate, to go over
th<: little creek westward, towards the place where the
savages came on shore when Friday was rescued \ and as *
soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about hals
a mile's distance, I bade them halloo as loud as they
could, andwaittill they found the seamen heard them; that
as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they
flxfmld return it again, and then keeping out of tight, take
a round, always answering when the other hallooedj tp>
draw them as sar into the island, and among the woods, as
possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such ways
I directed.
They were just going into the boat, when Friday and
the mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and
answering, run along the shore westward, towards the
the voice they heard, when they were presently stopped
by the creek, where, the water being up, they could not
get over, and called for the boat to come up, and let
theia over, as indeed I expected. When.
When they had set themselves over, I observed that the
l>oat being-£one tip a good way up into the creek, and au
it were in an harbour within the land, they took One of
the three men out of her to go along with them, and left
only two in the boat,' having sastened her to the stump of
a little tree on the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately leaving
Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I took
the rest with me, and, crossing the creek out of thefr
fight, we surprised the two men*before they were aware,
one of them lying on shore, and the other being in the
boat; the sellow on shore was between sleeping and
waking, and going to start up: the captain, who was
foremost, ran in upon him, and knocMphim down, and
then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a
dead man.
There needed very sew arguments to persuade a single
man to yield, when he saw sive men upon him, and his
comrade knocked down; besides, this was,.it seems, one
of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the
rest of the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded not
only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with us.
1n the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so
-well managed their business with the rest, that they drew
them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill to an-
other, and from one wood to another, till they not only
heartily tired them, but left them where they were very
lure they could not reach back to the boat before it was
•dark; and indeed they were heartily tired themselves also
fey the time they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in
the dark, and to sall upon them, so as to make sure work
with them.
It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came.back to their boat; and we could hear
the foremost of them, long before they came quite up,
calling to those behind to come along, and could also
hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired
they were, and not being able to come any saster, which
•was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is impossible
lo express their consusion when they found the boat sast
m 3 a-ground.
/
a ground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their j
two men gone; we could hear them ca'l to one ailother
in the molt lamentable manner, telling one another they
were gotten into anenchanted island ; that eitherthere were
inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or else
there were devils or spirits in it, and they should all be
carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades
by their names a great many times, but no answer; after
some time we could see them, by the little :light there
was, run about wringing their hands, like men in despair;
and t/iat sometimes they would go and fit down in the
boat to rest thejtfelves, then come ashore, and walk
about again, andWthesame thing over again.
My men would. sain have had me given them leave to
sall upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing to
take them at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill
as sew of them as I could; and especially I was un-
willing to haiard the killing of any of our men, knowing .
the others were very well armed : I resolved to wait to see
is they did not separate; and therefore, to make sure os
them, I drew my ambuscade nearer; and ordered Friday
and the captain to creep upon their hands and seet as
close to the ground as they could, that they might not be'
discovered, and get as near them as they possibly could,
before they offered so fire.
They had not been long in that posture, but that the
boatswain, who was the piincipal ringleader of the mu-
tiny, and had now shewn himself themest dejected and
dispirited of all the rett, came walking towards them with
two more of the crow; she captain was so eager, at
having the principal rogue so much in his power, that he'
could hardly have patience to let him come so near as so
be sure of him; for they only heard his tongue before:
but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday,
starting up on their feet, let fly at them.
The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next man
-was shot in the body, and sell just by him, though he did
not die til! an hoar or two after; and the third run for it.
At the noise osthe fire, i immediately advanced with
my whole army, which was now eight risen, viz. my-
self generalissimo; Friday my lieutenant-general; the
captain
Captain and his two men, and, the three prisoners of war,
whom he had trusted with- arras.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that they
couid not Iee our number; and I made the man they had
left in the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by
name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so
might perhaps reduce them to terms; which sell out just
as we desired: for indeed it was easy to think, as their
condition then was, they would be very willing to capitu-
late; so he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them,
Tom Smith, Tom Smith. Tom Smith answered irame-.
diately, Who's that? Robinson! For it seems he knew
his voice. The other answered, Ay, ay ; for God's sake,
Tom Smith, throw down your arms,^nd yield, or you
ara all dead men this moment."
Who must we yield to? Where are they ? says Smith
again. Here they are, says he; here is our captain and
fifty men with him, have been hunting these two hours;
the boatswain is killed; Will Frye is wounded, and 1 am
.a prisoner; and if you do not yield, you are all
lost.
Will they give us quarterthen? saysTom Smith, and
we will yield. I'll-go and ask, if you promise to yields
says Robinson. So he asked the captain, and the cap-
tain himself then calls out, You, Smith, you know my
voice, if you lay down your arms immediately, and sub-
mit, you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins.
Upon this Will Atkins cried out, For God's sake, cap-:
tain,give me quarter: what have I done? they have been
asl as bad as 1; which by the way was not true, neither;
for it seems this Will Atkins was the first m m that iaid
hold of the captain when they first routined, and used him.
barbarously, in tying his hands, and giving him inju-
rious language: however, the captain told him he must
4ay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the gover-
nor's mere)', by which he meant me, for they all called
me governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and hegged
their lives; and 1 lent the man that had parlied with
them, and two more, who bound them all; and then my
great a^my of fifty men, which, particularly with those
three, were all but eight, came up and seized upon them
M 4 , all,
all, and upon their boat, only that I kept myself and one
wore out of sight, for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of seizing the ship; and as for thu« captain, now he had
leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with them
upon the villany of their practices with him, and at
length, upon the sarther wickedness of their design; and
how certainly it must bring them to misery and distress
in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They al! appeared very penitent, and begged hard for
their lives: as for that, he told-them they were none of
his prisoners, but the commander's of the island; that
they thought.they had set him on shore in a'barren unin-
habited island ; bjjt it had pleased God so to direct them,
that the island was inhabited, and that the governor was
an Englishman; that he might hang them all there if he
pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he sup-
posed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was
commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for
death; for that he would be hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had
ks desired effect: Atkins sell upon his knees to beg the
'captain to intercede with thcgovernor for his lise; and
all the rest begged him for God's lake, that they might
not be sent to England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver-
ance was come, and that it would Jot a molt easy thing
to bring these sellows in to be hearty in getting possessioa
of the ship; so I retired in the dark from them, that they
might not see what kind of a governor they had, and
called the captain to me; when I called, as at a good
distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again, and
say to the captain, Captain, the commander calls for
you: and presently the captain replied, Tell his excel-
lency I am just a coming. This more persectly amused
them; and they all believed, that the commander was
just by, with his rifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, 1 told him my pro-
ject for seizing the ship, which he liked wondersully
well, and resolved to putit in execution the next morning.
But in order to execute it with more art, and to be
secure
AtnrXUtUUtlS OF tlOBlKSoJJ CRUSOE. 249
secure of success, I told him we must divide the prison-
ers, and that he should go and take Atkins, and two more
of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the cave
where the others lay i this was committed to Friday, and
the two'men who came on shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison; and
it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men in their
condition.
The other. I ordered to my bower, as 1 called it, of
which I have given a sull description; and as it was
senced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure enough,
considering they were upon their behaviour.
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was
to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to try them,
.and tell me, whether he thought they might be trusted
or no, to go on board, and surprise the ship: he talked
to them of the injury done him, of the condition they
were brought to, and that though the governor had
given them quarter for their lives, as to the present action,
yet if they were sent to England, they would all be
hanged in chains to be sure; but that if they would join
in such an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have
the governor's engagement for their pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would
be accepted by men in their condition: they sell dowa
on their knees to the ca.ptain, and promised with the
deepest imprecations, that they would be saithsul to him
to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to
him, and would go with him all over the world; that
they would own him for a sather to them as long as they
lived.
Well, says the captain, I must go and tell the gover-
nor what you say, and lee what J can do to bring him ta
consent to it: so he brought me an account of the temper
he found them in: and that he verily believed they
would be saithsul.
However, that we might be very secure, I told him he
^should go back again, and choose out five of them, and
tell them, that they should lee that they did not want men;
but that he would take out of th' se five to be his assist-
ants, and that the governor would keep the other two,
Aud the th:ee that were sent prisoners to the castle, (my

cave) as hostages, for the fidelity o£'those five; and that
if they proved unsaithsul in the execution, the five hos-
tages should he hanged in chains alive upon the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them, that the go-
vernor was in earnest; however, they had no way left
them but to accept it; and it was now the business of the
prisoners, as much as that of the captain, to persuade the
other sive to do their duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition:
1. The captain, his mate, and passenger. 2. Then the
two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their
characters from the captain, 1 had given their liberty, and
trusted them with arms. 3. The other two whom I
kept in my bower till now pinioned, but, upon the cap-
tain's motion, had now released. 4. These five relealed
at last; so that they were twelve in all, besides five we
kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with
these hands on board the ship: for, as to me, and my.
man Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to stir,
having seven men lest behind; aud it was employment
enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them
with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them
sast; but Friday went twice a day to them, to supply
them with necerfarics; and I made the other two carry
provisions to a certain distance, where Friday was to
talce it.
When I fhe-wed myself to the two hostages, it wa*
with the captain, who told them, I was the person the
governor had ordcied to look after them, and that it
was the governor's pleasure that they should not stir any
where but by my direction; that if they did, they should
be setched into the castle, and be laid in irons; so that
as we never suffered them to see me as governor, so I
now appeared to another person, and spoke of'the go-
vernor, the garrison, the cattle, and the like, upon alt
creations.
The captain had no^v, no difficulty before him, but
to surnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and
and man them : he made his passenger captain of one; with.
four other men; and himself, and his mate, and five
more,

more, went in the other: and they contrived their busi-
ness very we'll; for £ hey came up to the ship about rhid-
night: as soon as they came within call of the ship, he
made Robinson hail them, and tell them he had brought
off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time be-
fore they had sound them, and the like; holding them
in a chat, ti!l they came tp the ship's side; when the
captain and the mate, entering first with their arms, im-
mediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter
ivith the butt end of their muskets, being very saithsully
seconded by their men; they iecured all the rest that
were upon the main and quarter-decks, and began to
fasten the hatches to keep them down who .were below,
when the ether boat and thtir men, entering at the fore-
chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the skuttle
which went down into the cook-room, making three men
they found there prisoners.
When this was done, and all sase.upon the deck, the
captain ordered the mate with three mersto break into the
round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, and,
having taken the alarm, was gotten up, and with two
men arid a boy had gotten fire-arms in their hands; tiftd
. when the mate with a crow split open tlie door, the new
captain and his men fired boldly among them, and
wounded the mate with a musket ball, which broke his
arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed
nobody.
The mate calling for help, rushed, however, into the
round-house, wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot
the new captain through the head, the bullets entering at
his mouth, and came out again behind one of his ears;
so that he never spoke a word; upon which the rest
yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, without any
more lives lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain or-
dered seven guns to be sired, which was the signal agreed
upon with me, to give me notice of his success; which
you may be sure 1 was very glad to hear, having sat
watching upon theshore for it, till near two of the ciock
in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down;
and it having been a day of great satigue to me, I ikpt
m fa' very
252 a'dvfnTures ot TWBTNsott cftusofc.
very sound. till 1 was something surprised with the noise
of a gun; and presently starting up, I heard a man calj^
me by the name of governor, -governor; and presently
I knew the captain's voice, when climbing up to the top .
of the hill, there he stood; and pointing so the ship, he
'embraced me in his arms. My dear friend and deliverer,
says he, there's your ship, forshe is all your's, and so aw
we, and all that belong to her. I cast my eyes to the
ship, arrd there she rode within a little more than half a
mile of the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as
soon as they were masters of her'; and the weather being
sair, had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth
-of a little creek, and the tide being up, the captain had
• brought the pinnace in nearthe place where I first landed
my rafts, and so landed just at my door.
I was, at first, ready to sink down with the surprise:
for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands,
all things easy, and a large ship just ready to carry me
-away whither I pleased to go: at first, for some time, I
was not able to answer one word; but as he had taken
me in his arms, i held sast by him, or I should have
sallen to the ground.
He perceived the surprise, ^nd immediately pulled a
bottle out of his pocket, and gay* me a dram of cordial,
which he had brought on purpose for me : after 1 drank
it, I sat down upon the ground, and though it brought
me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could
speak a -word to him.
All this while the poor man was in as great an ec-
stasy as I, only not under any surprise, as 1 was.; and he
said a thousand kind tender things to me, to compose
and bring me to myself; but such was the flood of joy
in my breast, that it put all my spirits into consusion ; at
last it broke into tears, and in a little while after I re-
covered my speech.
Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my de-
liverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him 1 looked
upon him as a man sent from heaven to deliver me,
and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain
of wonders; that such things as these were the tes-
timonies we had of a secret hand of Providence go-
verning the world, and-an evidence that the eyes of
5 ant
AtrrE'NT'rit.'ES of robinson crbsoz, 253
:an infinite power could search into the remotest corner
of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever
'he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thanksulness to
heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless him,
who had not only in a miraculous manner provided for
-one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condi"-
tion, but from whom every deliverance must always be
acknowledged to proceed?
When we had talked awhile, the.captain 'told me he
had brought me some little refreshments, such as the
ship asforded, and such as the wretches, who had been <-
so long his masters, had not plundered him of: upon
this' he called aloud to the boat, and bid his men bring
the things ashore that were for the governor ; and indeed
it was a present, as if I had been one, not that was to be
•carried along with them, but as if I had been to dwell
upon the island still, and they were to go without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles sull of ex-
cellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine;
the bottles held two quarts a-piece; two pounds of ex-
cellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's
beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of pease, und
about an hundred weight of biscuit.
He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour, a
bag sull of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and
abundance of other things: but besides these, and what
was -a thousand times more usesul to me, he brought me
six clean new shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair
•of gloves, one pair of shoes, an hat. and one pair of
stockings, and a very good suit of clothes os his own,
which had been worn but very'little.: in a word, he
clothed me from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one
may imagine, to one m my circumstances; but neves was
any thing in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awk-
ward, and uneasy, as it was to me to wear such clothes at
their first putting on.
After 'these ceremonies past, and after all his good
things were brought into my little apartment, we began
to consult what was to be done with the prisoners we
had; for it was worth considering whether we might
venture
. £54
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
venture to take them away with us or no, 'especially two
of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible and refrac-
tory to the last degree ; . and the captain said he knew
they were such rogues, that there was no obliging them;
and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as
malesactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first
English colony he could come at; and I sound that the
captain himself was very anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that if he desired it, I durstunder-j
take to bring the two men he spoke of, to make it their own
request that he should leave them upon the island: 1 should
he very glad of that, says the captain, with all my heart.
Well, said I, I will send for them, and talk with them
for you: so 1 caused Friday and the two hostages, for
they were now discharged, their comrades having per-
formed their promise; 1 say, I caused them to go to the
cave and bring up the five men, pinioned . as they were,
to the bower, and keep them there till I came.
After some time, 1 came thither dressed in my new
habit, and now I was called governor again. Being all
met, and the captain with me, 1 caused the men to be
brought before me, and I told them-1 had had a sull ac-
count of their villanous behaviour to the captain, .and
how they had run away with the ship, and were prepar-
ing to commit sarther robberies; but that providence
had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they were
sallen into the pit which they had digged for others.
I let them know, that by my direction the ship had
been seized, that shelay now in the road, f.nd they might
see by and by that their new captain had received the
reward of his villainy; for that they might see him
hanging at the yard-arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to
,say why I should not execute them as parties taken in
the sact, as by my commission they could not doubt I
had authority to dov
One of them answered in the name of the rest, that
they had nothing to say but this, That when they were
. taken, the captain promised them their lives, and they
humbly implored my mercy; but I told them I knew
not what mercy to thew them; for, as for myself, I had
resolved to quit the island with all my men, and had
taken
•
255
taken passage with the captain to go for England: and as
for the captain, he could not carry them to England,
other than as prisoners in irons to be tried for mutiny,
and running away with the ship; the consequence ot'
which, they mult needs 'know, would be the gallows;
so that I could not tell which was belt for them, unless
they had a mind to take their sate in the island, if they
desired that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it;
1 had some inclination to give them their lives, if they
thought they could shift on shore. They seemed very
thanksul for it, (aid they would much rather venture to
stay there than to be carried to England to be hanged:
so 1 left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty
of it, as if he durst not leave them there: upon this, 1
seemed a little angry with the captain, and told him
that they were my prisoners, not his; and that seeing I
had ofsered them so much savour, I would be as good as
my word; and that if he did not think fit to consent to
it, I would set them at liberty as 1 found them; and if
he did not like that, he might take them again, if he
could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thanksul, and I ac-
cordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire into
the woods, to the place whence they came, and 1 would
leave them some fire-arms, some ammunition, and some
directions how they should live very well, if they
thought fit.
U pon this, I prepared to go on board the ship, but told
the captain, that' I would ltay that night to prepare my
things, and delired him to go on board in the meantime,
and keep all right in the ship, and send the beat on lnore
the next day for me; ordering him, in the meantime, to
cause the new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at
the yard-arm, that these men might see him.
When the captain was gone, i sent for the men up to
me to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse
with them of their circumstances j 1 told them I thought
they had made a right choice ; and if the captain carried
them away, they would certainly be hanged. 1 shewed
them their captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship,
and told them they had nothing less to expect.
V-hen
When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I
told them, I'woold let them into the story of my living
there, and put them into the way of making it easy to
them: accordingly I gave them the whole history of the
place, and of my coming to it ; strewed them my forti-
fications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn,
.cured my grapes, and, in a word, all that was necessary
to make them easy. I told them the ftory also of the fix-
teen Spaniards that were to be expected; for whom I
left a letter, and made them promise to treat them in
common with themselves.
I left them my fire-arms, viz. five mufquets, three
fowling pieces, and three swords. I had about a barrel
•of powder left ; for after the first year or-two 1 used but
little, and wasted none: I gave them a description of the
way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fatten them, to make both butter andcheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my ow:. story;
aud told them, 1 would prevail with the captain to leave
them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden-
seed, which I told them the bag of peas which the cap-
tain had brought me to eat, and bade them be fare to
sow and increase them.
Having done all this, t left them the next day, and
'went on board the ship ; we prepared immediately to sail,
but did not weigh that night : the next morning, early,
two of the five men came swimming to the ship's fide,
and; making a most lamentable complaint of the other
three, begged to be taken into thcfhip, for God's sake,
for they should be murdered; and begged the captain to
take them on board, tho' he hanged them immediately.
Upon this thecaptain .pretended to have no power with-
out me; hut after some difficulty, and after their solemn
promise of amendment, they were taken on hoard, and
were some time after soundly whipped and pickled; after
-which they proved very honest and quiet sellows.
Some time after this, I went with the boat on shore,
the tide being up, with the things promised to the
men, to which the captain, at my intercession, caused
their chest and clothes to be added, which they took,
and were very thanksul for, I also encouraged them, by
telling them, that if it 1-ay in my way to send a vessel to
take them in, I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried onboard
for reliques the great goat's skin cap I had made, my
umbrella, and one of my parrots; also 1 forgot not to
take the money 1 formerly mentioned, which had lain
by me so long useless, that it was grown rusty, or tar-
nished, and could hardly pass for silver, till it had been
a little rubbed and handled; and also the money I found
in the wreck of the Spanish ship.
And thus I left the island the nineteenth of December,
as 1 found by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I
had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months,
and nineteen days, being delivered from the second cap-
tivity the same day 4if the month that 1 first made my
escape in the BaTco-lango, from among the Moors of
Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arriyed in Eng-
land the eleventh of June, in the year 16'87, having
been thirty and five years absent.
- When I came to England, I was a persect stranger to
all the world, as if I had never been known there: my
benesactor, and saithsul steward, whom 1 had left in
trust with my money, was alive, but had had great mis-
fortunes in the world, was become a widow the second
time, and very low in the world: I made her easy as to
what she owed tae, assuring her I would give her no
trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude to her for-
mer care and saithsulness to me, I relieved her as my
little stock would afford, which at that time would in-
deed allow me to do but little for her; iut I assured her
I would never forget her former kindness to me; nor did
I forget her, when I had sufficient to help her, as shall
be observed in its place.
1 went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my sather
was dead, and my mother, and all the samily extinct,
except that I found two sisters, and two of the children
of one of my brothers: and as I had long ago been given
over for dead, there had been no provi&m made for me,
so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist
xnc; and that little money I had, would not; do somueb.
for me, as to settling in the world. » s\'
I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did
riot expect; and this was, that the master of the ship,
whom I had so happily delivered, and by the same means
saved the ship and cargo, having given a very handfome
account to the owners of the manner how 1 had saved
the lives of the men, and the ship, they invited me t»
meet them, and some other merchants concerned, and
all together made me a very handsome compliment upon
that subject, and a present os almost two hundred pounds
sterling.
But after making several reflections upon the circum-
stances of my lise, and how little way this would go to-
ward settling me in the world, I resolved to go toLrsoon,
and see if I might not come by some information of the
state of my plantations in the Brasils, and what was be-
come of my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had
some years now given me over for dead.
With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I ar-
rived in April following, my. man Friday accompanying
me very honestly in all these ramblings, and proving a
most saithsul servant upon all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I sound out by enquiry, and
to my particular satissaction, my old friend the captain
of the ship, who first took me up at sea, off the shore -of
Africa: he was now grown old, and had left osf the
fea, having put his son, who was sar from a young man,
into his ship, and who still used the Brasil trade. The
old man did not know me, and,, indeed, I hardly knew
him; but I soon broeght myself to his remembrance,
when I told him who I was. .
After some passionate expressions of our old acquaint-
ance, 1 enquired, you may be sure, after my plantation,
and my partner: the old man told me he had not
been in the Brasils for about nine years; but that he
could allure me, that when he came away, my partner
was living ; but the trustees whom I had joined with him
to take cognizance of my part, were both dead; that,
however, he believed that I would have a very good
account of the improvement os the plantation; for
that, upon the general belief of my being cast away and
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the
produce of my part of the plantation, to the procurator
Fiscal;
Fiscal; who had appropriated it, in case I never came to
claim it, one third to the King, and two thirds to the
monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit
of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the
Catholic saith; but that if I appeared, or any one for me,
to claim the inheritance, it would be restored; only that
the improvement, or annual production, being distributed
to charitable uses, could not be restored; but he assured
me, that the steward of the king's revenue (from lands)
and the provedores or steward of the monastry, had
taken great care all along, that the incumbent, that is
to say, my partner, gave every year a saithsul account ot'
the produce, of which.they received duly my moiety.
1 asked him, if he knew to what height of improve-
ment he had brought the plantation; and whether he
thought it might be worth looking after: or whtther,
on my going thither, I should meet with no obstruction
to my possessing my just right in the moiety.
He told me,- he could not tell exactly to what degree
the plantation was improved : but this he knew, that my
partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying but
one half of it; and that, to the best of his remembrance
he had heard, that the king's third of my part, which
was, it seems, granted away to some other monastry,
or religious house, amounted to above two hundred
moidores a year; that, as to my being restored to a
quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made
of that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and
my name being also inrolled in the register of the country.
Also he told me, that the survivors| of my two trustees
were very fair honest people, and very wealthy, and he
believed I would not only have their assistance for put-
ting me in possession, but wquld find a very considerable
sum of money in their hands, for my account, being the
produce of the sarm, while their sathers held the trust
and before it was given up, as above, which, as he re-
membered, was about twelve years.
I shewed-myself a little concerned and uneasy at this
account, and enquired of the old captain, how it came
to pats, that the trustees should thus dispose of my estedts,
when he knew, that I had made my will, had made
him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.

He told me, that was true ; but that, as there was no
proof of my being dead, he could not act as executor,
until some ceitain account should come of my death;
and that, betides, he was not willing to intermeddle with
a thing so remote: that it was true, he had registered my
will, and put in his claim; and could he have given
any account of my being dead or alive, he would have
acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio,
(so they called the sugar-house) and had given his son,
•who was now at the Bralils, order to do it. -
But, says the old man, I have one piece of news to
tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you
as the rest; and that is, that believing you were lost, and
all the world believing so also, your partner and trustee's
did.offer to account to me in your name, fortix or eight
of the first years of profit, which I received; but there
being at that time, lays he, great disburlements for in-
creasing the works, building an ingenio, and buying
slaves, it did not amount to near so much as afterwards J
it produced: however, says the old man, I Avail give'
you a true account of what I have received in all, and
how I have disposed of it.
AfteT a sew days sarther conserence with this antient
. friend, he brought me an account of the fix first years
income of my plantation, signed by my partner, and the
merchant's trustees, being always delivered in goods,
viz. tobacco in roll, aud sugar in chests, besides rum,
melasses, &c. which is the consequence of a sugar-work;
and I found by this account, that every year the income
considerably increased: but, as above, the disbursement
being large, the sum at first was small: however, the
old'man let me see, that he was debtor to me 470 moi-
dores of gold,kbelides 90 chests of sugar, and 15 double
rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship, he hav-
ing been shipwrecked coming home to Lilbon, about
eleven-years after nay leaving the place.
The good man then began to complain of his misfor-
tunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of my
money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a
new ship: however, my old friend, says he, you shall
not want a supply in your necessity; and as soen as my
ion returns. you shall be sully satisfied.
Upon
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me two
hundred Portugal moidores in gold; arid giving me the
writings of his title to the-ship which his son was gone to
the Brasils in, of which he was a quarter part owner, and
his son another, he put them both in my hands for secu-
rity of the rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness
of the poor man to be able to bear this; and remem-
bering what he had done for me, how he hed taken me
up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all oc-
casions, and particularly bow sincere a friend he was
now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what he
said to me: Therefore first I asked him if his circum-
stances admitted him to spare so much money at that
time, and if it would not streighten him? He told me
he could not say but it might streighten him a little;
but, however, it was my money, and I might want it
more than he.
Every thing the good man said was sull of affection,
and I could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke. In
short, I took one hundred of the moidores, and called for
a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them; then I
returned him the rest, and told him, if ever I had possession-
of the plantation, I would return the other to him also,
as indeed I afterwards did; and that, as to the bill of
sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not take it by
any means; but that if I wanted the money, I sound he
was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but
came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would
never have a penny more from him..
When this was passed, the old man began to ask me,
if he should put me in a method to make my claim to
my plantation. I told him, I thought to go over to it -
myself: He said I might do so if I pleased; but that if I
did not,~ there were ways enough to secure my right,
and immediately to appropriate the profits to my use; and
as there were ships' in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go
away to Brasil, he made me enter my name in a public
register, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that
I was alive, and that I was the same person who
took up the land for jhe planting of the said plantation
at first.
This
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a pro-
curation asfixed, he directed me to send it with a letter of
his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the
place ; and then proposed my staying with him till an ac-
count came of the return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the pro-
ceedings upon this procuration; for in less than seven
months I received a large packet from the survivors of
my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went
, to sea, in which were the following particular letters and
papers inclosed.
First, There was the account current of the produce
of my sarm, or plantation, from the year when there
sathers had balanced with my old Portugal Captain, be-
ing for lix years; the balance appeared to be in 1174
moidores in my savour.
Secondly, Ttare was the account of four years more
while they kept the effects in their hands, before the
government claimed the administration, as beins the
effects of a person not to be found, which they call Ci-
vil Death; and the balance of this, the value of the
plantation increasing, amounted to cruisadoes, which
made 3241 'moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustines ac-
count, who ha'd received the profits for above fourteen
years; but not being'able to account for what was dis-
posed to the hospital, very honeltly declared he had 8s2
moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to
my account: as to the king's part, that resunded
nothing. /
There was also a letter of my partner's, congratulating
me very affectionately upon my being alive; giving me
an account how the estate was improved, and what it
produced a year, with a .particular of the number of
squares or acres that it contained; how planted, how-
many staves there were upon it; and making two and
twenty crosses for blessings, told me, he had said so'
many Ave Maria's to thank the Blessed Virgin that I
was alive; inviting me very passionately to come over
and take possession of my own, and in • the mean time
to give him orders to whom he should deliver my
effects, if I did not come myself; concluding with an
hearty
263
hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his sami-
ly; and lent me, as a present, seven fine leopards' skins,
-which he had, it seems, received from Africa by some
other ship which he had sent thither, and who, it
seems, had made a better voyage than 1: He sent
ine also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and an
hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as
moidores.
By the same fleet my merchanj-trustees shipped me
1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and the rest
of the whole account in gold.
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of
Job was better than the beginning: It is impossible to
express the flutterings of my very heart, when 1 looked
over these letters, and especially when I found all my
-wealth about me; for as the Brasil ships come all in
sleets, the lame ships which brought my letters brought
my goods; and the effects were sase in the Tagus before
the letter came to my hand. In a word, I tinned pale,
and grew sick; and had not the old man ran and setched
me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had
overset nature, and I had died upon the spot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some
hours, till a physician being sent for, and something of
the real cause of my illness being known? he ordered
me to be let blood, after which 1 had relief, and grew
well; but I verily believe, if it had not been eased by
the vent given in that manner to the spirits, I should
have died.
1 was now master, all on a sudden, of above 60,0001.
sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well
call it, in the Bralils, of above a thousand pounds a
year, as sure as an estate of lands in England; and, in
a word, I was in a condition which I scarce knew how
to understand, or how t6 compose myself for the enjoy-
ment of. . . v - /
The first thing I did, was to recompence my original
benesactor, my good old captain, who had been first
charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in the be-
ginning, and honest to me at the end: I shewed him
all that was sent me; I told him, that, next to the
pro-
piovidence of heaven, which disposes all things, it was
owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him,
which Twould do an hundred fold: So I sirst returned to
him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then
1 sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up a gene-
ral release or discharge for the 470 moidores, which he
had acknowledged he owed me, in the sullest and firmed
manner possible; after which, I caused a procuration to
be drawn, impowering him to be my receiver of the
annual profits of my plantation, and appointing my
partner to account-to him, and make the returns by
the usual fleets to him in my name; and a clause in
the end, being a grant of 100 moidores a year to him
during his lise, out of the essects; and 50 moidores a
year to his son after him, for his lise: and thus I re-
quited my old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my course
next, and what to do with the estate that Providence
had thus put into my hands; and, indeed, I had more
care upon my head now than 1 had in my silent state
of lise in the island, where I wanted nothing but what
1 had, and had nothing but what I wanted; whereas I
had now a great charge upon me, and my -business was
how to secure it: I had never cave to hide my money
in, nor a place where it might lie without lock or key
till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body would
meddle with it: on the contrary, I knew not where to.
put it, or whom to trust with it; my old patron, the
captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only re-
fuge I had.
In the next place, my interest in the Brasils seemed to
summon me thither; but now I could not tell how to
think of going thither till I had settled my affairs, and
lest my effects in some sase hands behind me: at first I
thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was
honest, and would be just to me; but then she was in
years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be
in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back
to England myself, and take my effects with me.
I was some months, however, before 1 resolved upon
this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old captain
fully, and to satissaction, who had been my former
benesactor, so I began to think of my poor widow, whose
husband had been my sirst benesactor, and she, while it
was in her power, my saithsul steward and instructor:
So the first thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to
write to his correspondent in London, not only to pay
a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in money
an hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her, aud
comfort her in her poverty, by telling her, she should, if
I liv'-d, have a sarther supply: At the same time I sent
my two sisters in the country, each of them, an hundred
pounds, they being, though not in want, yet not in
very good circumstances; one having been married and
left a widow, and'the other having an husband not so
kind to her as he should be.
But among all my'relations or acquaintances I could
not yet pitch upon one to whom 1 durst commit the
gross of my stock, that I might go away to the Brasils,
and leave things sase behind me: and this greatly per-
plexed me,
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brafils, and have
settled myself there; for I was, as it were, naturalized
to the place; but I had some little scruple in my mind
about religion, which insensibly drew me back, of which
I shall say more presently. However, it was not religion
that kept me from going thither for the present; and as
I had made no scruple of being openly of the religion of
the country, all the while I was among them, so neither
did I yet; only that now and then having of late thought
'more of it than formerly, when I began to think of liv-
ing and dying among them, I began to regret my hav-
ing prosess'd myself a papist, and thought it might not
be the best religion to die in.
Bu{ i as I have-said, this was not the main thing that kept
me from going to the Brasils, but that really I did not
know- ^/th whom to leave my efsects behind me; so I re-
solv'd aFlast to go to England with them, where, if I ar-
riv'd, I concluded I should make some acquaintance, or
find some relations, that would be saithsul to me; and ac-
«ordingly I prepar'd to go forEngland with all my wealth.
In order to 'prepare things for my going home, I first
•(the Brasil fleet being just going away) resolved to give
vol I. n' answers
ADVENTURES OF ROBISS0N CRUSOE.
answers suitable to the just and saithsul account os
things I had from thence; and first to the prior of St.
Augustine 1 wrote a letter sull of thanks for his just
dealings, and the otter of the 872 moidores, which was
undisposed of, which I desired might be given, 500 to
the monastery, and 3/2 to the poor, as the prior should
direct, desiring the good Padres prayers for me, and the
like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees,
with .all the acknowledgment that so much justice and
honesty called for; as for sending them any present,
they were sar above having any occasion for it.
Lastly, 1 wrote to my partner, acknowledging his in-
dustry in the improving the plantation, and his inte-
grity in increasing the stock of the works, giving him
instructions for his suture government of my part, ac-
cording to the powers 1 had left with my old patron, to
whom I desired him to send whatever become due to
me, till he should bear from me more particularly; as-
suring him, that it was my intention, not only to come
to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder ,of
my lise: To this I added a very handsome present of
some Italian silks for his wise and two daughters, for
such the captain's son inform'd me he had; with two
pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I could get
in Lisbon, five pieces of black bays, and some Flanders
lace of a good value.
Having thus settled my affairs, fold my cargo, and
turn'd all my effects in good bills of exchange, my
next difficulty was, which way to goto England: I had
been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a
strange aversion to go to England by sea at that time;
and though I could give no reason for it, yet the diffi-
culty increased upon me so much, that though I had
once shipp'd my baggage in order to go, yet I alter'd
my mind, and that not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons: But let no man
slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in cases
of such moment: two of the ships which 1 had singled
out to go in, I mean, more particularly singled out than
any other, that is to say, so as in one of them to put my
things
Q
things 6n board, and in the other to have agreed wjth
the captain; I say, two of tlieie ships miscarried; viz.
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast
away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people
drowned except three; so that in either of these vessels I
had been made miserable, and in which most, it was
hard to say.
Having been thus harrassed in my thoughts, my old
pilot, to whom 1 communicated every thing, pressed me ,
•earnestly not to go to sea; but either to go by land to
the Groyne, and cross over the bay of Biscay to Rochelle,
srom whence it was but an easy and sase journey by land
to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to
Madrid, and so all the way by land through France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by
sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that 1 resolved
to travel all the way by land; which, as 1 was not in
haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the
pleasanter way; and to make it more so, my old captain
brought an English gentleman, the son of a merchant
in Lisbon, 'who was willing to travel with me: after
which, we picked up two who were English and mer-
chants Also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the
last going to Paris only; so that we were in all fix of us,
and five servants, the two merchants, and the two Portu-
guese, contenting themselves with one servant between
two, to save the charge; and as for me, I got an Eng-
iish sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man
Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of.
supplying the place of a servant upon the road.
In this manner I set out for Lilbon: and our compa-
ny being all very well mounted and armed, we made a
little troop, whereof they did me the honour to call ma
captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as be-
cause I had two servants, and, indeed, was the original
of the whole journey.
As 1 have troubled you with none of my sea journals,
so shall I troubleyou with none of my land journals: but
some adventures that happened to us in this tedious and
difficult journey, I must not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us stran-
gers to Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the
I-:. .. h 2 court
court of Spain, and to see what was worth observing;.
but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened
away, and set out from Madrid about the middle of Oc-
tober: but when we came to the edge of Navarre, we
wear alarmed at several towns on the way, with an ac-
count that so much sno^ was sallen on the French side of
the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to
come back to Pampeluna, aster having attempted, at an
extreme hazard, to pass on. '. .
When we came to Pameluna itself, we found it so in-
deed ; -and to me that had been always usej^to an hot
climate, and indeed to countries where we could, sftarce
bear any clothes oh, the cold was unsurrerahJt jiljor,
indeed, was it more plentisul than it was suq,riftig, to
come but ten days before out of the Old Castile wtiere
the weather was not pnly warm, but very hot, and irn-
mediately to seel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains,
so very keen, so severely cold, as to be, intolerable, and
to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and
toes, was very strange.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and selt cold weather,
which he had never seen or felt before in Kis lite.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence, and so long,
that the people said winter was come before its time,'
and the roads which were dis.'cult before, were now
quite impassable; in a word, the show lay in some
places too thick for us to travel; and being not hard
frozen, as is the cale in northern countries, there was no
going without being in danger of being buried alive
every step: we stajd no less than twenty days at Pampe-
luna; when (seeing the winter coming on, and no like-
lihood of its being better, for it was the severest winter
- all over Europe that had been known in many years)
I proposed that we mould all £0 away to Fontarabia,
and there taking shipping for Bourdeaux, which was a
very little voyage. ^ /-
But while we were considering this, there came in
four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the
French side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, had
found out a guide, who, traversing the country near the
head
head of Languedoc, had brought them over the moun-
tains by such ways, that they were not much incommoded
with the snow; and where they met with snow in any
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear
them and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us, he would under-
take to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the
snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to protect us
from wild beasts; for, he said, upon these great snows,
it,was frequent for some wolves to shew themselves at the
foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of
food, the ground being covered with snow: we told him
we were well enough prepared for such creatures as they
were, if he would insure us from a kind of two legged
wolves, <^hich we were told we were in most danger
from, tsofcially on the French side of the mountains.
He safisfitd us there was no danger of that kind in the
way that we were to go; so we readily agreed to follow
him, as-idid also twelve other gentlemen, with their
servants, tome French, some Spanish, who, as 1 said,
ha^Mtsetrfpted to go, and were obliged to come back
again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with our
guide, on the fifteenth of November; and indeed, i
was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he came
directly back with us, on the same road that we came
from Madrid, above twenty miles; when having passed
two rivers, and come into the plain country, we found
.ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country was'
pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden, turn-
ing to the left, he approached the mountains another
•way; and though it ig true, the hills and the precipices
looked dreadsully, yet he made so many tours, such
meanders, and led us by such winding ways, we insen-
sibly passed the height of the mountains, without being
much incumbered with the snow; and all on a sudden
he shewed us the pleasant fruitsul provinces of Langue-
doc and Gaicoigne, all green and flourishing; though
indeed they were at a great distance, and we had some
rough way to pass yet.
We were a little uneasy however, when we found it
Ctiowed one whole day and a night, so sast, that we
, K 3 could
could not travel; but he bid us be easy, we should soon
be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to de-
scend every day, and to come more north than before;
and so, depending upon our guide, we went'on.
It was about two hours before night, when our guide
being something before us, and not just in sight, out
rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a bear,
out of an hollow way, adjoining to a thick wood ; two of
the wolves flew upon the guide, and had he been half a
mile before us, he had been devoured indeed, before we
could have helped him: one of them sastened ugon his
horse, and the other attacked the man with that violence,
that he had not time, or not presence of mind enough,
to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most
lustily: my man Friday being next to me, I bade him ride
up, and see what was the matter: as soon as Friday came
in sight of the man, he hallooed, as loud as the other, O
master! O master! But like a bold sellow, rode directly 1
'up to the man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that at-
tacked him into the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for he, having been used to that kind of crea-
ture in his country, had no sear upon him, but went
close up to him, and shot him, as above;. whereas any
of us would have fired at a sarther distance, and have
perhaps either mifsed the wolf, or endangered shooting
the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than
I, and indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with
the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the
difmullest howlings of wolves, and the noise redoubled
by the echo of the mountains, that it was to us as if there
had been a prodigious multitude of them; and perhaps
indeed there was not such a sew, as that we had no cause
of apprehensions.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other,
that had sastened upon the horse, left him immediately,
and fled, having happily sastened upon his head, where
the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth, so that
he had not done him much hurt: the man, indeed, was
most hurt: for the raging creature had bit him twice,
once on the arm, and the other * time a, little above his
,' knee j
lenee; and he was just as it were tumbling down by the
disorder of the horse, when Friday came up, and shot
the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's pis-
tol we all mended our pace, and rid up as sast as the
way (which was very difficult) would give us leave, to
see what was the matter: as soon as we came clear of the
trees, which blinded us before, we saw plainly what had
been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor
guide; though we did not presently discern what kind of
creature it was he had killed. '\
But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such
a surprising 'manner, as that which followed between
Friday and the bear, which gave us all (though at first
we were surprised and afraid for him) the greatest di-
version imaginable: as the bear is an heavy, clumsy
creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does, which is
swift and light, so he has two particular qualities, which
generally are the rule of his actions; first, as to men,
who are not his proper prey, 1 say not his proper prey,
because, though I cannot say what excessive hunger might
do, which was now their case, the ground being all co-
vered with snow; yet as to men,- he does not usually at-
tempt them, unless they sirst attack him: on the contra-
ry, if you meet him in the woods, if you do not meddle
with him, he won't meddle with you; yet then you mult
take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road;
sot he is a very nice gentleman, he will not go a step out
of the way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid,
your best way is to look another way, and keep going
on; for sometimes, if yon stop, and stand still, and look
ltedsaftly at him, he takes it for an asfront; and if you
throw or toss any thing at him, and it hits him, though
it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he takes it
for an asfront, and sets all other business aside to pursue
his revenge.; for he will have satissaction in point of ho-
nour, and this is his sirst quality: the next is, that if he
be once affronted, he will never leave you night or day,
till he has his revenge, but follow at a good round rate
till he overtakes you. i
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we
came up to him, he was helping him off from his horse;
N 4 i - -- . for
for the man was both hurt and frighted, and indeed the
last more than the first; when, on a sudden we espie«J
the bear come out of the wood, and a very monstrous one
it was, the biggest by sar that ever I saw: we were all
a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday
saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the sel-
low's countenance: O ! O! O ! says Friday, three times,
pointing to him, O master! you give me te leave,-me
shakee te hand with him, me makee you good laugh.
I was surprised to see the sellow so pleased: You fool,
you, said I, he will eat you up. Eatee me up! eatee me
up! says Friday, twice over again; me eatee him up i
me makee yon good laugh: you all ltay here, me shew
you good laugh: so down he sits, and gets his boots off
in a. moment, and put on a pair of pumps (as we call
the flat shoes they wear) and which he had in his poc-
ket, gives my other servant his horse, and, with his gun,
away he flew, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle
with nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls -to
him, as if the bear could understand him : Hark ye! hark
ye! laysFriday, me speakee wit you. We followed at a
distance; for now being come down to the Gascoigne side
of the mountains, we-were entered a vast great forest,
where 'the country was plain, and pretty open, though
many trees in it scattered/here and there.
Friday, who had, as we lay, the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great stone,
and throws at him, and hit him just on the head ;v but
did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against
a wall; but it answered Friday's end;_ for the rogue
was so void of sear, that he did. it purely to make
the bear follow him, and shew us some laugh, as he
called it. |
As soon as the bear selt the stones and saw hirrLh^
turns about, and comes after him, taking devilishU^ng
strides, and muffling along at a strange rate, so as would
put an horse a middling gallop; away funs Friday,
and takes his course, as if he ran towards us for help;
so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and de-
liver my man; though I was angry at him heartily for
bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going
about
2>3
about his own business another way; and especially I
was angry that he had turned the bear upon us, and then
run away; and I called out, Ynu dog, said 1, is this
your making us laugh? Come away, and take your
horse, that we may shoot the creature. He hears me,
and cries out, No shoot, no .shoot, stand still, you get
.much laugh: and as the nimble creature ran two seet
for the beast's one, he turned on a sudden on one side
of us, and seeing a great oak-tree, fit for his purpose,
he beckoned us to follow, and, doubling his pace, he
gets nimbly up the'tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom of
the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at
a distance; the first thing he did, he stopt at the gun,
smelt to it, but let it lie, aud up he scrambles into the
tree, climbing like a' cat, though so monstrous heavy;
I was amazed at the follyjas I thought it, os my man,
and could hot for my lise see any thing to laugh at yet,
till seeing the bear get up the tree, wf all rode nearer
to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out
to the small of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got
about half way to him: as soon as the bear got out to
that part where the limb of the tree was weaker. Ha,
says he to us, now you see me teachee the bear dance;
so he salls a jumping, and shaking the boughs at which
the bear began to totter, but stood still, aiid began to look
behind him, to see how he should get back; then indeed
we did laugh heartily : but Friday hadnot done with him
by a great deal; when he sees him stand still, he calls
out to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could
speak English, What, you come no sarther? Pray you
, come "sarther! So he left jumping and shaking the
bough; and the beari just as if be understood what he
said, did come a littleiarther; then he sell a jumping
again, and the be»r:stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him 011
the head, and called to Friday to stand still, and we
•would shoot the bear; buthe cried out earnestly, O pray!
O pray !-no shoot, me flioot, by and then ; he would have
; said, by and by. However, to, shorten the story, Fiiclay
'•' ,~ 'v '* In' •' 1 "'danCed
danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we'
had laughing enough indeed, but still could not imagine
what the sellow would do; sor sirst we thought he de-
pended upon shaking the bear osf; and we found the
bear was too cunning for that too; for he would not get
out sar enough to be thrown down, but clings sast with
his great broad claws and seet, so that we could not ima-
gine what would be the end of it, and where the jell
would be at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly ; for seeing the
bear cling sast to the bough, and that he would not be
persuaded to come any sarther; Well, well, said Friday ;.
you no come sarther, me go, me go; you no come to
me, me come to you: and upon this he goes out to the
smallest end of the bough where it would bend with his
weight, and gently lets himsels down by it, sliding down
the bough, till he came near enough to jump down on
his seet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up andf
stauds still.
Well, said I to him, Friday, what will you do now?
Why do not you shoot him? No shoot, says Friday, no
yet, me shoot now me no kill; me stay, give you one
more laugh; and indeed so he did, as you will' see pre-.
"sently; fox when the hear saw his enemy gone, he comes
back from the bough where he stood, but did it mighty
leisurely, looking behind him every step, and coming
backward till he got into the body of the tree then,
with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the
tree, grasping it 'with his claws, and moving one foot at
a time very leisurely; at this juncture, and just before he
could set his hind feet upon the ground, Friday stepped.
close to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his
ear, and shot him as dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did not
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by our looks,
he salls a laughing himself very loud: so we kilt bear in
our country, says Friday. So you kill them 'said 1, why
you have no guns: No, says he, no guns, hut shoot great
much long arrow.
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us; but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt,
and what to do we hardly knew; the howling of wolves
fan much in my head; and indeed, except the noise I
once heard on the shore of Africa, of which I have said
something already, I never heard any thing that silled
me with so much horror.
These things, and the approach of night, called us
off, or else, as Friday would have had, us we mould cer-
tainly have taken the skin of this monstrous creature
off, which Was worth saving; but we had three leagues
to go; and our guide hastened us; so we left him, and
went forward oh our journey.
The ground was still covered with snow, though not
so deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ra-
venous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come
down into the forest, and plain country, pressed by-
hunger, to seek for food; and bad done a great deal of
mischief in the villages, where they surprised the coun-
try people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses,
and some people too.
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our
guide told us, if there were any more wolves in 'the
country, we should sind them there; and this was a
small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and
a long narrow desile or lane, which we were to pass to
get through the wood, and then we should come to the
village where we were to lodge.
It was within half an hour of sun-set when we en-
tered the first wood; and a little after sun-set when we
came into the plain. We met with nothing in the first
wood, except that, in a little plain within the wood,
which was not above two surlongs over, we saw five
great wol<res cross the road, sull speed one after ano-
ther, as if they had been in chase of some prey, and
had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were
gone, and out of sight, in a sew moments.
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched
saint-hearted sellow, bade us keep in a ready posture; for
he believed there were more wolves a coming.'
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through that
wood, which was near -half a league, and entered the
plain; as soon as we came into the plain, we had oc-
casion enough to look about us. The first object we met
v with
with was a dead horse ; that is to say, a poor horse
which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of
them at work; we could not say eating of him, but
picking of his bones rather; for they had eaten up all
the fleih before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their seast,
neither did they take much notice of us; Friday would
have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any
means; for I found we were like to have more business
upon our hands than we were aware of. We were
mat'half gone over the plain, but we began to hear the
wolves howl in the woods, on our left, in a frightsul
manner; and presently after we saw about an hundred
coming on directly towards us, all in a body, and most
of them in a line, as regularly as an army .drawn up
by experienced officers: I scarce knew in what man-
ner to receive them; but found, to draw ourselves
in a close line, was the only way: so we formed in
taimtrment: but, that we might not have too much
-interval, I ordered, that only every other man should
fire; and that the others, who had not sired, mould
stand ready to -give them a second volley immediately,
- if they continued to. advance upon us; and that then
• those who had fired at first, should not pretend to load
their susils again, bet stand ready, with every one a
pistol, for we were all armed with a susil, and a pair
of pistols,-each man; so we wereby this method able
'to sire six volleys, half of us at a time: however, at
, present we had no necessity; for, upon firing the first
volley, the enemy made a sull stop, being terrified, as
well with the noise, as with the sire; four of them,
•being shot in the head, dropped; several others were
wounded, and went Weeding off, as we could see by the
snow: 1 found they stopped, but did not immediately
- retreat; whereupon remembering that I had been told,
that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of
a man, I caused all our company to halloo as loud as
we could, and found the notion not altogether mis-
taken; for, upon our shout, they began to retire, and
turn about; then I ordered a second volley to be fired
• in their -rear, 'which put them to the. gallop,. and.away
they <went. to: .the woods.
...' This
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and
that we might lose no time, we kept doing; but we
had but little more than loaded our suiils, and put our-
selves into readiness, when we heard a terrible noise
in the same wood, on our left; only that it was sarther
onward the same way we were to go.
The night was coming on, and the night began to
be dusky, which - made it the worse on our vide; but,
the noise increasing, we could easily perceive, that it
was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures;
and, on a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of
wolves, on our left, one behind us, and one on our
front; so that we seemed to be surrounded with them;
however, as they did not sall upon us, we kept our
way forward, as sast as we' could make our .horses go,
I which, the^way being very rough, was on,ly a good
large trot; and in this manner we only came in view
os the entrance of the wood, through which we were
to pass, at the sarther side of the plain; but we were
greatly surprised, when, coming near the lane, or pass,
we saw a consused number of wolves standing just at
the entrance.
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we
heard the noile of a gun; and looking that way, out
rushed an horse, with a laddie and a bridle on him, fly-
ing like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after
him sull speed; indeed the horse had the heels of them;
but as we suppose, that he could not hold it at that rate,
we doubted not but they would get up with him at last;
and no question but they did. .
Here we had a most horrible fight; for, riding up to
the entrance where the horse came out, we found the
carcase of another horse, and of two men devoured by
these ravenous creatures, and of one the man was no
doubt the same whom we heard sire a gun; for there
lay a gun just by him sired off', but, as to the man, his
head, and the upper part of his body, were eaten up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew' not what
course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon; for
they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey; and
I verily believe there were three hundred of them: It
happened very much to our advantage, that at the.
entrance
entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there
lay some large timber-trees, which had been cut down
the summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage:
I drew my little troop in among these trees, and pla-
cing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I advised
them all to alight, and, keeping that tree before us, for
a breast-work, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts,
inclosing our horses in the centre.
We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a
more surious charge than the creatures made upon us in
this place: they came on us with a growling kind of a
noise,- and mounted the piece of timber (which, as I
said, was our breast-work,) as if they were only rushing
upon their prey; and this sury of theirs, it seems, was
principally Occasioned by their seeing our horses behind
us, which was the prey they aimed at: I ordered out
men to fire as before, every other man; and they took
their aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the
wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity Jo
keep a continual firing, for they came on like devils,
those.behind pushing on those before. 1
When we had fired our second volley of our susils,
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they would
have gone off, but it was but a moment, for others came
forward again; so we fired our volleys of our pistols,
and I believe, in these four firings, we killed seventeen
or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many; yet they
came on again.
I was loth to spend our last shot too hastily; so I called
my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better em-
ployed; for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he
charged my susil, and his own, while we were en-
gaged; but, as I said, I called my other man, and, giv-
ing him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train, all
along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train;
he did so, and had but time to get away, when the
wolves came up to it, and some were got up upon it,
when, I, snapping an uncharged pistol, close to the pow-
der, set it on fire; and those that were upon the timber
were scorched with it, and six or seven of them sell, ot
rather jumped in among us, with the force and sright
of the fire; we dispatched these in an instant, and the
'' rest
Test were so frighted with the light, which the night,
sor now it was very near dark, made more terrible,
that they drew back a little.
Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in
one volley, and after that we gave a shout; upon this,
the wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon
near twenty lame ones, which we found struggling on
the ground, and sell a cutting them with our swords,
-which answered our expectation; for the crying anil
howling they made were better understood by their sel-
lows; so that they fled, and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore of
them; and had it been day-light, we had killed many
more: the field of battle being thus cleared, we made
sorward again; for we had still near a league to go:
we heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the
woods as we went, several times; and sometimes we
fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling
our eyes, we were not certain; so in about an hour
more, we came to the town, where we were to lodge,
which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms; for
it seems, that, the night before, the wolves and some
bears had broken into that village, and put them in 3
terrible fright; and they were obliged to keep guard
night and day, but especially in the night to preserve
their cattle, and indeed their people.
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs
so swelled with the rankling of his two wounds, that he
could go no sarther; so we were obliged to take a new
guide there, and go to Tholouse, where we found a
warm climate, a fruitsul, pleasant country, and.no snow,
no wolves, or any thing like them: but when we told
our story at Tholouse, they told us it was nothing but
what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the ground .
but they inquired much what kind of a guide we had
gotten, that would venture to bring us that way in such
a severe season; and told us, it was very well we
were not all devoured: when we told them how we
placed ourselves, and the horses in the middle, they
blamed us exceedingly, and told us, it was fifty to one
but we had been all destroyed; for it was the sight of
the
the horses that made the wolves so surious, seeing their
prey; and that at other times they are really afraid of a
gun; but they being excessive hungry, and raging on
that account, the eagerness to come at the horses had
made them senleless of danger; and that if we had not
by the continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of
the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great
odds but that we had been torn to pieces: whereas, had
we been content to have sat still on horseback, and fired
as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses
so much for their own, when men were on their
backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that at
last, if we ha'cf stood altogether, and left our horses,
they would have been so eager to have devoured them,
that we might have come off sase, especially having
our sire-arms in our hands, and being so' many in
number.
For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my
lise; for seeing above'three hundred devils come roar-
ing and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing
to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost;
and as it was, I believe, 1 shall nevewtcare to cross those
mountains again; I think I would itrnch rather go a
thousand leagues, by sea, though I were sure to meet
'with a storm once a week. ,
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of, in my
passage through France; nothing but what our travel-
lers have given an account of, -with much more advantage
than I can: I travelled from Tholouse to Paris, and
'without any considerable stay came to .Calais, and landed
sase at Dover, the fourteenth of January, after having
had a severe cold season to travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had
in a little time all my new discovered estate sase about
me, the bills of exchange, which I brought with me,
having been very currently paid.
My principal guide, and privy counsellor, was my
good antient widow, who, in gratitude for the money
I had sent her, thought no pains too much, or care too
great, to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely
with every thing, that I was persectly easy as to the se-
curity of my effects; and indeed I was very happy from
my beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted in*
iegrity of this good gentlewoman.
And now 1 began to think of leaving my esf'ects with
this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the'
Brasils: but now another scruple came in the way, and
that was religionfor as I had entertained some doubts
about the Roman religion, even while I was abroad,
especially in my state of solitude, so I knew there was
no going to the Brasils for me, much less going to settle ,
there, unless I resolved to embrace the Roman Catholic
religion, without any reserve; except on the. other hand
I resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles, be a martyr
sor religion^ and die in the inquisition; so I resolved to
stay at home, and, if I could sind means for it, to dispose
of my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my friend at Lisbon,
.who in return gave me notice, that he could easily dis-
pose of it there! but that if 1 thought fit to give him
•leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants, the
survivors of my trustees who lived in the Brasils, who
must sully understand the value of it, who lived just upon
the spot, and who I knew to be very rich, so that he be-
lieved they would be fond of buying it; he did not
doubt, but 1 should make^ or 5000 pieces of eight the
more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gasje him orders to offer it to
them, and lie did so; and, in about eight months more,
the ship being then returned, he sent me an account, that
they had. accepted the offer, and had remitted 33,000
pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to
pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form
which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man,
who sent~Tne the bills of exchange for 33,800 pieces
«f eight for the estate; reserving the payment of 100
moidores a year, to him, the old man, during his lise,
and 50 moidores afterwards to his son for his lise, which
I had promised them; and which the plantation was to
make good as a rent-charge. And thus I have given
the first part of a lise of fortune and adventure, a
lite of providence's chequer-work, and of a variety
4' which
*
which the world will seldom be able to shew the like
osf': beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily
than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as to
hope for.
Any one would think, that in this state of complicated
good fortune, I was pall running any more hazards;
and so indeed I had been, if other circumstances had
concurred ; but I was inured to a wandering lise, had no
samily, nor many relations; nor, however righ, had X
contracted much acquaintance; and though I had fold
my estate in the Brasils, yet 1 could not keep that country
out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the
wing again; especially I could not resist the strong in-
clination I had to see my island, and to know if the poor
Spaniards were in being there; and how the rogues -I
left there had used them.
My true friend, the widow, earnest!)' dissuaded me'
from it, and so sar prevailed with me, that almost sor
seven years she prevented my running abroad; during
which time I took my two nephews, the children os
one of my brothers, into my care: the eldest, having
something of his own, 1 bred up as a j^ptleman, and
gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate,
after my decease; the other I put out to a captain of a
ship; and p.fter five years, finding him a sensible, bold,
enterprising young sellow, I put him into -a good ship,
and sent him to sea, and this young sellow afterwards
drew me in, as old as I was, to sarther adventure my-
self.
In the mean time, I. in part settled myself here: for,
first of all I married, and that not either to my disad-
vantage or dissatissaction; and had three children, two
sons and one daughter: but my wise dying, and my
nephew coming home with good success from a voyage
to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and his importu-
nity, prevailed and engaged me to go in' his ship as a
private trader to the East-Indies: this was in the year
1694.
'* In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island,
saw my successors the Spaniards, had the whole story of
their lives, and of the villains 1 left there; how at first
they
they insulted t!* poor Spaniards, how they afterwards
agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the
Spaniards wef obliged to use violence with them; how
they were subjected to the Spaniards; how honestly the
Spaniards uedthem; an history, if it were entered into,
as sull of variety and wondersul accidents as my own
part; particularly also as to their battles with the Carib-
bean?, who landed several times upon the island, and as
to the improvement fhey made upon the island itself;
and how five of them made an attempt upon the main
land, and brought away eleven men and five women
prisoners; by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young children on the island.
Here 1 stayed about twenty days; left them supplies
of all necessary things, and particularly of arms, pow-
der, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen. wWU-

Besides this, I shared the land into parts with them,
rescived to myself the property of the whole, but gave
them such parts, respectively, as they agreed on; and,
'having settled all things with them, and etl^gcj. ttutrn
not to leave the place, I left them there.
From thence i touched at the Brasils, from whence I
sent a bark, which 1 bought there, with more people, to
the island; and in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven
women, being such as I found proper for service, or for
wives to such as wouW take Aeux^as to the Englishmen,

ply themselves to planting which 1 afterwards could not

after they were mastered, and had their properties set
apart for them. I sent them alto from the Brasils five
cows, three of them being big with calf, some sheep,

'THE- END OF THE F
IKST VOLUME*
LIFE AND ADVENTURES.
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
THAT homely proverb, used on so many occasions
in England, viz. That what is bred in the bone
will not go out of the flesh, was never more verified than
in the story of my life.—Anyone would think, that
after thirty-five years affliction, and a variety of un-
happy circumstances, which sew men, if ever any, went
through before; and after near seven years of peace and
enjoyment in the sulness of all things; grown old, and
when, if ever it might be allowed me to have had ex-
perience of every state of middle lise, and to know which
was most adapted to make a man completely happy; I
say, after all this, any one would have thought that the
native propensity to rambling, which I gave an account
of in my first setting out into the world, to have been ib
predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, the
volatile part be sully evaporated, or at least condensed,
and [ might, at sixty-one years of age, have been a little
inclined to stay at home, and have done venturing lise
and sortune any more.
Nay, sarther, the common motive of foreign adven-
tures was taken away in me; for I had no fortune to
make—1 had nothing to seek.—If I had gained ten thou-
a S land
sand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had already
sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to; and
that I had was visibly increasing; for having no great
samily, I could not spend the income of what I had,
unless I would set up for an expensive way of living,
such as a great samily,'servants, equipage, gaiety, and
the like, which were things I had no notion of, or incli-
nation to, so that I had nothing indeed to do, but to lit
ftill, and sully enjoy what I had got, and see it increase
daily upon my hands.
\et all these things had no efsect upon me, or at least
not enough to relist the strong inclination I had to go
abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical dis-
stemper; particularly the desire of seeing my new plan-
tation in the island, and the colony I left there, run in
my head continually.—I dreamed of it all night, and
my imagination ran upon it all day; it was uppermost
in all my thoughts, and my sancy worked so steadily
and strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep;
in short, nothing could remove it out of my mind.—It
«ven broke so violently into ail my discourses, that it
made my conversation tiresome; for I could talk of no-
thing else; all my discourse ran into it, even to imper-
tinence; and I saw it myself.
1 have often heard persons of good judgment say, that
all the stir people make in the world about ghosts and
apparitions, is owing to the strength of imagination,
and the powersul operation of sancy in their minds;
that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing, or a
ghost walking, and the like: that people's pouring afsec-
tionately upon the.past conversation of their deceased
friends, so realizes it to them, that they are capable of
sancying, upon iome extraordinary circumstances, that
they 'see them, talk to them, and are answered by them,'
when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapour
in the thing, and they really know nothing of the matter.
For my part, 1 know not to this hour, whether
there are any such things as real apparitions, spectres,
or walking of people after they are dead, or whether
there is any thing in the stories they tell us of that kind,
more than the product of vapours, lick minds, and
wandering sancies.—But this I know, that my imagina-
tion
7
tion worked me up to such a height, and brought me into
such excess of vapours, or what else I may call it, that
I actually supposed myself oftentimes upon the spot, at
,my old castle behind the trees; I saw my old Spaniard,
Friday's sather, and the reprobate sailors, whom I left
upon the island. Nay, I sancied I talked with them,
and looked at them so steadily, tho' I was broad awake,
as the persons just before me; and this I did till I often
frightened myself with the images my sancy represented
to me.—One time, in my sleep, I had the villainy of
the three pirate sailors so lively related to me by the
first Spaniard and Friday's sather, that it was surprising;
they told me how they barbarously attempted to murder
all the Spaniards, and that they set fire to the provisions
they had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve them;
things that I had never heard of, and yet they were all
of them true in sact; and it was so warm in my ima-
gination, and so realized to me, that to the hour I
saw them, \ could not be persuaded but that it was, or
would be true; also how I resented it, when the Spa-
niards complained to me; and how I brought them to
justice, tried them before me, and ordered them all three
to be hanged.—What there was-really in all this mail
be seen in its place; for however I came to form such
things in my dream, and what secret converse of spirits
injected it, yet there was, 1 say, very much of it true.
I own that this dream had nothing in it literally and
specifically true; but tlje general part was so true,-the
base and villanous behaviour of these three hardened
rogues was such, and had been so much worse than all I
can describe, that the dream had too much similitude
of the sact; and as I would afterwards have punished
them severely, so if I h,ad hanged them all, I had been
much in the right, and should have been justified both
by the laws of God and man.
But to return to my story: in this kind of temper
I had lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my
life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion, but
what had something or other of this in it; so that my!
wise, who law my mind so wholly bent upon it, told
me very seriously one night, that she believed there was
fume secret powersul impulse of Providence upon me,
a 4 which
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
which had determined me to go thither again; and that
she found nothing hindered my going, but my being en-
gaged tor a wise and children. — She told me, that it was
true, she could not think of parting with me; but as she
was assured, that if she was dead, it would be the first
thing I would do; so, as it seemed to her, that the thing
was determined above, she would not be the only ob-
struction; for, is I thought sit, and resolved to go——
Here she found me very intent upon her words, and that
I looked very earnestly at her; so that it a little disor-
dered her, and she stopped. 1 asked her why she did not
go on, and say out what she was going to say. But I per-
ceived her heart was. too sull, and Tome tears stood in
her eyes.—Speak out, my dear, says I, are you willing
I should go? No, says she, very afsectionately, I ani sar
from willing; but if you are resolved to go, says she,
rather than I will be the only hindrance, 1 will go with
you; for though 1 think if a preposterous' thing for one
of your years, and in your condition, yet if it must be,
laid she again, weeping, I will not leave you ; for if it be
of heaven, you mult do it, there is no resistng it—and
if heaven makes it your duty to go, he will also make
it mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that
I may not obstruct it.
This affectionate behaviour of my wise, brought me
a little out of the vapours, ,and I began to consider what
I was doing — I corrected my wandering sancy, and be-
gan' to argue with myself sedately, what business 1 had,
after three score years, and after such a lise of tedious
sufferings and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy
a manner, I say, what business had 1 to rush into new
hazards, and put myself upon adventures, fit only for
youth and poverty to run into.
With those thoughts, 1 considered my new engage-
ments—that I had a wise, one child born, and my wise
then great with child of another; and that I had' all the
world could give me, and had no need to seek hazards
for gain—that I was declining in years, and ought to
think rather of leaving what 1 had gained, than of seek-
ing to increase it; that as to what my wise had said, of
its being an impulse from heaven, and that it should
be my duty to go, I had no notion of that; so alter
many
many of these cogitations, I struggled with the power
of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe
people may always do in like cases, if they will, and, in
a word, I conquered it : composed myself with such argu-
ments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my present
condition surnished me plentisully with; and particular-
ly, as the mod essectual method, I resolved to divert my-
self with other things, and to engage in some business
that might essectually tie me up from any more excur-
sions of this kind; for I found the thing returned upon
me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, or any
thing of moment immediately before me.
To this purpose 1 bought a little farm in the county
of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had
a little convenient house upon it, and the land about it
I found was capable of great improvement, and that it.
was many ways suited to my inclination, which I delight-
ed in cultivating, managing, planting, and improving;
and particularly, being an inland county, I was removed
from conversing among ships, sailors, and things relating
to the remote parts of the world.
In a word, I went down to my sarm, settled my sa-
mily, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon,
horses, cows, sheep; and, setting seriously to work,
became in one half year a mere country gentleman:
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my
servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting,
&c. and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life
that nature was capable of directing, or that a man,
always bred to misfortunes, was capable of being re-
treated to. * i .
I sarmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay,
was limited by no articles; I could pull up, or cut
down, as I pleased; what I planted was for myself,
'and what I improved was for my samily; and having
thus left osf the thoughts of wandering, I had not
the least discomfort in any part of my lise, as to this
world. Now I thought, indeed, that I enjoyed that
middle state of lise which my sather so earnestly re-
commended to me; a kind of heavenly lise, something
like what is described by the poet, upon the subject of a
country lise.
a 5 Free
Free from vices, free from' care,
Age has no pains, and youth no snare.
But in the middle of all this selicity, one blow from
unforeseen Providence unhinged me at once, and not only
made a breach upon me inevitable and incurable, but
drove me by its consequence, upon a deep relapse into
the wandering disposition, which, as I may say, being
born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold of me,
and, like the returns of a violent distemper, came on
-with an irresistible force upon me; so that nothing could
make any more impression upon me. This blow was
the loss of my wise.
It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my
wise, to give a character of her particular virtues, and
make my court to the sex by the flattery of a suneral
sermon. She was, in a sew words, the stay of all my
assairs, the centre of all my enterprises.; the engine,
that by her prudence reduced me to that happy compass
I was in, from the most extravagant and ruinous project:
that fluttered in my head, as above; apd did more to
guide my rambling genius, than a mother's tears, a
sather's instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own
reasoning powers could do. 1 was happy in listening to
her tears, and in being moved by her intreaties, and to
the last degree desolate and dislocated in the world by
the loss of her.
When she was gone, the world fboked aukwardly
round me; I was as much a stranger in it, in my
thoughts, as I was in the Bralils, when I first went on
shore there; and as much alone, except as to the assist-
ance of servants, as I was in my island. I knew neither
what to do, or what not to do. I law the world busy
-round me, one part labouring for bread, and the other
squandering it in vile excesses, or empty pleasures,
equally miserable, because the end they proposed still
tied from them; for' the men of pleasure every day sur-.
feited of their vice, and heaped-up work for sorrow
and repentance: and the men of labour spend their
iirength in daily stragglings for bread, to maintain the
vital ltiength they laboured with; so living in a daily
circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and working
but to live; as if daily bread were the only end of a
wearisome lise, and a wearisome lise the only occasion
of daily bread.
This put me in mind of the lise I lived in my king-
dom, the island, where I suffered no more corn to grow,
because I did not want it; and bred no more goats, be-
cause I had no more use for them: where the money
lay in the drawer till it grew mildewed, and had scarce
the savor to be looked upon in 20 years.
All these things, had I improved them as I ought to
have done, and as reason .and religion had dictated to
me, would have taught me to search surther than human
enjoyments for a sull selicity, and that there was some-
thing which certainly was the reason and end of lise,
superior to all these things, which was either to :be pos-
sessed, or at least hoped for on this side the grave.
But my sage counsellor .was gone; I was like a ship
without a pilot, that could only run before the wind:
roy thoughts run all away again into the old affair, my'
head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign
adventures, and all the pleasing innocent amusements
of my sarm, and my garden, my cattle, and my samily,
which before entirely possessed me, where nothing to me,
had no relish, and where like music to one that has no
ear, or food to one that has no taste : in a word, I resolved
to leave off housekeeping, let my sarm, and return to
London; and in a sew months after I did so.
When 1 came to London, 1 was still as uneasy as be-
fore; I had no relish to the place, no employment in it,
nothing to do bat to saunter about like an idle person,
of whom it may be said, he'is persectly useless in God's
creation, and it is not one sarthing matter to the reft
of his kind whether he be dead or alive. This also was
the thing, which of all circumstances of lise was the
most my aversion, who had been all my days uled to an
active lise; and 1 would often say to myself, a state of
idleness is the very dregs of lise; and indeed I thought I
was much more suitably employed, when I was 26 days
making a deal board.
It was now the beginning of the year 16.93, when
my nephew, whom, as I have observed before, I had
a 6 brought
brought up to the sea, and had made him commander os
a ship, was come home from a short voyage to Bilboa,
being the first he had made; he came to me, and told
me, that some merchants of his acquaintance had been
proposing to hirri to go a voyage for them to the East-
Indies and to China, as private traders: and now, uncle,
says he, if you will go to sea with me, 1 will engage to
land, you upon your eld habitation in the island, for we
are to touch at the Brasils.
jMothing can be a greater demonstration of a suture
state, and of the existence of an invisible world, than
the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of things,
-which we form in our minds, persectly reserved, and not
communicated to any in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how sar my distemper of
wandering was returned upon me, and 1 knew nothing
of what he had in his thoughts^to say; when that very
morning before he came to me, 1 had, in a great deal of
consusion of thought, and revolving every part of my
'circumstances in my mind, come to this resolution, viz.
that 1 would go to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea-
captain, and so, if it was rational and practicable, I
would go and see the island again, and see what was be-
come of my people there. I had pleated myself.alfo with
tjie thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying inha-
bitants from hence, getting a patent for the possession,
and 1 know not what; when in the middle of all this, in
comes my nephew, as I have said, with his project of
carrying me thither, in his way to the t ast-fndies.
I-paused a while at his words, and looking steadily at
him, What devil, said I, sent you on this unlucky er-
rand? My nephew startled, as if he had been frighted
at first; but perceiving I was not much displeased with
the proposal, he recovered himself; I hope it may not be
an unlucky proposal, fir, says he; I dare say you would
be pleased to see your new colony there, where you once
reigned with more selicity than most of jour brother
monarchs in the world.
In a word the scherhe hit so exactly with my tem-
per, that is to say, with the prepossession Lwas under,
and of which I have said so much, that I told him in
few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I-would
l 6' gQ
go with him: but I told him, I would not promise to go
any sarther than my own illand. Why, Sir, says he, you
do not want to be lest there aj-'ain, I hope? Why, said I,
can you not take me up again in your return? He told
me it would not be possible to do so; that the merchants
-would never allow him to come. that way with a loaden
ship ot luch value, it being a month's sail out of his way,
and might be three or four: Besides, Sir, if 1 should mis-
. carry, said he, and not return at all, then you would be
just reduced to the condition you were in before.
This was very rational; but we both found out a
remedy tor it, which was to carry a framed iloop on
board the ship, which, being taken in pieces, and
shipped on board the ship, rriight, by the help of some
carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up
again in the island, and sinished, fit to go to sea in a sew
days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the importuni-
ties of my nephew, joined in so effectually with my in-
clination, that nothing could oppose me; on the other
hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody that concerned
themselves so much for me, as to persuade me one
way or other, except my ancient good friend the wi-
dow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider my
years, my easy circumstances, and the heedless hazard
of a long voyage; and, above all, my young children:
but it was all to no purpose, I had an irresistible desire
to go the voyage; and i told her, 1 thought there was
something so uncommon in the impressions I had upon
my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind of
relisting Providence, if 1 should attempt to stay at home;
after which the ceased her expostulations, and joined
with me, not only in making provision for my voyage,
but also in settling my samily-affairs in my absence, and
providing for the education of my children.
In order to this, 1 made my will, and settled the
estate I had in such a manner for my children, and
placed it in such hands, that I was persectly easy and
satisfied they would have justice done them, whatever
might besal me; and for their education, I left it
wholly to my widow, with a sufficient maintenance to
herself for her care; all which she richly deserved; for
no
no mother could have taken more care in their educa-
tion, or understood it better; and as she livetl till I came
home, I also lived to thank her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning
of January, 1694-5, and 1, with my man Friday, went
on board in the Downs the 9th, having, betides that
sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable
cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony,
which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved to
leave so.
First, I carrried with me some servants, whom I
purposed to place there, as inhabitants, or at least, to
set on work there upon my own account while I staid,
and either to leave them there, or carry them forward,
as they should appear willing, particularly I carried two
carpenters, a smith, and a very handy ingenious sellow,
who was a cooper by trade, but was also a general me-
chanic, for he was dextr-ous at making wheels, and
hand-mills to grind corn, was a good turner, and a
good pot-maker; he also made any thing that was proper
to make of earth, or wood; in a word, we call him
our jack of all trades.
With these I carried a taylor, who had offered himself
to go passenger to the East. Indies with my nephew, but
afterwards consented to stay on our new plantation, and
proved a most necessary handy sellow as could be dctired,
in many other businesses besides that of his trade; for as
I observed formerly, necessity arms us for all employ-
ments. .
My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not
kept an account ot' particulars, consisting of a sufficient
quantity of linen, and some thin Englishstuffs for clothing
the Spaniards that I expected to find there, and enough
of them, as bymy calculation might comfortably supply
them for seven years; if 1 remember right, the materials
which I carried for clothing them, -with gloves, hats,
shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could
want for wearing, amounted to above 2001. including
some beds, bedding, and houshold stuff, particularly
kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c.
besides near 1001. more in iron-work, nails, tools of
. . every
every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary
thing I could think of.
I carried also a hundred spare arms, mufquets and
fufils, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two
pieces of brass cannon; and because I knew not what
time, and what extremities, I was providing for, I car-
ried an hundred barrels of powder, besides swords, and
cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and halberts,
so that, in short, we had a large magazine of all forts
of stores; and I made my nephew carry two small
quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to
leave behind, if there was occasion, that when they
came there, we might build a fort, and man it against
all forts of enemies; and indeed at first I thought there
would be need enough of it all, and much more, if we
hoped to maintain our possession of the island, as shall be
seen in the course of the story.
I had not such bad luck in this voyage, as I had
been used to meet with, and therefore shall have the less
occasion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps may be
impatient to hear how matters went with my colony;
yet some odd accidents, cross-winds, and bad weather
happened, on this first setting out, which made the voyage
longer than I expected it at first; and I, who had never
made but one voyage, viz. my first voyage to Guinea,
in which I might be said to come back again,. as the
voyage was at first designed, began to think the lame ill
sate still attended me; and that I was born to be never
contented with my own shore, and yet to be always un-
fortunate at sea.
Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and
we were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where
we lay windbound two-and-thirty days; but we had this
satissaction with the disaster, that provisions were here
exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that while
we lay here, we never touched the ship's stores, but rather
added to them; here also I took several hogs, and two
cows with their calves, which 1 resolved, if! had a good
passage, to put ashore in my island, but we found occasion
to dispose otherwise of them.
We
We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and had
a very sa'r gale of wind, for some days; as J remem-
ber, it might be about the 20th of February, in the even-
ing late, when the mate, having the watch, came into
the round-house, and toid us he' saw a flash of fire, and
heard a gun fired; and while he was telling us of it, a
boy came in, and told us the boatswain heard another.
This made us all run out upon the quarter deck, where
for a while we heard nothing, but in a sew minutes we
saw a very gieat light, and found that there was some
very terribl; fire at a diilance; immediately we had re-
course to our reckonings, in which we all agreed, that
there could be no land that way in which the fire
shewed itself, no, not for 500 leagues, for it appeared
at W. N. W. Upon this we concluded it must be some
ship on fire at sea; and as by our hearing the noise
of guns just before, we concluded it could not be far
off', we stood directly towards it, and were presently sa-
tisfied we should discover it, because the sarther we sailed
the greater the light appeared, though the weather being
hazy, we could not perceive any thing but the light
fora while :- in about half an hour's sailing, the wind
being sair for us, though not much of it, and the weather
clearing up a littie, we could plainly discern, that it was
a great ships on fire in the middle of the sea. I was
most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at all
acquainted with the persons engaged in it. I presently
recollected my former circumstances, in what condition
1 was in when taken up by the Portuguese captain; and
how much more deplorable the circumstances of the poor
creatures belonging to the ship must be, if they had no
other ship in company with them; upon this I im-
mediately ordered that five guns should be fired, one
soon after another, that, if possible, we might give notice
to them, that there was help for them at hand, and that
they might endeavour to save themselves in their boat;
-for though we could see the flame in the ship, yet they,
it being night, could see nothing of us.
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the
burning st.ip drove, waiting for day-light; when on a
sudden, to our great terror, though we had reason
to expect it, the sliip blew up in the air, and imme-
diately,
diately sunk! This was terrible, and indeed an asflicting
sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded,
must be either all destroyed, in the ship, or be in the ut-
most distress in their boats in the middle of the ocean,
which at present, by reason it was dark, I could not
see; however, to direct them as well as I could, I caused
lights to be hung out in all parts of the ship where
we could, and which we had lanthorns for, and kept
firing guns all the night long, letting them know by
this, that there was a ship not sar off.
About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered
the ship's boats, by the help of our perspective-glasses,
and found there were two of them, both thronged with
people, and deep in the water; we perceived they
rowed, the wind being against them; that they saw our
filip, and did the utmost to make us see them.
We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know
-we saw them; and hung a waft out, as a signal for them
to come on board, and then made more sail, standing
directly to them. In a little more than half an hour we
came up with them, and, in a word, took them all in,
being no less than sixty-four men, women and children j
sor there were a great many passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchant-.
ship of 300 tons, homeward bound from Quebec, in
the river of Canada. The master gave us a long ac-
count of the distress of his ship, how the fire began in the
. steerage by the negligence of the steersman; but, on his
crying out for help, was, as every body thought, entirely
put out; but they soon found that some sparks of the
first sire had gotten into some part of the ship, so disficult
to come at, that they could pot effectually quench it; and
afterwards getting in between the timbers, and within

mastered all the skill and all the application they were
able to exert.
They had no more to do then but to get into their
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty large;
being their long-boat, and a great shallop, besides a
small skisf, which was of no great service to them,
other than to get some fresh water and provisions into
her
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
her, after they had secured themselves from the fire.
They had indeed small hope of their lives by getting
into these,boats, at that distance from any land; only,
as they said well, that they were escaped from the fire,
and had a possibility that some ship might happen to
be at sea, and might! take them in. They had sails,
oars, and a compass, and were preparing to make the
best of their way to Newfoundland, the wind blowing
pretty sair, for it blew an easy gale at S. E. by E. They
had as much provisions and water, as, with sparing it
so as to be next door to starving, might support them
about 12 days, in which, if they had no bad weather,
and no contrary winds, the captain said he hoped he
might get to the banks of Newfoundland, and might
perhaps take some fish to sustain them till they might go
on shore. But there were so. many chances against
them in all these cases; such as storms to overset and
founder them, rains and cold to benumb and perish
their. limbs; contrary winds to keep them out and starve
them, that it must have been next to miraculous if they
had escaped.
In the midst of their consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the captain, with tears
in his eyes told me, they were on a sudden surprised with
the joy os hearing a gun fire, and after that four more;
these were the five gun3 which I caused to be fired at first
seeing the light; this revived their hearts, and gave
them . the notice, which, as above, I designed it should,
viz.-that there was a ship at hand for their help.
It was upon the hearing these guns, that they took
..down their masts aud sails, the found coming from
the windward, they resolved to lie by till morning.
Some time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired
three musquets, one a considerable while after another;
but these, the wind being contrary, we never heard.
Some time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and hear-
ing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to
be fired all the rest of the night; this set them to
work with their oars, to ke&p their boat's a-head, a't
least that we might the sooner come up with them;
and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found we saw
'them.'
It is impossible for me to express the several gestures,
the strange ecstacies, the variety of postures, which these
poor delivered people run into, to express the joy of their
fouls at so unexpected a deliverance; grief and sear are
easily described; sighs, tears, groans, and a very sew moti-
ons of the head and hands, making up the sum of its vari-
ety: but an excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand
extravagancies in it; there were some in'tears, some
raging and tearing themselves, as if they had been in the
greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving and down-
right lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with
their seet, others wringing their hands; some were
dancing, several tinging, some laughing, more crying,
many quite dumb, not able to speak a word, others sick
and vomiting, several swooning, and ready to saint, and
a sew were crossing themselves and giving God thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be many
that were thanksul afterwards; but the passion was too
strong for them at first, and they were not able to master
it; they were thrown into ecstacies and a kmd of frenzy,
and so there were but a very sew who were composed
and serious in their joy.
Perhaps also the case may have some addition to it,
from the particular circumstances of the nation they be-
longed to; I mean the French, whose temper is allowed
to be more volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly,
and their spirits more fluid than of other nations. 1
am not philosopher enough to determine the cause, but
nothing 1 had ever seen before came up to it: the ec-
stacies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, 'when he
found his sather in the boat, came the nearest to it-; and
the surprise of the master and his two companions, whom
I delivered from the two villains that set them on shore
in the island, came a little way towards it; but nothing
was to compare to this, either that I saw in Friday, or
any where else in my lise.
It is sarther observable, that these extravagancies did
not shew themselves in that different manner 1 have
mentioned, in different persons only; but all the va-
riety would appear in a short succession of moments,
, in
in one and the same person. A man that we saw thi»
minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and confounded,
should the next minute be dancing and hallooing like
an antick, and the next moment tearing his hair, or
pulling his cloaths to pieces, and stamping them under
his teet like a madman; a sew minutes alter that, we
should have him all in tears, then sick, then swooning;
and had not immediate help been had, would, in a sew
moments more, have been dead; and thus it was,' not
with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the greatest
part of them; and, if 1 remember right, our surgeon was
obliged to let above thirty of them blood.
There were two priests among them, one an old man,
and the other a young man ; and that which was strangest
was, that the oldest man was the worst.
As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and
saw himself sase, he dropped down stone dead, to alt
appearance; not the least sign of life could -be perceived
in him; our surgeon immediately applied proper reme-
dies to recover him, and was the only man in the ship
that believed he was not dead; and at length he opened
a vein in his arm, having first chased and rubbed the
part, so as to warm it as much as posiible; upon this the
blood, which only dropped at first, flowed something
freely; in three minutes after the man opened his eyes,
and about a quarter of an hour after that he spoke;
grew better, and, in a little time, quite well; after the
blood was stopped, he walked about, told us he was per-
sectly well, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon
gave him, and was, what we called, tome to himself.
About a quarter of an hour after this, they came run-
ning into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a
Fiench woman that had sainted, and told him, the
priest was gone stark mad. It seems he had began to
revolve the change of his circumstances in his mind,
and this put him into an ecstacy of joy; his spirits
whirled about saster than the vessels could convey them;
the blood grew hot and severish, and the man was
as fit for Bedlam, as any creature that ever was in
it: the surgeon would not bleed him again in that
condition, but gave him something to doze and put
him to sleep, which, after some time, operated upon
him
21
Mm, and he waked next morning persectly composed
and well.
The younge'r priest behaved himself with great com-
mand of his passion, and was really an example of a
serious well-governed mind; at his sirst coming on boaid
the ship, he threw himself Hat on his sace, prostrating
himself in thanksulness for his deliverance, in which!
unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him, really think-
ing he had been in a swoon; but he spake calmly,
thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks for his
deliverance, begged me to" leave him a sew moments,
and that, next-to his Maker, he would give me thanks
also.
1 was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only
left him, but kept others srom interrupting him also;
he continued in that posture about three minutes, or
a little more, after I left him; then came to me, as he
said he would, and, with a great deal of seriousness
and affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me,
that had, under God, given him, and so many miserable
creatures their lives. I told him 1 had no room to
move him to thank God for it, rather than me; for I
had seen, that he had done that already: but 1 added,
that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dic-
tated to all men, and that we had as much reason as he
to give thanks to God, who had blessed us so sar as to
make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of his
creatures.
After this, the young priest applied himself to his
country-folks, laboured to compose them, persuaded,
intreated, argued, reasoned with them, and did his utmost
to keep them within the exercise of their reason; and
•with some he had success, though others were, for a
time, out of all government of themselves.
1 cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps
it may be usesul to those into whose hands it may sall,
in the guiding themselves in all the extravagancies of
their passions; for if an excess of joy can carry men
out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason,
-what will not the extravagancies of anger, rage, and
a provoked mind, carry us to! And indeed, here I saw
reason for keeping an exceeding strict watch over our
passions of every kind, as well those of joy and satis-*
saction, as those of sorrow and anger.
We were something disordered by these extravaganices
among our new guests for the first day; but when they
had been refreshed, lodgings provided for them as well
as our ship would allow, and they had slept heartily, as
most of them did, being fatigued and frightened, they
were quite another fort of people the next day.
Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments
for the kindnel's shewn them was wanting; the French,
'tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that way.
The captain, and one of the priests, came to me the
next day, and, desiring to speak with me and my ne-
phew, the commander, began to consult with us what
should be done with them; and first they told us, that, as
we had laved their lives, so all they had was little
enough for a. return to us for the kindness received. The
captain said, they had saved some money, and some
things of value in their boats, catched hastily out of the
flames; and if we would accept it, they were ordered to
make an offer of it all to us; they only desired to be set
on shore somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they
might get a passage to France.
My nephew was for accepting their money at first
word, and to consider what to do with them afterwards;
but I over-ruled him in that part, for 1 knew what it
was to be set on shore in a strange country; and if the
Portugal captain, that took me up at sea, had served me
so, and took all 1 had for my deliverance, I must have
starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brasils, as I
had been at Barbary, the being Ibid to a Mahometan
orily excepted; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much
better master than a Turk, if not in some cases, a much
worse.
I therefore told the French captain, that we had taken
them up in their distress, it ^was true, but that it was
our duty to do so, as we were sellow-creatures, and as
we would desire to .be so delivered, if we were in the
like or any other extremity; that we had done nothing
for them, but what we believed they would have done
for us if we had been in their case, and they in ours;
but that we took them up to serve them not to plunder
them;
them; and that it would be a most barbarous thing, to
take that little from them which they had saved out of
the fire, and then set them oa shore, and leave them;
that this would be first to save them from death, and
then kill them ourselves; save them from drawing, and
then abandon them to starving; and therefore I would
not let the least thing be taken from them; as to setting
them on shore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceed-
ing great difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the
East Indies, and though we were driven out of our
course to the westward a very great way, which perhaps
was directed by heaven on purpose for their deliverance,
yet it was impossible for us wilsully to change our voyage
on this particular account; nor could my nephew, the
captain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he. was
under charter-party to pursue his voyage by the way
of Brasil; and all I knew he could do for them was,
to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships
homeward-bound from the West Indies, and get them
passage, if possible, to Engjand or France.
The first part of the proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thanksul for it; but
they were in a great consternation, especially the pas-
sengers, at the notion of being carried away to the East
Indies ; they then entreated me, that, seeing I was driven
so sar to the westward before I met with them, I would
at least keep on the same course to the banks of New-
foundland, where it was possible I might meet with some
ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to
Canada, from whence they came.
I thought this was but a reasonable request on their
part; and therefore 1 inclined to agree to it; for indeed
I considered, that to carry this whole company to the
East Indies, would not only be an intolerable severity to
the poor people, but would be ruining our whole voy-
age by devouring all our provisions; so 1 thought it no
breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen acci-
dent made absolutely necessary to us, and in which no
one could fay we were to blame; for the laws of God
and Nature would have forbid, that we should resuse
to take up two boats sull of people in such a distressed
condition; and the nature of the thing as well re-
- - ipecting
specting ourselves, as the poor people, obliged us to see
them on shore somewhere or other, for their deliver-
ance ; so I consented that we would carry them to New-
foundland, if wind and weather vould permit ; and, if
not, that I would carry them to Martinico in the West
Indies.
The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather
pretty good, and as it had blowed continually in the
points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, we missed
several opportunities of sending them to France; for
we met several ships bound to EuroPe> whereof two
were French, from St. Christopher's; but they had been
so long beating up against the wind, that they durst take
in no passengers' for sear of wanting provisions for the
voyage, as well for themselves as for thole they should
take in; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a
week after this, that we made the Banks of Newfound-
land, where, to shorten my story, we put all our French
people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there
to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to
France, if they could get provision to victual themselves
with; when, 1 say, all the -F rench went on shore, I
mould remember, that the young priest I spoke of,
hearing we were bound to the East Indies, desired to
go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the
coast os Coromandel; I readily agreed to that, for I
wondersully liked the man, and had very good reason,
as will appear afterwards; also four of the seamen
entered themselves in our ship, and proved very usesul
sello-ws.
From hence we directed our course for the West
Indies, steering away S. and S. by E. for about 20 days
together, sometimes little or no wind at all, when we
met with another subject for our humanity to work
upon, almost as deplorable as that before.
1t was in the latitude os 27 degrees 5 minutes N.
and the 19th day of March, 16.94-5, when we espied
a sail, our course S. E. and by S. We soon perceived
it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us; but
. could not at first know what to make of her, till, after
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her main-
top-mast, fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently she
-
fires
fires a gun as a signal of distress; the weather was pretty
good, wind at N. N. W. a fresh gale, and we sooii came
to spe&L with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home From
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road at Bar-
badoes, a sew days before she was ready to sail', by a
terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate
were both gone on shore; so that besides the terror of the
storm, they were but in an indifserent case for good
artists to bring the ship hom'e: they had been already
nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible
storm after the hurricane was over, which had blown
them quite out of their knowledge, to the westward,
and in which they lost their masts, as above; they told
us, they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, but
wer-e then driven away again to the south-east, by a
strong gale of wind at N. N. W. the lame that blew
now, and having no sails to work the ship with, but a
main-course, and a kind of square-sail upon a jury fore-
mast, which they had set up, they could not lie near the
wind, but were endeavouring to stand away for the
Canaries.
But that which was worst of all, was, that they were
almost starved for want of provisions, besides the satigues
they had undergone: their bread and flesh was quite
gone, they had not an ounce left in the ship, and had had
none for eleven days: the only relief they had was,'
their water was not all spent, and they had about half a
barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough; some
succades or sweetmeats they had at sirst, but they were
devoured, and they had seven casks of rum.
There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-ser-
vant, on board, who were going passengers, and think-
ing the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came on board
the evening before the hurricane began: and having no
provilions of their own left, they were in a more de-
plorable condition than the rest; for the seamen, being
reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves, had no
compassion, we may be sure, for the poor pafienajers;
and they were indeed in a condition that their misery is
very hard to describe.'
vol. ii. b I bail
. X J'ad, perhaps,- not known this part, if my curiosity
riad, tiot led me, the weather being sair, and the wind
abatecl, to go on board the ship: the second mate, who,
vpctn this occcasion commanded the ship, had been on
loard. our ship: and he told me indeed, that they had
three passengers in the great cabin, that they were in a
deplorable condition; nay, says he, I believe they are
dead, for 1 have heard nothing of them for above two
days; and I was afraid to er.quire after them, said he,
for 1 had nothing to relieve them with.
We immediately applied ourselves to give them what
relief we could spare; and indeed I had so sar over-ruled
things with my nephew, that I would have victualled
them, though we had gone away to Virginia, or any
part of the coast of America, to have supplied ourselves;
but there was no necessity for that.
But now they were in a new danger; for they were
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave them;
the mate or commander brought six men with him in his
boat; but these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and
were so weak, they could hardly lit to their oars: the
mate himself was very ill, and half starved; for he de-
clared he had reserved nothing from the men, and went
share and share alike with them in every bit they eat.
. I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before -
him immediately, and he had not eaten three mouthsuls
before he began to be tick, and out of order: fohe stopped
awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something with
some broth, which he said would be to him both food
and physic; and after he had taken it, he grew better:
311 the mean time, I forgot not the men; I ordered
-victuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather
devoured than eat it; they were so exceeding hungry,
that they were in a manner ravenous, and had no com-
mand of themselves; and two of them eat with so much
greediness, that they were in danger of their lives the
next morning.
The sight of these people's distress was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible pros-
pect of at my first coming on shore in my island, where
I had not the least mouthsul of food, or any hopes of
procuring it; besides the hourly apprehension 1 had
of being made the food of other creatures.) But all the
while the mate was thus relating to me the miserable
condition of the ship s company, I could not put out
of my thought the story he had told me of the three
poor creatures in the great cabin (viz.) the mother, her
son, and the maid servant, whom he had heard nothing
offor two or three days; and whom he seemed to con-
sess they had wholly neglected, their own extremities
being so great; by which I understood, that they had
really given them no food at all; and that therefore they
must be perished, and be all lying dead perhaps on the
floor or desk of the cabin.
As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called
captain, on board with his men to refresh themN so 1 also
sorgot not the starving crew that were left on board, but
ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and with
my mate and twelve men to carry them a sack of bread,
and four or five pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged
the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they stayed,
and to keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men's
taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it
was well boiled, and then to give every man but a little
at a time; and by this caution he preserved the men, who
would otherwise have killed themselves with that very
food that was given them on purpose to save their lives.
At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the
great cabin, and see what condition the poor passen-
gers were in, and if they were alive i to comfort them, and
give them what refreshment was proper; and the surgeon
gave him a large pitcher with some of the prepared broth
which he had given the mate that was ori' board, and
which he did not question would restore them gradually.
I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above,
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, which I
knew the ship itself would present me with, in a more
lively manner than I could have it by report, I took the
captain of the ship, as we now called him, with me, and
went myself a little after in their boat.
I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult
o get the victuals out of the boiler before it was ready j
but my mate observed his order, and kept a good
guard at the cook-room door; and the man he
B 2 placed
placed there, aster ufing all possible persuasion to have
patience, kept them oif'by force: however, he-caused
some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, arrd softened
them with the liquor of the meat, which they call
brewis, and gave them every one one, to stay their stom-
achs, and told them it was for their own sasety that
he was obliged to give them but little at a time. But
it was all in vain, and had I not come on board, and
their own commander and officers with me, and with
good words, and some threats also of giving them no
more, 1 believe they would have broke into the cook-
room by force, and tore the meat out of the surnace;
for words indeed are of a very small force to an hungry
belly: however we pacified them, and sed them gradu-
ally and cautiously for the first time, and the next time
gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and the
men did well enough.
But the misery of the poop passengers fn the cabin was
of another nature, and sar beyond the rest; for as, first,
the ship's company had so little for themselves, it was
but too true, that they had at first kept them very low,
and at last totally neglected them; so that for six or
seven days, it might be said, they had really had no
food'at all, and for several days before very little.
The poor mother, who, as the first mate reported, was
a woman of good sense, and good breeding, had spared
all she could get so afsectionately for her son, that at last
she entirely sunk under it; and when the mate of our
ship went in, she sat upon the floor or deck, with her
back up against the iides, between two chairs, which
were lathed sast, and her head sunk in between her moul-
ders, like a corpse, though not quite so dead. My mate
said all he could to revive and encourage her, and with
a spoon put some broth into her mouth; she opened her
lips, and lifted up one hand, but cculd not speak; yet
she understood what he said, and made signs to him, in-
timating, that it was too late for her; but pointing to
her child, as if she would have said, they mould take
care of him.
However the mate, who was exceedingly moved with
the light, endeavoured to get some of the broth into her
nsouth ; and, as he said, got two or three spoonsuls down,
though
>
though I question whether he could be sure of it or not:
but it was too late, and shc died the samenight.
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most
affectionate mother's lise, was not so sar gone; yet he lay
in a cabin-bed as one stretched out, with hardly any lise
left in him; he had a piece of an old glove in his mouth,
having eaten up the rest of it; however being young,
and having more strength than his mother, the mate got
something down his throat, and he began sensibly to re-
vive, though by giving him some time after but two or
three spoonsuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and
brought it up again.
But the next care was the poor maid; she lay all along
upon the deck hard by'her mistress, and just like one that
had sallen down with an apoplexy, and struggled sor
lise; -her limbs were destorted, one of her hands was
clasped round the frame of one chair, and the griped it
so hard, that we could not easily make her let it go; her
other arm lay over her head, and her seet lay both to-
gether, set sast against the' frame of the cabin-table; in
short, she lay just like one in the last agonies of death;
and yet she was alive too.
. The poor creature was not only starved with hunger,
and terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men
told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress,
whom she saw dying two or three days before, and
whom she loved most tenderly.
|. We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when
our surgeon, who was a man of very great knowledge
and. experience, and with great application recovered her
as to lise, he had her upon his hands as to her senses, for
she was little less than distracted for a considerable time
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 29.
Whoever shall read these memorandums, must.be de-
sired to consider, that visits at sea are not like a jour-
ney into the country, where sometimes people stay a
week or a fortnight at a place. Our business was to
relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by sot
them; and though they were willing to steer the same
course with us for some days, yet we could carry nq
sail to keep pace with a ship that had no masts; how-
ever, as their captain begged of us to help him Jo ses up
8 '3 a main-
a main-top-mast, and a kind of top-mast to his jury-
forc-mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three_or
sour days, and then having given him five barrels of beef
and pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of
peas, flour, and what other things we could spare; arid
taking three casks of sugar and some rum, and some
pieces of eight of them for satissaction, we left them,
taking on board with. us, at their own earnest request,
the youth, and the maid, and all their goods.
T he young lad was about seventeen years of age, a
pretty, well bred, modest, and sensible youth; greatly
dejected with the loss of his mother, and as it seems,
lad lost his sather but a sew months before at Bar-
badoes. He begged of the surgeon to speak to me, to
take him out of the ship; for he said, the cruel sellows
had murdered his mother; and indeed so they had, that
is to say, passively; for they might have spared a small
sustenance to the poor helpless widow, that might have
preserved her lise, though it had been just to keep her
alive. But hunger knows no friend, no relation, no jus-
tice, no right; and therefore is remorseless, and capable
of no compassion. *
The surgeon told him how sar we were going, and how
k would carry him away from all his friends, and put
him perhaps in as bad circumstances almost as we
found them in; that is to say, starving in the world.
He said it mattered not whither he went, if he was but
delivered from the terrible crew that he was among:
that the captain (by which he meant me, for he could
know nothing of my nephew) had saved his lise, and
he was sure would not hurt him; and as for the maid, he
was sure, if (he came to herself, she would be very thank-
sul for it, let us carry them whither we would. The sur-
geon represented the case so affectionately to me, that I
yielded, and we took them both on board with all their
goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could
not be removed, or come at; and as the youth had a
bill of lading for them, I made his commander sign a
writing, obliging him to go, as soon as he came to Bris-
tol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the
jouth said he was related, and to deliver a letter which
I wrote to him, and all the goods he had belonging to the ~ deceased
deceased widow; which I suppose was not done; for I
could i never learn that the ship .came to Briitol; but
was, as is most probable, lost at sea, being in so disabled
a condition, and so sar from an)' land, that I am of opi-
nion, the first storm she met with afterwards, she might
founder in the sea; for she was leaky, and had damage
in her hold, when I met with her.
I was now in the latitude of 1;) deg. 32 min. and had
hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at
first the winds had been contrary. I shall trouble no-
body with the little incidents of winds, weather, cur-
rents, &c. on the rest of our voyage; but shortening
my story for the sake of what is to follow, shall observe
that'* came to my old habitation, the island, on the 10th
of April, 1695. it was with no small difficulty that I
found the place: for as 1 came to it, and went from it
before, on the south and east side of the island, as com-
ing from the Brazils, so now coming in between the main:
and the island, and 'having n.rs chart for the coast, nor
any land mark, 1 did not know it when ITaw it, or
know whether I saw it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore ori
several islands in the mouth of the great river Oroorioque
but none for my purpose; only this I learned by my
coasting the shore, that I was under one great mistake'
before, viz. that the continent which I thought I sew.
from the island 1 lived in, was really no continent, but
a long island, or rather a ridge of islands, reaching from
one to the other side of the extended mouth of that
great river; and that the savages who came to my island,
were not properly those which we call Caribees, but
islanders, and other Barbarians of the same kind, who
inhabited something nearer to our side than the rest.
In short, I visited several of the islands to no purpose;
some I found were inhabited, and some were not. On
one of them I found some Spaniards, and thoughts they
had lived there; but, speaking with them, found they
had a .sloop lay in a small creek hard by, and that the,y
came thither to make salt, and catch some pearl-muscfes
if they could; but they belonged to the isle de Trini-
dad, which lay surther north, in the latitude of 10 and
11 degrees.
B 4 Thus
Thus coasting from one island to an other, sometimes
with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop,
which we had found a convenient boat, and therefore
kept her with their very good will, at length I came sair
on the fouth-lide of my island, and I preiently knew the
very countenance of the place; so I brought the ship
sase to an anchor, broadside with the little creek where
was my old habitation.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday and
asked him, if he knew where he was? He looked about a
little, and presently clapping his hands, cried; O yes, O
there, O yes, O there, pointing to our old habitation, and
sell a dancing and capering like a mad sellow, and I had
much ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, to
swim ashore to the place.
Well, Friday, said I, do you think we shall find any
body here or no? And what do you think, shall we see
your sather? The, sellow stood mute as a stock a good
while; but when I named his sather, the poor assectionate
creature looked dejected; and I could se'e the tears run
down his sace very plentisully. What is the matter Fri-
day, said I? Are you troubled because you may see your
father? No, no, says he, shaking his head, no see him
more, no ever more see again. Why so, said I Friday?
How do you know that? O no, O no, says Friday, he
long ago die! long ago he much old man! Well, well
said I, Friday, you don't know : but shall we see any one
else then: the sellow, it seems, had better eyes than I,
and he points just to the hill above my old house; and
though we lay half a league off', he cries out, Me see! me
see! yes, yes, me see much man there, and there, and
there! I looked, but I could see nobody, no, not with a'
perspective glass; which was, 1 suppose, because I could
not hit the place; for the sellow was right, as 1 found
upon enquiry the next day, and there were five or six
men altogether stood to look at the ship, not knowing
what to think of us.
• As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I caused
the English ancient to be spread, and fired three guns,
to give them notice we were friends; and about half
a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a smoke rise
from the side of the creek; so 1 immediately ordered
a boat
a boat out, taking Friday with me; and, hanging out a
white flag, or a flag of truce, I went directly on shore;
taking with me the young friar I mentioned, to whom I
had told the whole story of my living there, and the
manner of it, and every particular, both of my myself
and those that I left there, and who was on that account
extremely desirous to go with me. We had besides about
sixteen men very well armed, if we had found any new
guest there which we did not know of; but we had no
need of weapons.
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high
water, we rowed directly into the creek; and the first
man 1 sixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard whose lise I
had saved, and whom I knew by his sace persectly well;
as to his habit, I shall describe it afterwards. I ordered
nobody to go on shore at first but myself, but there was
no keeping Friday in the boat, for the assectionate crea-
ture had spied his sather at a distance, a good way off'of
the Spaniards, where indeed i saw nothing of him; and
if they had not let him go on shore, he would have
jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but
he flew away to his sather, like an arrow out of a bow.
It would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the
firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of this
poor sellow's joy, when he came to his sather; how he
embraced him, kissed him, stroked his sace, took him
up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down
by him; then stood and looked at him, as any one
would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour
together; then lay down upon the' ground, and stroked
his legs, and kissed them, and then got up again', and
stared at him; one would have thought the sellow
bewitched; but it would have made a dog laugh to see
how the next day his passion ran out another way : in the
morning he walked along the shore, to and again, with
his sather several hours, always leading him by the hand,
as if he had been a lady; and every now and then would
come to setch something or other for him to the boat,
either a lump of sugar, or a dram, a biscuit, or some-
thing or other that was good. In the afternoon his fro-
lics run another way, for then he would set the old
man down upou the ground, and dance about him, and
B 5 - made
made a thousand antic postures and gestures; and all the
while he did this, he would be'talking to him, and
telling him one story or another of his travels, and of
what had happened to him abroad, to divert him. In
short, if thesamefilial affection was to be found in chris-
tians t<\ their parents, hi our parts of the world, one
would be tempted to say, there hardly'would have been
any need of the fifth commandment.
But this is a digression: I return to my landing. It
would be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and
civilities that the Spaniards received me with. The first
Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew very well, was he
whose lise I saved; he came towards the boat, attended
by one more, carrying a flag of truce also; and he did
not only not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, no
notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to him:
Seignior, said I, in Portuguese, do you not know me? At
which he spoke not a word; but giving his musket to
the man that was with him, threw his arms abroad, and
saying something in Spanish tFirit I did not persectly hear,
came forward, and embraced tire, telling me he was inex-
cusable, not to know that sace again that he had once
seen, as of an angel from heaven, sent to save his lise. He
said abundance of very handsome things, as a well-bred
Spaniard always knows how; and then beckoning to
the person that attended him, bade him go and call out
his comrades. He then asked me, if I would walk to
my old habitation, where he would give me possession of
my own house again, and where 1 should see there had
been but mean improvements; so I walked along with
him; but alas! 1 could no more find the place again,
than if I had never been there; for they had planted so
many trees, and placed them in such a posture, so thick
and close to one another, in ten years time they were
grown so big, that, in short, the place was inaccessible,
except by such windings and blind ways, as they them-
selves only who made them could rind.
I aflted them, what put them upon all these fortifica-
tions? He told'me, 1 would say there was need' enough
of it, when they had given an account'how they had
passed their time since their arriving in the island, espe-
cially after they had the misfortune to find, that I was
/ gone;
gone: he told me he could not have but some satissac-
tion in my good sortune, when he heard that I was gone
in a good ship, and to my satissaction; and that he had
oftentimes a strong persuaiion, that one time or other he
should see me again: but nothing that ever besel him
in his lise, he said, was so surprising and asflicting to him
at first, as the disappointment he was under when he
came back to the island, and found I was not there.
As to the three Barbarians (so he called them) that
•were test behind, and of whom he'said he had a long
story to tell me; the Spaniards all thought themselves
much better among the savages, only that their number
was so small. And, says he, had they been strong
enough, we had been all long ago in piirgatory; and
with that he crossed himself upon the breast. But, Sir,
says he, 1 hope you will not be displeased, when I shall
tell you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for dur
dwn preservation, to disarm them, and making them our
subjects, who would not be content wish being moderately
our masters, but would be our murderers. I answered, I
was heartily afraid of it when I left them there; and no-
thing troubled me at my parting from the island, but that
they were not come back, that I might have put them in
possession of every thing first, and left the other in a state
of subjection, as they deserved: but if they had reduced
them'to it, I was very glad, and should be very sar from
finding any sault with it; for 1 knew they were a parcel
of refractory ungovernable villains, and were fit for any
manner of mischief.
While I was saying this, came the man whom he had
sent back, and with him eleven men more: in the
dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what na-
tion they were off, but he made all clear both to them
and to me. First he turned to me, and pointing to them,
said, These, Sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe
their. lives to you; and then turning to them, and point-
ing to me, he let them know who I was; upon which
they all came up one by one, not as'if they had been
sailors, and ordinary sellows, and I the like, but really,
as if they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I'
a monarch, or a great conqueror: their behaviour was
to the last degree obliging and courteous, and yet'
s 6 mixed
mixed with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well
became them; and, in short, they had' so much more
manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their
civilities, much less how to return them in kind.
The history of their coming to, and conduct in the
island, after my going away, is so remarkable, and has
so manyincidents, which the former part of my relation
-will help to understand, and which will, in most of the
particulars, reser to that account I have already given,
that I cannot but commit them, with great delight, to the
reading of those that come after me.
I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in
the sirst person, which will put me to the expence of
ten thousand said I's, and said he's, and he told me's,
and I told him's, and the like; but I shall collect the
sacts his rically, as near as I can gather them out of my
memory from what they related to me, and from what I
met with in my conversing with them, and with the
place. '•
In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I
can, I must go back to the circumstance in which I left
the island, and which the persons were in, of whom I
am to speak. At first it is necessary to repeat, that I had
sent away Friday's sather and the Spaniard, the two
whose lives I had rescued from' the savages; I say, I
had sent them away in a large canoe to the main, as I
then thought it, to setch over the Spaniard's companions,
whom he had left behind him, in order to save them.
from the like calamity that he had been in : and in order
to succour them for the present, and that, if possible
we might together find some way for our deliverance
afterward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance
of, or the least room to hope for, my own deliverance,
any more than I had twenty years before; much less had
I any foreknowledge of what after happened, I mean of
an English ship coming on shore there to setch them off,
and it could not but be a very great surprise to them,
-when they came back, not only to find that 1 was gone,
but to find three strangers left on the spot, possessed of
all that I had left behind me, which would otherwise
have been their own.
The first thing, however, which I enquired into,
that I might begin where I left' off, was of their own
part: and I desired he would give me a particular ac-
count of his voyage back to his countrymen with the
boat, when I sent him to setch them over. He told
me there was little variety in that part; for nothing re-
markable happened to them on the way, they having
'very calm weather, and a smooth sea; for his coun-
trymen, it could not be doubted, he said, but that they
were overjoyed to see him: (it seems he was the prin-
cipal man among them, the captain of the vessel they
had been shipwrecked in, having been dead some time).
They were, he said, the more surprised to see him, be-
cause they knew that he was sallen into the hands of
savages, who, they were_ satisfied, would devour him,
as they did all the rest of their prisoners; that w en he
told them the story of the deliverance, and in what
manner he was surnished for carrying them away, it
was like a dream to them: and their astonishment, they
said, was something like that of Joseph's brethren,
when he told them who he was, and told them the
story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court: but when
he fliewed them their arms, the powder, the ball, and
the provisions that he brought them for their journey
or voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a
just share of the joy of their deliverance, and immediately-
prepared to come away with him.
Their first business was to get canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the honest
part of it, but to trespass upon their f/iendly savages,
and to borrow two large canoes or periagua's on pre-
tence of going out a fishing, or for pleasure.
In these they came away the next morning; it seems
they wanted no time to get themselves ready, for they
had no baggage, neither cloths, or provisions, or any
thing in the world, but what they had on them, and a
sew roots to eat, of which they used to make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent, and in that
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and
to get off from the island; leaving three of the most
impudent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable villains
behind
behind me, that any man could desire to meet with, to
the poor Spaniard s great grief and disappointment,
you may be sure.
The only just thing the rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came on shore, they gave my letter to
them, and gave them provisions, and other relief, as I
had ordered them to do; also they gave them the long
paper of directions, which I had left with them, con-
taining the particular methods which I took for managing
every part of my lise there; the way how I baked my
bread, bred up my tame goats, and planted my corn;
how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word,
every thing I did; all this being written down, they
gave to the Spaniards, two of whom understood English
well enough; nor did they resuse to accommodate the
Spaniards with any thing else, for they agreed very well
for some time, they gave them an equal admission into
the house, or cave, and they began to live very sociably;
and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my
method, and Friday's sather together, managed all their
affairs; for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing
but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, and catch
tortoises, and when they came home at night, the Spa-
niards provided their suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this,
would the others but have let them alone; which, how-
ever, they could not find in their hearts to do long:
but, like the dog in the manger, they would not eat
themselves, and would not let others eat neither: the
differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and
such as are not worth relating: but at last it broke out
into open war, and it began with all the rudeness and
insolence that can be imagined, without reason, without
provocation, contrary to nature, and indeed, to com-
mon sense; and though it is true, the firtt relation of it
came from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call
the rccusers, yet, when 1 came to examine the sellows,
they could not deny a word of it.
But before I come to the particulars of this part, I
must supply a desect in my former relation; and this
was, that T forgot to set down among the restj that,
just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, there
hap-
happened a little quarrel on board our ship, which I was
afraid once would tarn to a second mutiny'; nor was it
appeased, till the captain, rousing up his courage, and
taking us all to his assistance, parted them by force,
and making two of the most refractory sellows prison-
ers, he laid them in irons; and as they had been active
in the former disorders, and let sall some ugly danger-
ous words the second time, he threatened to carry them
in irons to England, and have them hanged there for
mutiny, and running away with the ship.
This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to
do it, frighted some other men in the ship; and some
of them had put it in the heads of the rest, that the cap-
tain only gave them good words for the present, till they
should come to some English port; and that then they
should be all put into a gaol, Snd tried for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us
with it; upon which it was desired, that I, who still
passed for a great man among them, should go down
with the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell them, that
they might be assured, if they behaved well the rest of
the voyage, all they had done for the time past, should
be pardoned. So I went, and after passing my honour's
word to them,' they appeared easy, and the more so,
when I caused the two men, who were in irons, to be
released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that
night, the wind also salling calm: next morning we
found, that our two men who had been laid in irons
had stole each of them a musket, and some other wea-
pons, (what powder or shot they had, we knew not)
and had taken the ship's pinnace, which was not yet
hauled upj and run away with her to their companions
in roguery on shore.
As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on
shore, with twelve' men and the mate, and away they
went to seek the rogues; but they could neither find
them nor any of the rest; for they all fled into the woods,
when they saw the boat coming on shore. The mate
was once resolved, in justice to their roguery, to have
destroyed their plantations, burnt all their houihold-stuff
and furniture, and left theni to shift without it; but
4 having
having no order he let all alone, left every thing as
they found it, and, bringing the pinnace away, came
on board without them.
These two men made their number five; but the
other three villains were so much wickeder than these,
that after they had been two or three days together,
they turned their two new-comers out of doors to shift
for themselves, and would have nothing to do with
them; nor could they for a good while be persuaded
to give them any food; as for the Spaniards, they were
not yet come.
When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business
began to go forward; the Spaniards would have per-
suaded the three Encdish biutes to have taken in their
two countrymen again, that, as they said, they might
be all one samily; but they would not hear of it: so
the two poor sellows lived by themselves, and finding
nothing but industry and application would make them.
live comfortable, they pitched their tents on the north
shore of the island, but a little more to the west, to be
out of the danger of the skvages, who always landed
on the east parts of the island.
Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and the
other to lay up their magazines and stores in; and the
Spaniards having given them some corn for seed, and
especially some of the peas which 1 had left them, they
dug and planted, and inclosed, aster the pattern I had
set for them all, and began to live pretty well; their first:
crop of corn was On the ground, and though it was
but a little bit of land which they had dug up at first,
having had but a little time, yet it was enough to re-
lieve them, and find them with bread and other eatables;
and one of the sellows, being the cook's mate of the
ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings, and
such other preparations as the rice, and the milk, and
such little flesh as they got, surnished him to do.
They were going on in a little thriving posture, when
the three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too,
in mere humour, and to insult them, came and bullied
them, and told them the island was theirs; that the go-
vernor, meaning me, had given them possession of it,
and nobody else had any right to it; and damn them
they should build no houses upon their ground, unless
they would pay them rent for them.
The two men thought they had jested at first; and
asked them to come and sit down, and see what sine
houses they were that they had built, and tell them what
rent they demanded: and one of them merrily told them,
if they were ground-landlords, he hoped, if they built
tenements i^pon the land, and made improvements, they
would, according to the custom of all landlords, grant
them a long lease, and bid them go setch a scrivener to
draw the writings. One of the three, damning and raging,
told them, they should see they were not in a jest; and
foing to a little place at a distance, where the honest men
ad made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a fire-
brand, and clasps it to the outside of their hut, and very
sairly set it on fire; and it would have been all burnt
down in a sew minutes, if one of the two had not run to
the sellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with.
his seet, and that not without some difficulty too.
The sellow was in such a rage at the honest man's
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with a pole
he had in his hand; and had not the man avoided thp
blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended
his days at once. His comrade, seeing the danger they
were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they
came both out with their musquets; and the man that
was first struck at with the pole, knocked the sellow
down, who began the quarrel, with the stock of their
musquet, and that before the other two could come to
help hjm; and then seeing the rest come at them, they
stood together, and presenting the other ends of their
pieces to them, bade them stand oss.?
The other bad fire-arms with them too; but one of
the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made
desperate by his danger, told them, if they ossered to
move hand or foot, they were all dead men; and boldly
commanded them to lay down their arms. They did
not indeed lay down their arms; but, seeing him re-
solute, it brought them to a parley, and they consented
to take their wounded man with them, and be gone;
and indeed, it seems the sellow was wounded sufficiently,
with the blow; however, they .were much in the
wrong,
wrong, since they had the advantage, that they did not
disarm them essectually, as they might have done, and
have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given them
an account how the rogues had treated them; for the
three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every
day gave them some intimation that they did so.
But not to croud this part with an account of the les-
ser part of their rogueries, such as treading down their
corn, shooting three young kids, and a she-goat, which.
the poor men had got to breed up tame for their store;
and, in a word, plaguing them night and day in this
manner, it forced the two men to such a desperation,
that they resolved to sight them all three the first time
they had a sair opportunity. In order to this they re-
solved to go to the castle, as they called it, that was my
old dwelling, where the three rogues and the Spaniards
all lived together at that time, intending to have a sair
Battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see sair
play. So they got up in the morning before day, and
came to the place, and called the Englishmen by their
names, telling a Spaniard that answered, that they
wanted to speak with them.
'It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards,
having' been in the woods, had seen one of the two
Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I call the honest men,
and he had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards, of
the barbarous usage they had met with from their three
countrymen, and how they had ruined their plantation,
dnd destroyed their corn, that they had laboured so hard
t6 bring forwards and killed the milch-goat, and their
three kids, which was all they had provided for their
sustenance; and' that if he and his friends, meaning
the Spaniards, did not assist. them again, they should be
starved. When the Spaniards came home at night, and
they were all at supper, he took the freedom to reprove
the three Englishmen, though in gentle and mannerly
terms, and asked them, how they could be so cruel, they
being harmless inoffensive sellows, and that they were
putting themselves in a way to subsist by their labour,
and that it had cost them a great'deal of pains to bring
things to such persection as they had.
Our
'One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What
had they to do there? That they came on shore without
leave, and that they should not plant or' build upon the
island; it was none of their ground. Why, says the
Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior Inglese, they mult not
starve. The Englishman replied, like a true rough-hewn.
tarpaulin, they might.starve and be damn'd, they should
not plant nor build in that place. But what must they
do then, Seignior, says the Spaniard? Another of the-
brutes returned, do! d—n them, they should be servants,
and work for them! But how can you expect. that of
them? They are not bought with your money; you
have no right to make them servants. The Englishmen
answered, the island was theirs, the Governor had given
it to them, and no man had any thing to do there but
themselves; and with that swore by his Maker, that he
would go and burn all their new huts; they should
build none upon their land.
Why, Seignor,. says the Spaniard, by the same rule,
we must be your servants too. Ay, says the bold dog,
and so you shall too, before we have done with you,'
mixing two or three G^—d d—mme's in the proper in-
tervals of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at
that, and made him no answer. However this little dis-
course had heated them; and starting up, one says to the
other, I think it was he they called Will Atkins, come
Jack, let us go and have the other brush with thein (
we will demolish their castle, I will warrant you; they
shall plant no colony in our dominions.
Upon this they were all trooping away, with every
rnanagun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some
insolent things among themselves of what they would
do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity offered; but
the Spaniards, it seems, did not so persectly understand
them as to know all the particulars; only, that, in ge-
neral, they threatened them hard for taking the two
Englishmen's part.
Whither they went, or hojv they bestowed their time
that evening, the Spaniards said, they did not know;
but it seemed they wandered about the country, part of
the night; and then lying down in the place which I
used tb call rhy bower, they were weary, arid overslept
them-
themselves. The case was this: they had resolved to
flay till midnight, and so take the poor men when they
were asleep; and they acknowledged it afterwards, in-
tending to set sire to the huts while they were in them
and either burn them in them, or murder them as they
came out; and as malice seldom sleeps very sound, it
was very strange they would not have been kept waking.
However, as the two men had also a design upon
them, as I have said, though a much sairer one than that
of burning and murdering, it happened, and very luckily
for them all, that they were up and gone abroad, before
the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts.
W hen they came thither and found the men gone,
Atkins, who it seems was the foi wardest man, called out
to his comrades, ha, Jack, here's the nest! but d—n
them, the birds are flown! They mused awhile to think
what should be the occasion of their being gone abroad
so soon, and suggested presently, that the Spaniards had
given them notice of it; and with that they shook
hands, and swore to one another that they would be
revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made
this bloody bargain, they sell to work with the poor
men's habitation; they did not set fire indeed to any
thing, but they pulled down both their houses, and pul-
led them so limb from limb, that they left not the least
stick standing, or scarce any sign oh the ground where
they stood; they tore all their little collected household-
stuff in pieces, and threw every thing about in such a
manner, that the poor men found, afterwards, some of
their things a mile off from their habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the young
trees which the poor men had planted; pulled up the
inclosure they had made to secure their cattle and their
corn; and, in a word, sacked and plundered every thing
as completely as a herd of Tartars would have done.
The two men were at this juncture gone to find them
out, and had resolved to sight them wherever they had been,
though they were but two to three: so that, had they
met, there certainly would have been bloodshed among
them; for they were all very stout, resolute sellows to
give them their due. .
But providence took more care to keep them asunder
v < than
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45
than they themselves could do to meet; for as they
had dodged one another, when the three were gone
thither, the two were here; and afterwards, when the
two went back to sind them, the three were come to the
oki habitation again: we shall see their difserent con-
duct presently. When the three came back, like surious
creatures, flushed with the rage which the work they
had been about put them into, they came up to the
Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by~way
of scoff and bravado; and one of them stepping up to
one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple. of
hoys at play, takes hold of his hat, as it was upon his
head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his sace,
says he to him—And you Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall
have the same sauce, if you do not mend your manners.
The Spaniard, who, though quite a civil man, was as
brave as a man could desire to be, and withal a strong
well-made man, looked steadily at him for a good
while; and then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped
gravely up to him, and with one blow of his fist, knock-
ed him down, as an ox is selled with a pole-ax, at which
one of the rogues, insolent as the first, fired his pistol at
the Spaniard immediately; he miffed his body indeed,
for the bullets went through his hair, but one of them
touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much.
The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt
than he really was, and that put him into some heat,
for before he acted all in a persect' calm; but now re-
solving to go through with his work, he stooped and
'took the sellow's ruutquet whom he had knocked down,
and was just going to shoot the man who had sired at
him, when the rest of the'Spaniards, being in the cave,
came out, and calling him not to shoot, they stepped in,
secured the other two, and took their arms from them.
When they were thus disarmed, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their
own countrymen, they began to cool; and giving the
Spaniards better words, would have had their arms.
again; but the Spauiards considering the seud that was
between them and the other two Englishmen, and that
it would be the best method they could ta*e to keep
them from one another, told them they would do them
no
no harm; and if they would live peaceably they would
be very willing to assist and associate with them, as they
did before; but that they could not think of giving them
their arms again, while they appeared so resolved to do
mischief with them to their own countrymen, and had
even threatened them all to make them their servants.
The rogues were now more capable to hear reason
than to act reason; but being resused their arms, they
went raving away, and raging like madmen, threaten-
ing what they would do, though they had no fire-arms.:
but the spaniards, despising their threatening, told them
they should take care how they offered any injury to their
plantation or cattle; for if they did, they would shoot
them, as they would do ravenous beasts, wherever
they found them; and if they sell into their hands
alive, they would certainly be hanged. However this
•was sar from cooling them; but away they went, swear-
ing and raging like suries of hell. As soon as they
-were gone, came back the two men in passion and rage
enough also, though of another kind; for having been
at their plantation, and finding it all demolished and de-
stroyed, as above, it will eafily be supposed they had
provocation enough: they could scarce have room to
tell the tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them
theirs; and it was strange enough to find, that three
men mould thus bully nineteen, and receive no punish-
ment at all.
The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially
having thus disarmed them, made light of their threat-
enings; but the two Englishmen resolved to have their
remedy against them, what pains soever it cost to find
them out.
But the Spanirds interposed here too, and told them,
that they were already disarmed; they could not consent
that they (the two) should pursue them with fire-arms,
.and perhaps kill them; but, said the grave Spaniard,
who was their Governor, we will endeavour to make
them do you justice, if you will leave it to us; for, as
there is no doubt but they will come to us again when
their passion is over, being not able to subsist without
our assistance, we promise you to make no peace with.
them, without having a sull. satissaction for you; and
upon
upon this condition we hope you will promise to use no
yiolencewith them, other than in your desence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very aukwardly,.
and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards protested
they did it only to keep them from bloodshed, and to
make all easy at last; for, said they, we are not so many
of us, here is room enough for us all, and it is a great pity
we should not be all good friends. At length they did
consent, and waited for the issue of the thing, living for
some days with the Spaniards, for their own habitation
was destroyed.
In about five days after the^ three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger, having
chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came back
to the grove; and finding mv Spaniard, who, as t have
said, was the governor, and two more with him,
walking by the side of the creek, they came up in a very
submissive humble manner, and begged to be received
again into the samily. The Spaniards used them
civilly, but told them, they had acted so unnaturally by
their countrymen, and so very grossly by them (the
Spaniards), that they could not come to any conclu-
sion without consulting the two Englishmen, and the
rest; but, however, they would go to them, and dis-
course about it, and they should know in half an hour.
It may be guessed, that they were very hard put to it;
sor it seems, as they were to wait this half hour for an
answer, they begged he would send them out some bread
in the mean time; which he did, and sent them at the
same time a large piece of goat's flesh, and a broiled
parrot; which they ate very heartily, for they were
hungry enough.
After half an hour's consultation they were called in,
and a long debate bad about them, their two country-
men charging them with the ruin of all their labour,
and a design to murder them; all which they owned
before, and therefore could not deny now; upon the
whole, the Spaniards acted the moderatois between
them; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not
to hurt the three, while they were naked and.unarmed,
so they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their
fellows two huts, one to be ,of the fame dimensions,
and the other larger than they were before; also to sence
their ground again, where they had pulled up the sences,
plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the
land again for planting corn, where they had spoiled it;
and, in a word, to restore every thing in the same state
as they found it, as near as they could; for entirely it
could not be, the season for the corn, and the growth of
the trees and hedges, not being possible to be .recovered.
Well, they all submitted to this; and as they had
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to live
pleasantly and agreeably together again; only that these
three sellows could never be persuaded to work; I mean
not for themselves, except now and then a little, just as
they pleased: however, the Spaniards told them plainly,,
that-if they would but live sociably and friendly together,
and study in the whole the good of the plantation, they
would be content to work for them, and let them walk
about and be as idle as they pleased; and thus having
lived pretty well together for a month or two, the Spa-
niards gave them their arms again, and gave them liberty
to go abroad with them as before.
It was not above a week after they had these arms,
. and went abroad, but the ungratesul creatures began to
be as insolent and troublesome as before; but, however,
an accident happened presently upon this, which en-
dangered the sasety of them all; they were obliged to
lay by all private resentments, and look to the preserva-
tion of their lives.
It happened one night, that the Spaniard governor,
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose lise I
had saved, who was now the captain, or leader, or
governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the
night, and could by no means get any sleep: he was
persectly well in body, as he told me the story, only
found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon men
lighting, and killing one another, but was broad awake,
and could not by any means get any steep; in short,
he lay a great while; but growing more and more
uneasy, he resolved to rise: as they lay, being so many
'of them, upon goat steins, laid thick upon such couches
and pads as they made for themselves, and not in ham-
mocks
Ihocks and ship-beds, as 1 did, who was but one; si>
they had little to do, when they were willing to rise, but
to get up on their seet, and perhaps put on a coat,
such as it was, and their pumps, and they were ready for
going any way that their thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he looked Out; but, being dark,
he could see little or nothing; and besides, the trees
'which I had planted, as in my former account is de-
scribed, and which were now grown tall, intercepted his
sight, so that he could only look up, arid lee that it was
a clear star-light njght; and, hearing no noise, he re-
turned and laid him down again; but it was all one, he
could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to any-
thing like rest, but his thoughts were to the last degree
uneasy, and yet he knew not for what.'
Having made some noise With rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them waked,
and, calling, asked who It was that was up? The go-
vernor told him how it had been with him. Say you
so? says the other Spaniard; such things are not to be
slighted, I assure you; there is certainly some mischief
working, says he, near -us; and presently he asked him.
Where are the Englishmen? The are all in their huts,
fays he, sase enough. It seems, the Spaniards had kept
possession of the main apartment, and had made a place,
where the three Englishmen, since their last mutiny, al-
ways quartered by themselves, and could not come at the
Test. Well, lays the Spaniard, there is something in it,
I am persuaded from my own experience; I am satisfied
our spirits erhbodied have'converse with, and receive in-
telligence from, the spirits unembodied, and inhabiting
the invisible world; and this friendly notice is given for
our advantage, if we know how to make use of it.
Come, says he, let us go out and look abroad; and if »
we find nothing at all in it to justify our trouble, I'll tell
you a story to the purpose, that shall convince you of
the justice of my proposing it.
In a word, they went out to go to the top of the
hill, where I used to go; but they, being strong, and in
good company, nor alone, as I was, used none of my
cautions to go up by the latter, and then pulling it
up after them, to go up a second stage to the top, hut
vol. n. , c were
-were going round through the grove unconcerned and
-unwary, when they were surprised with seeing a light,
as of a fire, a very little way osf from them, and hearing
the voices of men, not of one, or two, but of a great
number. <
In all the discoveries I had made of the savages land-
ing on the island, it was my constant care to prevent
:therrr makmgthe least discovery cSf their being any in-
habitant upon the place; and when by any necessity
rtbey came to know it, they selt it so efsectually, that
-they who got away were scarce able to give any account
:<>fit, for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor did
ever any that had seen me, escape to tell any one • else,
except it were the three savages in our last encounter,
-who jumped into the boat, of whom I mentioned,
*hat I was afraid they should go home, and bring mare
help.
Whether it was in consequence of the escape of those
men, that so great a number came now together; or
-whether they came ignorantly and by accident on their
-usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it seems,
understand; 'but whatever it was, it had been their
business either to have concealed themselves, and not
- have seen them at all:; much less to have let the savages
have seen, that there were any inhabitants in the place;
-but to have sallen upon them so effectually, as that not a
man of them should have escaped, which could only
nave been by getting in between them and their
boats; but this presence of mind was wanting to them,
which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great
-while.
We need not douht, but that the governor, and the
man with him, surprised with this sight, ran back imme-
diately, and-raised their sellows, giving them an account
cf the imminent danger they were all in; and they again
as readily took the alarm, but it was impossible to per-
suade them to stay close within where they were, but
that they must all runout to see how things stood.
While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough,
and they bad opportunity enough for some hours to
view them by the light of three fires they had made
at some distance from one another; what they were
doing
doing they knew not, and what to do themf-lves they
knew not; for, first, the enemy were too many; an<J,
secondly, they did not keep together, but were divides!
'into several parties, anil were on shore in several places.
The Spaniards were in ho small consternation at this
sight; and, as they found that the sellow's rah'straggling
all over the shore, they made no doubt but, first or last,
some of them would chop in upon their habitation, or
upon some other place, where they could see the tokens'
of inhabitants; and they were in great perplexity also
for sear of their flock of goats, which would have been
-little less than starving them, if ihey should have been
destroyed; so the first thing they resolved upon, was to
dispatch three men away before it was light, viz. two
Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the goats
away to the great valley where the cave was, and, if need
•were, to drive them into the very cave itself.
Could they have seen the savages altogether in one
body, and at a distance from their canoes, they resolved,
if there had been an hundred of them, to have attacked
them; but that could not be obtained, for, they were
some of them two miles off from the other, and,
as it appeared afterwards, were of two different
nations.
After having mused a great while on the course they
should take, and beaten their brains in considering their
present circumstances, they resolved at last, while it was
dark, to send the old savage (Friday's sather) out as &
lpy, to learn, if possible, something concerning them,
as what they came for, and what they intended to
do, and the like: the old m.in readily undertook it,
and, stripping himself quite naked^ as most of the
Ravages were, away he went. Aiter he had been gone
an hour or two, he brings word, that be had been
among them undiscovered, that he found they were
two,parties, and of two several nations, who had war
with one another, and had had a great battle in their
own country, and that both sides having had several
^prisoners taken in th,; sight, they were by mere chance
landed in the some island, for the devouring their pri-
soners, and making merry: but their coming so by
chance to the same place, had spoiled all their mirth:
c 2 that
that they were in a threat rage at one another, and were
so near, that he believed they would fight again, as soon:
as day-light began to apjiear; but he did not perceive
that they had no notion of any body's being on the
island but themselves. He had hardly made an end of
telling the story, when they could perceive, by the un-
usual noise they made, that the two little armies were
engaged in a bloody sight.
Friday's sather used all the arguments he could to per-
suade our people to lie close, and not be seen: he told
them their sasety consisted in it, and that they Had
nothing to do but tojie still, and the savages would kill
one another to their hands, and the rest would go away;
and it was so to a tittle. But it was impossible to pre-
vail, especially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity
•was so impoitunate upon their prudentials, that they
must run out and see the battle: however- they used
some caution, viz. they did not go openly, just by their
-own dwelling, but went sarther into the woods, and
placed themielves to advantage, where they might se-
curely see them manage the sight, and, as they thought,
not to be seen by them; but, it seems, the savages did
see them, asweshall find hereafter.
The battle was very fierce, and, if I might believe the
FngWhmen., one of them laid, be could perceive that
some of them were men of great bravery, of invincible
spirits, and of great policy in guiding the sight.
The battle, they laid, held two hours, before they
could guess which party would be beaten; but then
that party which was nearest our people's habitation,
began to appear weakest, and after some time more,
some of them began to fly; and this put our men again
into a great consternation, lest any of those that fled
should run into the grove, before their dwelling, for
slielter, and thereby involuntarily discover the place;
and that by consequence the pursuers should do the
like in search for them. Upon this they resolved, that
they would stand armed within the wall, and whoever
came into the grove, they should sally out over the
wall, and kill them ; so that, if possible, not one should
return to give an account of it; they ordered also, that
it should be done with their swords, or by knocking
them
tfiem clown with the stock of the musket, not by shoot-
ing them, for sear of railing an alarm by the noise.
As they expected, it sell out; three of the routed
army fled for lise, and crossing the creek, ran directly
into the place, not in the least knowing whither they
went, but running as into a thick wood sor shelter: the
scout they kept to look abroad, gave notice of this:
within, with this addition, to our men's great satis-
saction, viz. That the conquerors had not pursued them,
or, seen which way they were gone. Upon this, the
Spaniard Governor/a man of humanity, would not suf-
ser them to kill the three sugitives ; but, sending out three
men by the top of the hill, ordered them to go round,
and come in behind them, surprise and take them pri-
soners, which was done; the residue of the conquered
people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the vic-
tors retired, and made no pursuit, or very little ^ but,
drawing themselves into a body together, gave two great
screaming shouts, which they supposed were by way of
triumph, and. so the sight ended; and the same day,
about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also marched'
to their canoes, and thus the Spaniards had their island
again free to themselves, their fright was over, and they
saw no savages in several years afterwards.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their den; and, viewing the sield of battle, they found
about two-and-thirty dead men upon the spot; somer
were killed with great long arrows, several of which
were found sticking in their bodies; but most of
them were killed with their great wooden swords, sixteen
or feventeen of which they found in the field of battle,
and as many bows, with a great many arrows; these
swords were great unweildy things, and they must be-
very strong men that used them; most of those men that
were killed with them, had their heads mashed to pieces,
as we may lay, or, as we call it in English, their brains.
knocked out, and several of their arms and legs broken;
so that it is evident they sight with inexpressible rage and
fury; they found not one wounded man that was not
stone dead; for either they stay by their enemy till they
have quite killed them, or they carry all the wounded
men, that are not quite dead, away with them.
CI This
This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great-
while: the sight had filled them with horror, and the
consequence appeared terrible to the last degree, especi-
ally upon supposing that some time or other they should
sall into the hands of those creatures who would not-
only kill them as enemies, but kill them for food as we
kill our cattle. And they prosessed to me, that the
thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mutton, though
it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had:
something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very.
stomachs, made them lick when they thought of it, and;
silled their minds with unusual terror, that they were not:
themselves for some weeks after.
This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes I
have been speaking of; and for a great while after they
were very tractable, and went- about the common bust-.
ness of the whole society well enough; planted, sowed,.
reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the country;
but some time after this, they sell all into such simple
measures again, as brought them into a. great deal of.
trouble.
They had taken three prisoner?, as I had observed;
and these three being lusty stout young sellows, they made
them servants, and taught.them to work for them, and,.
as slaves they did well enough; but they did not take
their measures with them as 1 did by my man Friday,
viz. t» begin with them upon the principle of having.
saved their lives, and then instructed them in the rational
principles of lite, rriuch less of religion, civilizing and
reducing them by kind usage, and affectionate arguings ;:
but as they gave them their food every day, lo they
gave them tbeir work too, and kept them sully employed
in drudgery. enough .; but they sailed in this by it, that
they never had them to assist them and sight for them, as.
J had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the very:
flesh upon my bones.
But to come to the samily part; being all now good
friends (for common danger, as I said above, had ef-
sectually reconciled them,) they began to consider their
general circumstances; and the first thing that came
under their consideration was, whether seeing the
savages particularly haunted-that side of th,c island,
and.
5S
ilfid tliat there were more remote and retired parts of it
equally adapted to their way of living, and manisestly to'
their advantage, they should not rather remove their ha-
bitation, and plant in some more proper place for their
sasety, and especially for the security ot' their cattle and'
corn.
Upon this, after long debate,- it was conceived, that
fhey should not remoye their habitation; because that-
so.ne time or other they thought they might hear from
their governor again, meaning me: and if I should send
any one to seek them, 1 would be sure to direst them on-
that tide, where, if they mould sind the place demolished,-
they would conclude the savages had killed us all, and'
we were gone, and so our supply would go away too.
But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove-
them into-the vailey where my cave was, where the
land was as proper to both, and where indeed there was
land enough j. however, upon second thoughts, they al-
tered one part of that resolution to, and resolved only
to remove part of their cattle thither, and plant part of
their corn there; and so if one part was destroyed, the'
other might besaved: and one piece of prudence they
used, which it was very well they did, viz. That they
never trusted these three savages, which they had taken
prisoners, with knowing any thing of the plantation they
had made in that valley,.or of any cattle they had there;
much less of the cave there, which they kept in case of
necessity, as a sase retreat; and thither they carried also
the two barrels of powder, which 1 had lest them at my
coming away.
But, however,- they resolved not to change their ha-
bitation; yei they agreed, that as I had caresully co-
vered it first with a wall or fortification, and then with
a grove of trees; so, seeing tjieir sasety consisted en-
tireiy in their being concealed, of which they were now
sully convinced, they. set to work to cover and conceal
the place yet more essectually than before: to this pur-
pose, as 1 had planted trees, (or rather thrust in stakes,'
-which in time all grew to be trees) for some good
distance before the entrance into my apartmeftt, they
went on in the same manner, and filled up the rest of
that- whole space of ground, from the trees 1 had: sct>
. . c 4t- 'quite
quite down to the side of the creek, where, as 1 said, T
landed my floats, and even in the very ouze where
the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to
land, or any sign that there had been any landing
thereabouts; these stakes also, being of a wood very
forward to grow, as I have noted formerly, .they took
care to have generally very much larger and taller than
those which 1 had planted, and placed them so very thick
and close, that when they had been three or four years
grown, there was no piercing with the eye any conside-
rable way into the plantation; as for that part which I
had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's
thigh; and among them triey placed so many other short
ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a pali-
sado a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to im-
possible to penetrate it, but with a little army, to cut i.
all down; f ra little dog could hardly get between the
trees, they stood so close.
But this was not all; for they did the same by all tha
ground to the right hand, and to the left, and round
even to the top of the hill; leaving no way, not so
much as for themselves to come out, but by the ladder
placed up to the side of the hill, and then lifted up,
and placed' again from the first stage up to the top }
which ladder, when it was taken down, nothing but
what had wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at
them.
This was excellently well contrived; nor was it less
than what they afterwards found occasion for; which
served to convince me, that as human prudence has tha
authority of Providence to iustify it, so it has, doubtless,
the direction.of Providenc* to set it to work; and, would
we listen carefully to the voice of it, l am sully per-
suaded we might prevent many of the disasters which
our lives are now by our own negligence subjected tol
But this by the way.
I return to the fiory: they lived two years after this
in persect retirement, and had no more visits from the
savages; they had indeed, an alarm given them one
morning, 'which put them in a great consternation;
sor, some of the Spaniards being out early one morning,
«in the west. side, or rathe/ end of the island, which, by
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON GRUSOX. &7
being discovered, they were surprised with seeing above
twenty canoes of Indians just coming on more.
They made the best of their way home, in hurry
enough; and giving the alarm to.their comrades, they
kept close all that day and the next, going out only at
night, to make observation; but they had the good luck
to be mistaken; for wherever the i'avages went, they did
not land at that time in the island,-but pursuedsome othec
design.
And now they had another broil with the three Eng-
lishmen; one of which, a most turbulent sellow, being inv
a rage at one of the three slaves, which 1 mentioned they
had taken, because the sellow had not done something.
right which he bid him do, and seemed a little untrac-
table in his shewing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-
belt, in which he wore it by hrs side, and sell upon the
poor savage,not to correct him, but to kill himi-
One of the Spaniards, who was by,, seeing him give
the sellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he
aimed at his head, but struck into hisshoulder, so that he
thought he had cut the poor oreature's: arm osf, rant-
to him, and intreating him not to murder the poor man,.
clapt in between him and the savage, to prevent the
mischief.
The sellow, being enraged the more at- this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would
serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which the
Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with w
shovel, which lie had in his hand (for they were work-
ing in trje sield about the corn-land) knocked the brute
down: Another of the Englishrren, running at the
same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard
down; and then two Spaniards more came to help. their
man, and a third Englishman sell u-pon them. They.
had noneof them any fire-arms, or any other weapons but
hatchets and other tools, except the third Englishman ;.
he had one of. my old rusty cutlasses, with which he
made at the last Spaniards, and wounded them. both.
This fray set the whole samily in an uproar, and more
help coming in, they took the three Englishmen prison-
ers, . The next question was, what should be done with,
c 5- 'them i.
them? They had been so often mutinous, and were Co
surious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that they knew
not what course to take with them; for they were misV
chievous to the last degree, and valued not what hurt they
did any man,; _ so that, in short, .it was not sase to live
-with them.
The Spaniard who was governor, told them in so many
words, that if they had been his own countrymen, he
would have hanged them all; for all laws, and all govern-
ors, were to preserve society; and those who were dan-
gerous to society, ought to be expelled out of it; but as
they were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous .
kindness of an Englishman that they all owed thejr pre-
fervation and deliverance, he would use them with all!
possible lenity, and would leave them to the judgment of .
the other two Englishmen, who were their countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, .and said,
they desired it might not be left to them; for, says he,
I am sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows ; and
•with that gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the
three, had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join
together, and murder all the Spaniards, when th«y were
jn their sleep.
When the Spanish Governor heard this, he calls to
Will Atkins: How, J3eignior Atkins, says he, will you
murder us all? What have you to say to that? That
hardened villain was so sar from denying it, that he said
it was true, and, G—*-d d—mn him, they would do it still:
before they had done with them. Well, bat Seignior
Atkins, said the Spaniard, What have we done to you,.
that you would kill us h And what would you get by
killing us I And what must we do to prevent your
killing us? Must we kill you, or will you kill us!
Why will you: put us to the necessity of this, Seignior
Atkins? says the Spaniard, very calmly, and smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's'.
making a jest of it,. that, had he not been held by three
men s. and withal had no weapons with him, it was .
thought he would have attempted to have killed the
Spaniard in the middle of all the company.
This hair-brained carriage obliged them to consider se-
riously what was to be done. The two Englishmen and'
ib.e. Spaniards whp.sav.ed. th« poor savage, were of the
opinion,.
opinion, That they should hang one of the three for an
example to the rest; and that particularly it should be
he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his
hatchet, aud indeed there was some reason to belive he
had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable
condition with the wound he had received, that it was
thought he could not live.
But the governor Spaniard still said, No, it^was an
Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he would
never consent to put an Englishman to death, though he
had murdered half of them; nay, he said, if he had
been killed himself b.y an Englishmen, and had time left
to speak, it should be, that they should pardon him.
This was so politively insisted on by the governor Spa-•
niard that there was no gainsaying it; and, as mercisul
councils are most apt to prevail where they are so ear-
nestly pressed, so they all came into it; but' then it was
to be considered, what should be done to keep them from
the mischief they designed; for all agreed, governor and
all, that means were to be used for preserving. the so-
ciety from danger. After a long debate it was agreed,
first, That they should be disarmed, and not permitted
to have either gun, or powder, or shot, or sword, or any
weapon, and should be turned out of the society, and
lest to live where they would, and how they could, by
themselves; but that none of the rest, either Spaniards
or English, ihould converse with them, speak with^rrern,
or have any thing to do with them; that they should be
forbid to come within a certain distance of the place
where the rest dwelt; and that if they offered to com-
mit any disorder; so.as to Ipoil, burn, kill, or destroy any
of the corn, planting, buildings, sences-, or cattle belong-
ing to the society, that they should die without mercy,
and would shoot them wherever they could Awl them.
The governor, a man of great humanity, musing up-
on the sentence, considered a little upon it; and, turn-
ing to the two honest Englishmen, said, Hold v you must
reflect, that it will be long ere they can raise corn and
cattle of their own, and they must: not starve; we must
therefore allow them provisions. So he caused to be
added, that they should have a proportion of corn given
them, to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by
which. time. they might be s'uppoied to raise some of their
C ,6 •' own
own; that they should have six milch-goa.ts, four-he-,
goats, and six kids given them, as well for present sub-
sistence, as for a store; and that they should have tools-
given them for their work in the field; such as, six.
hatchets, an- axe, a saw; and the like t But they shoulct
liave none of their tools or provisions, -Unless they would:
swear solemnly, that they would not hurt or injure any of
the Spaniards with them , or of their sellow Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned
them out to shift for themselves. They went away
i'ullen and refractory, as -neither contented to go away,.
or to stay; hut, as there was no remedy, they went pre-.
tending to go and chute a place where they should set-
tle themselves, to plant and live. by themselves;. and
some provision were given, but no weapons.
About four or five days after,: they came again for •
some victuals, and gave the governor-art account were
they had pitched their tents, and marked themlelves out.
an habitation or plantation; it was a very convenient
place indeed, on the remotest part os the island, N. E.
much about the place where I providentially landed ia
my sirst voyage, when I was driven out to sea, the Lord
alone knows whither, in my foolish attempt to surround
the island. i
Here they built themselveS'-two handsome, huts,. and
contrived them in a manner like my. first habitation*..
being close under the side of a hill, having some trees
growing already to- the threc. sides. of it; so that by
planting others, it would be very. easily covered from-
the sight, unless narrowly searched sor; they desired .
some dry goat-skins, for beds and covering, which were .
given them; and upon their giving their words, that
they would not disturb the rest, or. injure' any of-their
plantations, they gave them hatchets, and.what other,
tools they could spare; some pease, barley, and rice,.
for sowing, and, ia . a-word, . any thing they wanted,,
but arms and ammunitios..
They lived in.this separate condition about six months,
and had got hl their- first harvest, though the quantity
-was but small, the parcel of land th"y had planted be-
ing hut little; for indeed, having all their plantation to
form, they had a great deal of work upon their hands;'
:asd,iwd&sa they canae to make boards and pots,. and such.,
- things.
tiiings, they were quite out of their element, and could.
make nothing of it; and when' the rainy season came
on, for want.ofa cave in the earth, they could not keep.
their grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling:..
and this humbled them much, so they came and begged
the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did
and in four days worked a great hole in the side of the
hill for them, big enough to secure their corn,. and
other things from the rain; but it was but a poor. place
at best, compared to mine ;. and especially as mine was,
then; for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and
made several new apartments in it..
About three quarters of a -year after this separation,
a new frolic took these rogues, which, together with.
the former villany they had committed, brought mis-
chief enough. upon them, and had very near been the.
ruin of the whole colony; the three new associates.
began, it seems, to be weary. of the laborious lise they.
led, and that without hope of bettering their circum-
stances; and a whim took them, that they would make
a voyage to the Continent, from whence the savages
came, and would try if they could not seize upon some.
prisoners among the natives there, and bring them.
home, so as to make them do the.laboriou».part of the.
work for them.
The project was net so preposterous, if they had gone
no surther; but they did nothing, and proposed nothing;
but had either mischief in the design, or mischief in the.
event; and, if I may give my opinion, they seemed to
be under a blast from heavea; for, if we will not allow.
a visible curse to pursue visible crimes,, how shall we re-
concile the events of. things with divine justice? It was.
certainly an apparent vengeance os their crime of mu-
tiny and piracy*. that- brought them to the state they
were in; and, as they shewed net the least remorse for'
the crime, but added new villanies to it, such as, par-
ticularly, that piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding,
a poor slave, because he.did not, or perhaps could not,.
•understand to do what he was directed; and to wound.
Km in such a manner, as no question, made him a.
cripple all his lise; and in a place where no surgeon.
ox medicine could be had for his cure : .and, what was,
itilL worse, the. murderous. intent;.or,.to. do justice to.
62 iDVEtJTUITES OF ITOBTN90N CHUSOF.
the crime, the intentional murder, for such to be surff
it wasi as was afterwards the formed design they all
laid, . to murder the Spaniards in cool blood, and in
their sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the story: The
three sellows came down to the Spaniards one morning
and, in very humble terms, desired to be admitted to>
speak with them: the'Spaniards very readily beard
-what they had to say, which was this.: that they were
tired of living in the manner they did; that they were
not handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted ; .
and that, having no help, they found they should be
starved; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to
take one of the canoes which they came over in, and
give them arms and ammunition, proportioned for their-
desence, they would go over to the main, and seek their
fortune, and so deliver them from the trouble of sup-
plying them with any other provision^.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them
but yet very honestly represented to them the certain
destruction they were running into; told them, they had
suffered such hardships upon that very spot, that they
could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell them, that:
they would be starved or murdered; and bade them-
consider of it.
The men replied audaciously, they should be starved-i
if they staid here, for they could not work, and would;: -
not work: and they could but be starved abroad; and -
that if they were murdered, there was an end of them, .
they had no/wives or children to cry after them; and, .
in short, insisted importunately upon their demand, .de-
claring that they would go, whether they would give
them any arms or no.
The Spaniards told therm; with great kindness, that i
if they were resolved to go, they should not go like nake4^
men, and be in no condition to desend themselves; and'
that though they could ill spare their- sire-arms, -having
not enough for themselves, yet they would let them have
two musquets, a pistol, and a c.utlass, and each man a .
hatchet, which they thought sufficient for them.
In a word, they accepted the offer; and having baked •
them bread enough to serve them a (nonth, and given
them as much goat's flesh as they could eat while it wasi -
sweets.
sweet, and a great basket-sull of dried grapes, a pot-sull
of fresh water, and a young kid alive to kill, they bold-
ly set out in a canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it
was at least/forty miles broad.
The boat was indeed a large,one, and would have
very well carried 15 or 30 men; and therefore was ra-
ther too big for them to manage; but as they had a sair
breeze, and the flood-tide with them, they. did well
enough: they had made a mast of a long.pole, and a
sail of four large goat-skinsdried, which they had sewed
or laced together; and away they went merrily enough;
the Spaniards called after them, Bon Veajo; and no
man ever- thought of seeing them any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one another, and
the two honest Englishmen who Vemained behind, how
quiet and comfortably they lived, now those three tur-
bulent sellows were gone; as for their ever coming again
that was the remotest thing from their thoughts that
could be imagined; when behold, after 22 days.ab-
sence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his
planting-work, sees three strange men coming towards
him at a distance, two of them with guns -upon their
shoulders. n
Away runs the Englishman, aaif he was bewitched,.
and became frighted and amazed to the governor Spa-
niard, and tells them they were all undone, for there
-were strangers landed upon the island, he could not tell
who : the Spaniard pausing a wliile, says to him, how
do you mean, you cannot tell who? They are savages
to be sure. No, no, says the Englishman, they are men
in clothes, with arms: Nay then, says the Spaniard,
why are you concerned? If they are not savages, they .
must be friends; .for there is no Christian nation upon
earth, but will do us good rather than harm»-
W hile they were debating thus, came the three Eng»-
lishmen, and, standing without the wood, which was
Jiew planted,. hallooed to them; they presently knew
their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind ceased.
Eut now the admiration was turned upon another ques-
tion, viz. What could be the matter, and what made:
them come back again.
It was not long before they brought the men in; and
•enquiring where they had been, and what they had been
doing?
doing? They gave them a sull account of their voyage^,
in a sew words, viz. That they reached the land in two
days, or something less; but, sinding the people alarmed -
at their coming, and preparing-with. bows and arrows.
to sight them, they durst not go on shore, but sailed on
to the northward 6 or 7 houiSi till thev came to a great.
opening, by which they perceived that the land they.
saw from our island was not the main, but an island
that entering that opening of the sea, they saw another
island on the right hand north, and several more west
and, being resolved to land somewhere, they put over
to one of the islands which lay west, and went boldly on.
shore; that they found the people were courteous and.
friendly to them, and they gave them several roots, and
some dried fish, and appeared very sociable; and the.
women, as well as the men, were very forward to supply
them with any thing they could get for them to eat, and
brought it to them a great way upon their heads.
They continued. here four days, and enquired, as
-well as they could of them by sigps, what nations were.
this way, and that way; and were told of several fierce
and terrible people, that lived almost every way; who,
as they made known by signs to them, used to eat men •
but as for themselves, they said that they never eat men.
or women, except only such as they took in the wars ;.
and then they owned,. that they made a great seast, and.
eat their prisoners.
The Englishmen enquired, when they had a seast of:
thatkind; and theytold them,.two moons ago, pointing,
to the. moon, and then to two fingers; and that their
great king had 200 prisoners now, which he had taken,
in his war; and they. were seeding them to make theras.
sat for the next.seast. . The Englishmen seemed mighty
desirous to see those prisoners; but the others mistaking
them, thought they were desirous to have some of
them, to carry away for their own eating,. So they
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting.of the sun,.
and then to the rising ;. which was to signify, that the
next morning, at sun rising, they would bring some for
them ; and accordingly, the next morning, they brought.
down five women, and eleven men; and gave them.
*o. the. Englishmen, to. cany with- them, on their
voyage,.
voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen
down to a sea-port town, to victual a strip.
As brutish and barbarous as these sellows were at
home, their stomachs turned at this right, and they did
not know what to do ; to resuse the prisoners, would have
been the highest affront to the savage gentry that offerees
them; and what to do with them they knew not; how-
ever, upon some debate, they resolved to accept of them;
and in return, they gave the savages that brought them,
one of their hatchets, an old key, a knise, and six or
feven of their bullets, which, though they did not under-
stand they seemed extremely pleased with ; and then, ty-
ing the poor creatures hands behind them, they (the
people) dragged the prisoners into the boat for our men.
The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon
as they had them, or else they that'gave them this noble
present, would certainly have expected that they should
j have gone to work with them, have killed two or three
i of them the next morning, and perhaps have invited the
donors to dinner.
But, having taken their leave with all the respects and
shanks that could well pass between people, where on
ione side, they understood not one word they could say,
they put off with their boat, and came back towards
the first island, where, when they arrived, they set eight
of their prisoners at liberty, there being too many of
them for their occasion.
In their voyages they endeavoured to have some com-
munication with their prisoners, but it was impossible
to make them understand any thing; nothing they could
say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was
looked upon as going about to murder them; they first
of all unbound them, but the poor creatures screamed
at that, especially the women, as if they had just selt the
knise at their throats; for they immediately concluded:
they were unbound on purpose to be killed..
If they gave them any thing to eat, it was. the same
thing; then they concluded it was for sear they should:
rink in flesh, and so not be sat enough to kill: if they
looked at one of them more particularly, the party pre-.
sently concluded, it was to' see whether he or she waa
fj&ttpstand- fittest to kill first; nay, after they had brought
thenv
them quite over, and began to use them kindly, and
treat them well, still they expected every day to make a
dinner or supper for their new masters. -
When the three wanderers had given this unaccount-
able history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard
asked them, where their new samily was. And being
told that they had brought them on shore, and put them
into one of their huts, and were come to beg some vic-
tuals for them, they (the Spaniards) and the other two
Englishmen, that is to say, the Whole colony resolved
to go all down to the place, and see them, and did so,.
and Friday's sather with them.
W hen they came into the hut, there they sat all bound;
for when they had brought them on shore, they bound
their hands, that they might not take the boat and
make-their escape; there, 1 say, they sat, all of them
stark-naked; first, there were three men, lusty comely
sellows, well shaped, strait arid sair limbs, about 30 or
35 years of age, and 5 women, whereof two might be-
from 30 to 40, two more not above 2<* or 25, and the
fifth a tall comely maiden, about 16 or 17: the women
were well-savoured agreeable persons, both in shape and
seatures, only tawny; and two of them, had they been-
persect white, would have passed for handsome women,.
even in London itself, having very pleasant agreeable
countenances, and of a very modest behaviour, especially
when they. came afterwards to be cloathed, and dressed
as they called it, tho' that dress was very indifferent, it.
must be consessed: of which hereafter.
The sight you may be lure was something uncouth
to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a just cha-
racter) men of the best behaviour, of the most calm,
sedate tempers, and persect good humour, that- ever I
met with; and in particular,. of the most modesty, as-
will presently appear: I say, the sight was very uncouth,
to see three naked men, and five naked women, all toge-
ther bound, and in the most miserable circumstances
that human nature could be supposed to be, vit. to be
expecting every moment to be dragged out, and have
their brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up like
a..calf that is killed for a dainty.
Xhe first thing they did was to cause the old Indian,
Friday's.
Friday's satheiyto go in, and see first if he knew any of
them; and then, if he understood *ny of their speech:
as soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously at
them, but knew none of them, neither could any of
them understand a word he said, or a sign he could
make, except one of the women.
However, this was enough to answer the end, which
was to satisfy them, that the men into whose hands they
were sallen were Christians, that they abhorred eating of.
men or women, and that they might be sure they would
not be killed; as soon as they were assured of this, they
discovered such a joy, and by such aukward and several
ways, as is hard to describe; for it seems they were of
several nations.
The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid, in
the next place, to ask them if they were willing to be
servants, and to work for the men who had brought
them away, to save their lives? -At which they all sell:
a dancing; and presently one sell to taking up this, and
another that, any thing that lay next, to carry on their
Ihoulders, to intimate that they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having women
among them would presently. be attended with some
inconveniency, and might occasion some strise, and per-«
haps blood, asked the three men, what they intended to
do with these women, and how they intended to use
them, whether as servants, or as women. One of the
Englishmen answered very boldly and readily, that they
would use them as both. To which the governor raid,
I am not going to restrain you from it; you are your
owmnasters as to that; but this 1 think is but just, for
avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and 1 desire
it of you for that reason only, viz. that you will all en-
gage, that if any of you take any of these women, as a
woman, or wise, he shall take but one; and that having
taken one, none else should touch her; for though we
cannot marry any of you, yet it is but reasonable, that
while you stay here, the woman any of you t. ke,
should be maintained by the man that takes her, and
should be his wise; I mean, says he, while he continues
here; and that none else should have any thing to d»
with her. All this appeared so just, that every one.'
ggreed to i£ without any disficulty. Ths%
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards, if they dc—
signed to take any of them? But every one answered^.
no: some of them said they had wives in- Spain, and
the others did not like women that were not Christians r
and altogether declared, that they would not touch one
of them; which was an instance of such virtue, as I
have not met with in all my travels: on the other hand,
to be short, the five Englishmen took them every one a
wifv; that is to say, a temporary wise; and fo they set
up a new form of living; for the Spaniards and Friday's
sather lived in my old habitation, which they had en-
larged exceedingly within; the three servants, which
they had taken in the late battle of the savages, lived
with them, and thele carried on the main part ot' the
colony, supplying all the rest with food, and assisting
them in any thing as they could, or. as they found ne-
cessity required.
But the wonder of this story was, how five such re-
fractory ill-matched sellows should agree about these
women, and that two of them should not pitch upon
the same woman, especially feeing two or three of them-
were, without comparison, more agreeable than the
others; but they took a good way enough to prevent
quarrelling among themselves; for they set the five wo-
men by themselves in one of their hut6, and they went
all into the other hut, and: drew lots among them- who
should chuse first.
He that drew to chuse first went away by himself to
the hut where the poor naked creatures were, and setch-
ed out her he chose; and it was worth observing, that
he that chose first, took her that was reckoned the home-
liest, and the oldest of the five, which made mirth enough
among the rest; and even the Spaniards.laughed at it:
but the sellow considered better than any of them, that
it was application and business that they were to expect
assistance in, as much as.any thing else; and she proved
t^ie best wise in the parcel.
When the poor women saw themselves set-in a row
thus, and setched out one by one, the terrors of their
condition returned upon them again, and they firmly
believed, that they were now going to be devoured : ac-
cordingly, when the English sailor came iaand setched'
,. out
out one of them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry,
and hung about her, and took their leave of her with
such agonies and such affection, as would have grieved
the hardest heart in the world; nor was it possible for
-the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be
immediately murdered, till they setched the old man,
Friday's sather, who instantly let them know, that the
five men who had setched them out one by one, had
chosen them for their wives.
When they had done this, and the fright the women
-were in was a little over, the men went to work, and
the Spaniards came and helped them; and, in a sew
hours they had built them every one a new hut or tent
sor their lodging apart: for those they had already, were
crouded with their tools, houshold-ftuff and provisions;
The three wicked ones had pitched sarthest off, and the
two honest ones nearer, but both on the north-shore of
the island, so that they continued separate as before; and
thus my island peopled in three places, and, as I might
say. three towns were began to be planted.
And here it is very well worth observing, that, as it
often happens in the world (what the wile ends ot God's
providences are in such a disposition of things, I cannot
say), the two honest sellows had the two worst wives:
and the three reprobates, that were scarce worth hang-
ing, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed born
to do themselves good, nor any one else, had three clever,
diligent, caresul, and ingenious wives; not that the two
first were ill wives as to their temper or humour; for all
the five were most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected
creatures, rather like slaves than wives; but my meaning
is, they were not alike capable, or ingenious, or indus-
trious, or alike cleanly neat.
Another observation I must make, to the honour of
a diligent application on the one hand, and to the dis-
grace of a slothsul, negligent, idle temper on the other,
that when I came to the place, and viewed the several
improvements, planting, and management of the several
little colonies, the two men had so sar outgone the
three, that there was no comparison: they had indeed
both of them as much ground laid out for corn as they
wanted; and the reason was, because, according to my
rule,
70
JtDVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
rule, nature dictated, and that it was to no purpose'to
sow more corn than they wanted; but the difserence of
the cultivation, of the planting, of the sences, and indeed
every thing else, was easy to be seen at sirst view.
The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their huts, that when you came to the place, no-
thing was to be seen but a wood; and though they had
their plantation quite demolished, once by their own
countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be shewn
in its place, yet they had restored all again, and every
tiiing was flourishing and thriving about them; they had
grapes planted in order, and managed like a vineyard,
though they had themselves never seen any thing of that
kind; and by their good ordering their vines, their
grapes were as good again as any of the others. They
had also formed themselves a retreat in the thickest part
of the woods, where, though there was not a natural
•cave, as 1 had found, yet they made one with incessant
labour of their hands, and where, when the mischief
which followed happened, they secured their wives and
children, so as they could never be found: they having
W sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood,
which, as I said, grew so easily, made a grove impassa-
ble, except in one piace, where they climbed up to get
over the outside part; and then went in by ways of
•their own leaving.
As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, tho*
they were much civilized by their new settlement, com-
pared to what they were before, and were not so quar-
relsome, having not the same opportunity, yet one of i
the certain companions of a profligate mind, never left
them, and that was their idleness; it is true, they plant-
ed corn, and made sences; but Solomon's words were
never better verrified than in them; '1 went by the
vineyard of the slothsul, and it was overgrown with
thorn ;' for when the Spaniards came to view their crop,
they could not iee it in some places tor weeds; the hedge
had several gaps in it, where the wild goats had gotten
in, and eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there a
dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for the
present, but it was only shutting the stable door after
the steed was -stolen: whereas, when they looked on the
colony
I'
-colony of the other two, there was the very sace of in-
dustry and success upon afl they did; there was not a
-weed to be seen in all their corn, or a gap in any of their
hedges: and they, on the other hand, verrtfied Solomon's
words in another place: ' The diligent hand maketh
rich;' for every thing grew and thrived, and they had
plenty within and without; they had more tame cat-
tle than the others, more utensils and necessaries within
doors, and yet mere pleasure and diversion too.
It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and
cleanly wichin doors; and, having learned the English.
way of dressing and cooking from one of the other Eng-
lishmen, who, as 1 siid, was a cook's mate on board
ithe thip, they dressed their husband's victuals very nice-
ly; whereas the other could not be brought to under-
stand it; but then the husband, who, as I said, had been
cook's mate, did it himself; but, as for the husbands
of the three wives, they loitered about, setched turtles'
eggSi and caught fish and' birds: in a word, anything
tut labour; and they sared accordingly. The diligent
\i, ed well and comfortably, and the slothsul lived hard
and beggarly; and so I believe, generally speaking, it is
:all °ver the world.
But now 1 come to a scene, different from all that had
happened before, either to them or me, and the origin of
4he story was this:
Early one morning there came on shore five or six
,canoes of Indians, or Tavages, call them which you
please; and there is no room to doubt that they came
upon the old errand of seeding upon their slaves;' but
that part was now so samiliar to the Spaniards, and to
our men too, that they did not concern themselves about
it, as I did; but, having been made sensible by their
experience, that their only business was to lie concealed,
and that, if they were not seen by any of the savages,
they would go orf ' again quietly, when their business was
done, having as yet not the least notion of there being
any. inhabitants in the island; I say, having been made
sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give no-
tice to all the three plantations to keep within doors,
and not to shew themselves; only placing a scout in a
4 proper
'proper place, to give notice when the boats went off to>
sea again.
This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among
-the savages, that there were inhabitants there; .which
was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole co-
lony. After the canoes with the savages were gone off,
the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and some of them
had the curiosity to go to the place where they had been,
to see what they had been doing. Here, to their great
surprise, they found three savages left behind, and lying
sast asleep upon the ground; it was supposed, they had
either been so gorged with their inhuman seast, that like
beasts, they were asleep, and would not stir when the
others went, or they wandered into the woods, and did
not come back in time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and
persectly at a loss what to do; the Spaniard governor as
it happened, was vith them, and his advice was asked,
but he prosessed he knew not what to do; as for slaves
they had enough already; and as to killing them, they
were none of them inclined to that; the Spaniard gover-
nor told me, they could not think of shedding innocent
blood; for, as to them, the poor creatures had done
-no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they
thought they had no just quarrel with them, to take
away their lives.
And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards, observe,
that let all the accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico and
Peru be what they will, I never met with seventeen men,
of any nation whatsoever, in any foreign country,
who were so universally modest, temperate, virtuous,
so very good-humoured, and so courteous, as these Spa-
niards; and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in their
very nature; no inhumanity, no barbtrity, no out-
rageous paffions, and yet all of them men of great cou-
rage and spirit.
Their temper and calmness had appeared in their
bearing the unsust'erable usage of the three Englishmen,
and their justice and humanity appeared now in the
case of the savages, as above: after some consultation,
they
they resolved upon this, that they would lie still awhile
longer, till, if possible, these three men might be gone;
'but then the governor Spaniard recollected, that the
three savages had no boat; and that, if they were left
to rove about the island, they'would certainly discover
that there were inhabitants in it, and so they should be
undone that way,
Upon this they went back again, and 'there lay the
fellows sait asleep still; so they resolved to awaken them,
and take them prisoners, and they did so: the poor
sellows were strangely frighted when they were seized
upon and bound, and afraid, like the women, that they
should be murdered and eaten; for, it seems, those peo-'
pie think all the world do as they do, eating men's
flesh; but they were soon made eafy as to that, and
away they carried them.'
It was very happy to them, that they did not carry
them horneto their castle; I mean to my palate under the
hill; but they carried them first to the bower, where was
the chief of their country work; filch as the keeping the
goats, the planting the con*, he. and afterwards they
-carried them to the habitation of the two Englishmen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not much
they had for them to do; and whether it was by neg-
igence in guarding them-, Or that they thought the seh-
sows could not mend themselves, I know not, but one
of them ran away; and, taking into the woods, they
could never hear of him more.
They had good reason t,o believe he got home again
soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages,
who came on shore three or four weeks afterwards, and
-who, carrying on their revels as usual, went off again in
two days time: this thought terrified them exceedingly;
for they concluded, and that not without good cause in-
deed, that if this sellow got sase home among his com-
rades, he would certainly give them an account that there
were people in the island, as also how weak-and sew they
were; tor this savage, as I observed before, had never
been told, as it was very happy he had not-, how many
they were, or where they lived; nor had he ever seen jjr
heard the fire of any of their guns, much lei's had they
shewn him any other of their retired places, such as the
vol. ii. .o cave
cave in the valley, or the new retreat .which the two
Englishmen had made, and the like<r .- •.
The first testimony they had, that this sellow had
given intelligences • them was, that about two months
after this, six canoes of savages, with about seven, or
eight, or ten men jn a canoe, came rowing along the
north-side of the island, where they never used to come
before, and landed about an hour after sun-rise, at a
convenient place, about a mile from the habitation of
the two Englishmen, where this escaped man had been
kept: as the Spaniard governor said, had they been
all therei the damage would not have been so much,
sor not a man of them would have escaped; but the
case difsered now ^ery much; for two mtn to fifty were
too much odds: the two men had the happiness to dis-
cover them about a league off, so that it was above an
b»ur. before they landed ; and as they landed about a
mile from their huts, it was some time before they could
come at them. Now having great reason to believe that
they were betrayed, the first thing they did, was to bind
the slaves which were left, and cause two of the three
men, whom they brought with the women, who, it
feems, proved very saithsul to them, to lead them with
their two wives, and whatever they could carry away
with them, to their retired place in the woods, which I
have spoken of above, and there to bind the two sellows
hand and foot till they h/ard sarther.
In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on
snore, and that they bent their course directly that
way, they opened the sences where their milch-goats
were kept, and drove them all out, leaving their goats
to straggle into the wood, whither they pleased, that
| the savages might think they were all bred wild; but
the io<rue who came with them was too cunning for that,
and gave them an account of it all; for they went di-
rectly to the place.
VV hen the two poor frighted men had secured their
wives and goods, they lent she other slave they had
of the three, who came with the women, and who was
at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards, with
all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy
help; and in the mean time they took their arras,
. and
and what ammunition they had, and retreated toward the
place in the wood, -where their wives were sent, keeping
at a distance, yet so that they might see, \ if possible,
which way th.e savages took.
They had not gone sar, but that, from a rising
ground, they could fee the little army of their enemies
come on directly to their habitation, and in a moment
tnore coulct see all their huts and houmold-stuff flaming
"up together, to their great grief and mortification; for
they had a very great loss; and to them irretrievable, at
least for some time. They kept their station for awhile,
till they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread them-
selves all over the place, rummaging every way, and
every place they could think of, in search for prey; and
in .particular for the people of whom, it plainly appeared,
they had intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves
not secure where they stood, because, as it was likely
some of the wild people might come that way, so they
might come too many together, thought it proper to
make another retreat about half a mile sarther, believing,
as it afterwards happened, that the sarther they strolled,
the sewer would be together.
The next halt was at the entrance into a very thjck
grown part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a
tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly large, and in
this tree they both took their standing, resolving to see
what might offer.
They had not stood there long, but two of the savages
appeared running directly that way, as if they had already
notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack
them; and a little way surther they espied three more
coming after them, and five more beyond them, all com-
ing the same way ; besides which, they saw 7 or 8 more at
a distance, running another way; for, in a word, they
ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their game,
The poor men were now in great perplexity, whether
they mould stand, and keep their posture, or fly; but after
a very short debate with themselves, they considered, that
if the savages ranged the country thus, before help came,
they might, perhaps, find out their retreat in the woods,
and then all would be lost; so they resolved to stand them.
D 2 there
there; and if there were too many to deal with, then they
would get to the top of the tree, from whence they doubt-
ed not to desend themselves, fire excepted, as long as thein
ammunition lasted, tho' all the savages that were landed,
which were near fifty, were to attack them.
Having resol ved upon this, they next considered whether
they mould fire at the two first, or wait for the three, and so
take the middle party; by which the two and the five that
followed would be separated; at length they resolved to let
the t«vo first pass by, unless they should spy them in the
tree, and come to attack them. The two first savages also
consirmed them in this resolution, by turning a little from
tl.em towards another part of the wood; but the three,
and the five after them, came forwards directly to the
tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there.
Seeing them come so strait towards them, they resolved
to take them in a line as they came; and as they resolved
to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first soot might hit
them all three; to which purpose, the man who was to
fire, put three or four bullets into his piece, and having
a sair loop-hole, as it were, from a broken hole in the
tree, he took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting
till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, io
that he could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the savages came
on, they plainly saw, that one of the three was the run-
away savage that had escaped from them, and they both
knew him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he
should not escape, though they should both fire; so the
other ttood ready with his piece, that if he did not drop
at the tirtt soot, he soould be sure to have a second.
- But the sirst was too good a marksman to miss his aim:
for the savages kept near one another a little behind
in a line; in a word, he fired, and hit two of them di-
rectly: the foremost was killed outright, being shot in
the head; the iecond, which was the run-away Indian,
was shot through the body, and sell, but wai not quite
dead; and the third had a little scratch in th • shoulder,
perhaps by the same ball that went through the body of
the second; and, being dreadsully frighted, though not
much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and
yelling in a hideous manner.
The
The five that were behind, more frighted with the
noise than sensible of their danger, stood still at first; fdr
the woods made the found a thousand times bigger than
it really was ;Mhe echoes rattling from one side to ano-
ther, and the fowls rising from all parts, screarrting and
making, every sort, a several kind of noise, according
to their kind, just as it was when I fired the first gun
that, perhaps, was ever shot off in that place since it
was an island.
However, all being silent again, and they not knowing
what the matter was, came on, unconcerned, till they
came to that place where their companions lay in a
condition miserable enough: and here the poor ignorant
creatures, not sensible that they were within reach of the
same mischief, stood all of a huddle over the wounded
man, talking, and, as may be supposed, enquiring of
him how he came to be hurt; and who, 'tis very ratio-
nal to believe, told them that a flash of fire first, and
immediately after that, thunder from their gods, had
killed those two, and wounded him: this, I say, is ra-
tional; for nothing is more certain than that, as they
saw no man near them, so they had never heard a gun
in all their lives, or so much as heard of a gun; neither
knew they any thing of killing or wounding at a distance,
with fire and bullets; if they had, one might reasonably
believe, that they would not have stood so unconcerned,
in viewing the sate of their sellows, without some appre-
hension of their own.' •
Our two men, though, as they consessed to me, it
grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor crea-
tures, wbo<at the same time had no notion of their dan-
ger; yet, having them all thus in their power, and the
first having loaded his piece again, resolved to let fly
both together among them; and singling out by agree-
ment which to aim at, they shot together, and killed, or
very much wounded, four of them; the fifth, frighteU
even to death, though not hurt, sell with the rest; so
that our men, seeing them all tall together, thought th^y
had killed them all.
The belief that the savages were all killed, made our
two men come boldly out from the tree before they
had charged their guns again ^ which was a wrong

step; and they were under some surprise, when they
came to the place, and sound no less than four of the
men alive, and of them, two very little hurt, and one
not at all; this'bbliged them to sall upon them. with the
stocks of their mulquets; and sirst, they made sure of
the runaway savage, that had been the cause of all the
mischief; and of another that was hurt in his knee, and
put them out of their pain; then the man that was not
hurt at all came and kneeled down to them, with his
two hands held up, and made piteous moan to them by
gestures and signs, for his.lise; but could not lay one
word to them that they could understand.
However, they signified to him to sit down at the foot
of a tree thereby; and one of the Englishmen^. with a.
piece of rope twine, which he had by great chance in his.
pocket, tied his seet sait together, and his hands behind
kirn, aud there they left him; and with what speed they
could, made aster the other two which were gone before
searing they, or any more of them, should find the way
to their covered place in the woods, where their wives,
and the sew goods they had left lay: they came once in
sight of the two men, but it was a great distance; how-
ever, they had the satissaction to see them cross over a
valley, towards the sea, the quite contrary way from that
which led to th«ir retreat, which they were afraid of;
and, 'being satisfied with that, they went back to the tree
where they left their prisoner, who, as they supposed,
was delivered by his comrades; for he was gone, and
the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound
him, lay just at the foot of the tree.
They were now in aS great concern as before, not
knowing what course to take, or how near the enemy
might be, or in what numbers; so they resolved to go
away to the place where their wives were, to see if all
was well there, and to make them- easy, who were in
fright enough to be sure; for though the savages were
their own country folks, yet they were most terribly a-
fraid of them, and perhaps the more, for the knowledge
they had of them. j
When they came thither, they found the savages had
been in the wood, and very near the jsiace, but had not
found it; for indeed, it was inaccessible,: by the trees

standing so thick, as before, unless the persons seeking it
had been directed by those that knew it, which these were
not; they found, therefore, everything very sase, only
the women in a terrible fright: while they were here,
they had the comfort of seven of the Spaniards coming to
their assistance; the other ten, with their servants, and
old Friday, I mean Friday's sather, were gone in a body
to desend their bower, and the corn and cattle that were
kept there, in case the savages should have roved over to
that side of the country; but they did not spread so sar:
with the seven Spaniards came one of the savages, who.
as I said, were their prisoners formerly, and with them
also came the' savage whom the Englishmen had left
'bound hand and foot at the tree: for it seems they came
that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men, and
unbound the eighth, and brought him along with them;
where, however, they were obliged to bind him again,
-as they had done the two others, who were left when
the third ran away.
The prisoners began now to be a burden to them, and
they were so afraid of their escaping, that they thought
they were under an absolute necessity to kill them for their
own preservation ; however, the Spaniard governor would
not consent to it; but ordered, that they mould be sent
out of the way, to my oki cave in the valley, and be kept
there with two Spaniards to guard them and give them
food, which was done, and they were bound there
hand and foot for that night. - -
Wheti the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were
so encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to
stay any longer there; but taking five of the Spaniards
and themselves, with four musquets and a pistol among
(hem, and two stout quarter staves, away they went in
quest of the savages; and sirst, they came' to the tree
where the men lay that had been killed; but it was
easy to see, that some more of the savages had been there;
for they attempted to carry their-dead men away, and
had dragged two of them a good way, but had given it
over : from thence they advanced to the sirst rising ground,
where they had stood and seen their camp destroyed, and
where they had the mortification still to tee some of
the smoke; but neither could they' here see any of the
D -4 savages i
savages: they then resolved, though with all possible
caution, to go forward towards their ruined plantation.;
but a little before they came thither, coming in light of
the sea-shore, they saw plainly all the savages embarked
again in their canoes, in order to be gone.
They seemed sorry at-first that there was no way to
come at them, to give them a parting blow: but
upon- the whole, were very well satisfied to be rid of
fdiem.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and
all their improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed
to come and help them to. rebuild, and to assist them
with needsul supplies, Their three countrymen, who
were not yet noted for having the least inclination to do.
any good, yet, as soon as- they heard of it (for they,
living remote eastward, knew nothing. of the matter
till all was over), catne and offered their help and affiil—-
aiice, and did very friendly work for several days, to.
restore their habitations, and make necessaries for them.;..
and thus in. a little time they were set upon their
legs again.
About two days after this, they. had the sarther satis-
saction of seeing three of the savages' canoes come driv-
ing on shore, and, at some distance from them,.wita
two drowned men; by which they had reason to.
believe, that they had met with a storm at sea, and
had overset some of them fcr it. blew very hard the
night after they went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other
hand, enough of them escaped lo inform the rest, as
well. of what they had done, as of what happened to
them.; and to whet them on to another enterprise of
the same nature, which they, it seems, resolved to at-
tempt, with sufficient force to carry all before them;
for, except what the first man had told them of inhabi-
tants, they could say little to it pf their own knowledge;
for they never saw cne man, and the sellow being killed
that had affirmed it, they had no other witness to con-
firm it to them.
It was five or six months after this, before they heard
any more of the savages, in which time our men
•were in hopes they had npt forgot their former bad
luck,.
luck, or had given over the hopes of better; when, on
a sudden, they were invaded with a most formidable fleet,
of no less than twenty-eight canoes sull of savages armed
with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, and
suchlike engines of war; and they brought such num-
bers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into
the utmost consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
easternmost side of the island, our men had that night
to consult and consider what to do; and, in the first
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed was
their only sasety before, and would much more besonow,
while the number of their enemies was so great, they
therefore resolved', first of all, to take down the huts,
which were built for the two Englishmen, and drive
away their goats to the old cave; because they supposed
the savages would go directly thither, as soon as it was
day, to play the oki game over again, though they did
not now land within two leagues of it.
1n the next place, they drove away all the flock of
•goats they had at the old bower, as 1 called it, which
belonged to. the Spaniards; and, in short, left as little
appearance of inhabitants any where as possible; and th,e
next morning early they posted themselves with all their
force, at the plantation of tlie two men, waiting for their
coming. As they guested, so it happened; these new
invaders, leaving their canoes at the east-end of the island,
came ranging along the shore directly towards the place,
to the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as ogr
men could judge. Our army was but small indeed;
but, that which was worse, they had not arms for all
their number neither: The whole account, it seems,
flood thus: First, as to men:
17 Spaniards.

To their flal-es they did not give either mufquet or fui-
fil, but they had every one an halbert, or a long staff, like
a quarter-staff, with a,great spike of iron sastened into-
each end of it, and by his fide a hatchet; also every one
of our men had hatchets. Two of the women could not
be prevailed upon, but they would come into the sight \_
and they had bows and arrows, whichthe Spaniards had
taken from the savages,. when the first action happened*.
which I have spoken of, where the Indians fought with
©ne another, and the women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor, whom,I have.described so of-
ten, commanded the whole; and William Atkios, who,.
tho' a dreadsul sellow for wickedness, was a most daring
bold sellow, commanded under him. The savages came
forward like lions, and our men, whiebwas the worst ofr'
their sate, had no advantage in their situation; only that
Will Atkins, who now proved a molt usesul. sellow^ with,.
fix men,, was planted just behind a small thicket of bushes,
as an advanced guard,. with orders to let the sirst of them
pass by, and then fire into the middle of them ;. and as
ibon as he had fired, to make his retreat, as nimbly as.
he could, round a part of the wood, and so come in.
behind the Spaniards where they stood, having a thicket.
of trees all before thenu
When-the savages came on, they ran straggling about
every way in heaps, out of all manner of order; and
Will Atkins let about sifty of them pass by him; then
seeing the rest. come in a very thick throng, he orders
three of his men to fire, having leaded their musquets.
4 with.
-with six or seven bullets a-piece, about as big as large
piltol-bullets. How many they killed or wnuuled, they
knew not; but the conlternation and surprise was inex-
pressible among the savages, who were frighted, to the
last degree, to hear such a dreadsul noise, and see their
men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that did it;
when in the middle of their fright, William Atkins, and
his other three, let fly s^gain among the thickest of them;
and in less than a minute, the first three, being loaded
again, gave them a third volley.
Had William Atkins and his men retired immediately,
as soon as they had fired, as they were ordered to do;
or had the rest of the body been at hand, to have poured
in their shot continually, the savages had been effectually
routed; for the terror that was among them came prin-
cipally from this, viz. That they were killed by the Gods
with thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that
hurt them; but W illiam Atkius, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat; some of the savages, who were at
a distance, spying them, came upon them behiad; and
tho' Atkins and his men fired at them also two or three \
times, and killed above twenty, 'retiring as sast as they
could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one
of his sellow Englishmen with their arrows, as they did
afterwards one.Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves who
came with the women; this slave was a most gallant
sellow, and fought most desperately, killing five of them .
with his own band, having no weapon but one of the
armed staves, and an hatchet; -
Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded,
and two other men killed, retreated to a riling ground in
the wood; and the Spaniards, after firing three vollies
upon them, retreated also, for their number was lo great,
and they were so desperate, that tho' above fifty of them
were killed, and more than so many wounded, yet they
came on in the teeth of our men, searless of danger, and
shot their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed, that
their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, were
made outrageous by their wounds, and fought like
madmen. ->-,, .

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body

But:as it was a.clear-moonlight-night; and they founds

ed men, and a great hurry and noise among them where -
they lay, they afterwards- resolved to sall upon them in-
the night; especially if they could come to: give them
but-one volley before they were discovered. This they
had a. sair opportunity to do; for one of the two Eng-
lishmen, in whose. quarter it was where the fight began, .
led- them round, betweentbe woods and the sea-lide,
westward, and turning short- south-, they came so near
where the thickest of them lay; that'before they were
seen or heard, eight of them nred in among them, and
did dreadsul execution upon them; in-half a minute more
eight others fired after them, pouring in their small shot-
in such a quantity, that abundance were killed and-
wounded; and all this while they were not able to see
who hurt. them, or which way to %.
Xha
The Spaniards charged again, with the utmost expediti-
on, and then divided themselves into 3 bodies and resolved:
to sall in among them all together: they had in each body
8 persons; that is to say 24> whereof were 22 men, and!
the 2 womenv who, by the way, fought desperately.
They divided the fire-arms equally in each party,
and so of the halberts and staves. They would have
had thewomen keep-back 7 tut they said, they were re-
solved to die with- their husbands^ Having thus formed
their little army, thejr marched' out from among the
trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting
and hallooing as loud as they could; the savages stood
all together,. bub where in the utmost consusion', hearing
the noise of our men shouting from- three quarters toge-
ther; they would have fought if they had seen us; ants
as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows
were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, tho' not
dangerously. But our men gave them no- time; but,
running up to them, fired among them three ways, and'
then sell in with the butt-ends of their mufquets, their
swords, armed staves, and hatchets ; and laid about- them-
so welli that, in a word, they set'up a dismal screaming.
and howling, flying to save their lives.which way soevcrr
they could.
Our men were tired'with the execution-; and killed,,'
or mortally wounded, in the two sights, about 180 of
them; the rest, being frighted out of their wits, scoured'
thro' the woods, and over the hills, with all the speed'
that sear and nimble feet could help them to do; and'
as we did not trouble ourselvesmuch to-pursue them,,
they got- altogether to the sea-sidei where they landed,
and where their canoes lay. But- their disaster was not-
at an end yet; for- it blew a terrible storm of wind that

them to put off; nay, the storm continuing all night,.
-when the tide came up> their eanoes were most of them
driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore,

ADVENTURES OF ROBIKSON CRUSOE.
they could, they resolved to march to that part of the
island where the savages were fled, and see what posture
they were in. This necessarily led them over the place
-where the fight had been, and where they found several
of the poor creatures not quite dead, and yet past reco-
vering lise-—a light disagreeable enough to generous minds;
for a truly great man, tho' obliged by the law of battle
to destroy his enemy, takes no delight an his misery.
However, there was no need to give any order in this
case; for their own savages who were their servants,
dispatched those poor creatures with their hatchets. -
At length they came in view of the place where the
more miserable remains of the savages' army lay, where
there appeared about 100 still; their posture was gene-
rally fitting upon the ground, with their knees up to-
wards their mouth, and the bead put between the hands,
leaning down upon the knees.
When our men came within two musquet-shot of.
them, the Spaniard governpr ordered two mufquets to-
be fired without ball, to alarm them; this he did, that,
by their countenance, he might know what to expect,.
viz. Whether they were ftill in heart to sight, or were so
heartily beaten, as to- be dispirited and discouraged, and
lb he might manage accordingly.
This stratagem took; for, as soon as the savages heard
the first gun, and &w the flastl of the second, they
started up upon their seet in the greatest consternatiort
imaginable -T and as our men advanced swiftly towards:
them, they all ran sereaming and yawling away, with?
a kind of an howling noise, which our men did not
understand, and had never heard before; and thus they
ran up the hills into the country.
At first, our men had much rather the weather had
been calm, and they had all gone away to sea: but they
did not then consider, that this might probably have been
the occasion of their coming again in such multitudes as
not to be resisted; or, at least, to come so many and so
often, as would quite desolate the island, and starve them:
Will Atkins therefore, who, notwithstanding his wound,
kept always with them, proved the best counsellor in this
case: his advice was, to take the advantage that of-
sered, and clap in between them and their boats j and
so
so deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any-
more to plague the island.
They consulted long about this, and some were against
it, for sear of making the wretches fly into the woods,
and live there desperate; and so they should have them
to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir about their -
business, and have their plantation continually rifled, all
their tame goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced
to a lise of continual distress.
Will Atkins told them, they had better have to do
with 100 men, than with 100 nations ; that as they must
destroy their boats, so they must destroy the men, or be
all of them destroyed themselves*. In a word, he .shewed
them the necessity of it so plainly, that they all came into
it; so they went to work immediately with the boats,
and, getting some dry wood together from a dead tree,
they tried to se£ some of them on, fire; but they were so-
wet that they would scarce burn. However, the fire so
burned the upper part, that it soon made them unsit for
swimming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came running out of
the woods; and, coming as near as they could to our
men, kneeled down and cried, Oa, Oa^ Waramokoa, and
some other words of their language, which none of the
others underttood any thing of;. but as they made pitisul
geitures and stran^? noises, it was easy to understand they
begged to have tneir boats spared, and that they would
be gone, an! never come thither again.
But our men were now satisfied that they had no way
to preserve themselves, or to save their colony, but ef-
sectually to prevent any of these people from ever going
home again; depending upon this, that if ever so much*
as one of them got back into their country to tell the
story, the colony was undone: so that, letting them?
kaow that they should not have any mercy, they sell to-
work with their canoes, and destroyed them every one
that the storm had not destroyed before at the sight o£
which the savages raised a hideous cry in the woodsy....

with them.
Nor
y
93 , XDvrNTURES or robinson crcsox.-
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consi-
der, that while they made those people thus desperate',
they ought to have kept good guard at the .same time
upon their plantations; for though it is true they had
driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not find'
their main retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill, nor
the cave in the valley, yet they found out my plantation
pt the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the
sences and planting about it, trod all the corn underfoot,
tore up the vints and grapes, Ireing just then almost ripe,.
and did our men rm inestimable damage, tho' to them-
selves, not one sarthing's worth of service.
Though our men were able to sight them upon all oc-
casions, yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or
hunt them up and down; for as they were too nimble
of foot for our men when they found them single, Ib our
men durst not go about single, for sear of being surround-
ed with their numbers: the best was, they had no wea-
pons; for tho' they had bows, they had no arrows lest,
nor any materials to make any, nor had'they any edged
tool or weapon among them.
The extremity and distress they were reduced to was
great, and indeed deplorable, but at the same time our
men were also brought to very hard circumstances by
them; for though their retreats were preserved, yet their
provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled; and:
what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they knew
not; the only resuge they had now, was the stock of
cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some little
corn which grew there. The three Englishmen, William:
Atkins, and his comrades, were now reduced to two,.
one of them being killed by an arrow, which struck him
en the side of his head, just under the temples, so that he
Bever spoke more; and it was very remarkable, that this
was the same barbarous sellow who cut the poof savage
stave with his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to
have murdered the Spaniards.
- I looked upon their case to have been worse at this
time than mine was at any time after I first difcoveredl'
the grains of barley and rice, and got into the method'
of planting and railing my corn, and my tame cattle; for
now they had,, as I may say, an hundred wolves upon-
the island, which would devour every thing they could
come at, yet could be very hardly come at themselves.
The sirst thing they concluded* when they saw what
their circumstances were, was, that they would, if pos-
sible, drive them- up to the sarther part of the island,.
south-east, that, if any more savages come on shone, they
might not find one another : then, that they would daily
hunt and harrass them, and kill as many of them as they
could come at, till they had reduced their number, and
if they could at last tame them, and bring them to any
thing, they would give them com, and teach them how
to plant and live upon their daily labour.
In order to this, they followed them, and so terrified
them with their guns, that in a sew days, if any of them.
fired a gun at an Indian,. if he did not hit him!, yet he.
, would sall down for sear ; and so dreadsully frighted they
were, that they kept out of sight sarther and sarther,
till at last our men following them, and every day almost
killing and wounding some of them, they kept up in the
woods and hollow places so. much, that.it reduced them
to the utmost misery for want of food; and many were
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any hurt,.
hut merely starved to death.
When ouv men found this, it mada. their. hearts re-
lent,' and pity moved them; especially the Spaniard
governon, who was the most gentlemani-like^ generous-
minded man that ever I met with in my lise: and lie
proposed, if possible, to take one of. them alive, and
bring him. to understand what they meant, so sar as
to be able to act as interpreter, and to go among them,
and see if they might be brought to some conditions
that might be depended upon to save their lives, and
to do us no spoil. .. s .''
It was some time before any o£ them, could be taken.;
but, being weak and half-starved, one of them.was at last
surprised and made a prisoner;. he wag sullen at first, and
-would neither eat nor drink; but finding himself kindly-
used, and victuals given him, and no violence offered
him, he at last grew tractable, and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often

but would give them a part of the island to live in, pro-
vided they would give satissaction ; that they should keep
in their own bounds, and not come beyond them to in-
jure or prejudice others; and that they should have corn.
given them, to plant and make it grow for their bread,
and some bread given them for their present subsistence;
and old Friday bade the sellow go and talk with the reft
of his countrymen, and see what they laid to it, assuring
them, that if they did not agree immediately, they should
all be destroyed.
The poor wretches thoroughly humbled, and reduced
in number to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal
at the first offer, and begged to have some food given
them; upon which, twelve Spaniards and two English-
men, well armed, and three Indian slaves, and old Friday,
marched to the place where they were, the three Indian
Daves carried them a large quantity of bread, and some
rice boiled up to cakes, and dried in the sun, and three
live goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of
a hill, where they fat down, eat the provisions very
thanksully, and were the most saithful sellows to their
words that could be thought of; for, except when they
came to beg victuals and directions, they never came'out
of their bounds; and there they lived when I came to.
the island, and I went to see them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, m^ke bread,
breed tame goats, and milk them; they wanted nothing
but wives, and they soon would have been a nation i
they were consined to a neck os land, surrounded with
high rocks behind them, and lying plain towards the sea
before them, on the south-east corner of the island : they
had land enough, and it was very good and fruitsul, for
they had a piece of land about a mile and a half broad,
and three or four miles in length.
Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as
I made for myself; and gave among them 12 hatchets,
and three or tour knives; and there they lived the molt
subjected innocent creatures that were ever heard of.
After this, the Colony enjoyed a persect tranquillity,
•with respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them,
which was in about two years; not but that now and
then some canoes of savages came oa shore for their
triumphal
triumphal unnatural seasts; but as they were of several
nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of those that
came before, or the reason of it, they did not make any
search or enquiry after their countrymen; and if they
had, it would have been very hard for them to have
found them out.','. . . •
Thus, I think, I have given a sull account of all that
happened to them, to.my return, at least, that was worth
notice. The Indians, or savages, were wondersully
civilized by them, and they frequently went among
them; but forbid, on pain of defith, any of the Indians
coming to them, because they wtpld not have their set-
tlement betrayed again.
One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they taught
the savages to make wickerwork, or baskets; but they
soon out-did their masters; for they made abundance of
most ingenious things in wicker-work; particularly all
forts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cupboards, &c. as also
chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance of
other things, being very ingenious at such work, when
they were once put in the way of it.
My coming was a particular relief to these people,
because we surnished them with knives, scissars, spades,
shovels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind which they
could want. . -
With the help of these tools they were so very han-
dy, that they came, at last, to build up their huts, or
houses, very handsomely; raddling, or working it up
like basket-work all the way round, which was a very
extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd;
but was an exceeding good sence, as well against heat,
as against all forts of vermin; and our men were so taken
with it, that they got the wild savages to come and do
the like for them; so that when I come to see the two
Englishmen's colonies, they looked, at a distance, as if
they lived all like bees in a hive; and as for Will Atkins,
who was now become a very industrious, necessary, and
sober sellow, he had made himself such a tent of bas-
ket-work, as, I believe, was never seen; it was 120 paces
round on the outside, as I measured by my steps; the
walls were as close-worked as a basket, in pannels ot
squares, thirty-two in number,, and very strong, stand-
ing about 7 seet high; in.5the middle was another not
above 22 paces round, but built stronger, being eight
square in its form,' and. in the eight corners stood eight j
very strong posts, round the top of which he laid strong
pieces, joined together with wooden pins, from which he
railed a pyramid before the roof of eight rafters, very
handsome, I assure you. and joined together very well,
though he had no nails, and only a sew iron spikes,
which he had made himself too out of the old iron that
I had left there; and, indeed, this sellow shewed abun-
dance of ingenuity uj. several things which lie had iso,
knowledge of: he t_.-2.de himself a forge, with a pair of
wooden bellows to blow the fire; he made himself char-
coal for his work, and he formed out of one of the iron:
crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon j: in this
manner he made many things, but especially hooks, sta-
'pies and spikes* bolts and hinges. But to return to the
house: after he pitfihed the roof of his innermost tent,
he worked it up between the rafters with basket-work
so firm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously with
lice-straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, which ce~'
vered the top, that his house was as dry as if it had been
tiled or slated. . Indeed, he owned that the savages made
the basket-work for him. . '•'
The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all round
. this inner apartment, aaad long rafters lay from the 32
angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about
twenty seet distant; so that there was a space like a walk*
within the outer wicker-wall> and without the inner,
near twenty seet wide.
The inner place he partitioned off with the same wick-
er-work, but much sairer, and divided it into six apart-
ments, for that he had six rooms on a floor, and out
of every one of these there was a door; first, into the
entry or coming into the'main tent, and another door
into the space or walk that was round it; so that this
walk was also divided into fix equal parts, which served
not only for a retreat, but to store up any necessaries
which the samily had occasion for. !J$heie six spaces
not taking up the whole circumserence, what other
apartments the outer circle had, were thus ordered: as
soon as you were in at the door of the outer circja,
you Tiad a short passage strait before jr0u to the door of
the inner house; but on either side was a wicker parti-
tron> and a door in it, by which you went, first, into a
large room: or store-house, 20 seet wide, and about 30
seet long, and through that into another not quite so
long; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome
rooms, six of which were only to be come at through
the apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets or
retired rodms to the respective chambers of the inner cir-
cle; and four large warehouses or barns, or what you
please to call them, which .went in through one another,
two on either hand of the passage, that kd through the
outer door to the inner tent,
Such a piece of balket-work, I believe, was never feen
in the world; nor any house or tent so neatly contrived,
much less so built; in this great bee-hive lived the three
samilies, that is to say, Will Atkinfc, and his companion;
the third was killed, but his wise remained with three
children; for she was, it seems, big with child when he
died; and the other-two were not at all backward to give
the widow her sull share of every thing, I me'an, as to
their corn, milk, grapes, &x. and when they killed a kid,
or found a turtle on the shore: so that they all lived well
enough, though it was true, that they were not so indus-
trious as the other two, as has»been already observed.
One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that as
for religion, I don't know that there was any thing of
that kind among them; they pretty often, indeed, put
one another in mind, that there was a God, by the very'
common method of seamen, viz. swearing by his name:
nor were their poor ignorant savage wives much the bet-
ter for having been married to Christians, as we must
call them ; for as they knew very little of God themselves,
so they were utterly incapable of entering into any dis-
course with their wives about a God, or to talk any thing
to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say
the wives had made from them, was, that they had taught
them to speak Englifii pretty well; and all the children
they had, which were near twenty in all, were taught
-to speak English too, from their first learning to speak,
though they at first spoke it in a very broken manner,
like their mothers. There were none of those children
above six years old when I came thither; for it was not
much above seven years that they had setched these five
savage ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitsul,
for they had all children, more or less: I think the
cook's mate wise was big of her sixth child; and the
mothers were all a good fort of well-governed, quiet,
laborious women, modest and decent, helpsul to one ano-
ther, mighty observant and subject to their masters, I
cannot call them husbands, and wanted nothing but to
be well instructed in the Christian religion, and to be
legally married; both which were happily brought about
afterwards by my means, or, at least, by the consequence
of my coming among them. <.
Having thus given an account of the colony in gene-
ral, and pretty much of my five runagade Englishmen, I
must say something of the Spaniards, who were the
main body of the samily; and in whose story there are
some incidents also remarkable enough.
I had a great many discourses with them about their
circumstances, when they were among the savages; they
told me readily, that they had no instances to give of
their application or ingenuity in that country; that they
were a poor miserable dejected handsul of people; that
if means had been put into their hands, they had yet so
abandoned themselves to despair, and so sunk under the
weight of their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing
but starving: one of them, a grave and very sensible
man, told me, he was convinced they were in the wrong;
that it was not the part of wise men to give up them-
selves to their misery, but always to take hold of the
helps which reason offered, as well for present support,
as for suture deliverance; he told me, that grief was
the most senseless insignificant passion in the world; for
that it regarded only things past, which were generally
impossible to be recalled or to be remedied, but had no
view to things to come, and had no share in any thing
that looked like deliverance, but rather added to' the
afssiction than proposed a remedy; and upon this, he
repeated a Spanish proverb; which, tho' I cannot repeat
in just the lame words that he spoke it, yet 1 remember
1 made it into an English proverb of my own, thus:
In trouble to be troubled.
Is lo have your trouble doubled.
He ran on them in remarks upon all the little improve-
ments I had made in n,y solitude; my unwearied appli-
cation, as he called it, and how I had made a condition,
-which, in its circumstance, was at first much worse than
theirs, a thousand times more happy than theirs was,
even now, when they were altogether: he told me, it
was remarkable, that Englishmen had a greater presence
of mind, in their distress, tb,an any people that ever he
met with; that their unhappy nation, and the Portu-
guese, were the worst men in the world to struggle with
misfortunes; for that their first step in danger, after com-
mon efforts are over, was always to despair, lie down
under it and die, without routing their thoughts up to
proper remedies for escape.
1 told him their cale and mine differed exceedingly;
that they were cast upon the shore without necessaries,
without supply of food, or of present sustenance, till
they could provide it: that it is true, I had this dis-
advantage and discomfort, that I was alone; but then
the supplies 1 had providentially thrown into my hands,
by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore, was
such a help as would have encouraged any creature in
the world to have applied himself as 1 had done:
Seignior, says the Spaniard, had we poor Spaniaids
been in your case, we should never have gotten half
those things out of the ship as you did: nay, says he,
we should never have found means to have gotten a
raft to carry them, or to have gotten a raft on shoie
-without boat or sail; and how much lels should we
have done, said he, if any of us had been alone! Well,
1 desired him to abate his compliment, and go on with
the history of their coming on shore, where they land-
ed: he told me, they unhappily landed at a place
-where. there were people without provisions; whereas,
bad they had the common sense to have put off to sea
again, and gone to another island a little sarther, they
had found provisions, though without people; there
being an island that way, as they had been told, where
there
there were provisions, though no people; that is to sayy
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there,
and filled the island with goats and hogs at several times;
where they have bred in such multitudes, and where
turtle and sea-fowls where in fifch plenty, that they
•could have been in no want of flesh, though they had
found no bread; whereas here they were only sus-
tained with a sew roots and herbs, which they under-
stood aot, and which had no substance in them, and
which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough, and
who could treat them no better, unless they would turn
canibals, and eat men's flesh, which was the great dain-
ty of the country.
They gave me an account how many ways they
strove to civilize the savages they were with, and to
teach them rational customs in the ordinary way of liv-
ing, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon them,
as unjust, that they, who .came thither for assistance and
support, should attempt to set up for instructors of those
that gave them bread; intimating, it seems, that none
should set up for the instructors of others but those
who could live without them.
They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they
were driven to; how sometimes they were many days
without any food at all, the island they were upon being
inhabited by a fort of savages that lived more indolent>
and,' for that reason, were less supplied with the neces-
saries of lise, than they had reason to believe others were
in the same part of the world; and yet they found that
these savages were less ravenous and voracious, than those
who had better supplies of food.
Also they added, that they could not but see with
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness, the go-
verning Providence of God directs the events of things in
the world; which, they said, appeared in their circum- ,
itances; for, if pressed by the hardships they were under,
and the barrenness of the country where they were, they
had searched aster a better place to live in, they had then
been/iut of the way of the relief that happened to them
by my means.
Then they gave me an account, how the savages,
whom they lived among, expected them to go cut with
them
'them into their wars: and it was true that,, as they had
fire-amis with them, had they not ha 1 the disaster to lose'
their ammunition, they should not have been serviceable
only to their friends, but have made themselves terrible
both to friends and enemies; but bemg without powder
and shot, and yet in a condition, that they could not in
reason deny to go out with their landlords to their wars;
when they came in the sield of battle, they were in a
worse condition than the savages themselves; for they:
neither had bows nor arrows, nor could they use those
the savages gave them; so that they could do nothing
but stand still, and be wounded with arrows, till they
came up to the teeth of their enemy; and thn, indeed,
the three halberts they had, were of use to them, and
they would often drive a whole little army before them
with those halberts and sharpened sticks put into the
muzzles of their muskets: but that for all this they were
sometimes surrounded with multitudes, and in great dan-
ger from their arrows; till at last they found the way to
make themselves large targets of wood, which they co-
hered with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew
not; and these covered them from the arrows of the sa-
vages; that, notwithstanding these, they were sometimes
in great danger, and were once five of them knocked
down together with the clubs of the savages, which was
. the time when one of them was taken prisoner; that is to
say, the Spaniard, whom I had relieved: that at first they
thought he had been killed, but when afterwards they
heard he was taken prisoner, they were under the greatett
grief imaginable, and would willingly have all yentured
their lives to have rescued him. • -
They told me, that when they were so knocked down,
the rest of their company rescued them, and stood over
them, fighting till they were come to themselves, all but
he who they thought had been dead; and then they
made their way with their halberts and pieces, standing
-close together in a line, through a body of above a thou-
sand savages, beating down all that came in their way,
got the victory over their enemies, but to their great
sorrow, because it was the loss of their friend; whom
the other party, finding him alive, carried off'with some
others, as I gave an account in my former,
vol, 'h. £ they
%
'i They described most affectionately, how they werev
surprised with joy at the return of their friend and
companion in misery, who they thought had been de-
voured by wild beasts of the worst kind, v'n. by wild
men'; and, yet how more and more they were surprised
with the account he gave them of his errand, and that
there was a Christian in a place near, much more one
that. was able, and had humanity enough to contribute.
to their deliverance.
They described how they were astonished at the sight
of the relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves
of bread, things they had not seen since their coming: to
that miserable place; how often they crossed it, and
blessed it as bread sent from heaven; and what a reviv-
ing cordial it was ta-their spirits to taste it; as also of
the other things I had sent for their supply. And, after
all, they would have told me something of the ioy they
were in, at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them
away to the person and place, from whence all these new
comforts came; but they told me, it was impossible to
express it by words; for their excessive joy driving them
to unbecoming extravagancies, they had no way to
describe them, but by telling me, that they bordered
upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their pas-
sion, suitable to the sense that was upon them ;• that, in
some it worked one way, and in some another; and that
some of them, through a surprise of joy, would burst
out into tears; others be half-mad, and others immedi-
ately saint. This discourse extremely affected me, and
called to my mind Friday's extacy, when he met his
sather, and the poor people's extacy, when I took them
up at sea, after their ship was on sire; the mate of the
ship's joy, when he found himself delivered in the place,
-where he expected to perish; and my own joy, when,
after twenty-eight years captivity, I found a good ship
ready to carry me to my own country: all these things
made me more sensible of the relation of these poor men,
and more affected with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things,
'as I found them, 1 must relate the heads of what I did
for these people, and the condition in which I left them.
It was their opinion, and mine too, that they would be
1' troubled
trembled no more with the savages; or that, if they
were, they would be able to cut them osf', if they were
twice as many as before; so that they had no concern
about that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with
the Spaniard, whom I called governor, about their stay
in the island; for, as I was not come to carry any of
tHein off, so it would not be just to carry osf some, and
leave others, who perhaps would be unwilling to stay,
if their strength .was diminished.
On the other hand, 1 told them, I came to establish
them there, not to remove them; and then I let them
know, that I had brought with me relief of sundry kinds
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRtJSOE. 50
them with all things necessary; as well for their conve-
nience, as their desence; and that I had such parti-
cular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit
their number, as by the particular necessary employ-
ments which they were bred to, being artificers, to
assist them in those things, in which, at present, they
were to seek.
They were all together when I talked thus to them;
and before 1 delivered to them the stores I had brought, I
asked them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot and
buried the first animosities that had been among them,
and could make hands with one another, and engage in
a strict: friendship, and union of interest, so that there
might be no more misunderstandings or jealousies.
William Atkins, with abundance of frankness and
good humour, said, they had met with afflictions enough
to make them all sober, and enemies enough to make
them all friends , that, for his part, he would live and
• die with them; ahd was so sar from designing any thing .
against the Spaniards, that, he owned, they had done
nothing to him but what his own bad humour made
necessary, and what he would have done, and, perhaps,
much worse, in their case; and that he would ask them
pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things
he had done to them; and was very willing and defi»
rous of liyifig in terms of entire friendship and union
-with them; and would do any thing that lay in his
power to convince them of it; and as' for going.to Eng-
land, he: cared not if he did not go thither these
twenty years.
ES The
The Spaniards :said, they had, indeed, at first, dis-'
armed and excluded William Atkins, and his two coun-
trymen for their ill conduct, as they had let me know;
and they appealed to me for the necessity they were
under to do so; but that William Atkins had behaved
himself so bravely in the great sight they had with the
savages, and on several occasions since, and had shewed
himself sti saithsul to, • and concerned for the general in-
terest of them all, that they had forgotten all that was
•past; and thought he merited as much to be trusted with
arms, and supplied with necessaries, as any of them;
and that they had testified their satissaction in him, by
-committing the command to him, next to the governor
'himself; and as they had an entire considence in him,
and all his countrymen, lo they acknowledged, they
had merited that considence, by all the rnethods that
honest men could merit to be valued and trutled; and
they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving me
this assurance, that they would never have any interest
ftparate from one another. . .
Upon these frank and open declarations of friend-
ship, we appointed the next day to dine all together:
and, indeed, we made a splendid seast: 1 caused the
ihip's cook, and his mate to come on thore, and dress
our dinner; and the old cook's mate we had on shore
assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of good beef,
and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provision,
with our punch bowl, and materials to fill it; and, in
particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret,
and ten bottles of English beer; things that neither the
Spaniards or the Englishmen had tasted for many years;
and which it may be supposed, they were exceeding
glad of.
The Spaniards added to our seast five wh6le kids,
-which the cook's roasted; and three of them were sent
covered up close on board our ship to the seamen, that
they might feast on fresh meat from on shore, as we did
with their salt meat from on board.
After this seast, at which we were very innocently
merry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, that
there might be no dispute about dividing, I shewed them
there was sufficient for them all; and desired, that they
might
ni'ght all take an equal quantity of the goods that were
for wearing; that is tasav, equal when made up. A*
first, I distributed linen sufficient to make everyone of
them four shirts;' and, at the Spaniard's request, after-
wards made them up fix; these were exceedingly comfort-
able to them, having been what, as I may sa)r, they had
long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them.
1 allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned?
before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock,
which I judged sittest for the heat of the season, cool and
loose; and ordered that, whenever they decayed, they
should make more, as they thought fit: the like for
pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, &e.
I cannot express what pleasure, what satissaction, sat
upon the countenances of all these poor men, when they
saw the care I had taken of them, and how well 1 had
surnished them : they told me that I was a sather to them;
and that, having such a correspondent as I was, in so re-
mote a part of the world, it would make them forget
that they were left in- a desolate place: a-nd they all vo-
luntarily engaged to me, not to leave the place without
my consent.
Then I presented to them the people I had brought with:
me; particularly the taylor, the smith, and the two car-
penters, all of them most necessary people; but, above
all, my general artificer, than whom they could not name
any thing that was more needsul to them ; and the taylor,
to shew his concern for them, went to work immediately,
and, with my leave, made them everyone a shirt the first
thing he did; and, which was still. more, he taught the
women not only how to sew and stitch, and use the nee-
dle, but made them assist to make the shirts for their huf-
bands, and for all the rest.
As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention how use-
sul they were, for they took in pieces all my clumsy un-
handy things, and made them clever convenient tablesy
stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, and every
thing they wanted of that kind.
But, to let them see how nature made artificers at first,
I carried the carpenters to see William Atkins's basket-
house, as 1 called it; and they both owned, they never
saw au instance of such natural ingenuity before; nor
E 3 . an/
any thing so regular, and so handily built, at least o£
its kind: and one of them, when he saw it, after mu-
ling a good while, turning about to me, I am sure, says
he, that man has no need of us; you need do nothing
but give him tools.
Then I brought them out all my store of tools^and
gave every man a digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake,
tor we had no harrows or ploughs; and to every separate
place, a pick-axe, a ciow, a broad-axe, and a saw; al-
ways appointing that as often as any were broken, or
worn out, they should be supplied, without grudging,
out of the general<stores that 1 left behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives, fcis-
sers,. and all forts of tools, and iron-work, they had
without tale, as they required; so* no man would care.
to take more than he wanted; and he must be a fool that
would waste or spoil them, on any account whatsoever:
and, for the use of the smith, 1 left two tons of unwrought
iron for a supply.
My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought
them, was such, even to prosusion, that they could not
but rejoice at them; for now they could march as 1 used
to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, if there was
occasion; and were able to sight 1000 savages, if they
had but some little advantages of situation; which also
they could not miss of, if they had occasion.
1 carried on shore with me the young man whose
mother was starved to death, and the maid also; she was
a sober, well educated, religious young woman, and be-
haved so inoffensively, that every one gave her a good
word: she had, indeed, an unhappy lise with us, there
being no woman in the ship but herself; but she bore it .
with patience. After a while, seeing things so well
ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my
island, and considering that they had neither business nor
* acquaintance in the East Indies, nor reason for taking so
long a voyage; 1 say, considering all this, both of them
came to me, and desired I would give. them leave to re-
main on the island, and be entered among my samily, as
they called it.
1 agreed to it readily; and they had a little plot os
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or
. , , houses.
houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, palKsadoed
like Atkins's, and adjoining to his plantation ; their tents
-were contrived so, that they had each of them a'room.
apart to lodge in, and a middle tent, like a great store-
houses to lay all their goods ,in, and to eat and drink in.
And now the other two Englishmen removed their habi-
tation to the same place; and so the island was divided
into three colonies, and no more, viz. the Spaniards with
old Friday, and the first servants, at my old habitation
under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city,
and where they had so enlarged and extended their works,
as well under, as on the outside of the hill, that they
lived, tho' persectiy concealed, yet sull at large. Never
was there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I be-
lieve, in any part of the world: for, I verilf believe,
1000 men might have ranged the island a month, and,
if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked
on purpose for it, they would not have found it; for the
trees stood so thick, and so close, and grew so sast matted
into one another, that nothing but cutting them down
first, could discover the place; except the two narrow
entrances where they went in and out, could be found,
which was not very easy: one of them was just downat
the water's edge, on the side of the creek, and . it was
afterwards above 200 yards to the place; and the other
was up the ladder at twice, as I have already formerly
described it; and they had a large wood, thick planted,
also, on the top of the hill, which contained above an
acre, which grew apace, and covered the place from all
discovery there, with only one narrow place between two
trees, not easy to be discovered, to enter on that side.
The other colony was that of Will. Atkins's, where
there were four samilies of Englishmen, I mean thole I
had left there, with their wives and children; three
savages, that were slaves; the widow and children of the
Englishman that was killed; the young man and the
maid, and, by the way, we made a wise of her also,
before we went away: there were also the two carpen-
ters and the taylor, who I brought with me for them:
also the smith, who was a very neceflary man to- them,
specially as the gunsmith, to take care of their arms;
and my other man, whom I called Jack of all trades;
Z 4 who
who was himself as good almost as twenty men, for he
was not only a very ingenious sellow, bat a very merry
sellow; and, before I went away, we married him to-
the honest maid that came witfi the youth in the ship;
whom I mentioned before.
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally
to say something of the French ecclesiastic, that I had
brought with me out of the ship's crew, whom 1 took
at sea. It is true, this man was a Roman, and perhaps;.
it may give ossence to some hereafter, if I leave any thing
extraordinary upon record, of a man, whom, before I
begin, 1 mult (to set him out in just colours) represent in
terms very much to his disadvantage, in the account of
Protestants; as first, that he was a Papist; secondly, a
Popish, Priest ; and thirdly, a French Popish Priest.
But justice demands os-me to give him a due charac-
ter; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious, and
molt religious person; exact in his lise, extensive in his
charity, and exemplary in almost every thing he did:
What, then, Can any one say, against my being very
sensible of the value of such a man, notwithstanding his
prosession? Though it may be my opinion, perhaps,
as well as the opinion of others who shall read this,.
that he was mistaken.
The first hour that I began to converse with him,.
after he had agreed to go with me to the East Indies,.
I found reason to delight exceedingly in his conversation:
and he first benjan with me about religion, in the most
obliging manner imaginable.
Sir, says he, you have not only, under God (and at
that he crossed his breast) saved my lise, but you have
admitted me to go this voyage in your ship, end, by
your obliging civility, have taken me into your samily,
giving me an opportunity of free conversation r Now,
Sir, says he, you see by my habit, what my prosession
is; and I guess by your nation, what your's is: I may
think it is my duty, and, doubtless, it is so, to use my
utmost endeavours, on all occasions, to bring all the
fouls that I can to the knowledge of the truth, and to
embrace the Catholic doctrine; but, as I am here under
your permission, and in your samily, I am bound in jus-
tice to your kindness, as well as in decency and good
manners,.
manners to be under your government; and therefore,
I (hall not, without your leave,. enter into any debates on-
the points of religion, in which we may not agree, sar-
ther than you shall give me leave.
I told him his carriage was so modest, that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were
such people as they call heretics; but, that he was not
. the first Catholic that I had conversed with, without
salling into any inconveniencies, or carrying the ques-
tions to any height in debate; that he should not find^
himself the worse used for being of a disserent opinion
from us; and if we did not converse without any dis-
like on either side, upon that score; it would be hi9
sault, not ours.
He replied, that he thought onr conversation mighfe
be easily separated from. disputes; that it was not his.
business to cap principles with every man he discoursed.
with •» and that he rather'desired me to converse with
him as a gentleman, than as a religieux;. that-if I would
give him leave, at any time, to discourse upon religious
subjects, he would readily comply with it; and that
then he did not doubt but I would allow him also to
desend hisown opinions, as well as he could; but that,
•without- my leave, he would not break in upon me with,
any such thing,
He told me sarther, that he would' not cease to-do all
that became him in his office, as a priest, as well as a
private Christian,. to procure the good of the ship, and
the sasety. of all that was in her: and though, perhaps,
we would not join with him, and he could not pray with,
us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do-
upon all occasions. In this manner we conversed; and,-
as he was of a most obliging gentleman-like behaviour,
so he was, if I. rnay be allowed to say so, a man.of good
sense, and, as I believe, of great learning.
lie gave me a most diverting account of his lise,
and'of the many extraordinary events of it ;- of many
adventures which had besallen him in. the sew years
that he had been abroad in the world, and particu-
lar!)' this was very remarkable, viz. that during the voy-
age he was now engaged in, he had the missortune to
be five times shipped and unshipped, and uever to go
to the place whither any of the ships he was in were at
first designed: that his first intent was to have gone to
Martinico; and that he went on board a ship bound
thither, at St. Maloes; but being forced into Lisbon in
bad weather, the ship received some damage, by running
aground in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was obli-
ged to unload her cargo there: that finding a Portuguese
£hip there, bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail, 'and
supposing he should easily meet with a vessel there, bound
to Martinico, he went on board, in order to sail to the'
Madeiras; but the Master of the Portuguese ship being
but an indifferent mariner, had been out in his reckon-
ing, and they drove to Fial; where, however, he hap-
pened to sind a very good market for his cargo, which
-was corn; and therefore resolved not to go to the Ma-
deiras, but to load salt at the Isle of May, to go away to
Newfoundland: he had no remedy in the exigence, but
to go with the ship; and had a pretty good voyage
as sar as the Banks, so they call the place where they
catch the fish, where meeting with a French ship bound
from France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and from
thence to Martinico, to carry provisions, he thought he
should have an opportunity to complete his first design:
but when he came to Quebec, the master of the ship died,
and the ship proceeded no sarther: so the next voyage he
shipped himself for France, in the ship that was burnt,
when we took them up at sea, and then shipped them
with us for the East Indies, as I have already said. Thus
he had been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may
call it, in one voyage, besides what I shall have occasion
io mention sarther of the same person.
But I stall not make digressions into other men's
stories, which have no relation to my own. I return
to what concerns our affair in the island: he came to
me one morning, for he lodged among us all the while
we were upon the island; and it happened to be just
•when I was going to visit the Englishmen's colony, at.
the sarthest part of the island; I say, he came to me,.
and told me, with a very grave countenance, that he
had, for two or three days, desired an opportunity of
some discourse with me, which, he hoped, would not
be displeasing to me, because he thought it might, in
4 some
some measure, correspond with my general design, which
was the prosperity of my new colony; and, perhaps,
might put it, at least, more than he yet thought it was,
in the way'of God's blessing.
I looked a little surprised at the last part of his dis-
course; and turning a litde short, how Sir, said 1, can
it be said, that we are not in the way of God's blessing,
after such visible assistance, and wondersul deliverances,
as we have seen here, and of which 1 have given vou
;a large account?
If you had pleased, Sir, said he, (with a world of
modesty, and yet with great readiness) to have heard me,
you would have found no room to have been displeased,
much less to think so hard of me, that I should suggest,
that you have not had wondersul assistances and delive-
rances; and, I hope, on your behalf, that you are in the
way of God's blessing', and your design is exceeding good,
and will prosper. But, Sir, said he, though it were
more so, than is even possible to you, yet there may be
some among you, that are not equally right in their
actions: and you know, that in the story of Israel, one
Achan, in the ca-mp, removed God's blessing from them,
and turned his hand so against them, that thirty-six of
them, though not concerned in the crime, where the
objects of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that
punishment.
I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told
him' his inserence was lb just, and the whole design seem-
ed so sincere, and was really so religious in its own na-
ture, that I was very sorry I had interrupted him; and
begged him to go on: and, in the mean time, because it
seemed, that -what we had both to say, might take up
some time, I told him, I was going to the Englishman s
plantation, and asked him to go with me, and we might
discourse of it by the way; he told me, he would more
willingly wait on me thither, because there partly the
thing was acted, which he desired to speak to me about:
so we walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain
with me in what he had to say.
Why then, Sir, says he, be pleased to give me leave
to lay down a sew propositions, as the foundation of
what I have to say, that we may not differ in the ge-
£ 6 neral
neral principles, tho' we may be of some dissering opi-
nions in the practice of particulars. First, Sir, though-
we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion, ami
it is very unhappy that it is so, especially in the cafe
'before us, as I shall shew' afterwards; yet, there are
some general principles in which we both agree, viz.
First, that there is a God; and that this God, having
given us some stated general rules for our service and obe-
diewce, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend
him, either by neglecting to do what he has commanded,-
or by doing what he has expressly forbidden; and let
our different religions be what they will, this general
principle is readily owned by us all—that the blessing
of God does not ordinarily follow a presumptuous fin-
ning against' his command: and every good Christian
will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that are
under his care living in a total neglect of God and his
commands, ft is not your men being protestants, what-
ever my opinion may be of such, that discharges me
from being concerned- for their fouls, and from endea-
vouring, if it lies before me, that they should live in as
little distance from, and enmity with- their Maker as
possible; especially, if you give me leave to meddle so
sar in your circuit. ,
I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and tohl
him, I granted all he said, and thanked him, that he
would so sar concern himself for us; and begged he
would explain the particulars, of what he had observed,
that, like Joshira, (to take his own parable). I might put
away the accursed thing from-us. ,
Why then, Sir, says he, I will take the liberty you
give me; and there are three things, which, if I am
right, must stand in the way of God's blessing-upon
your endeavours here, and' which I- should rejoice, for
your sake, and their own, to see removed/ And, Sir,
fays he, I promise myself, that you will sully agree with.
me in them all, as soon as I name them; especially,
because I shalt. convince you, that every one of them.
may, with great ease, and very much to your satissac-
tion, be remedied. .
He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities,
hut went on: First, Sir> says he, you have here soar
Englishmen^.
s
Englishmen, who have setched women from among the
savages, and have taken them as their wives, and have
had many children- by. them all, and yet are not married
to them after any stated legal manner, as the laws of
God and man require; and therefore are yet,.in the sense
of bpth, no less than adulterers, and living in adultery.
To this, Sir, says he, I know. you-will object, that thece
was no clergyman, or priest of any kind, or of any
prosession, to persorm- the ceremony; nor any pen and
ink, or paper, to write down a contract of marriage,.
and have it signed between them. And I know also,.
Sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you; I mean
of the agreement that he obliged them. to make when
they took these women, viz. that they should chuse them
out by consent, and keep separately to them; which, hy
the way, is nothing of a marriage, no agreement with
the women as wives, but only an agreement among
themselves^ to-keep-them- from quarrelling.
But, Sir, the elsenGe of the sacrament of matrimony
(so he called it, being a Roman), consists not onlvinthe
mutual consent of the parties to take one another as man
and wise, but in-the formal and legal obligation that
there is in the. contract, to compel the man: and.woman,
at all times, to own and acknowledge each.other \. oblig-
ing the man tq abstain from all other women, to engage
in no other contract while these subsist; and on all occa-
sions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for them and
their children; andtooblige the women to do the same,
or like conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their side.
Now, Sir, says he, these men may, when they please,
or when occasion presents, abandon these women, dis-
own their children, leave them to perish, and take other
women and marry them whilst these are living. And
here he added, with some warmth, How, Sir, is God
honoured in this unlawsul liberty? And how shalL a
blessing succeed your endeavours in- this place, however
good in themselves, and however sincere in your design,
while these men, who at present are your subjects, under
your absolute government and dominion, are allowed by
you to live in open adultery?
I consess, I was struck at thd thing itself, but much
more with the Convincing arguments he supported it
with
with; for it was certainly true, that though they had no
clergyman on the spot, yet a formal contract on both
sides, made before witnesses, and confirmed by any token,
which they had all agreed to be bound by, though it had
been but the breaking a stick between them, engaging
the men to own these women for their wives upon all
occasions, and never to abandon them or their children,
and the women to the same with their husbands, had been
an effectual lawsul marriage in the sight of God; and it
was a .great neglect that it was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off with my young priest,
by telling him, that all that part was done when 1 was
not here; and they had lived 'fo many years with them
now, that if it was an adultery, it was past remedy ;' they
could do nothing in it now.
Sir, says he, asking your pardon for such freedom,
you are right in this; that it being done in your absence,
you could not be charged with that part of the crime.
But, I beseech you, flatter not yourself, that you are not
therefore under an obligation to do your uttermost now
to put an end to it: how can you think, but that, let
the time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt for the
suture will lie entirely upon you; because it is certainly
in your power now to put an end to it; and in nobody's
power but your's.
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right; but I
imagined, that, by putting an end to it, he meant that I
should part them, and not suffer them to live together
any longer; and I said to him, I could not do that by
any means, for that it would put the whole island in con-
fusion. He seemed surprised that I should so sar mistake
him. No, Sir, says he, I do not mean that you should
feparate them, but legally and effectually marry them
now. And, Sir, as my way of marrying may not be so
easy to teconcile them to, though it will be as efsectual,
even by your own laws, so your way may be as well be-
fore God, and as valid among men; I mean by a written
contract, signed by both man and woman, and by all the
witnesses present; which all the laws of Europe would
«ecree to be valid.
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so rauch
sincerity. of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his
discourse,
discourse, as to his own party or church: and such a true?
vjarmth for the preserving people that he had no know-
ledge of, or relation td: I say, for preserving them from
transgressing the laws of God, the like of which I had,
indeed, not met with any where. But recollecting what
he had said, of marrying them by a written contract,
which I knew would stand too, I returned it back upon
him, and told him, I granted all that he had said to be
just, and, on his part, very kind: that I would discourse
with the men upon the point now, when I came to them.
And I knew no reason why they should scruple to let
him marry them all; which I knew well enough would
be granted to be as authentic and valid in England, as
if they were married by one of our own clergymen.—
What was afrerwards done in this matter, I shall speak
of by itself.
I then pressed him to tell me what was the second com-
plaint which he had to make; acknowledging that I was
very much his debtor for the first, and thanked him
heartily for it, He told me he would use the same free-
dom and plainness in the second, and hoped I would
take it as well: and this was, that, notwithstanding these
English subjects of mine, as he called them, had lived
with these women for almost seven years, and had taught
them to speak English, and even to read it; and that
they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable under-
standing, and capable of instruction; yet they had not
to this hour taught them any thing of the Christian reli-
gion; no, not so much as to know that there was a God,
or a worship, or in what manner God was to be served;
or that their own idolatry, and worshipping they knew
not who, was salse and absurd.
This, he said, was' an unaccountable neglect, and
what God would certainly call them to an account for;
and, perhaps, at last take the work out of their hands.
He spoke this very affectionately-and warmly. I am per-
suaded, says he, had those men lived in the savage coun-
try, whence their wives came, the savages would have
taken more pains to have brought them to be idolaters,
and to worship the devil, than any of these men, so sar
as I can see, has taken with them, to teach them the
iaowletlge of the true God. Now, Sir, said he, though I
do not acknowledge your religion, or yoirmine, yet we'
flvould be all glad to see the devil's servants, and the sub-
jects of his kingdom, taught to know the general prin-
ciples of the Christian religion; that they might at least
hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of a Resurrection,
and of a suture state, things which we all believe; they
hid, at least, been so much nearer coming into the bolbm
of the true church, than the) are now in the public pro-
fession of idolatry and devil-worship.
I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms, and
embraced him with an excess of passion :- How sar, said
1 to him, have I-been from understand:ng the most essen-
tial part of a Christian, viz. to love the interest os the
Christian church, and the good of other men's fouls. I
scarce have known what belongs t6 being a Christian.
O Sir, do not say so, replied he; this thing is not your
sault. No! laid 1, but why did I never lay it to heart
as well as you? It is not too late yet, said he; be not
too forward to condemn yourself. But what can be done
now? said I; you sec I am going away. Will you give
me leave, said he, to talk with these poor men about it?
Yes, with all my heart, said I, and will oblige them to
give heed to what you say too. As to that, said he, we
must leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is our
business to assist them, encourage them,and instruct them:
and if you willgive me leave, and God his blessing, I do
not doubt but the poor ignorant fouls shall be brought
home into the great circle of Christianity, if not into the
particular saith that we all embrace, and that even while
we stay here. Upon this, I said, I shall not only give
you leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it. What
followed on this account 1 shail mention-also again in its
place.
I now pressed him for the third article in which we
were to blame. Why really, says he, it is of the same
nature, and I will proceed (asking your leave) with the
same plainness as before: it is about your poor savages
yonder, who are, as I may say, your conquered subjects,
it is a maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be received
among all ( hristians, of what church, or pretended
church soever; viz..that Christian knowledge ought to
be propagated by all po£ible means, and on all possible
occasions,
occasions. It is on this principle that our church. sends
missionaries into Persia, India, and China; and that our
clergy, even of the superior fort, willingly engage in
the most hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous
residence, among murderers and barbarians, to teach
them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them
over to embrace the Christian saith. Now, Sir, you
have an opportunity here to have six or seven and
thirty poor savages brought over from idolatry to the
knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that
I wonder how you can pass such an ocsasion of doing
good, which is really worth the expence of a man's
whole lise.
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word
to say: I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for
God aiid religion before me, let his particular principles
be of what kind soever. As for me, I had not so much
as entertained a thought of this - in my heart before;
and, I believe, should not have thought of it; for I
looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom,
had we any work for them to do, we would have used
as such, or would have been glad to have transported
them to any other part of the world; for our business
was to get rid of them; and we would all have been sa-
tisfied, if they had been sent to any country, so they had
never seen their own. But to the case: I say I was
confounded at his discourse, and knew not what answer
to make. He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some
disorder: Sir, said he, I shall be very sorry if what
I have said gives you any offence. No, no, said I, I am
offended with nobody but myself; but I am persectly
confounded, not only to think, that I should never take
any notice of this before, but with reflecting what notice
I am able to take of it now. You know, Sir, said I,
what circumstances I am in;. I am bound to the East-
Indies, in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom,
it would be an insufferable piece of injustice to detain
their ship here, the men lying all this while at victuals
and wages upon the owner's account: it is true, I
agreed to be allowed twelve days here; and if I stay
more, I must pay 31. sterling per diem demurrage; nor
can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more; and
1 have
1 have been here thirteen days already; so that I am
persectly unable to engage in this work, unless I would
susfer myself to be left behind here again; in which
case, if this single ship should miscarry in any part of her
voyage, I should be just in the same condition that 1 was
left in here at first; and from which I have been so won-
dersully delivered.
He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my
voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience, whether
the blessing of saving seven and thirty souls, was not worth
my venturing all I had in the world for? I was not so
sensible of that as he was; and I returned upon him thus:
Why, Sir, it is a valuable thing indeed, to be an instru-
ment, in God's hand, to convert seven and thirty hea-
thens to the knowledge of Christ; but as you are aa
ecclesiastic, and are given over to that work, so that it
seems naturally to sall into the way of your prosession,
how is it then, that you do not rather offer yourself to,
undertake it, than press me to do it?
Upon this he saced about, just before me, as he
walked along, and putting me to a full stop, made me a
very low bow: I most heartily thank God, and you, Sir,
says he, for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a
work; and if you think yourself discharged from it,
arid desire me to undertake it, 1 will most readily do it,
and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and
difficulties of such a broken disappointed voyage as I
have met with, that I have dropt at last into so glorious
a work.
1 discovered a kind of rapture in his sace, while he
spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like fire, his sace
glowed, and his colour came and went, as if he had
been salling into fits: in a word, he was fired with the
joy of being embarked in such a work. 1 paused a con-
siderable while before I could tell what to say to him;
for I was really surprised to find a man of such sincerity
and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond the ordi-
nary rate of men, not out of his prosession only, but even,
of any prosession whatsoever: but after I had considered
it awhile, 1 asked him seriously if he was in earnest,
and that he would venture on the single consideration
of an attempt on those poor people, to be locked up in
aa
an implanted island, for, perhaps, his lise; and at last
might not know whether he should be able to do them
. any good or not.
He turned short upon me, and asked me what T called
a. venture: Pray, Sir, said he, what do you think 1 con-
sented to go in your ship to the East Indies for r' Nay,
said I, that I know not, unless it was to preach to the
Indians. Doubtless it was, said he: and do you think,
if I can convert these seven and thirty men to the saith
ef Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should never
be fetched off the island again? Nay, is it not insinitely
of more worth to save so many souls, than my lise is,
or the lise of twenty more of the same prosession? Yes,
Sir, says he, I would give Christ and the bMelled Virgin
thanks all my days, if 1 could be made the least happy
instrument of saving the souls of these poor men, though
I was never to let my foot off this island, or see my na-
tive country any more. But since you will honour me,
says he, with' putting me into this work (for which I
will pray for you all the days of my lise), I have one
humble petition to you, says he, besides. What is that?
said I. Why, says he, it is, that you will leave your man
Friday with me to be my interpreter to them, and to assist
me; for, without some help, 1 cannot speak to them, or
they to me.
1 was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, because
I could not think of parting with him, and that for many
Teasons; he had been the companion of my travels; he
was not only saithsul to me, but sincerely affectionate to
the last degree; and I had resolved to do something con-
siderable for him, if he outlived me, as it was probable he
would: then I knew, that as I had bred Friday up to be
a protestant, it would quite confound him, to bring him
to embrace another prosession; and he would never,
while his eyes were open, believe that his old master was
an heretic, and would be damned; and this might in the
end ruin the poor sellow's principles, and so turn him
back again to his original idolatry.
However, a sudden thought relieved me in this
strait, and it was this: I told him I could not say
that I was willing to part with Friday on any account
whatever; though a work, that to him was of more.

value than his sise, ought to me to be of much more
value than the keeping or parting with a servant. But,
on the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would
by no means consent to part with me; and then to
force him to it, without his consent, would be a mani-
sest injustice; because I had promised I would never
put him away; and he had promised and engaged
to me, that he would never leave me, unless I put him
away.
He seemed very much concerned at it; for he had no
rational access to these poor people, seeing he did not
understand one word of their language, nor they one
word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him
Friday's Father had learned Spanish, which I found he
also understood, and he should serve him for am interpre-
ter; so he was much better satisfied, and nothing could
persuade him but he would stay to endeavour to convert
fhem; but Providence gave another and very happy turn
to all this.
I come back now to the first part of his objections.
When we came to the Englishmen, 1 sent for them all
together; and after some accounts given them of what
I bad done for them, viz. what necessary things I had
provided for them, and how they were distributed;
which they were sensible of, and very thanksul for; I
began to talk to them of the scandalous lise they led,.
and gave them a sull- account of the notice the clergy-
man had already taken of it ;- and arguing how un-
christian and irreligious a lise it was,. I first asked them
if they were married men or batchelors? They soon ex-
plained their condition to me, and shewed me that two-
of them were widowers, and' the other three were single
men or batchelors. 1 asked them, with what conscience
they could take these women and' lie with them, as
they had done, call them their wives, and have so many
children by them, and not to be lawsully married to-
them?
They all gave me the answer that I expected'; viz.
that there was nobody to marry them; that they
agreed before the governor to keep them as their wives,
and to keep them, and own them, as their wives; and
they thought, as things stood, with them, they weve aa
'legally
legally married as. if they had been married by a parson,
and with all the formalities in the world.
I told them, that no doubt they were married in
the light of God, and were bonffd in conscience to
keep them as their wives; but that the' laws of men
being otherwise, they might pretend they were not mar-
ried, and so desert the poor women and children here-
afters and that their wives, being poor desolate wo-
men, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to
lielp themselves. 1 therefore told them, that unless I
was assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing
for them; but would take care, that what I did Ihould
'be for the women and children, without them; and
that unless they would give some assurances that they
would marry the women, 1 could not think it was con-
venient they should continue together as man and wise;
for that it was both scandalous to men, and offensive to
God, who they could not think would bless them if they
went on thus.
All this passed as I expected; and they told me, espe-
cially Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak for the
rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they had
been born in their own native country, and would not
leave them upon any account whatever; and they did
verily believetheir wives were as virtuous and as rnodeft,
and did, to the utmost of their skill, as much for them
and for their children, as any women could possibly do;
and they would not part with them on any account :—
And Will. Atkins, for his own particular, added, if any
man would take him away, and offer to carry him home
to England, and to make him captain of the best man of
war in the navy, lie would not go with him, if he might
not carry his wise and children with him; and if there
was a clergyman in the ship, he would be married to her
now, with all his heart.
This was just as I would Tiave it; .the priest was
not with me at that moment, but was not sar off:
So, to try him sarther, I told him 1 had a clergyman
with me, and if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next morning, and bade him consider os
it, and talk with the rest: he said, as for himself, he
need not consider of it all; for he was very ieady to
do it, and was glad I had a minister with me; and he
believed they would be all willing also. 1 then told
him, that my friend, the minister was a Frenchman,
and could not speak English; but that I would act the
clerk between them. He never so much as asked me
whether he was a papist or a protestant, which was in-
deed what I was afrajd of; but I say they never en-
quired about it; so we parted. I went back to my
jclergyman, and Will. Atkins went.in to talk with his
companions. I desired the French gentleman not to
isay any thing to them till the business was thoroughly
ripe; and 1 told him what answer the' men had given
.me.
Before I went from their quarter, they all came to ire,
and told me, they had been considering what I had
said; that they were very glad to hear 1 had a clergy-
man in my company; and they were very willing to
give me the satissaction I desired, and to be formally
married as soon as I pleased, for they were sar from de-
siring to part with their wives; and that they meant
nothing but what was very honest when they chose
them; so I appointed them to meet me the next morn-
ing; and that in the mean time they should let their
wives know the meaning of the marriage-law, and that
it was not only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige
them, that they should not forsake them, whatever might
happen. ~. -
The women were easily made sensible of the mean-
ing of the thing, and were very well satisfied with it,
as, indeed, they had reason to be; so they sailed not
to attend all together at my apartment the next morn-
ing, where 1 brought out my clergyman; and though.
he had not on a minister's gown after the manner of
England, or the habit of a priest, after the manner of
France, yet having a black vest, something like a cas-
ibck, with a sash round it, he did not look very unlike
a minister; and as for his language, I was his inter-
preter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour to them', and the
scruples he made of marrying the women, because they
were not baptized, and prosessed Christians, gave them.
an exceeding reverence for his person; and there was no
need
119
treed after that to enquire whether he was a clergyman
or no.
Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been car-
ried so sar, as that he would not have married them at
all; nay, notwithstanding all 1 was able to say to him*
he resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily; and
at last resused absolutely to marry them, unless he had
first talked with the men, and the women too: and
though at sirst I was a little backward to it, yet at last I
agreed to it with a good will, perceiving the sincerity of,
his design.
When he came to them, he let them know that I had
acquainted him with their circumstances, and with the
present design; that he was very willing to persorm that
part of his sunction, and marry them, as I had desired;
'but that before he could do it, he must take the liberty
to talk with them. He told them, that in the sight of
nil difserent men, and in the sense of the laws of society,
they had lived all this while in an open adultery.; and
that it was true, that nothing but the consenting to
marry, or essectually separating them from one another,
now could put an end to it; but there was a difficulty
init too, with respect to the laws of Christian matri-
mony, which he was not sully satisfied about, viz. that
of marrying one that is a prosessed Christian, to a savage,
an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not baptized; and
yet that he did not see that there was time left for it, to
endeavour to persuade the women to be baptized, or to
prosess the name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted,
heard nothing of, and without which they could.not be
baptized.
tie told me, he doubted they were but indifserent
Christians themselves; that they had but little know-
ledge ot God or his ways, and therefore he could not
expect that they had laid much to their wives on that
head yet; but that unless they would promise him to
use their endeavours with their wives, to persuade them
to become Christians, and would as well as they could,
instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God' that
made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed
thern, he could not marry them 5 for he would have
jio hand in joining Christians with savages; nor was
it consistent with the principles of' the Christian re-
ligion; and was indeed expressly forbidd:n in God's
law.
They heard all this ^ery attentively, and I delivered
it very saithsully to them from his mouth, as near his
own words as I could, only sometimes adding some-
thing of my own, to convince them how just it was,
and now I was of his mind; and I always very saith-
sully drstinguisheci between what I said from myself,
and what were the clergyman's words. They told
me it was very true what the gentleman had laid,
that they were but very indifferent Christians them-
selves, and that they had never talked to their wives
about religion.. Lord, Sir, says Will. Atkins, how
'should we teach them religion? Why, we know nothing
ourselves:; and besides, Sir, said he should we go to talk
to them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell,
'twould'but make them laugh at us, and ask us what we
believe ourselves? and if we should tell them, we be-
lieve all the things that we speak of to them, such as
of good people going to heaven, and wicked people
to the devil, they would ask us, where we intended to
-go ourselves, who believe all this, and yet are such
wicked sellows, as indeed we are? Why, Sir, said Will,
'tis enough to give them a surseit of religion at first
hearing. Folks must have some religion themselves.
helbre they pretend to teach other people. Will
Atkins, said I to him, though I am afraid what you say
has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your
wise that she is in the wrong? That there is a God,
and a religion better than her own; that her gods are
idols, that they can neither hear nor speak; that there
is a great Being that made all things, and that can de-
stroy all that he has made; that he rewards the good,
and punishes the bad; that we are to be judged by him
at last for all we do here; you are not so ignorant, but
even nature itself will teach you, that all this is true;
and I am satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe
it yourself.
That's trut, Sir, said Atkins; but with what sace caa
I say any thing to my wise of all this, when she will tell
me immediately, it cannot be true?
Not true! said I ; what do you mean by that? Why
Sir, said he, she will tell me it cannot be true that this
God (I shall te\l her of) can be just, or can punish, or
reward, since I am not punished, and sent to the devil,
that have been such a wicked creature as she knows I
have been, even to her, and to every body else, and that
I flrould be suffered to live, that have been always acting
1b Contrary to what I must tell her is good, and to what
I ou<;ht to have done. .'
Why truly, Atkins, said 1, 1 am afraid thou speakest
too much truth; and with that I let the clergyman know
what A tkins had said; for he was impatient to know:~
O! said the priest, tell him there is one thing will make
him the best minister in the world to his wise, and that
is repentance; for none teach repentance like true peni-
tents ; he wants nothing, but to repent, and then he will
be so much the better qualified to instruct his wise; he
will then -be able to tell her, that there is not only a God,
and that He is the just rewarder of good and evil; but
that he is a mdrcisul Deing, and, with insinite good-
ness and fong-lussering, forbears to punish those that of-
send; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the death
of a sinner, but rather that he should return and live;
that he often suffers wicked men to go on a long time,
and even. reserves damnation to the general day of retri-
bution; that it is a clear evidence of God, and of a
suture state, that righteous men receive not their reward,
or wicked men their punishment, till they come into
another world 5 and this will lead film to teach his wise
the doctrine of the .resurrection, and of the last judg-
ment; let him but repent for himself, he will be an ex-
cellent preacher of repentance to his wise.
I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious
all the while, and who, we could easily perceive, was
more than ordinarily affected with it; when be.ng eager,
and hardly suffering me to make an end: I knew all
this!,' master, says he, and a great deal more ; but 1 haa't
the impudence to talk thus to my wise ; when G id, and
my own conscience knows, and my wife w 11 he an
undeniable evidenee against me, that I have li ed as if
I had never heard of God, or a suture stale, or any
thing about it, and to talk of my repeating, alas! (and
. vol., 11. r with
vrith that -he setched a deep sigh; and I could see that
tears stood in his eyes) 'tis past all that with me. Part
it! Atkips, said 1, What dost thou mean by that? I know
•well enough what I mean, Sir, says he; I mean 'tis too
late; and that is too true.'
I told my clergyman, word for word, what he said;
the poor zealous priest (I must call him so; for be his
opinion what it will, he had certainly a most singular
afsection for the good of other men's fouls; and it would
.-be hard to think he had not the like for his own; I say,
.this zealous affectionate man) could not refrain tears also;
but, recovering himself, he said to me, Ask him but one
question, Is he easy, that it is too late, or he is troubled,
and wishes it were not so? I put the question sairly to
-Atkins; and he answered with a great deal of passion,
How could any man be easy in a condition that cer-
tainly mult end in eternal destruction ! that he was sar
srom being easy; but that, on the contrary, he believed
it would one time or other ruin him.
What do you mean by that? said I. Why, he said,
he believed he (hould, one time or other, cut his own
throat, to put an end to the terror of it.
The clergyman shook his head, with great concern
in his sace, when I told him all this ; but, turning quick
to me upon it, said, if that be his case, you may assure
him it is not too late; Christ will give him repentance;
but pray, says he, explain this to him, That as no man
is fayed but by Christ, and the merit of his passion,
procuring divine mercy for him, how can it be too late
sor any man to receive mercy? Does he think he is
able to fin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy?
Pray tell him, There may be a time when provoked
mercy will no longer strive, and when God may resuse
to hear, but-that 'tis never too late for men to ask mer-
cy; :and we that are Christ's servants are commanded to
preach mercy at all times, in the name of .1esus Christ,
ito all those that sincerely repent; so that 'tis never too
Jate to repent.
'I- told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great
earnestness 5 but it seemed as if he turned off the dis-
course to the rest; for he said to me, he would go and
have some talk with his wise; so he went out awhile
'^' . . and
Adventures of robinson crusoe. 123
and we walked to the rest. I perceived they were all
stupidly ignorant, as to matters of religion; much as I
was when I went rambling away from my sather; and
yet that there were none of them backward to he ir what
had been said, and all of them seriously promised that
they would talk with their wives about it, and do their
endeavour topersuade them to turn Christians.
The clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported what
answer they gave, but said nothing a good while; but,
at last, shaking his head, W.e that are Christ's servants,
fays he, can go no surther than to exhort and instruct;
and when men comply, submit to the reproof, and pro-
mise what we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are bound to
accept their good words: but, believe me,. Sir, said he,
whatever you may have known of the lise of that man
you call William Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere
convert among them; I take that man to be a true peni-
tent; I won't despair of the rest; but that man is per-
sectly struck with the sense of his past lise; and I doubt
not, b¥t when he comes to talk of religion to his wise,
he will talk himself essectually into h; for attempting to
teach others is sometimes the belt way of teaching our-
selves. I knew a man, added he, who, having nothing
but a summary notion of religion himself, and being
wicked and profligate, to the last degree, in his lise, made
a thorough reformation in himself, and being to con"ert
a Jew; and if that poor Atkins begins but once to talk
seriously of Jesus Christ to his witea my life for it, he
talks himself into a thorough convert, makes himself a
penitent, and who knows what may follow?
Upon this discourse however, and their promising, as
above, to endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace
Christianity, he married the other three couple; but
Will Atkins and his wise were not yet come in: after
this, my clergyman, waiting awhile, was curious to
know where Atkins was gone; and, turning to me, fays
he, I tntreat you, Sir, let us walk out of your laby-
rinth here and look: I dare say we shall find this poor
man somewhere or other, talking seriously with his wise,
and teaching her already something of religion. I
began to be of the same mind; so we went out toge-
ther; and 1 carried him a way which none knew but

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
myself, and where the trees were so thick set, as that
it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and
far harder to see in, than to see out; when coming
to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins, and his tawny
savage wise, fitting under the shade of a bnsh, very
eager in discourse; I stopped short, till my clergyman
came up to me; and then, having shewed him where
they were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a
good while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing up
to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens; then
<lown to the earth, then out to the sea, then to himself,
then to her, to the woods, to the trees. Now, says my
clergyman, you see my words are made good: the man
preaches to her; mark him, now he is telling her that
our God has made him, and her, and the heavens, the
earth, the sea, the woods, the trees. &c. I believe he is,
said I: immediately we perceived. Will Atkins start upon
his seet, sall down upon his knees, and lilt up both his
hands: we suppose he said something, but we qpuld not
hear him; it was too sar for that: he did not continue
kneeling half a minute, but comes and fits down again
by his wise, and talks to her again. We perceived then
the woman very attentive, but whether the said any
thing or no, we could not tell. While the poor sellow
was upon his knees, 1 could see the tears run plentifully
down my clergyman's cheeks; and I could hardly for-
bear myself; but it was a great asfliction to us both,
that we were not near enough to hear any thing that .
passed between them.
Well, however, we could'come no nearer, for sear of
disturbing them: so we resolved to see an end of this
piece of ltill conversation; and it spoke loud enough
to us, without the help of voice; he sat down again, as
1 have said, close by her, and talked again earnestly to
her; and two or three times we could see him embrace
her passionately: another time we saw him take out his
handkerchief, and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her
again with a kind of transport very unusual *. and aster
several of these things, we saw him on a sudden jump
nri again, and lend her his hand to help her up, when
immediately, leading her by the hand a step or two.

they both kneeled down together, and continued so about
two minutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out alou^,
St. Paul, St. Paul! behold he prayeth: I was fraid
Atkins would hear him; therefore I intreated h:m to
withhold himself a while, that we might see an end of
the scene, which to me, I must consess, was the mad
afsecting, and yet the most agreeable, that ever I saw in
my lise. Well, he strove with himself, and contained
himself for a while, but was in such raptures of joy toi
think that the poor heathen woman was become a chris-
tian, that he was not able to contain himself: he wept
several times; then throwing up his hands and crossing
his breast, said over several things ejaculatory, and by
-way of giving God thrnks for so miraculous 3 testimony
of the success of our endeavours; some he spoke softly,
and 1 could not well hear, others audibly, some in La-
tin, some in French; then two or three times the tears
of joy would interrupt him, that he could not spe:>k
at all. But I begged that he would compose himself,
and let us' more narrowly and sully observe what was
before us, which he did for a time, and the scene was
not ended there yet; for, after the poor man and his ,
wise were risen again from their knees, we observed he
stood talking still eagerly to her; and we observed by her
motion that she was greatly affected with wha,t he said,
by her frequent lifting up her hand, laying her hand to
her breast, and such other postures as usually express
the greatest seriousness and attention; this continued
about half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked
away too; so chat we could see no more of them in
that situation.
I took this interval to talk with my clergyman; and
first, I told him, I was glad to see the particulars we
had both been witnesses to; that though I was hard
enough of belief in such cases, yet that 1 began to
think it was all very sincere here, both in the man and
his wise, however ignorant they both might be: and I
hoped such a beginning would have a yet more happy
end: and who knows, said I, but these two may in
time, by instruction and example, work upon some
of the others? Some of them! laid he, turning quxk
r 3 upon
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRt'SOS.
upon me, py, upon all of them ; depend upon it, if those
two savages (for he has been but little better, as you re-
late it) stiou embrace Jesus Christ, fhey will iien-er leave
till they work upon all the rest; for true religion is na-
turally communicative; and he that is once made a
Christian wilt-never leave a Pagan behind him, if he can
help it. I owned it was a most Christian principle to
think so, and a testimony of a true zeal, as well as a ge-
nerous heart in him. But, my friend, said I, will you
give me liberty-to start one difficulty here? I cannot tell
how to object the least thing against that afsectionate con-
cern, which you shew for the turning the poor people
srom their Paganism to the Christian religion. But how
does this comfort you, while these people are, in your
account, out of the pale of the Catholic church ; without
which you believe there is n6 salvation; so that you
esteem these but heretics still; and for no other reasons as
efsectually lost as the Pagans themselves?
To this he answered with abundance os candour and
Christian charity, thus: Sir, 1 am a Catholic of the
Roman church, and a priest of the order of St. Bene-
nict, and I embrace all the principles of the Roman
saith; but yet, if you will believe me, and this I do not
speak in compliment to you, or in respect to my circum-
stances, and your civilities: 1 say, nevertheless, I do
not look upon you, who call yduri'elves reformed, with-
out some charity; I dare not say, though I know it is
cur opinion in general; yet, 1 dare not say, that you
cannot be saved, will by no means limit the mercy of
Christ, so sar as to think that he cannot receive you into
the bosom of his church, in a manner, to us, imper-
ceivable, and which it is impossible for us to know:
and I hope you have the same charity for us. I pray
daily for your being all restored to Christ's church, by
whatsoever methods he, who is all wile, is pleased to
direct. In /the mean time, sure, you will allow it to
consist with me, as a Roman, to distinguish sar between
a Protestant and a Pagan; between one that calls on
Jesus Christ, thougli*in a way which 1 do not think is
according to the true saith: and a savage, a barbarian,
that knows no God, no Christ, no redeemer at all:
and if you are not within the pale of the Catholic
church,
church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it than'
those that know nothing at all of God, or his church i
1 rejoice therefore, when 1 fee this poor man, who, yotf
say, has been a profligate, and almost a murderer, kneel;
down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did,
though not sully enlightened; believing that God from
whom every such work proceeds, will sensibly touch his.
heart, and bring him to the further knowledge of the
truth in his own time, and if God shall influence this
poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage his'
wise, 1 can never believe that he shall be cast away him-;
self: and have I not reason then to rejoice, the nearer
any are brought to the knowledge of Christ, though
they may not be brought quite home into the boi'0"1 of
the Catholic church, just at the time when I may desire1
it; leaving it to tne goocmeiS or cnntt iu [^.icu kj
work in his own time, and his own way? Certainly I.
would rejoice, if all the savages in America .were brought,
like this poor wOinan, to pray to God, though they
•were to be all Protestants at first, rather than they should
continue Pagans and Heathens; firmly believing that.he
who had bellowed that first light upon them, would sar-
ther illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly gr^ce.
and bring them . intp the pale of his church when he
should see good. . •.' ,
- I was astonished at the sincerity and temper.of this
truly pious papist, as much as I was oppressed by the
power of his reasoning; and it presently occurred to.my
thoughts, that if such a temper was universal, we might
be all Catholic christians, whatever church, or particular
prosession we joined to, or joined in ; that a spirit of cha-
rity would soon work us all up into right principles; and
in a word, as he thought that the like charity would
make us all Catholics, so I told him, I befieyed^ihad all
the members of his church the like moderation, they
would soon be all Protestants; and there we leijt that
part, for we never disputed at all. 1 .
However, 1 talked to him another' way, and faking
him by the hand, my friend, sai'd I,'l ..wish,'a'll the
clergy of the Roman church were blessed with such mo-
deration, and an equal share of your charity : I am en-
tirely of your opinion; but 1 mult tell you, that if you
F 4 ihould
should preach such doctrine, in Spain or Italy, they
would put you into the inquisition.
It may be so, said he, 1 know not what they might
do in Spain or Italy; but I will not say they would be
the better christians for that severity; for I am sure there
is no heresy in too much charity.
Well, as Will Atkins and his wise were gone, our
business there was over'; so we went back our own
way; and when we came back, we found them wait-
ing to be called in. Observing this, I asked my clergy-
man if we should discover to him that we had seen < him.
Tinder the bush, or no ; and it was his opinion we should
not; but that we should talk to him first, and hear
-what he would say to us; so we called him in alone,.
nobody being in the place but ourselves; and 1 begun
with him thus; • '.
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had you I
What was your sather?
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be. Sir, my
father was a clergyman.
R. C. What education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I
despised all education, instruction, or correction, like a
beast as I was. . . - - .
R. C. It is true, Solomon fays, he that despiseth re-
proof- i? brutish.
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish indeed; I murdered
roy father! for God's sake, Sir, talk no more about that,
Sir! I murdered my poor sather I
Priest. JHa! a murderer !*
* Here the priest started (for I interpreted every
''word as he spoke it) and looked pale. 1t seems
he believed that Will had really killed his own
sather.
'v '' .
R. 'C. No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so ; Will
Atkins explain yourself; you did not kill your sather,
did you, with your own hands?
W. A. No, Sir; I did not cut his throat; but I
cut the thread of all his cornforts, and shortened his days;
1 broke his heart by the^most ungratesul unnatural re-
W turn
turn for the most tender affectionate treatment that ever
sather gave, or child could receive.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your sather, to
estort this confession; I pray God give you repentance
for it, and forgive you that, and a!) your other fins; but
I asked you, because I see that tin.ugh you have not
much learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are
in things that are good; that you have known more of
religion a great deal than you have practised.
W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the consession
that I made about my sather, conscience does; and
-whenever we come to look back upon our lives, the sins
against our indulgent parents are certainly the sirst that
touch us; the wounds they make lie deepest, and the
weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the mind of all
the fins we may commit.
R. C. You talk too seelingly and sensible for me, At-
kins; I cannot bear it.
W. A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing of it.
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every -shore, every hill, nay, 1
may say, every tree in this island is witness to the an-
guish of my soul, for my ingratitude, and base usage of
a good tender sather; a sather much like your's, by
your description: and I murdered my sather as well as
you, Will Atkins: but think, for all that, my repen-
tance is short of your's too* by a great deal.
* I would have said more, if I couM have restrained
my passions ; but I thought this poor man's repen-
tance was so much sincerer than mine, that I was
going to leave off the discourse, and retire; for I
was surprited with what he said, and thought that,
instead of my going about to teach and instruct him,
the man was made a teacher and instructor to me,
'in a most surprising. and: unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was
greatly affected with it; and said to me, Did I not say,
Sir, that when this man was converted, he would preach
to us all? I tell you, Sir, if this one man be made a
true penitent, here will be no need of me; &e w.ll make
r 5 Christians
christians of all in the ifland. But, having a little con*»
posid myself, I renewed my discourse with Will Atkins,
But, Will, said I, How comes the sense of this matter
to touch you just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has
struck a dart through my very foul; I have been talking
about God and religion to my wise, in order, as you
directed me, to make a christian -of her; and she has
preached such a sermon to me, as I shall never forget
while I live.
R. C. No, no, it is not your wise has preached to you,
Dut when you were moving religious arguments to her,
conscience has flung them back upon you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a force as it is not to be
relisted.
R. C. Pray, Will, let us know whnt passed between
you and your wise; for I know something of it al-
ready.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a sull account
of it; I am too full to hold it; and yet have no tongue to,
express it ; but let her have said what she will, and
though I cannot give you an account of it, this I cant
te 1 you of it, that I resolve to amend and reform my
lise.
R. C. But tell us some of it. How did you 1>egii*
Will? For this has been an extraordinary ease that is
certain; she has preached a sermon indeed, if she 'has
wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, 1 first told her the nature. of our laws
about marriage, and what the reasons were that men-
and women were obliged to enter into such compacts
as it was neither in the power of one or other to break;
that otherwise order and justice could not be maintained,
and men would run from their wives, arid abandon their
children, mix consusedly with one another, and neither
samilies be kept entire, or inheritances be settled by a
le^al descent.
R. C. You talk like a Civilian, Will. Could yon
m ke her understand what you meant by inheritance and
samiiies i' They know no such thing among the savages,
but marry any how, without any regard to relation,
ceasanguinisy, or samily, brother and sister, nay, as I
. have
have been told, even the sather and daughter, and the
son and the mother.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinformed ; and my
wise assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it;
perhaps, for any surther relations, the,' nay i t be so
exact as weare; but she tells me they never touch one
another in the near relation you speak of.
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her.?
W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was
much better than in her country.
R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there be/an all our dialogue. 1 asked
her, if she would be married to me our way i She asked
me, What way that was? I told her marriage was ap-
pointed of God ; and here we had a iirange talk together,
indeed, as ever man and wise had, !believe.
N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his
. wise, as I took it down in writing, just after he
told it me, was as follows:
Wise. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a
'God in your country?
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is is in every country.
Wise. No; your God in my country: my country
have the great old Benamuckee God.
W. A. Child, I am very unfit to shew you who God
is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven and the earth,
the sea, and all that in them is.
Wise. No makee de earth; no you God makee de
earth; no make my country*.'
* W. A. laughed a little at her expression ofjGod
not making her country.
Wise. No laugh. Why laugh me? This no ting
(to laughs.
f He was justly reproved by his wise; for she was
more serious than he at first.
W. A. 'That's true indeed ; I will not laugh any more,
any dear.
Wise. Why you say, you God make all!
W. A. ies, child, our God made the whole world,
.and you, and me, and all things; for he is the only
? 6 true
true God; there is no God but he; he lives for ever la
heaven.
Wise. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That's true indeed; but I have been a wicked
wretch; and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee
•with any thing before, but have lived without God in
the world myself.
Wise. What have you-de great God in you de country,
you no, know him? No say O to him? No good ting
for him? That no impossible!
W. A. It is true though for all that: we live as if
there was no God in heaven, or that he had no power
on earth.
Wise. But why God let you do so? Why he no
makee you good live?
W. A. It is all our own: sault.
Wise. But you say me, he is great, much great, have
much great power; can make kill when he will;
why he no makee kill when you- no serve him ?' No say
0 to him? No be good mans?
W. A. That is true; he might strike me dead, and
1 ought to exepect it; for I have been a wicked wretch,
that is true; but God is mercisul, and does not deal
with us as we deserve.
Wise. But then, do not you tell God tankee for that
too?
W. A. No, indeed: I have not thanked God for his
mercy, any more than I have seared God for his
power.
Wise. Then you God no God; me no think, believe
be be such one, great much power, strong;. no makee
kill you, though you makee him much angry.
W. A; W hat! will my wicked lise hinder you from
bslieving in God! What a dreadsul creature am I ! And
•what a sad truth is it that 'the horrid lives of Christians-
binders the conversion of Heathens.!.
Wise. How me tink you have great much God * up*
there, and yet no do well, nado good ting ?. Can/he tell?
Sure he no tell what you do.
* She points up to heaven»
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things r he
hears us speak, sees what we do, knows what we think,.
though we do not speak.
Wise. What! he no hear you swear, cnrse, speak
the,great damn?
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it aft.
Wise. Where be then the muchee great power
strong?
W. A. He is mercisul: that is all we can say for it;
and this proves him to be the true God: he is God, and
not man: and therefore we arenot consumed*.
* Here Will Atkins told us, he was struck with horror,
to think how he could tell his wise so clearly, that
God sees, and hears, and knows the secret thoughts*
of the heart, and all that we do ; and yet that he had
dared to do all the vile things he had done
Wise. Mercisul! what do you call dat?
W. A. He is our sather and maker; and he pities
and spares us.
Wise. So then he never makee kill, never angry
•when you do wicked i then he no good himself, or nc»
great able. , .
W. A. Yes, yes, my dear; he is insinitely good, and
insinitely great, and able to punish too: and sometimes,
to shew his justice and vengeance, he lets fly his anger
to destroy sinners, and make examples: many are cut off
in their fins.
Wise. But no makee kill you yet: then he tell you,
may be, that he no makee you kill, so you make de bar-
gain with him, you do bad ting, he no be angry at you,
•when he be angry at other mans?
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon
•his goodness: and he would be insinitely just, if he de-
stroyed me, as he has done other men.
Wise. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead?
What you say to hii» for that? You no tell him tankee
for all that too?
W. A.. I am an unthanksul, ungratesul dog, that
if. true.
Wise*
Wise. Why he no makee you much good better?
You say he makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the world; 'tis
I have deformed myself, arid abused his goodness, and
have made myself an abominable wretch.
Wife. I wish you makee God know me: I no makee
him angry: 1 no do bad wicked ting.
Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to
hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught to
know God: and he such a wicked wretch, that he
could not say one word to her about God, but what
the reproach of his own carnage would make most
irrational to her belief: nay, that already she could
not believe in God, because he that was so wicked
was not destroyed.
\
'W. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could teach
you to know God, not God to know you ; for he knows
you already, and every thought in your heart.
Wise. Why then he know what I say to you now;
he know me wish to know him: how shall me know
who makee me?
W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee: I cannot
teach thee: I'll pray to him to teach thee to know him;
and to forgive me, that I am unworthy to teach thee.
The poor sellow was in such an agony at her desiring
him to make her know God, and her wishing to
know him, that, he said, he sell down on his knees
before her, and prayed to God to enlighten her mind
with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to
pardon his sins, and accept of his being the un-
worthy instrument of instructing her in the principles
of religion ; after which he sat down by her again;
and their dialogue went on.
35, B. This was the time when we saw him kneel dowa
- and. lift up his hands. -
Wise,.
Wise. What you put down the l:neefor? What you
hold upjbe hand for? What you say? What you speak
to? What is that?
W. A. My dear, a bow my knees in token of my sub-,
mission to him that made me: I said O to him, as you
call it, and as you say, your old men do to their idol,
Benamuckee; that is, I pray to him.
Wise. What you say O to him tor?
W. A. 1 prayed to him to open your eyes and your
understanding, that you may know him, and be accept-
ed by him.
Wise. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can; he can do all things.
Wise. But he no hear what you say?
W. A. Yes, he.has bid us pray to him, and promised
to hear us.
Wise. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he
bid you? What you hear him speak?
W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but he has
revealed himself many ways to us.
Here he was at a great loss to make her understand
that God had revealed himself to us by his word:
'and what his word was: but at last he told it her
thus:
W. A. God has spoken to some good men in former
days, even from heaven, by plain words: and God has
inspired good men, by his spirit; and they have written
all his laws down in a book.
Wise. Me no understand that: where is book }
W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this book *
but I hope I shall, one time or other, get it for yoa
*o read it.
Here he embraced her with great affection; but with
inexpressible grief, that he had not a bible.
Wise. But how you makee me know, that God
(teachee them to write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be God*'
Wise. What rule, what way you know?
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRCsoE.
W. A. Because he teaches and commands nothing
but whaj is good, righteous, and holy; and tends to
make us persectly good,' as well as persectly happy;
and because he forbids, and commands us to avoid all
that is wicked, that is eyil in itself, or evil in its con-
fequences.
Wise. That me would understand, that me sain see:
if he reward all good thing, punish all wicked thing, he
teachee all good thing, forbid all wicked thing, he makee
all thing, he give all thing; he hear me when I say O to
him, as you go to do just now; he makee me good, if
I wish to be good ; he spare me, no makee kill me, when
I no be good; all this you say he do; yes, he be great
God; me take, think, believe him be great God; me
say O to him too, with you, my dear.
Here the poor man said he could forbear no longer;
but, raising her up, made her kneel by him; and he
prayed to God aloud to instruct her in the knowledge of
himself, by his spirit; and that by some good providence,
if possible, she might, some time or other, come to have
a bible, that she might read the word of God, and ba
taught by him to know him. ,
This was the time that we saw him lift her up by the
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.
They had several other discourses, it seems, after this,
too long to set down here; and particularly she made
him promise, that since he confefied his own life had
been a wicked abominable course of provocation against
God, that he would reform it, and not make God
angry any more; lest he should make him dead, as
(he called it, and then she should be left alone, and- never
be taught to know this God better, and lest he should
be miserable, as, he had told her, wicked men should
be after death.
This was a strange account, and very affecting to us
both, but particularly the young clergyman: he was,
indeed, wondersully surprised with it: but under the
greatest affliction imaginable, that he could hot talk to
her: that he could 'not speak English. to make her un-
derstand him: aad as she spoke but very broken English.
13/
he could not understand her. However, he turned him-
self to me, and told me, that he believed there must be
more to do with this woman than to marry he*: 1 did
not understand him. at first, but at length he explained
himself; viz. That she ought to be baptized.
I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for
going about it presently: No, no, hold Sir, said he,
though I would have her baptized by all means, yet I
must observe, that Will Atkins, her husband, has, in-
deed, brought her in a 'wondersul manner to be willing
to embrace a religious lise, and has given her just ideas
of the being of a God, of his power, justice, and mercy:
yet I desire to know of him, if he has said any thing to
her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners: of
the nature of saith in him, and the redemption by him:
of the holy spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment,
and a suture state.
I called Will Atkins again, and asked him; but the
poor sellow sell immediately into tears, and told us, he
had said something to her of all those things, but that
he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own consci-
ence so reproached him with his hoi rid ungodly lise, that
he trembled at the apprehensions, that her knowledge of
him should lessen the attention she should give to those
things, and make her rather contemn religion, than re-
ceive it; but he was assured, he said, that her mind was
so disposed to receive due impressions of all those things,
that if 1 would but discourse with her, she would make
it appear to my satissaction, that my labour would not be
lost upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as in-
terpreter between my religious priest and the woman, I
intreated him to begin with her; but sure such a sermon
was never preached by a Popish priest in these latter ages
of the world; and, as I told him, 1 thought he had all-
the zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian,
without the errors of a Roman Catholic: and that I took
him to be such a clergyman as the Roman bishops were,
before the church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty
over the consciences of men.
In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace
the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption by bimj
not
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did the
first notions of a God, but with joy and saith, with an
assection, and a surprising degree of understanding, scarcer
to be imagined, much less to be expressed; and at her
own request she was baptized.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated
him that he would persorm that office with some caution,
that the man might not perceive he was of the Roman
church, if possible, because of other ill consequences
-wiich might attend a difference among us in that very
religion which we were instructing the other in. He told
me, that as he had no consecrated chape1, nor proper
things for the office, I should see he would do it in a
manner, that I should not know by it, that he was a
Roman Catholic mysels, if I had not known it before;
and so he did, for saying only some words over to him-
self in Latin, which I could not understand, he poured a
whole drsh sull of water upon the woman's head, pro-
nouncing in French very loud, Mary; which was the
name her husband desired me to give her, for I was her
godsather; I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and:
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; so that none could
know any thing by it, what religion he was of: he gave-
- the benediction afterwards in Latin; but either Will
Atkins did not know but it was French, or else did not
take notice of it at that time.
As soon as this was over, he married them; and after
the marriage was over, he turned himself to Will Atkins,
and in a very affectionate manner exhorted him not only
to perseveie in that good disposition he was in, but
to support the convictions that were upon him, by a
resolution to reform his lise; told him, it was in vain
to say he repented, if he did not forsake his crimes;
represented to him, how God had honoured him with
being the instrument of bringing his wise to the know-
ledge of the Christian religion; and that he should be
caresul he did not dishonour the grace of God; and that,
if he did, he would see the Heathen a better Christian
than himself j the savage converted, and the instrument
cast away.
He said a great many good things to them both, and
then recommended them, in a sew words, to God's
goodness^,
goodness, gave them the benediction again, I repeating
every th ng to them in English: and thus ended the
ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant agreeable
day to me that ever I passed in my whole lise.
But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts
hung continually upon the conversation of the 37 savages;
and sain he would have staid upon the island to have un-
dertaken it; but I convinced him, First, that his under-
taking was inpracticable in itseH'; an! 2dly, that per-
haps, I could put it into a way of being done, in his
absence, to his satissaction, of which by and by.
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a nar-
row compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship,
when the young man, whom I had taken out of the
samished ship's company, came to me, and told me, he
understood I had a clergyman with me; and that 1 had
caused the Englishmen to be married to the savages,
whom they called wives; that he had a match too, which
he desired might be finished before I went, between
two Christians; which, he hoped, would not be dis-
agreeable to me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was his
mother's servant, for there was no other christian woman
on the island; so 1 began to persuade him not to do any
thing of that kind rashly, or because he sound himself
in this solitary circumstance: I represented, that he had
some considerable substance in the world, and good friends,
es I understood by himself, and by his maid also; that
the maid was not only poor, and a servant,1 hut was
unequal to him, she being 26 or 27 years old; and
he not above 17 or 18; that he might, very probably,
with my assistance, make a remove trom this wilderness,
and come into bis own country again; and that then it
would be a thousand to one but be would repent bis
choice, and the dillike of that circumstance might be
disadvantageous to both. I was going to fay more, but
he interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great
deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses, that he
had nothing of that kind in his thoughts, his present
circumstances being melancholy and disconsolate enough,
and he was very glad to 'hear, that I had thoughts of
putting them in a way to see their own country again,
and that nothing should have set him upon staying there,
but that the voyage I was going was so exceeding long
and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the
reach of all his friends, but he had nothing to desire of
me, but that I would settle him in some little property
in the island where he was, give him a servant or two,
and some sew necessaries, and he would settle himsels
here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if ever
I returned to England, I would redeem him, and hoped
I would not be unmindsul of him when I came to Eng-
land, that he would give me some letters to his friends in
London, to let them know how good I had been to him,
and what part of the world, and what circumstances I
had left him in; and he promised me, that whenever I
redeemed'him, the plantation, and all the improvements
he had made upon it, let the value be what it would,
should be wholly mine.
His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering
his youth, and was the more agreeable to me,. because
he told me positively the match was not for himself.
I gave. him all possible assurances, that if I lived to come
sate to England, I would deliver his letters, and do his
business effectually, and that he might depend I would
never forget the circumstances I left him in; but still I
was impatient to know who was the person to be married:
upon which he told me, it was my Jack of all Trades
and his maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surprised when he named the
match ; for, indeed, I had thought it very suitable. The
character of that man I have given already; and as for
the maid, she was a very honest, modeit, sober, and
religious young woman; had a very good share ofsense,
was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very hand-
somely, and to the purpose, always with decency Biid
good' manners, and not backward to speak when any
thing required it, or impertinently forward to speak when
it was not her business; very handy and house-wisely in
any thing that was before her; an excellent manager,
and fit indeed to have been governess to the whole island;
she knew very well bow to behave herself to all kind of
folks she had about her, and to better, if (he had sound
any there.
'. • The
The match being proposed in this manner, -we mar-
Tied them the same day, and as I was sather at the altar,
as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave her a por-
tion, for I appointed her and her husband a baudsome
large space of ground for their plantation; and, indeed,
this match and the proposal the young gentleman made
to me, to give him a small property in the island, put me
upon parcelling it out among them, that they might not
quarrel afterwards about their situation.
This sharing out the land to them I left to Will At-
kins, who, indeed, was now grown a most sober, grave,
managing sellow, persectly reformed, exceeding pious and
religious, and, as sar as I may be allowed to speak posi-
tively in such a case, I verily believe, was a true sincere,
penitent.' -
He divided things so justly, And so much to every one's
satissaction, that they only desired one general writing
under my hand for the whole; which I caused to be
drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, setting out the
bounds and situation of every man's plantation, and testi-
fying, that I gave them thereby, severally, a right to
the whole possession and inheritance of the respective
plantations of sarms, with their improvements, to them
and their heirs; reserving all the rest of the island as my
-own property, and a certain rent for every particular
plantation, after eleven years, if 1 or any one from
me, or in my name, came to demand it, producing an
attested copy of the same writing.
As to government and laws among them, I told
them, I was not capable of giving them better rules
than they were able to give themselves; only made
them promise me to live in love and good neighbour-
hood with one another: and so 1 prepared to leave
them.
One thing I must not omit, and that is: that being
now settled in a kind of commonwealth among them*
selves, and having much .business in hand, it was but
odd to have seven and thirty Indians live in a nook of the
island, independent, and, indeed, unemployed; for,
excepting the providing themselves food, which they
had difficulty enough in sometimes, they had no manner
of business or property to manage. I proposed there-
fore
fore to (he governor Spaniard, that he should go to them
-with Friday's sather and propose to them to remove,
and either plant for themselves, or take them into their
feveral samilies as servants, to be maintained for their
labour, but without being absolute slaves, for I would
not admit them to make them slaves by force, by any
means, because they had their liberty given by capitula-
tion, and, as it were articles of surrender, which they
ought not to break. .
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came
all very cheersully along with him; so we allotted them
land and plantations, which three or four accepted of,
but all the rest chose to be employed as servants in the
several samilies we had settled; and thus my colony was
in a manner settled as follows :—the Spaniards possessed
my original habitation, which was the capital city, and
extended their plantation all along the side of the brook,
-which made the creek that I have so often described, as
sar as my bower, and as they increased their culture, it-
went always eastward; the Englistt lived in the north-
east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began,
and came on southward and south-west, towards the
back part of the Spaniards, and every plantation had a
great addition of land to take in, if they found occa-
sion, so that they need not jostle one another for want
of room.'
All the west end of the island was left uninhabited,
that if any of the savages mould come on shore there only
for their usual customary barbarities, they might come
and go ; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb
them; and no doubt, but they were often ashore, and
went away again; for 1 never heard that the planters

It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted to
my friend the clergyman, that the work of converting
"the savages might, perhaps, be set on foot in his
absence to his satissaction; and'Itold him, that now
I thought it was put in a fair way l for the savages
being thus divided among the (.'hrislians, if they would
but eveiy one of them do their part with those which
came under their hands, I hoped it might have a very
good effect. • - -

He agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will do
their part. But how, says he, how shall we obtain that
of them? I told him, we should call them all toge-
ther, and leave it in charge with them, or go to them
one by one, which we thought belt; so we divided it;
he to speak. to the Spaniards who were all papists, and
1 to the English who were all protestants; and we re-
commended it earnestly to them, and make them pro-
mise, that they would never make any distinction of pa-
pist or protestant, in their exhorting the savages to turn
Christians, but teach them the general knowledge of
the true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ: and
they likewise promised us, that they would never have
any differences or disputes, one with another, about
religion.
When I came to Will Atkins's house, (I maj' call it
so, for such a house, or such a piece of basket-work, I
believe was not standing in the world again !) I say,
when I came thither, I found the young woman I have
mentioned above and Vv ill Atkins's wise were become
intimates, and this prudent, religious young woman,
had persected the work Will Atkins had begun; and
though it was not above four days after what I have
related, yet the new baptized savage woman was made
such a Christian, as I have seldom heard of any like
her, in all my observation or conversation in the
world.
1t came next into my mind, in the morning, before
I went to them, that. among all the needsul things I
had to leave with them, I had not left a bible: in which
I shewed myself less considering for them, than my good
friend the widow was for me, when she sent me the
cargo of 1001 from Lisbon, where she packed up three
bibles and a prayer-book. However, the good woman's
charity had a greater-extent than ever she imagined,
for they were reserved for the comfort and instruction
of those that made much better use of them than I had
done.
I took one of the bibles in my pocket, and when
I came to. William Atkins's tent or house, I found
the young woman, and Atkins's baptized wise, had
been discoursing of religion together; (for William At-
kins
kins told it me, with a great deal of joy) I asked, if
they were together now? And he said, yes: lo I went
into the house, and he with me, and we found them
together very earnest in discourse: O, Sir, says William
Atkins, when God has sinners to reconcile to himself,
and aliens to bring home, he never wants a mes-
senger: my wise has got a vnew instructor: I knew
I was unworthy,' as I was incapable of that work: ,
that young woman has been sent hither from heaven:
she is enough to convert a whole island of savages.
The young woman blushed, and rose up to go away,
but I desired her to sit still; I told her she had a good
work upon her hands, and I hoped God would bless
her in it.
We talked a litfle, and I did not perceive they had
any book among them, though I did not ask; but I put
my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my bible: Here,
said^I to Atkins, I have brought you an assistant, that,
perhaps, you had not before. The man was so con-
founded, that he was not able to speak for some time;
but recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands,
and turning to his wise, here, my dear, says he, did
not I tell you, our God, though he lives above, could
hear what he said? Here is the book 1 prayed for,
when you and I kneeled down under the bush: now
God has heard us and sent it. When he had said thus,
the man sell into such transports of a passionate joy,
that between the joy of having it, and giving God
thanks for it, the tears ran down his sace like a child
that was crying.
The woman was surprised, and was like to have
run into a mistake, that none of us were aware of;
for she firmly believed God had sent the book upon her
husband's petition. It is true, that providentially it
was so, and might be taken so in a consequent sense:
but I believed it would have been no difficult matter, at
that time, to have persuaded the poor woman to have
believed, that an express messenger came from heaven,
on purpose to bring that individual book: but it was
too serious a matter, to suffer any delusion to take
place: So I turned to the young woman, and told
her, we did not deike to impose upon the new con-
vert,
-»ert, in her first, and more ignorant understanding of
things; and begged her, to explain to her, that God
fnay be very properly said to answer our petitions, when
in the course of his providence, such things are, in a
particular manner, brought to pal's, as we petitioned for;
but we do not expect returns from heaven, in a mira-
culous and particular manner; and that it is our mercy
it is not so.
This the young woman did afterwards efsectually; so
that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used here;.
and I should have thought it one of the most unjustisiable
frauds uvthe world, to have had it so; but the surprise
of joy upon Will Atkins, is really not to be expressed;:
and there, we may be sure, was no delusion : sure no man
was ever more thanksul in the world for any thing o£
its kind, than he was for this bible; and, I believe,
never any man was glad of a bible from a better prin-
ciple; and though he had been a most profligate creature,
desperate, headitrong, outrageous, surious, and wicked,
to a great degree, yet this man is a standing rule to us all
for the well-in'structin<; children; viz. that parents
should never give over to teach and instruct, or ever
despair of the success of their endeavours, let the chil-
dren be ever so obstinate, refractory, or, to appearance,
insensible of instruction; for, if ever God in his provi-
dence touches the consciences of such, the force of their
education returns upon them, and the early instruction
of parents is not lost, though it may have been many
years laid asleep; but, some time or other, they may
find the benefit of it.
Thus it was with this poor man, however ignorant
he was, or divested of religion and Christian knowledge.
He found he had some to do with now more ignorant
than himself; and that the least part of the inltruction
of his good sather, that could now come to his mind,
was of use to him.
Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how his
father used to insist much upon the inexpressible value of
the bible—the privilege and blessing of it to nations,
samilies, and persons; but he never entertained the
least notion of the worth of it till now; when, bein^
VOL. II, g to
to talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted
the help of the written oracle for his assistance.
The young woman was very glad of it also, for the
present occasion, though the had one; and so had the
youth on board our ship, among the goods which were
not yet brought on shore. And now, having said so
many things of this young woman, I cannot omit telling
one story more of hef and myself, which has something
in it very informing and remarkable. t
I have related to what extremity the poor young wo-
man was reduced; how her mistress was starved to death
and did die on board that unhappy ship we met at sea;
and how the whole ship's company being reduced to the
last extremity, the gentlewoman,- and her son, and this
maid, were first hardly used as to provisions; and, at
last, totally neglected and starved, that is to lay, brought
to the last extremity of hunger.
One day, being discoursing with her upon the extre-
mities they sussered, I asked her if she could describe,
by what she selt, what it was to starve, and how it ap-
peared? She told me, she believed she could; and she
told her tale very distinctly thus:
First, Sir, said (he, we had for some days sared ex-
ceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger; but now,
at last, we were wholly without food of any kind, ex-
cept sugar, and a little wine, and a little water. The
first day aster I had received no food at all, I found my-
self, towards evening, first empty and fickish at my sto-
mach, and nearer night, mightily inclined to yawning
and sleepy; 1 laid down on a couch, in the great cabin,
to sleep; and slept about three hours, and awaked a
little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay
down: after being about three hours awake, it being
:ibout five o'clock in the morning, I found myself empty
and my stomach sickish again, and laid down again}
but could not sleep at al^ being very saint and ill; and
thus I continued all the second day, with a strange va-
riety, first hunger, then sick again, with reachings to
vomit; the second night, -being obliged to go to bed
again, without any food more than a draught of sair
-water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadoes,
and that the market was mightily (locked with provisions;
Vliat I bought some for my mistress, and went and dined
very heartily.
I thought my stomach was sull after this, as it would
have been alter, or at, a giod i!insl r; but when I awak-
ed, I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to sind myself
in the extremity of samine: the last glass of wine we had
I drank, and put sugar into it, because of its having
some spirit to supply nourishment; but there being no
substance in the stomach for the digesting office to work
vpon, I found the only efsect of the wine was, to raise
disagreeable sumes from the stomach into the head; and
1 lay, as they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk,
for some time.
The third day in the morning, after a night of strange
and consused inconstant djeams, and rather dozing than
sleeping, 1 awaked, ravenous and surious with hunger;
and I question, had not my understanding returned, and
conquered it, I say, I question whether, if I had been a
mother, and had a little child with me, its lise would
have been sase or no.
This lasted about three hours, during which time
I was twice raging mad, as any creature in Bedlam, as
my young master told me, and as he can now inform
you.
In one otS these fits of lunacy, or distraction, whether
by the motion of the ship, or some^ ssip of my foot, I
know not; I sell down, and struck my sace against the
corner of a pallet-bed, in which my mistress lay; and
with the blow the blood gushed out of my jiose; and
the cabin boy bringing me a little bason, I sat down, and
bled into it a great deal; and as the blood ran from me,
1 came to myself; and in the violence of the flame, or
the sever I was in, abated, and so did the ravenous part
of the hunger.
Then I grew lick, and reached to vomit, but could
not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up: after
I had bled some time, 1 swooned, and they all believed
I was dead; but I came to myself soon after, and then
had a most dreadsul pain in my stomach, not to be
described, not like the cholic, but a gnawing eager pain
for food; and, towards night, it went oft' .with a kind
of earnest wishing or longing for food; something like,
©"* as
as I suppose, the longing of a woman with child. I
took another draught of water, with sugar in it, but tny
stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it a!! up again;
then I took a draught of water, without sugar, and that
stayed with me; and laid me down upon the bed, pray-
ing most heartily, that it would please God to take me
away; and composing my mind in hopes of it, I slum-
bered awhile; and then waking, thought myself dying,
being light with vapours from an empty stomach; I re-
commended my foul to God, and earnestly wished that
somebody would throw me into the sea.
All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I
thought expiring; but bore it with much more patience
than s, and gave the last bit of bread she had to her
child, my young master, who would not have taken
it, -but she obliged him to eat it; and, I believe, it
saved his lise. 1
Towards the morning I slept again, and fi'st, when I
awaked, I sell into a violent paffion of crying; and
after that, had a second fit of violent hunger, so that I
got up ravenous, and in a most dreadsul condition; had
my mistress been dead, as much as I loved her, I am
certain, I should have eaten a piece of her flesh with as
much relish, and as unconcerned, as ever I did the flesh
of any creature appointed for food; and once or twice I
was going to bite my own arm. At last, I saw the
bason, in which was the blood 1 had bled at my nose the
day before; I ran to it, and swallowed it with such haste
and such a greedy appetite, as if I had wondered nobody
had taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from
me now.
Though after it was down, the thoughts of it filled
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger; and I
drank a draught of sair water, and was composed and
refreshed for some hours after it. This was the fourth
day, and thus I held it till towards night, when, within
the compass of three hours, 1 bad all these several cir-
cumstances over again, one after another, viz. sick, sleepy,
eagerly hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous
r.gain, then lick again, then lunatic, their crying, then
ravenous again, and so «very quarter of an hour; and
roy strength wasted exceedingly. At_ night I laid me
v down
clown, having no comfort, but that in the hope that I
should die before morning.
All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger was now
turned into disease, and I had a terrible cholic arid gri-
ping; wind instead of food, having found its way into
the bowels; and in this condition 1 lay till morning,
when I was surprised a little with the cries and lamenta-
tions of my young master, who called out to me, that,
his mother was dead. I lifted myself up a little. for I
had not strength to rise, but found she was not dead',
tho' she was able to give very little signs of lise.
I had then such convulsions in my stomach for want
of some sustenance, that I cannot describe them, with
such frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that nothing
but the tortures of death can imitate; and this condition
I was in, when I heard the seaman above cry out,
A sail! asail! and halloo and jump about as if they were
distracted. '.
I was not able to get off from the bed, and my mis-
tress much less; and my master was so sick, that I
thought he had been expiring; so we could not open
the cabin door, or get any account what it was that oc-
casioned such a combustion; nor had we any conversa-
tion with the ship's company for two days, they having
told us, they had not a mouthsul of any thing to eat in
the ship; and they told us afterwards they thought we
had been dead.
It was this dreadful condition we were in, when you
were sent to save our lives; and how you found us, Sir,
you know as'well as l, and better too.
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct ac-
count of starving to death, as I consess, I never met
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me: I am the
rather apt to believe it to be a true account, because the
youth gave me an account of a good part of it; though
I mult own, not so distinct, and sb seelingly, as his
maid; and the rather, because, it seems, his mother
sed him at the price of her own lise: but the poor
maid, though her constitution being stronger than that
< • ot?
of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly woman
too, she might struggle harder with it; 1 say, the poor
maid might be supposed to seel the extremity something
- ••' g 3 sooner
sooner than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep
the last bits something longer than she parted with any
to relieve the maid. No question, as the case is here re-
lated, if our ship, or some other, had not so providenti-
ally met them, a sew days more would have ended all
their lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one
another; and even that, as their case stood, would havo
served them but a little while, they being 500 leagues
from any land: or any possibility of relief, other than
in the miraculous manner it happened; but this is by
the way. I return to my disposition of things among the
people.
And first, it is to be observed here, that, for many
reasons, I did not think sit to let them know any thing
of the sloop I had framed, and which 1 thought of setting
up among them; for I found, at least at my first coming,
such seeds of division among them, that I saw it plainly,
had I set up the stoop, and left it among them, they
would, upon very light disgust, have separated, and gone
away from one another; or perhaps, have turned pirates,
and so made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plan-
tation of sober and religious people, as I intended it to
'be; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that
I had on board, or the. two quarter-deck guns, that my
nephew took extraordinary, for the lame reason; I thought
they had enough to qualify them for a desensive war
against any that mould invade them; but I was not to
'set them up for an offensive war, or to encourage them
to go abroad to attack others, which in the end, would
only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves and all
their undertakings; I reserved the sloop, therefore, and
the guns, for their service another way, as I shall observe
in its place.
1 have now done with the island: I left them all in
good circumstances, and in a flourishing condition, and
went on board my ship again the 5th day of May, hav-
ing been five and twenty days among them; and, as
they were all resolved to stay upon the island till I came
to remove them, I promised to send some surther relief
from the Brazils, if 1 could possibly find an opportunity;
and particularly, 1 promised to send them some cattle,
such as flieip, hogs, aud cows; sor as to the two cows
and .
and calves, which I brought from England, we had been
obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill them at sea,
for want of hay to seed them. ,
. The next d'ay, giving them a salute of five gnns at
parting, we set sail, and arrived at the Bay of All Saints,
in the Brazils, in about 22 days; meeting nothing re-
markable in our passage, but this; that about three days
after we sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting
strong to the N. N. E. running, as it were, into a bay
or gulph, on the land side, we-were driven something i
out of our course; and once or twice our men cried,
land to the westward; but whether it was the continent
or islands, we could.not tell by any means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth,
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, co-
vered towards the land, with something very black, not
being able to discover what it was ; but after some time,
our chief mate going up the main shrouds a little way,
and looking at them with a perspective, cried out, it was
an army. I could not imagine what he meant by an
army, and spoke a little hastily, Calling the sellow a fool,
or some such word: Nay, Sir, says he, don't be angry,
for it is an army, and a fleet too; for I believe there arc
a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle along,
and they are coming towards us too, apace, and sull of
men.
I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my
nephew the captain ; for he had heard such terrible stories .
of them in the island, and having never been in those
seas before, that he could not tell what to think of it,
but said, two dr three times, we shall all be devoured.
I mull consess, considering we were becalmed, and the
the current set strong towards the shore, I liked it the
worse; however, I bade him not be afraid, but bring the
ship to an anchor, as soon as we came so near as to knovy
that we must engage them. 't
The weather continued calm, and they came on apace
towards us; so I gave orders to come to an anchor, and
surl all our sails. As for the savages, I told them, they
had nothing to sear from them but fire; and therefore
they should get their boats out, and sasten them, one
close by the head, and the other by the stern, and man
a 4 . them
them both well, and wait the issue in that posture f
this I did, that the men in the boats might be ready,,
with sheet and buckets, to put out any fire these sa-
vages might endeavour to six upon the outside of the
ship.
In this posture we layby for them, and in a little while
they came up with us, but never was such a horrid sight
seen by Christians: my mate was much mistaken in his
calculation of their number, 1 mean of a thousand canoes;
the most we could make of them when they came up,
-being about 126'; and a great many of them too; for
some of them had 16 or 17 men in them, some more^
and the least six or seven.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which.
they had, doubtless, never seen before, nor could they,
at first, as we afterwards understood, know what to make
efus. They came boldly up, however, very near to us,
and seemed to go about to row round us; but we called to>
our men in the boats, not to let them come too near them.
This very order brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it : for five or six of their
large canoes came so near our long-boat, that our men
beckoned with their hands to them to keep back; which
they understood very well, and went back; but at their
retreat about 500 arrows came on board us from those
boats; and one of our men in the long-boat was very'
much wounded.
However, I called to them not to fire by any means i
but we handed down some deal boards into the boat, and
the carpenter presently set up a kind of a sence, like waste
boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages, if
they lhould shoot again.
About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a
body astern of us, and pretty near, so near that we could
easily discern what they were, though we could not tell
their design. 1 easily found they were some of my old
friends, the same sort of savages that I had been used
to engage with; and in a little time more they rowed
somewhat sarther out to sea, till they came directly
: broadside with us, and then rowed down strait upon us,
till they came so near, that they could hear us speak;
'- upoa
: upon this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they
ihould shoot any more arrows, and make all our guns
ready; but, being so near as to be within hearing, I
made Friday go out upon- the deck, and call' out aloud
to them- in his language, to know what they meant;
which accordingly he did: whether they understood
him or not, that I knew not; but as soon as he had
called to them, fix of them, who were in the foremost,
or nighest boats to us, turned their canoes from us; and
stooping down, shewed us their naked backsides; just as
if in English, (saving your presence) they had bid us
kiss ——; whether this was a defiance or ehallenge,
we know not; or whether it was done in mere contempt
or a signal to the rest; but immediately Friday cried
out, They were going to shoot; and unhappily for
him, (poor sellow) they let fly about 300 of their ar-
rows, and to my inexpressible grief killed poor Fri-
day, no other man being in their light. The poor sel-
low was shot with no less than three arrows, and about
three more fell very nigh him; such, unluckily, marksmen
they were,
1 was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, the
campanion of all my sorrows and solitude, that I im-
mediately ordered five guns to be loaded with small shot,
and four with great; and gave them such a broad-
side as they had never had in their lives before to be
sure. - ,".
They were not above half a cable's length off when
we fired; and our gunners took their aim so well that
three or four of their canoes were overset, as we had
- reason to believe, by one shot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides
to us gave u-s no great offence; neither did I know for
certain whether that, which would pass for the greatest
i contempt among us, might be understood so by them,
. ^or not; therefore in return, I had only resolved to have
fired four or five gnns with powder onlyf*which I knew
would fright them sufficiently \ but wbePu^y shot at us
tlirectly with all the fury thiy *tv<iie capable of, and
.especially as: they had killed my poor Friday, whom I
ib entirely loved and valued,s and'who* indeed, so well
: ,deserVCsJ-it, I not only had'beert j-a-stified before'God and
r J . g 5 maa
man, but would have been very glad, if I could, to haves
overset every canoe there, aud drowned every one o
them. f
1 can neither tell how many we killed, or how many
we wounded, at this broadside; but sure such a fright
and hurry never was seen among such a multitude: there
were I'3 or 14 of their canoes split, and overset, in all;
and the men all set a swimming; the rest, frighted
out of their wits, scoured away as sast as they could,
taking but little care to save those whose boats were split
or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that there were
many of them lost; and our men took up one poor sel-
low iwimniuig for his lise, above an hour after they were
all gone. -
Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and
wound a great many: but, in short, we never knew any
thing how it went with them; for they fled so sast, that
in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not see above
three or four straggling canoes; nor did we ever see the
rest any more: for a breeze of wind springing up the
same evening, we weighed, and set sail for the Brazils.
We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so sullen
that he would neither eat or speak; and we all sancied
that he would starve himself to death: but 1 took a way
to cure him: for I made them take him, and turn him
into the long boat, and make him believe they would toss
him into the sea again, and so leave him where they found
him, if he would not speak; nor would that do, but they
Jeally did throw him into the sea, and camse away from
him: and then he followed them, for he swam like a
cork, and called to them in his tongue, tho' they knew
not one word of what he said. However, at last, they
took him in again, and then he began to be more tracta-
ble; nor did I ever design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again; but I was the most
disconsolate creature alive, for want of my man Friday,
and would .>. we been very glad to have gone hack to the
island, to<he .ve taken one of the rest from thence
'for my occatron, but it could not be; so we went on;
we had one prisoner, as I have said, and it was a long
while before we could make him understand any thing;
hut, in time, our men taught him some iicglilh, and

he began to be a little tractable: afterwards we enquired
-what country he came from, but could make nothing of
what he said; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals,
and spoken in the throat, in such an hollow and odd
manner, that we could never form a word from him;
and we were all of opinion that they might speak
that language as well, if they were gagged, as other-
wife; nor could we perceive that they had any occasion
cither for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate; but formed
their words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with
an open throat; he told us however, some time aster,
when he had taught him to speak a little English,
that they were going, with their kings, to sight a great
battle. When he said kings, we aslced him how many
kings? He said, there were five nation, (we could not
make him understand the plural s) and that they all
joined to go against two nation. We aslced him, What
made them come up to us? He said, To makee te great
wonder look: where it is to be observed, that all those
natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn English,
they always add two e's at the end of the words where
we use one, and place the accent upon the last of them,
as makee, takee, and the like; and we could not break
them of it; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it
off, though at last he did.
And now I name the poor sellow once more, I
must take my last leave of him; poor honest Friday!
We buried him with all decency and solemnity porii-
ble, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing him
into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns
for him: and so ended the lise of the most gratesul,
saithsul, honest, and most affectionate servant that ever
man had.
We now went away with a sair wind for Brasil, and
in about twelve days time, we made land in the
latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the
north eaftermost land of all that part of America. We
kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore, sour days, when
we made the Cape St. Augustine, and in three days
came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints, the old
c 6 place
•'place of my deliverance, from whence came both rr.y
: good and evil sate. - •
Never did a ship come to this part that had less busi-
ness than I had; and yet it was with great disficulty that
-we were admitted to hold the least correspondence on
ihore: not my partner himself, who was alive, and made
a great figure among them; not mv two merchant trus-
tees, nor the same of my wondersul preservation in the
island, could obtain me that savour: but my partner.,
remembering that- 1 had given five hundred moidores to
the p ior of the monastry of the Augustines, and three
hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to the mo--
nastry, and obliged the prior that then was to go to the
governor, and beg leave for me presently, with the cap-
tain, and one more, besides eight seamen, to come oa
ihore, and no more-; ,and this upon condition absolutely
capitulated for, that we should not ofser to land any
goods out of the ship, or to carry any person away withj-
©ut licence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any goods,.
that it was with extreme difsiculty that I got on shore
three bales of K.nglish goods, such as fihe broad cloths^
stusf's, and some linen, which I had bought for. a present
to mv partner.
He was a very generous broad-hearted man, though
J( like me J he came from little at first; and though he
knew not that I had the least design of giving him any
thing, he sent me on board a present of fresh provisions,
wine, and sweetmeats, worth about thi. ty moidores,
including some tobacco, and three or four fine medals
in- gold. But I was even with him: in my present,
which, as I- have said, consisted of sine broad cloth,
English stuff's, lace, and fine Hollands. Also Idelir
vered him about the value of 1001. sterling, in the
same goods, sor other uses; and I obliged him to set
up .the sloop which I- had brought with me from EngT
land, as I have said-, for the ule of my colony, in or-

the
the place; nor did he miss it, as I had an account from-
my partner afterwards. 1 got him soon loaded with the
small cargo I had sent them; and one of our seamen,
that had been on more with me there, offered to go with
the sloop, and settle there, upon my letter to the governor
Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity of land for
a plantation; and giving him some clothes, and tools
for his planting work, which, lie said, he understood,
having been an old planter in Maryland, and a buccaneer
into the bargain.
I encouraged the sellow by granting all he desired;:
and, as an addition, I gave him the savage which we had
taken prisoner of war, to be his slave, and ordered the
governor Spaniard to give him his share of every thing
he wanted with the rest.
When we came to fit this man out, my old partner
told me, there was a certain very honest sellow, a BrasiJ
planter of his acquaintance, who had sallen into the dis-
pleasure of the church j I know not what the matter
is with him, says he; but, on my conscience, I think
he is an heretic in his heart; and he has been obliged
to conceal himself for sear of the inquisition; that
he wovdd be very glad of such an opportunity to
maks his escape, with his wise and two daughters;
and if I would let them go to the island, and allot them
a plantation, he wou'd give them a small stock to begin
with;. for the officers of the inquisition had seized all
his effects and estate, and he had nothing left but a
little houshold stuff, and two slaves; and, adds he,
though I hate his principles, yet I would not have him
sall into their hands, for he will'assuredly be burnt alive
if he does.
I granted this. presently, and joined my Englishman
with them; and we concealed the man, and his wise
and daughters, on board one ship, till the sloop put out
to go to sea; and then (having put all their gopds.
on board the sloop some time before) we put them.
on board the, sloop, after she was got out of the
bay. ^''

partner; and their stock, indeed, wasi muck alike rich

begin with, but as above. However, they carried over
•with them (which was worth all the rest) some materials
for planting iugar canes, with some plants of canes;
which he, 1 mean the Portugal man, understood Yery
well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in
the island, I sent them, by this sloop,- three milch-
cows, and sive calves, about twenty-two hogs among
them, three lows big with pig, two mares, and a stone-
horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged
three Portugal women to go; and recommended it to
them to marry them, and use them kindly. I could have
procured more women, but 1 remembered, that the poor
persecuted man had two daughters, and there were but
five of the Spaniards that wanted; the rest had wives os
their own, though in another country.
All this cargo arrived sase, and, as you may easily
suppose, very welcome to my old inhabitants, who were
now, (with this addition) betwixt sixty and seventy
. people, besides little children, of which there were a
great many: I found letters at London from them, all
by way of Lisbon, when I came back to England, being
sent back to the Brasils by this sloop, of which I shall
take some notice in its place.
I have now done with my island, and all manner of
discourse about it; and whoever reads the rest of my
memorandums, would do well to turn his thoughts
entirely from it, and expect to read only of the follies
of an old man, not warned by his own harms, much
less by those of other men, to beware of the like; not
cooled by almost forty years misery and disappointments;
not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation; not
made cautious by affliction and distress beyond imita-
tion.
1 had no more business to go to the East Indies, than
a man at sull liberty, and having committed no crime,-
has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire him
to lock him up among the prisoners there, and starve
him. Had 1 taken a small vessel from England, and
-went directly to the island; had I loaded her, as I did
the other vessel, with all the necessaries for the planta-
tion, and for my people, took a patent from the govern*
merit here, to have secured my property, in subjection
only to that of England, which, to be sure, I might have
obtained; had I carried over cannon and ammunition,
servants, and people to plant, and, taking possession of
the place, fortified and strengthened it in the name of
England, and increased it with people, as I might easily
have done; had I then settled myself there, and sent the
ship back, loaded with good rice, as I might also have
done in six months time, and ordered my friends to
have fitted her out again for our supply; had 1 done
this, and stayed there myself, I had, at least, acted like a
man of common sense; but I was possessed with a wan-
dering spirit, scorned all advantages, pleated myself with
being the patron of those people 1 had placed there,
and doing for them in a kind of haughty majestic way,
like an old patriarchal monarch; providing for them as
if I had been the sather of the whole samily, as well as
of the plantation: but I never so much as pretended to
plant in the name of any government or nation, or to ac-
knowledge any prince, or to call my people subjects, to
any one nation more than another; nay, 1 never so much
as gave the place a name; but left it as 1 found it, be-
longing to no man, and the people under no discipline or
government but my own; who, though I had an influ-
ence over them as sather and benesactor, hats no authority
or power to act or command one way or other, sarther
than voluntary consent moved them to comply: yet even
this, had I staid there, would have done well enough;
but as I rambled from them, and came thither no more,
the last letters I had from any of them, were by my part-
ner's means, who afterwards lent another sloop to the
place; and who sent me word, though 1 had not the
letter till five years after it was written, that they went
on but poorly, were malcontent with their long stay
there; that Will Atkins was dead; that five of the Spa-
niards were come away; and that though they had not
been much molested by the savages, yet they had some
ftirmishes with them; that they begged of him to write
to me, to think of she promise 1 had made to setch them
away, that they might see their own country again be-
fore they died.
Z But
But I was gone a wild-goose chace indeed; and they
who will have any more of me, mult be content to-
follow me through a new yariety of follies, hard-
ships. and wild adventures; wherein the justice of
Providence may be duly observed, and v*e may seer
how easily heavers can gorge us with our own desiresr
make the strongest of our wishes to be our afflidtion,
and punish us moll severely with those very things which
we think it would be our utmost happiness to be al-
lowed in.
Let no wise man flatter himself with the strength of
his own judgment, as if he was able to chuse any parti-
cular station of lise for himself. Man is a short-sighted
creature, sees but a very little way before him; and as
his passions are none of his best friends, so his particular
affections are generally his worst counsellors.
I say this, with respect to the impetuous desire I had
from a youth, to wander into the world; and how evi-
dent it now was, that this principle was preserved in me
for my punishment. How it came on, the manner, the
circumstance, and the conclafion of it, it is easy to give
you historically, and with its utmost variety of particu-
lars. But the secret ends of Divine Providence, in thus
permitting us to be hurried down the stream of our own
desires, are only to be understood of thole who can listen
to the voice of Providence, and draw religious conse-
quences from- God's justice, and their own mistakes.
Be it, had I business, or no business, away I went:
it is no time now to enlarge any farther upon the rea-
son or absurdity of my own conduct: but to come to
the history, I was embarked for the voyage, and the
voyage I went.
1 shall only add here, that my honest and truly pious
clergyman left me here: a ship being ready to go to
Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither ;. being still, as
he observed, bound never to finish any voyage he be-
gan: how happy had it been for me,. if I had gone with
him !: »», .'• :-- - \

things to be thanksul for, .and you had:Dever heard of the
second part of the travels and adventures,to£ Robinson

Crusoe; so I must leave here the fruitless exclaiming at
myself, and go on with my voyage.
b rom the Brasils we made directly away over the At-
lantic sea, to the Cape de Bonne Efperance, or, as we
call it, the Cape of Good Hope; and had a tolerable
-good voyage, our course generally south-east: now and
then a storm, and some contrary winds. But my dis-
asters at sea were at the end, my suture rubs and cross
events were to besal me on shore; that it might appear
the land was as well prepared to be our scourge as the
sea, when heaven, who directs the circumstances of
things, pleases to appoint it to be so.
Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a super-
cargo on board, who was to direct all her motions, after
she arrived at the Cape :. only being limited to certain
number of days, for stay, by charter-party, at the several
ports she was to go to; this was none of my business,
neither did I meddle with it at all; my nephew the cap-
tain, and the supercargo, adjusting all those tbiiigs be-
tween them as they thought fit.
We made no stay at the Cape, longer than was needful
to take in fresh water, but made the best of our way to
the coast of Corotnandel; we were indeed informed,
that a French man of war of fifty guns, and two large
merchant ships, were gone for the Indies: and, as I
knew we were at war with France, I had lbme appre-
hensions of them; but they went their own way, and we
heard no more of them.
1 shall not pester my account, or the reader, with
descriptions of places, journals of our voyages, variations
of the compass, latitudes, meridian distances, trade-
winds, situation of ports, and the like; such as almost all
the histories of long .navigation are sull of, and which
make the reading tiresome enough; and are persectly
unprofitable to all that read, except only to those who
are to go to those places themselves.
It is enough to name the ports and places which we
touched at; and what occurred to us upon our pasting
from one to another. We touched first at the island of
Madagascar, where, tho'the people are fierce and treachq-
roi)?,, and in particular, very well armed with lances and
.b.qwi, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet
we
we sared very well with them awhile; they treated as
very civilly; and for some trifles which we gave them,
such as knives, fcissars, &c. they brought us 11 good
fit bullocks, middling in size, but very good in flesh;
which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our pre-
sent spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.
We were obliged to stay here for some time, aster we
had surnished ourselves with provisions; and I, that
was always too curious to look into every nook of the
world wherever I came, was for going on shore as often
as I could. It was on the east side of the island that we
went on shore _pne evening; and the people, who, by
the way, are very numerous, came thronging about us,
and stood gazing at us, at a distance: as we had traded
freely with them, and had been kindly used, we
thought ourselves in no danger; but when we sow the
people, we cut three boughs out of a tree, and stuck
them up at a distance from us, which, it seems, is a
mark in the country, not only of truce and friendship,.
but, when it is accepted, the other side set up three-
poles or boughs also, which is a signal that they accept
the truce too; but then this is a known condition of the
truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three poles
towards them, nor they come past your three poles
or boughs towards you; so that you are persectly secure
within the three poles; and all the space between your
poles and theirs, is allowed like a market, for free con-
verse, traffic, and commerce. When you go thither,
you must not carry your weapons with you; and if they
come into that space, they stick up their javelins and
lances, all at the first pdles, and come on unarmed; but
if any violence is offered to them, and the truce thereby
broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold of their
weapons, and then truce is at an end.
It happened one evening, when we went on shore,
that a greater number of their people came down thaa
usual, but were all very friendly and civil. They
brought with them several kinds of provisions, for
which we satisfied them with such toys as we had;
their women also brought us milk and roots, and . se-
veral things very acceptable to vs, and all was quiet;
aud
and we made us a little tent; or hut, of some boughs of
trees, and lay on the shore all that night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so
well satisfied to lie on shore as the rell; • and the boat ly-
ing at an anchor, about a stone's cast from the land,
with two men in her to take care of her, I made one of
them come on shore; and getting some boughs of trees
to cover us also in the boat, 1 spread the sail on the bot-
tom of the boat, and lay on board, under the cover of
the branches of the trees, all night.
About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our
men make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for
God's sake, to bring the boat in, and come and help
.them, for they were all like to be murdered; at the same
time 1 heard the firing of five musquets, which was the
number of the guns they had, and that three times over;
sor, it seems, the natives here were not so easily frighted
with guns as the savages were in America, where 1 had
to do with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter; but
rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I
-caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with
three susils we had on board, to land, and assist our
men.
We got the boat soon to the shore; but our men were
in too much haste, for, being come to the shore,
they plunged into the water, to get to the boat with all
the expedition they could, being pursued by between
three and four hundred men. Our men were but nine in
all, and only five of them had susils with them: the rest,
indeed, had pistols and swords, but they were of small
use to them.
We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty
enough too, three of them being very ill wounded; and
that which was still worse, was, that while we stood in
the boat to take our men in, we were in as much
danger as they were in on shore, for they poured their
'arrows in upon us so thick, that we were sain to barri-
cade the side of the boat up with the benches, and two
or three loose boards, which, to our great satissaction,
we had, by mere accident, or providence rather, in the
boat.
And yet, had it been daylight, they are, it seems*
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen but
the least part of any of us, they would have been sure
of us: we had, by the light of the moon, a little fight
of them, as they stood pelting us from the shore with
darts and arrows; and, having got ready our fire-arms,
we gave them a volley; and we could hear by the cries
of some of them, that we had wounded several; how-
ever, they stood thus in battle-array on the shore till
break of day, which we suppose was, that they might
see the better to take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to,
weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we must
needs stand up in the boat, and they were as sure to hit
us, as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot:
we made signals of distress to the ship, which, though
she rode a league off, yet my nephew the captain,
hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiving the posture
we lay in, and that we fired towards the shore, pretty
well understood us; and weighing anchor with all
speed, he stood as near the shore as he durst with the
ship, and then sent another boat, with ten hands in
her, to assist us, but we called to them not to come
too near, telling them what condition we were in ; how-
ever, they stood in nearer to us; and one of the men,
taking the end of a tow line in his hand, and keeping
our boat between him and the enemy, so that they
could not persectly see him, swam on board us, and
made the line sast to the boat; upon which we flipt our
little cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed
us out of the reach of the arrows, we all the while
lying close behind the barricadowe had made.
As loon as we were got from between the ship and
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, we
ran along just by them, and we poured in a broadside
among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small
bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot, which
made a terrible havoc among them.
When we were got on board, and out of danger, we
had time to examine into the occasion of this fray:
and, indeed, our supercargo, who had been often i'a
those
166
those parts, put me upon it; for he said, he was sure
the inhabitants would not have touched us, after we
had made a truce, if we had not done something to pro-
voke them to it; at length it came out, viz. that an
old woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had
brought it within our poles, with a young woman with
her, who also broughthim some roots or herbs; and while
the old woman (whether she was mother to the young
woman or no, they could not tell) was selling us the
milk, one of our men ofsered some rudeness to the
•wench that was with her: at which the old woman
made a great noise. However, the seaman would not
quit his prize, but carried her out of the old woman's
fight among the trees, it being almost dark: the old
woman went away without her, and, as we suppose,
made an outcry among the people she came from, who,
upon notice, railed this great army upon us in three or
four hours: and it was great odds but we had been all
destroyed.
One of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack, as
lie sallied out of the tent we had made: the rest came
offfree, all but the sellow who was the occasion of all
the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black mis-
tress, for we could not hear what became of him a
great while: we lay upon the shore two days after,
though the wind presented, and made signals for him;
-made our boat sail up shore, and down shore, several
leagues, but in vain: so we were obliged to give him
over: and if he alone had suffered for it, the loss had
been the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing
on shore once more, to tryjf 1 could learn any thing
of him or them: it was the third night after the action,
that 1 had a great mind to learn, if I could by any
means, what mischief we had done, and how the game
stood on the Indian side: I was caresul to do it in the
dark, lest we should be attacked again: but I ought,
indeed, to have been sure, that the men I went with had
been under my command, before I engaged in a thing so
hazardous and mischievous, as I was brought into it
without any knowledge or desire.
We took twenty stout sellows with us as any its the
ship, besides! the supercargo and myself; and we landed
two hours before midnight, at the same place where the
Indians stood drawn Up the evening before: I landed
here, because my design, as I have said, was chiefly to
fee if thev had quitted the field, and if they had left any
marks behind them, or of the mischief we had done
them; and I thought, if we could surprise one or two of
them, perhaps we might get our man again, by way of
exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our men
into two companies, whereof the boatswain commanded
one, and I the other. We neither could hear nor
see any body stir when we landed; so we marched
up, one body at a distance from the other, to the
field of battle. At first we could see nothing, it being
very dark; but by and by, our boatswain, that let! the
first party, stumbled and sell over a dead body. This
made them halt there awhile, for knowing by the cir-
cumstances that they were at the place where the In-
dians had stood, they waited for my coming up; Here
we concluded to halt till the moon began to rise, which
we knew would be in less than an hour; - and then
we would easily discern the havoc we had made among
them. We told two and thirty bodies Upon the
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some had
an arm, and some a leg shot off; and one had his head:
those that were wounded, we supposed they had carried
away.
When we had rtlrtde, as 1 thought, a sull discovery
of all we could come at the knowledge of, I was for
going on board again, but the boatswain and his party
often sent me word, that they were resolved to make a
visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, as they called
them, dwelt; and desired me to go along with them 1
and if they could find them, as they still sancied they
should, they did not doubt, they said, getting a good
booty; and it might be, they might find Thomas Jeffrys
there: that was the man's name we had lost.
Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew'well
enough what answer to have given them; for I .would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing it
was
was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a ship,
and a ship's loading in our charge, and a voyage to
make, which depended very much. upon the lives of
the men; but as they lent me word they were resolved
to go', and only asked me and my company to go along
-with them, 1 positively refused it, and rose up (for
I was littirijr on the ground) in order to go to the
boat; one 01 two or the men began to importune me
to go, and when I still resused positively, began to
grumble, and say they were not under my command,
and they would go. Come, Jack, says one of the men,
will you go with me? I will gi for one. Jack laid
he would; and another followed, and then another, and,
in a word, they all left me but one, whom, with much
disficulty too, I persuaded to stay; so the supercargo
and 1, with one man, went back to the boat, where,
I told them, we would stay for them, and take care to
take in as many of them as mould be left; for I told
them, it was a mad thing they were going about, and
supposed. most of them would run the sate of Thomas
Jeffrys.
They told me, like seamen, they'd warrant it they
would come off again; and they would take care, &c.
So away they went. I entreated them to conlider the
Chip, and the voyage; that their lives were not their
own; and that they were entrusted with the voyage,
iiv. some measure; that if they miscarried, the ship
might be lost for want of their help; and that they
could not answer it to God and man. I said a great
deal more to them on that head, but I might as well
have talked to the main-mart of the ship t they were
mad upon' their journey; only they gave me good
words, and begged I would not be angry; said, they
would be very cautious, and they did not doubt but they
would be back again in about an hour at sarthest; for
the Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile off,
though theyi'oon*k it above two miles before they got
to it.
Well, they all went away, as above; and though the
attempt was desperate, and such as none but madmen
would have gone about, yet, to give them their due,
they went about it warily, as well as boldly. They were
gallantly
gallantly armed, that is true: for they had every man a
susil or musket, a bayonet, and every man a pistol: some
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers; and
the boatswain, and two more, had pole-axes: besides all
•which they had among them 13 hand grenadoes. Bolder
sellows, and better provided, never went about any
wicked work in the world.
When they went out, their chief design was plunder,
and they were in mighty hopes of sinding gold there:
but a circumstance, which none of them were aware of,
set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of them
all: When they came to the sew Indian houses, which
they thought had been the town, which were not above
half a mile off, they were under a great disappointment,
for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses; and
where the town was, or how big, they knew not: they
consulted, therefore, what to do, and were sometime
before they could resolve: for if they sell upon these,
they must cut all their throats; and it was ten to one but
some of them might escape, it being in the night, though
the moon was up; and if one escaped, he would run
away, and raise all the town, so they should have a whole
army upon them. Again, on' the other hand, if they
went away, and left those untouched (for the people
were all afleep) they could not tell which way to look for
the town.
However, the last was the best advice: so they re-
solved to leave those houses, and look for the town as
well as they could: they went on a little way, and'
found a'cow tied to a tree: this they presently con-
cluded would be a good guide to them; for they said
the cow certainly belonged to the.town before them,
or the town behind them; and if they untied her, they
should see which way she went: if she went back, they
had nothing to say to her: but, if she went'forward,
they had nothing to do but to follow her: so they cut
the cord, which was made of twisted stags, and
the cow went on before them: in a word, the cow
led them directly to the town, which, as they re-
ported, consisted of above 200 houses, or huts: and in
some of these, they found several samilies living to-
gether. . i
Here
Here they found all silent; as profoundly secure, as fleer*
Und a country that had never seen an enemy of that kind,
vtould make them: upon this they called another council,
to consider what they had to do; and in a word they re-
solved to divide'themselves into three bodies, and to set
three houses on sire in three parts of the town; and a*
the men came out, to seize them and bind them if
-any resisted, they need hot to be asked what to do then;
and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder; but'
resolved to march silently first through the town, and
fee what dimensions it was of, and consider if they might
venture upon it, or no.'
They did so, and desperately resolved that they WOulA-
venture upon them; but while they were animating one
another to the work, three of them, that -Were a little
before the rest, called out aloud, and told them they had
found Thos. Jeffrys, they all ran up to the place, and so
it was indeed, for there they found the poor sellow hanged
up naked by one arm, and his throat cut: there was an,
Indian house just by the tree, where they found sixteen
or seventeen of the principal Indians, who had been con-
cerned in the fray with us before, and two or three of
them wounded with our (hot; and our men found they
were awake, and talking one to another in that house,
but knew not their number.
The sight of their p&or mangled comrade A enraged
them as before, that they swore to one another, they
would be revenged, and that not an Indian who came
into their'hands should have quarter; and to work they
went immediately; and yet not so madly as by the rage
and fury they were in might be expected. Their first
care was to get something that would ioon take fire;
but after a little search, they found that would be to no
purpose, for most of the houses were low, and thatched
with flags or rushes, of which the Country is sull; so
they presently made some wild sire, as we call it, by wet-
ting a little powder in the palms of their hands; and in
a quarter of an hour, they set the town on fire in four
or sive places; and particularly that house where the
Indians were not gone to bed. As soon as the sire began
to blaze, the poor frighted creatures began to ruth out
to save their lives; but met with their sate in the at-
vol. H. h tempt,
tempt, and especially at the door, where they drove then*
back, the boatswain himself killing one or two with his
polc-ax; the house being large, and many in it, he did
snot care to go in, but called for an hand-grenado, and
threw it among them, which, at first, frighted them;
but when it burst, made such havock among them, that
they cried out in a hideous manner.
In short, most of the Indians who were in the open
:part of the house, were killed or hurt with the grenado,
<except two or three more, who pressed to the door,
which the boatswain and two more kept with the bayo-
nets in the muzzles of their pieces, and dispatched all
-who came that way. But there was another apartment
in the house, where the prince or king, or whatsoever
lie was, and several others, were; and they kept in, till
4he house, which was bv this time all of a light flame,
sell in upon them, and they were smothered, or burnt
together.
All this while they fired not a gun, because they would
jiot waken the people saster than they could master
them: but the sire began to waken them sast enough,
and our sellows were glad to keep a little together in
bodies; for the fire grew so raging, all the bouses be-
ing made of light combustible stuff, that they could
hardly bear the street between them' and their business
was to follow the fire for the surer execution: as sast as
the fire either forced the people out of those houses which
were burning, or frighted them out of others, our peo-
ple were ready at their doors to knock them on the head,
Jlill calling and hallooing to one another to remember
Thomas Jeffrys.
While this was doing, I must consess I was very un-
easy, and especially, when I saw the flames of the town,
which, it being night, seemed to be just by me.
My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men
4oo, seeing inch a sire, was very uneasy, not knowing
what tlie matter was, or what danger 1 was in; espe-
cially hearing the guns too; for by this time they began
*o use their fire-arms: a thousand thoughts oppressed his
mind concerning me and the supercargo, what should
become osu9j and at last though he could ill spare any
Jttore men, yet, not knowing what exigence we might
in, he tikes another boat, and with thirteen men and
himself comes on shore to me.
He was' surprised to see me and the supercargo in the
boat, with no more than two men, for one had beea
Jest to keep the boat; and though he was glad that we
were well, yet he was in the lame impatience with us to
know what was doing; for the noise -continued, and the
name increased: I consess it was next to an impossibility
for any men in the world to restrain their curiosity of
knowing what had happened, or their concern for the
sasety of the men. .In a word, the captain told me, he
would go and help his men,' let what would come. I
argued with him, as I did before with the men, the sase-
ty of the ship, and the danger of the voyage, the interest
of the owners and merchants, &c. and told him I would
go, and the two men, and only see if we could, at a
distance learn what was like to be the event, and come
back and tell him.
It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk
to the rest before; he would go, he said, and he only
wished he had lest but ten men in the ship; for he could.
not think of having his men lost for want of help: he
had rather he said lose the ship, the voyage, and his
lise, and all; and so away went he.
Nor was I any more able to stay behind now than I
was to persuade them not to go before; so, in short, the
captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace, and
setch twelve men more from the ship, leaving the long-
boat at an anchor; and that when they came back, six
men should keep the two boats, and six more come after
Bs.; so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the
whole ship's company consisted of b'5 men, whereof two
-were lost in the first quarrel which brought this mischief
on.
Being now on the march,'iyou may be sure we selt
little of the ground we trod on; and being guided by
the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to the
place of the flame. If the noise(of the guns were
surprising to us before, the cries of the p :or people
-were now quite of another nature, and filled us with
horror. I must consess I never was at the sacking of
a city, or at the taking of a town by storm; I have
h2 heard
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland,
and killing man, woman, and child; and I had read of
Count Tilly sacking of the city of Magdeburg, and cut-
ting the throats/os 22,000 of both sexes; but 1 never had.
an idea, of the thing itself before; nor is it possible to
describe it, or the horror which was upon our minds
at hearing it.
However we went on, and at length, came to the
town, though there was no entering 'the streets of it
sor the fire. The first object we met with, was the
ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, for the
house was consumed; and just before it, plain now to
be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and three
'Women killed; and as we thought, one or two more
lay in the heap among the fire. In short, these were
such instances of rage altogether barbarous, and of a
sury something beyond what was human, that we thought
it impossible our men could be guilty of it; or if
they were the authors of it, we thought that every one
of them ought to be put to the worst of deaths: but
this was not all; we saw the fire increased forward, and
the cry went on just as the fire went on, so that we were
in the utmost consusion. We advanced a little way sar-
ther; and beheld, to our astonishment, three women na-
ked, crying in a most dreadsul manner, and flying as if
they ha<l, indeed, had wings, and after them, sixteen or
feventeen men, natives, in the same terror and consterna- .
tion, wivii three of our English butchers (tor I«call
. them no better) in the rear; who, when they could not
overtake. them, fired in among them, and one that was
killed by their shot sell down in our sight; when the
rest saw us, be!ie\ing us to be their enemies, and that we-
would murder them, as well as those that pursued them,
they set up a most dreadsul shriek, especially the women,
and two of them sell down as if already dead with the
sright.
My very foul shrunk within me, and my blood ran
/chill in my veins when I saw this; and I believe, had
the three Knglith sailors that pursued them come on, I
had made our men kill them all. However, we took
tome ways to let the poor flying creatures know that
we
-we would not hurt them; and immediately they earner
Hp to us, and kneeling down, with their hands lifted upr
made piteous lamentations to us to save them-, which we
let them know we would do; whereupon they kept all
together'in a huddle, close behind us, for protection. I
left my men drawn up together, and charged them to
hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at some of our peo-
ple, and see what devil it was possessed them, and what
they intended to do; and, in a word, to command them
off; assuring them, that if they stayed till daylight,
they would have a hundred thousand men about their
ears: I say I left them, and went among those flying
people, taking only two of our men with me ; and there
was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among them; some of
them had their seet tewibly burnt with trampling and
sunning through the fire; others their hands burnt, one
of the women had sallen down in the fire, and was almost:
burnt to death before she could get out again; two ox
three of the men had/ cuts in their backs and thighs, from-
our men pursuing, and another was shot through the
'body, and died while I was there.
, I would sain have learned what the occasion of all
this was, but I could not understand one word they said i
though by signs 1 perceived that some of them knew
tot what was the occasion themselves. I was so terri-
fied in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt, that i
'could not stay there, but went back to my own men;
I told them my resolution, and commanded them to
sollow' me, when in the very moment came fqur of our
men, with the boatswain at their head, running over the
heaps of bodies they had killed^ all covered with blood
and dust, as if they wanted more people to massacre
when our men hallooed to them as loud as they could
halloo; and, with much ado, one of them made then*
hear; so that they knew who we were, and came up to-
Ms.
As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo
like a shout of triumph, for having, as he thought,
more help come; and without bearing to hear me, cap-
tain, says he, noble captain, 1 am glad you are come;
we have not half done yet; villains! hell-hound dogs!

H 3
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I will kill as many of them as poor Tom has hairs upoa
his head. We have sworn to spare none of them; we
will root out the very' name of them from the earth ; and
thus he ran on, out of breath too with action, and would
not give us leave to speak a word.
At last, raising my voice that I might silence him
a little, Barbarous dog! said I, what are you doing?
1 won't have one creature touched more, upon pain of
death'. I charge you, upon your lise, to stop your
hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead man this
minute.
Why Sir, says he, do you know what you do, or
what they have done? If you want a reason for what
we have done, come hither; and with that he shewed
me the poor sellow hanging upon a tree with his throat
cut.
I consess I was urged then myself, and at another
time should have been tWward enough: but I thought
they had carried their rage too sar, and thought of
Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, « Curled be
their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was
cruel.' But 1 had now a new taste upon my hands; for
when the men 1 carried with me saw the sight, as 1 had
done, I had as much to do to restrain them, as I should
have had with the others; nay, my nephew himself
sell in with them, and told me, in their heading, that
he was only concerned for sear of the men being over-
powered; for, as to the people, he thought not one of
them ought to live; for they had all glutted themselves
with the murder of the poor man, and that they ought
to be used like murderers; upon these words, away
ran eight of my men with the boatswain and his crew,
to complete their bloody work ;. and 1, seeing it quite
out of my power to restrain them, came away pensive
and sad, for I could not bear the sight, much less the
horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that sell
jiito their hands.
I got nobody to come back with me but the super-
cargo and two men, and with these I walked back to
the boats. It was a very great piece of folly in me, I
consess, to venture back, as it were alone; for, as it
began now to be almost day, and the alarm had run
- '• - ' over.
Over the country, there stood about forty men armed'
with lances and bows at the little place where the twelve'
or thirteen houses stood mentioned before; but by acci-
dent I missed the place, and came directly to the sea-1
side; and by that time T got to the sea-side it was broad'
day; immediately I took the pinac'e, and went aboard,
and sent her baek to assist the men in what might'
happen.
v I observed that about the time I came to theboat-'
side, the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated ;'
but in about half an hour after I got on board, I heard
a volley of our men's fire-arms,. and saw a great smoke;'
this, as I understood afterwards, -was our men salling
.upon the forty men, who, as I said, stood at the sew
houses on she way; of whom they killed 16 or 17, and
set all those houles on fire, but did not medJle with the
women or children. -!
By that time the men got to the shore again with the
pinnace, our men began to appear; they came drop-J
ping in, some and some; not in two bodies, and in form,'
as they went out, but all in heaps, straggling.here and
therein such a manner, that a small force of resolute men'
might have cut them all'off.
But the dread of them was upon the whole country j
the people were amazed, and surprised, and so frighted/
that ! believe, an hundred of them would have fled at
the fight of but five of our men. Nor in all this terrible''
action was there a man who made any considerable de-
sence; they were so surprised between the terror of the
. sire, and the sudden attack of our men in the dark;< that
they knew not which way to turn themselves ; for if they5
fled one way, they were met by one party ; if back again,
by another; so that they were every where knocked down.
Nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except
'one who strained his foot, and another had one of his"
hands very much burnt.
I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and,
rndeecf, with all the men, in my mind, but with him iri
particular; as well for his acting so out of his duty, as'
commander of the •soip, and having the charge of the
voyage upon him, as in his prompting, rather than cool-
the rage of his men, in so bloody and cruel an en-
h 4 terprit'e;
terprise; my nephew answered me very respectsully *
but told me that when he saw the body ot' the poor. fea-
man, whom they had murdered in such a cruel and bar-
barous manner, he was not master of himseif, neither
could he govern his passion; he owned, he should not
have done so, as he was commander of the ship r-JsRit, as.
be was a man, aad nature moved him, he could not bear
it. As for the relt of the men, they were not subject:
to me at all: and they knew it well enough; so they
took no notice of my dislike.
- T he next day we set sail: so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the
number they killed: some said one thing, some another :-
but, according to the bell of their .accounts put all to-
gether, they killed, or destroyed, about 150 people,
-women, and children, aad left not a house standing in
the town.
As for the poor sellow Thomas Jeffrys, as he was
quite dead, for his throat was so cut that his head was.
half off, it would do him no service to bring him away ;•
so they left him where they found him, only took hita
down from the tree where he was hanged by one hand.
However just as our men thought this action to be, I
was against them in it: and I always, after that time,.
told them God would blast the voyage: for Hooked up-
on the blood ^hey shed that night to be murder in them -
for though it is true that they killed Thomas Jeffrys, yet
it was as true that Jeffry6 was the aggressor, had broken
the truce, and had violated er debauched a young woman
cf theirs, who came to our camp innocently, and on the
ijiith of their capitulation..
The boatswain desended this quarrel when we were
afterwards on board. He said, it was true that we
ieemed to break the truce, but really had not; and that
she war was begun the night before by the natives them-
selves, who had shot at us, and killed one of our men
without any just provocation: so that, as we were in a
capacity to irght*them, we mi<;bt also be in a capacity
to do ourselves justice upon them in an extraordinary
manner: that though the poor man had taken liberty
with a wench, he ought not to have been murdered, and
4.bat in such a vlllanous manner: and that they did no-*
thing but what wa£ just, and that the laws of God al-
lowed to be done to murderers.
One would think this should have been enough to
have warned us against going on shore among heathens
and barbarians; but it is impossible to make mankind
wise, but at their own experience; and (heir experience
feems to be always of most use to them, when it is dear-
est bought.
We were now bound to the gulph of Persia, and'sroms
thence to the coast os Coro'maadel, only to touch at
Surat; but the chief of the supercargo's design lay at the
bay os Bengal, where, if he missed of the business out-
ward-bound, he was to go up to Qhina, and return to
the coast as he came home.;
The first disaster that besel u-3 was tn the Gulph of
Persia, where five of our men, venturing onshore ori the
Arabian: side of the Gulph, were surrounded by the
Arabs, and either all killed or carried away .into slavery y
the rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them,
and had but just time to get off their boat ; I began to
upbraid them with the just retribution of heaven in this
case; but the boatswain very warmly told me, he
thought i went sarther in my censures.than I could shew
any warrant for in scripture, and reserred to the thir-
teenth of St Luke, ver. 4. where our Saviour intimates,
that those men, on- whom the Towdfr of Siloam sell,
-were not sinners above all the Galileans ; but that which,
indeed, put me to silence in this case, was, that n6ne of
these five men, who were now lost, were of theTfombe'r
of those who went on shore to the massacre ofmada-
gascar (so 1 always called it, though our men could not
bear the word massacre with any patience); and, indeed*
this last circumstance, as 1 have laid, put me to silence
for the present.
But my frequent preaching to them ori this subject
had worse consequences than I expected; and the boat-
swain, who had been the head of the attempt, fame up-
boldly to me one time, and told me, he sound jhat
I continually brought that affair upon the stage; that
I made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the
men very ill on that account, and himself in p. Jocu-
lar: that as I was but a passenger, and had no cora-
. H 5 inand
mand in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they ware
not obliged to bear it; that they did not know but I
might have some ill design in my head, and, perhaps,
call them to an account tor it, when they came to Eng-
land; and that therefore, unless I would resolve to have
done with it, and also not to concern myself sarther
with him,'or any of his assairs, he would leave the
ship; for he did' not think it was sase to sail with me
among them.
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him, that I did consess I had all alpng op-
posed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I would al-
ways call it; and that I had on all occasions spoken
my mind freely about it, though not more upon him.
than any of the rest; that as to my having no command
in.the ship, that was true, nor did I' exercise any au-
thority, only took the liberty of speaking my mind in
things which publicly concerned us all; as to what
concern 1 had in the voyage, that was none of his
business; I was a considerable owner of the ship, and
in that claim I conceived 1 had a right to speak, even
sarther than I had yet done, and wouldnot.be account-
able to him,. or any one else; and began to be a little
warm with him: be made but. little reply to me at
that time, and I thought that affair had been over.
We were at thisgtime invthe road to Bengal: and, being
willing to. see the place, I went on shore with the
supercargo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself; and
towards evening was preparing to go on board, when
one of the men came to me, and told me, he would not
have me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for
they had orders not to carry me on board. Any one
may guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a mes-
sage; and! asked the man, who bade him deliver th^t
errant to me? He told me the cockswain. I said no
more to the sellow, but bade him let them know he had
delivered bis. message, and that I had given him no an-
swer to iti
I immediately went, and' found out the supercargo^
and told him the story, adding, what I. presently fore-
saw^ viz.. that there would certainly be a mutiny in the
ship j. and iatreated him to go. immediately.on board the
ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the captain of it:
but I might have spared this intelligence, for, before I
'had spoken to him on shore, the matter was efsected ca.
board: the boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and.
in a word, all the inserior osficerSi as soon as 1 was-
gone osf in the boat, came up to the quarter-deck,. and
desired to speak with the captain; and there the boat-
swain, making a long harangue (for the sellow talked
vary well), and repeating all he had said to rhe,' told'
the captain in a sew words, that as I was now gone
peaceably on shore, they were loth to use any vio-
lence with me; which, if 1 had not gone on shore,.
they would otherwil'e have donS, to oblige me to have
gone. They therefore thought fit to tell him, that as>
they shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his
command, they would perform it saithsully: but if 1 •
-would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit
it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no sarther with..
him? and at that word ALL, he turned his sace about'
towards the main-mast, which was, it teems, the signal
agreed on between them; at which all the seamen.being
got together, they cried out, One and A-LL! One and:
ALL •:
My nephew, the captain, was a reran of spirit, .and of .
great presence of mind; and though he was surprised,.
you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told them calmlyv •
he would coniider of the matter; but that he could do,
nothing na.it till he had spoken to me about it; he used.
some arguments with them, to shew them the unreason-
ableness and injustice of the thing; but it was. all in
vain; they swore, and shook hands round, before his.
sace, that they would go all on shore, unless he would
encase to them . not to susfer me to come on board the.
ship. . -
This was an hard article upon him, who knew his:
obligation to me, and did not kno.w how 1 might take
it; so he began to talk cavalierly to them; told them,.
that I was a considerable owner of the ship, and
that in justice he could not put me out of my own
house; that this was next door. to serving me as she
famous pirate Kid had done, who made the mutiny ia
the ship, set- the captain on shore in an uninhabited.

ADVENTURES OP ROBINSON CRUS©B.
island, .and ran away with the ship: that let them go.
into what ship they would, if ever they came to Eng-
land again, it would cost them dear ; that the ship was
mine, and that he would not put me out of it: and that
he would rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than
disoblige me so much; so they might do as they pleas-
ed. However* he would go on more* and talk witha
me there; and invited ifte boatswain to go with him,
and perhaps they might accommodate the matter with.
me.
But they all rejected the proposal; and said, they
-would have nothing to do with me no more, neither
on board, nor on shore; and if I came on board, they
-would go on shore. Well said'the captain, if you are:
all of this mind let me go on shore, and talk with him j.
so away he came to me with this account, a little after
the message had been brought to me from. the cock-
swain.
I was very glad to see my nephew, I must consess;
for I was not without apprehensions that they would
consine him by violence, set sail, and run away with the-
ship; and then I had teen strips naked in a remote
country, and nothing to help myself: in short, 1 had
been in a worse case than when I was all alone in the
island.
But they hod not come to that: length, it seems, to my
great satissaction; and when my nephew told me what
they had said to him, ami how they. had sworn, and:
shook hands, that they would one and all leave the ship,.
if I was suffered to come on board, 1 told him, he shoulci
not be concerned at it at all,, for I would stay on shore
I only desired he would take care and send me all my
necessary things.on shore, and leave me a sufficient sum.
of money, and I would find mv way to England as well.
as I could.
This was ai heavy piece of news to my nephew; but
there was no way to help it, but to comply with it.
So in short, he went on board the ship again, and satis-
fied the men, that his uncle had yielded to their im-
portunity, and had sent for his goods from on board
the ship. So the matter was over in a very sew.-
4 hours,;.
hours; the men returned to their duty, and I begun t»
consider what course I should steer.
I was now alone in the remotest part of the world,
as I think I may call it, for I was near three thousand
leagues, by sea, sarther otf from England, th ', I was
at my island; only, it is true, I might travel here by
land over the Great Mogul's country to Surat, might
go from thence to Bassora hy sea, up the Gulf of
Persia, and from thence might take the way of the ca-
ravans, over the deserts of Arabia to Aleppo and Scan-
deroon; from thence by sea again to Italy, and so oveir
land into France: and this, put together, might be, at
least, a sull diameter of the globe ;. but, if it were to be
rneafured,. I suppose it would appear to be a great deal
more.
1 had another way before me, which was to wait for
Ibme English ships, which were coming to Bengal, from
Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get passage on
board them sot England: but as I came hither without
any concern with the English East India Company, so it
would be difficult to go from hence without their licence,
unless with great- savour of the eaptains of the ships, or
of the company's sactors; and to both. I was an utter
stranger.
Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by con-
trarieties, to see the ship set sail without me; a treat-
ment, 1 think, a man in my circumstances scarce ever
Biet with, except from- pirates running away with a
ship, and setting those that would not agree with their
-villany on shore; indeed this was the next door to it,
both ways: however, my nephew left me two ser-
vants, or rather, one companion and one servant
the first was elerk to the purser, whom he engaged to.
go with me, and the other wa9 bis own servant. I
took me also a good lodging in the house of an English-
woman, where several. merchants lodged, some
French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one English-
man. Heie I was handsomely enough entertained; and
that I might not be said to run rashly upon :ny thing, 1
staid here above nine months, considering what course
to take, and how to manage myself; I had some English"
goods with- me, of value, and a considerable sum of
money,
money, my nephew surnishing me with a thousand'
pieces of eight, and a letter'of credit for more, if I had
occasion,.that I might not be straitened, whatever might
happen.
I quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage
too; and, as 1 originally intended, I bought here some
very good diamonds, which, of all other things, was the
most proper for me, in my circumstances,. because t
might always carry my whole estate about me.
After a long stay here, and many proposals made for
my return to England; but .none salling to my mind, the
English merchant, who lodged with me, and with whom.
I had contracted an intimate acquaintance, came to me
one morning: Countryman, says he, I have a project to
communicate to you, which, as it suits with my
thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with your's also,
when you shall have thoroughly considered it.
Here we are posted, says he, you by accident, and I by
my own choice, in a part of the world very remote from/
our own country; but it is in a country where, by us
who understand trade and business, a great deal of money.
is to be got: if you will put a thousand pounds to my
thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here, the sirst we
can get to our minds; you shall be captain, I will be
merchant, and we will go a trading voyage to China; for'
what should we stand still for? 'The whole world is in.
motion, rolling.round and round; all the creatures of
God, heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent,!
why should we be idle? There are no drones, says he,
living in the world but men: why should we be of that.
number?
1 liked this proposal very well, and the more, because.
it seemed to be expressed with so much good will, ancL
info friendly a manner; I will not say that I might,
by my loose and unhinged circumstances, be the fitter to.
embrace a proposal for trade, and, indeed, for any thing
else, or otherwise trade was none of my element: how-
ever, I might, perhaps, say, with some truth, that if
trade was not my element, rambling was ;. and no pro-
posal for seeing any part of the world which 1 had nev er
seen. before, could possibly come amiss to me,.
It was, however, sometime before we could get a
ship to our mind; and when .we got a vessel, it was
not easy to get English sailors; that is to say, so many as
were necessary to govern the voyage, and manage the
sailors which we should pick there; after some time we
sot a mate, a boatswain, tfnd a gunner, English; a
)utch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast men;
with these, we found we could do well enough, having.
Indian seamen, such as they are, to make up^
There are so many-travellers who have written the
history of their voyages and travels this way, that it
would be but very little diversion to any body to give
a long account of the places we went to, and the people
who inhabit there; thole things I leave to others, and
leave the reader to those journals and travels of English-
men, many of which, I sind, are published, and more
promised every day: it is enough for me to tell you,.
that we made the voyage to Achin, in the island of
Sumatra, sirst; and from thence to Sianv where we ex-
changed some of our wares for opium, and-for some
arrack; the first, a commodityywhich bears a great price
among the Chinese, and which, at that time, was very
much wanted there: in a word, *'e went up to Susham,
made a very great voyage, were eight months out, and
returned' to Bengal; and 1 was very well satisfied with
my adventure. I observe that our people in England
often admire how the officers, which the company send
into India, and the merchants which generally stay there
get such very good estates as they do, and sometimes
come home worth sixty, seventy^ and an hundred thou-
sand pounds at a time.
But it is no wonder, or, at least, we slrall fee so much
sarther into it,. when we consider the innumerable ports
and places where they have a free commerce, that it will
then be no wonder; and much less will it be so, whert
-we consider, that all those places and ports where the
English ships come, there is so much, and such constant
demand for the growth of all other countries, that there is
a certain vent for the return, as well as a market-abroad
for the goods carried out.
In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so
ucb money by the first adventure, and such an insight
into the method of getting more, that, had I been twenty
years younger, I should have been tempted to have staid)
here, and sought no sarther for making my fortune: bat
-what was all this to a man on the wrong side of three-
score, that was rich enough, and came abroad more in
obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world, than a.
covefous desire of getting in it?' And, indeed, I think,
it is with great justice that I now eall it a restless desire
for it was so: when I was at hosae, 1 was restless to go
abroad, and now I was abroad, I was restless to be at
home. I say, what was this gain to me? 1 was rich
enough already, nor had I any uneasy desires about
getting more money; and therefore the profits of the
voyage to me were things of no great force to me for
the prompting me forward to sarther undertakings:
hence I thought, that by this voyage I had made no
progress at all; because I was come bade, as I might
call it, to the place from whence 1 came, as to an home •
whereas my eye, which, like that which Solomon speaks
of, was never satisfied. with seeing, was still more desirous
©f wandering and seeing. I was come into a part of the
world which I never was in before, and that part in par-
ticular which I had heard much of; and was resolved to
see as much of it as I could; and then I thought 1 might
say, I had seen all the world that was worth seeing.
J5ut my sellow traveller and 1 had different notions;
Idonot name this to insist upon my own, for I acknow-
ledge his was most just, and the most suited to the end off
a merchant's lise, who, when he is abroad upon adven-
tures, it is his wisdom to stick to that, as the best thing
for him, which he is like to get the most money by r.
My new friend kept himself to the nature of the thing,
and would have been content to have gone like a carrier's
horse, always to the same inn, backward and forward*
provided he could, as he called it, find his aecount in
it: on the other nand, mine, old as I was, was the no-
tion .of a mad rambling boy, that never cares to see a
thing twice over.
But this was not all: I had a kind of impatience
ea me to be nearer home* and yet the most unsettled
resolution imaginable, which way. to go: in the inter-
val o£ these consultations, my friend, -who' was'always
uponv_
upon the search for business, proposed another voyage
to me, viz. among the spice-issands, and to bring home
a load of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts;
.places where, indeed, the Dutch do trade,-but the
islands belong partly to Spaniards; though we went not
so sar, but to some other, where they have not the whole
power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were
not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief difficulty
was in bringing me to come into it; however, at last,
nothing else offering, and finding that really stirring
about and trading, the profit being so great, and, as I
may say, certain, had more pleasure in it, and more sa-
tissaction to the mind, than fitting still; which, to me
especially, was the unhappiest part of my lise, 1 resolved
on this voyage too, which we made very successsully,
touching at Bornea, and several islands, whole names I
do not remember, and came home in a'bout five months.
We fold our spice, which was chiefly cloves, and some
nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried them
away for the Gulph; and making near five of one, we
really got a great deal of money.
My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at
nae: Well now, said he, with a sort of an agreeable in-
sult upon my indolent temper, is not this better than
walking about here, like a man of nothing to do, and
spending our time in staring at the nonsense and igno-
rance os .the Pagans? Why truly, said I, my friend, I
think it is, and I begin to. be a convert to the principles
of merchandizing; but 1 must tell you, said I, by the
-way, you do not know what 1 am doing: for if once I
conquer my backwardness, and' embark heartily, as old
as I am, I shall harrass you up and dcKvn the world tilt
I tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall nevee
let you lie still.
But to be short with my speculations; a little while
after this there came in a Dutch. ship from Batavias; she
-was a coaster, not an European trader, and of about
two hundred tons burthen: the men, as they^pretended*
having been so sickly, that the captain had not men
enough to go to sea with, he lay by at Bengal i and, as
if having got money enough, or being willing, for other
reasons, to go for. Europe, he gave public notice,. that
he would fell his ship. - This came to my ears before* my
new partner heard of it; and I had a great mind to buy'
it: so I went home to him , and told him of ithe con-
siders awhile, for he was no rash man neither: but, mu-
sing some time, he replied, She is a little too big; but,
however, we will have her. Accordingly we bought
the ship; and, agreeing with the master, we paid'forher,-
and t ok possession. When we had done so, we resolved'
to entertain the men, if we could, to join them with
-<hose we had, for the pursuing our business: but on a?
sudden, they having not received thek wages, but their
share cf the money, as we afterwards learnt, not one of
them was to be found. We enquired much about them,
and at length were told, that they were all gone together
by land to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence;
and from thence were to travel to- Surat, and so by sea to-
the Gulph of Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, as
that I missed the opportunity of going with them; for
such a ramble,-1 thought, and in luch company as would
both have guarded me, and diverted me, would have
suited mightily with my great design; and 1 should both
have seen the world, and gone homewards too: but I
•was much better satisfied a sew days after,' when I came
tp know what sort of sellows they were; for, in short,
their history was, that this man they called captain
was the gunner only, not the commander; that they
had been a trading voyage, in whieh they were attacked
on the shore by some, of the Malaccans, who had
killed the captain and three of his men; and that after
the captain was killed, these men, eleven in' number,
bad resolved to run away with the ship, which they did;
and had brought her in at the bay of BengaH leaving
the mate and five men more on shore, of whom we shall'
bear sarther.
Well, let them come by the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though we did
not, I consess, examine into things so exactly as
we ought, for we never enquired any thing of the
seamen, who; if we had examined, would certainly
have saultered in their accounts, contradicted one ano-'
ther, aad,. perhaps, contradicted themselves; or, one
who
how or other, we should have seen reason to have sus-
pected them; but the man shewed us a bill of sale for
the (hip, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such
name (for I suppose it was all a forgery), and called him-
self by that name; and we would not contradict him';
and being withall a little too. unwary, or at least, having
no suspicion of the thing, we -&ent through with our
bargain.
However, we picked up some English seamen here
after this, and some Dutch; and we now resolved for a
second voyage to the south-east, for cloves, &c. that is
to say, among. the Phillippine and Malacca isles j and
- in short, not to fill this part of my story with trifles, when
what is yet to corrre is so remarkable, I spent, from first
to last, • six years in this country, tracing from port to
port, backward and forward, and with very good success;
and was now the last year with my partner, going in
the ship above-mentioned on a voyage to China; but
designing first to Siam, to buy rice.
In this voyage, being, by contrary winds, obliged to
beat up and down a great while in the ftreights of Ma-
lacca, and among the islands, were no sooner got clear of
those difficult seas, but we found our ship bad sprung a
leak, and we were not able, by all our industry, to find
out where it was. This forced us to make for some port;
and my partner, who knew the country better than I did,
directed the captain to put into the river of Cambodia;
for I had made the English mate, one Mr. Thomson,
captain, not being. willing to take the charge of the ship
upon myself. This river lies on the north-side of the
great bay orgulph, which goes up to Sianr.
While we were here, and going often on shore for re-
freshment, there comes to me one day an Englishman,
and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board an Eng-
lish East India ship, which rode in the same river, up at,
or near the city of Cambodia; what brought him hither
-we knew-not, but he comes up to me, arid speaking
English: Sir, says he, you are a stranger to me and I to
<you, but I have something to tell you that very nearly
concerns you. .'
I looked steadily at him a good while, and he thought
at first I had known him, but I did not: If it very nearly
concerns roe, said 1, and-not yourself, what moves you
to.'
to tell it me? I am moved, says he, by the imminent
d:inger you are in, and, for aught I see, you have no-
knowledge of it. I know no danger I am in, said I,
but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out; but I
propose to lay her aground to-morrow, to see if I can
find it out. But, Sir, says he, leaky, or not leaky, find
it, or not find it, you will be wiser than to lay your ship
on shore to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say
to you: Do you know, Sir, said he, the town of Cam-
bodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river; and there
are two large English ships about five leagues on this
side, and three Dutch? Well, said I, and what is that
to me? Why, Sir, says he, is it for a man that is upon
such adventures as you are, to come into- port, and not
examine first what ships there are there, and whether he is
able to deal with them? I suppose you do not think you
are a match for them. I was amused very much at his dis-
course, but not amazed at it, for I could not conceive
what he meant; and I turned short upon him, and said,
Sir, I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot imagine
what reason 1 have to be afraid of any of the company's
ships, or Dutch ships; 1 am no interloper; what can
they have to say to me I
He looked like a man half angry, hats pleased;
and, pausing a while, but smiling, Well, Sir, says he, it
you think yourself secure, you must take your chance ;.
I am sorry your sate should blind you against good
advice; but assure yourself, if you do not put to sea.
immediately, you will the very next tide be attacked
by five long-boats sull- of men; and, perhaps, if
you are taken, you will be Ranged for a pirate, and
the particulars examined into afterwards: I thought,
Sir, added he, 1 should have met with a better reception
than this, for'doing you a piece of service of such im-
portance I can never be ungratesul, said I, for any
service, or to any man that offers me any kindness j
ut it is past my comprehension, said I, what they should
ave such a design upon me for: However, since
you say there is no time to be lost, and that there
is some villanous design in hand against me, t
will go on board this minute, and put to sea im-
mediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we can
swink
swim without stopping: But, Sir, said I, shall I go
away ignorant of the reason of all this? Can you give
me no surther light into it?
I can tell you but part of the story, Sir, says he; but
I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and, I believe, I
could persuade him to tell you the rest; but there is
scarce time for it: but the short of the story is this, the
first part' of which, 1 suppose, you know well enough,
viz. Th«t you were with this ship at Sumatra; that
there your captain was murdered by the Malaccans,
with three of his men; and that you, or some of those
that were on board with you, ran away with the ship,
and are since turned PIRATES'. This is the sum of the
story, and you will all be seiaed as pirates, [ can assure
you, and executed with very little ceremony; .for you
know merchant's ships shew but little law to pirates, if
they get them in their power.
Now you speak plain English, said 1, and I thank
you; and though I know nothing that we have done,
like what you talk of, but I am sure we came honestly
and sairly by the ship, yet, seeing such work is a
-doing, as you fay, and that you seem to mean honestly,
1 will be upon my guard. Nay, Sir, says he, do not
talk of being upon your guard; the best desence is to
&e. out of the danger; if you have any regard to your
lise, and the lives of all your men, put out to sea,
-without sail at high-water; and as you have a whole tide
before you, you will be gone too sar out before they
-can come down; for they will come away at high-
water; and as they have twenty miles to come, you'll
get near two hours of them by the difference of the
tide, not reckoning the length of the way. Besides,
as they are only boats, and nos ships, they will not
venture to follow you sar out to sea, especially if it
blows. N- . .
Well, said.J, you have been very kind in this: What
stiall 1 do for you, to make you amends? Sir, says he,
you may not be so willing to make me amends, be-
cause you may not be convinced of the truth of it; I
will make an offer to you: I have nineteen months pay
due to me on board the ship .., which I came out
«f England in; and the Dutchman, that is with me, has:
feven months pay due to him; if you will make good
our pay to us, we will go along with you: if you find
nothing more in it, we will desire no more; but if we
do convince you that we have saved your lise. and the
stiip, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave the
rest to you.
1 consented to this readily, -and went immediately on
board, and the two men with- me. As soon as I came
to the ship fide, my partner, who was on board, came
out on the quarter-deck, and called to me, with a great
deal of joy, O ho1. O ho! we have stopped the leak!
we have stopped the leak! Say you so! said I, thank
God! but weigh the anchor then immediately: Weigh!
says he; what do you mean by that? What is the mat-
ter? says he. Ask no questions, said I, but all hands to
work and weigh, without losing a minute. He was
surprised; but, however, he called the captain, and he
immediately ordered the anchor to be got up; and
though the tide was not quite done, yet a little land-breeze
blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I called him
into the cabin, and told him the story at large; and we
called in the men, and they told us the rest of it; but as
it took us up a great deal of time, so before we had done,
a seamen comes t° the cabin door, and calls out to us
that the captain bade him tell us we were chased:
Chased! said I, by whom and by what? By five sloops,
or boats, said the sellow, sull of men. Very well, said
I; then it is apparent there is something in it. In the
next place, T ordered all our men to be called up, and
told them, that there was a design to seize the ship,
and to take us for pirates; and asked them if they
would stand by us, and by one another? The men an-
swered, cheersully, that one and all, they would live aad
die with us. Then I asked the captain, what way he
thought best for us to manage a sight with him; for,
resist them 1 resolved we would, and that to the' last
drop. He said readily, that the way was to keep them
off with our great shot, as long as we could, and
then to fire at them with our small arms, to keep ihem
from boarding us; but when neither of these would do
any longer, we would retire to our close quarters; per-
haps they had not materials to break openour bulk-heads,
or get in upon us.
A The
The gunner had in the mean time, orders to bring two
guns to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear
the deck, and load them with musquet-bullets, and small
pieces of old iron, and what next came to hand ; and thus
-we made ready for fight: but all this while kept out to
sea, with wind enough, and could see the boats at a dis-
tance, being five large long-boats following us, with all
the fail they could make.
Two of these boats, 'which by our glasses, we could
see, were English, ihad out-sailed the rest, were near two
leagues ahead of them, and gained upon us considerably;
£o that we sound they would come up' with us: upon
which we fired a gun without a shdt, to intimate that
•they should bring to: and we put out a flag of truce,
as astgnal for parley: but they kept crowding after us,
till they came within shot; upon this we took in our
narhite flag, they having made no answer to it, hung out
the reg fla^, and fired at them with shot: 'Notwithstand-
ing this, they came on till they were near enough to call
-to them with a speaking trumpet, which we had on
board: so we called them, and bade them keep off at
their peril.
1t was all one, they crouded after us, and endeavoured
*o come under our stern, so to board us on our quarter-
•upon which, seeing they were resolute for mischief, and
depended upon the strength that followed them, 1 ordered
to bring the strip to, so that they lay upon our broad-
side, when immediately we fired five guns at them -: one
of them had been levelled so true as to carry away the
ftern of the hindermost boat, and bring them to the
-necessity of taking down their sail, and running all to
•the head of the boat to keep her from linking; so she lay
by, and had enough of it .; but, seeing the foremost boat
itill crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in
particular.
While this was doing, one of three boats that was
behind, being forwarder than the other two, made up
to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we
could afterwards see her take out the men; we called
again to the foremost boat, and offered a truce to par-
Jey again, and to know what was her business with us;
but had no answer; only she crowded close under our
1 stern.
stern. Upon this oht gunner, who was a very dexterous
sellow, run out his two chace guns, and sired at her}
but the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, wa-
ved their caps, and came on; but the gunner, getting
quickly ready again, fired among them a second time;
-one shot of which, though it missed the boat itself, yet
sell in among the men, and we could easily see, bad
done a great deal of mischief among them; but we,
taking no notice of that, weared the ship again, and
brought our quarter to bear upon them j aa J firing three
guns more, we found the boat was split almost to pieces;
in particular, her rudder, and a piece of her stern, was
shot quite away; so they handed their sail immediately,
and were in great disorder; but, to complete their mis-
fortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them again;
where he hit them we could not tell, but we found
the boat was finking, and some of the men already in
the water: upon this I immediately manned out our
pinnace, which we had kept close by our side, with or-
ders to pick up some of the men, if they could, and save
them from drowning, and immediately to come on board
with them; because we saw the rest of the boats be-
gan to come up. Our men in the pinnace, followed
their orders, and took up three men; one of which was
just drowning, and it was a good while before we
could recpver him. As soon as they were on board, we
crowded all the fail we could make, and stood sarther
out to sea; and we found, that when the other three
boats came up to the first two, they gave -over their
chace.
Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I
knew not the reason of it, yet ieemed to be much greater
than I apprehended; 1 took care that we would change
our course, and not let any oneimagine whither we were
going; so we stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the
course of all European ships, whether they were bound'
to China, or any where else, within the commerce of the
European nations.
When we were now at sea, we began to- consult
with the two seamen, and enquire first, what the
meaning of all this should be? The Dutchman let us
into
into the secret of it at once; telling us, That the sel-
low that fold as the ship, as we said, was no more than
a thief, that had run away with her. Then he told us
how the captain, whose name too he mentioned, though
I do not remember it now, was treacherously murdered
by the natives on the coast of Malacca, with three of his
men; and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, got
into the woods, where they wandered about a great
while, fill at length, ht, in particular, in a miraculous
manner, made his,escape, and swam off'to a Dutch ship,
which sailing near the shore, in its way from China, had
sent their boat on shore for fresh water; that he durst
not come to that part of the shore where the boat was,
but made shift in the night, to take in the water sarther
off, and swimming a great while, at last the ship's boat
took him up.
He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where two
of the seamen belonging to the ship had arrived, hav-
ing deserted the rest in their travels; and gave an ac-
count, that the sellow who had run away with the ship,
sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which were gone a
cruising in her; and that they had already taken an Eng-
lish ship, and two Dutch ships, very richly laden.
This latter part we found to concern us directly, and
though we knew it to be salse, yet, as my partner said,
very well, if we had sallen into their hands, and they had
such a prepossession against us before hand, it had been
in vain for us to have desended ourselves, or to hope for
any good quarters at their hands, especially considering
that our accusers had been our judges, and that we could
have expected nothing from them but what rage would
have dictated, and ungoverned passion have executed:
and therefore it was his opinion, we should go directly
back to Bengal, from whence we came without putting'
in at any port whatever; because there we could give an
account of ourselves, and could prove where we were
-when the ship put in, whom we bought her of, and the
like: and which was more than all the rest, if we were
put to the necessity of bringing it before the proper judges,
westtould be lure to have some justice; and not be hanged
iirst, and judged afterwards.
vox. H. l I was
I wap some time of my partner's opinion; but after a
little mprc serious thinking, I told him, I thought it was
a very great hazard for us to attempt returning to Ben-
gal, for that we were on the wrong side of the straights
of Malacca; and that if the alarm was given, we should
be sure to be way-laid- on every side, as well by thp
Dutch of Batavia, as the English elsewhere; that if we
should be taken, as it were, running away, we should
even condemn ourselves, and there would want no more
evidence to destroy us. I also asked the English sailor's
opinion, who said he was of my mind, and that we should
certainly be taken.
This danger a little startled my partner, and all the
Æiip's company; and we immediately resolved to go
away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to China; and
from thence pursuing the first design, as to trade, find
some way or other to dispose of the ship, and come back
in some of the vessels of the country, such as we could
get. This was approved of as the best method for our
security; and accordingly we steered away N. N. E.
keeping above sifty leagues off from the usual course to
the eastward.
This, however, put us. to some inconveniences; for
first, the winds, when we came to that distance from the
lhore, seemed to be more steadily against us, blowing al-
most trade, as we call it, from the east, and E. N. E.
so that we were a long while upon our voyage; and we
were but ill provided with victuals for so long a run;
and, which was still worse, there was some danger, that
those EnglHh and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us,
-whereof some were bound that way, might be got in be-
fore us; and if not, some other ship, bound to China,
might have information of us from them, and pursue us
with the same vigour.
I must consess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late escape from the long boats,
to have been in the most dangerous condition that ever
I was in through all my past lise; for, whatever ill cir-
cumstances I had been in, I was never pursued for a thief
before; nor had I ever done any thing that merited the
name of dishonest, or fraudulent, much less thievish. I
had chiefly been mine owa enemy; or, as I maj rightly
'fey, I had been nobody's enemy but my own. But
now I was embarrassed in the worst condition imagina-
ble; for though I was persectly innocent, I was in no
condition to make that innocence appear. And if I had
been taken, it had been under a supposed guilt of the
worst kind; at least, a crime esteemed so among the peo-
ple I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an eseape, though
-which way to do it, I knew not; or what port or place
we should go to. My partner seeing me thus dejected,
though he was the most concerned at first, began to en-
courage me; and describing to me the several ports off
that coast, told me, he would put in on the coast o
Cochinchina, or the bay of Tonquin; intending to go
afterwards to Macao, a town once in the possession of the
Portuguese, aftd where still a great many European sami-
lies resided, and particularly the missionary priests usually
went thither, in order to their going forward to China.
Hither then we resolved to go; and accordingly,
though after a tedious and irregular course, and very
much ftrerghtened for provisions, we came within sight
of the coast very early in the morning; and ttpon reflec-
tion upon the past circumstances we were in, and the
danger, if we had hot escaped, we resolved to put into a
small river, which, however, had depth enough of wa-
ter for us, and to see if we could, either over land, or
by the ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were
jn any port thereabouts. This happy step was, indeed,
our deliverance; for though we did not immediately see
any European ships in the bay of Tonquin, yet, the
-next morning, there came into the bay two Dutch Ihips,
and a third without any colours spread out, but which
we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two
leagues distance, steering for the coast of China; and in
the afternoon we went' by two English ships, steering
-'the same course; and thu-s we thought, we saw ourselves,
beset with enemies, both one way and the other, The
place we were in wasfwild and barbarous, the people
thieves, even by occupation or prosession; and though
it is true, we had not much to seek of them, and ex-
cept getting a sew provisions, cared not how little we
'had to do with them, yet it was with much difficulty
* « that
that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them seve-
ral ways.
We were in a small river of this country, within a
sew leagues of its utmost limits northward; and by our
boat we coasted north-east to the point of land which
opens to the great bay of Tonquin; and it was in
this beating up along the shore, that we discovered as
above, that in a word, we were surrounded with ene-
mies. The people we were among were the most bar-
barous of all the inhabitants of the coast; -having no
correspondence with any other nation, and dealing only
in fish and oil, and such gross commodities; and it
may be particularly seen, that they are, as I said, the
most barbarous of any of the inhabitants; viz. that
among other customs they have this one, that if any
vessel had the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their
coast, they presently make the men all prisoners; that
is to say, staves; and it was not long before we found a
spice of their kindness this way, on the occasion fol-
lowing.
1 have observed above, that our ship sprung a leak
at sea, and that we could not find it put; and however
it happened, that as I have said, it was stopped unex-
pectedly, in the happy minute of our being to be seized
by the Dutch and English ships, near the bay of Siam;
yet, as we did not find the ship so persectly tight and
sound as we desired, we resolved, while we werein this
place, to lay her on shore, take out wjiat heavy things
•we had on board, which were not many, and to wasli
and clean her bottom; and, if possible, to find out where
the leaks were.
Accordingly,. having lightened the ship, and brought
all our guns, and other moveable things, to one side,
we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her
bottom: for, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay
her dry aground, neither could we find out a proper
place for it.
The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with
such a sight, came wondering down to the shore to look
at us; and seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a
manner, and heeling towards the shore, and not seeing
our men, who were at work oa her bottom, with stages,
and
and with their boats on the off side, they presently con-
cluded that the ship was cast away, and lay so very sast
on the ground.
On this supposition they came all about us in two or
three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats, having
some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, intending,
no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the
ship, and if they had found us there, to have carried us
away for slaves to their king, or whatever they call him,
for we knew not who was their governor.
When they came up to the ship, and began to row
jound her, they discovered us all hard at work, on the
outside of the ship's bottom and side, warning, and
graving, and stopping, as every seasaring man knows .
how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
-were a little surprised, could not imagine what their
design was; but, being willing to be sure, we took
this opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and
others to hand down arms and ammunition, to those
that were at work to desend themselves with, if there
should be occasion: and it was no more than need:
for, in less thari a quarter of an hour's consultation,
they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a wreck;
that we were all at work, endeavouring to save her, or
to save our lives by the help of our boats -; and when;
we handed our arms into the boats, they concluded,
by that motion, that we were endeavouring to save
some of our goods. Upon this they took it for granted
they all belonged to them: and aWay they came di-
rectly upon our men, as if it had been in a line of
battle.
Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be
frighted; for we lay but in an ill posture to sight,
and cried out to us to know what they mould do. I
immediately called to the men who worked upon the
stages to shp them down, and get up the side into the
ship: and bade those in the boat to row round and
come on board; and those sew of us who were da
board, worked with all the strength and hands we had,
to bring the ship to rights: but, however, neither th'c
men upon the stage, nor those in the boats, could do-
i 3 i as
as they were ordered, before the Cochinehinese were upon
them ; and, with two of their boats boarded our long-
boat, and began to lay hold of the men as their prisoners.
The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman,
a stout strong sellow, who having a musquet in his hand,
never offered to fire it, but laid it down in the boat, like
A fool, as I thought. But he understood his business bet-
ter than 1 could teach him; for he grappled the Pagan,
and dragged him by main force out of their own boat in-
to ours; where, taking him by the two ears, he beat his
head'so against the boat's gunnel, that the sellow died in-
stantly in his hands; and in the mean time, a Dutchman,
who stood next, took up the musquet, and with the but-
end of it, so laid about them, that he knocked down five
of them, who attempted to enter the boat; but this was
little towards resisting thirty or forty men, who searless,
because ignorant of their danger, began to throw them-
selves into the long-boat, where we had but five men to
desend it; but one accident gave our men a complete
victory, which deserved our laughter rather than any
» thing else; and that was this:
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of
the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had caulk-
ed her, to stop the leaks, had got two kettles juit let
down into the boat ; one filled with boiling pitch, and
the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and such stuff as
the shipwrights used for that work; and the man that
attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand,
with which he supplied the men that were at work with
that hot stuff; two of the enemy's men entered the
boat just where this sellow stood, being in the fore-
> sheets;.he immediately saluted them with a ladlesul of
the stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and scalded them,
being half-naked, that they roared out like two bulls,
and enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea.
The carpenter law it, and cried out, Well done, Jack,
give them some more of it; when stepping forward
himself, he takes one of their mops, and dipping it in
the pitch-pot, he and his man thre,w it among them fa
plentisully, that, in short, of all the men in three boats,
there was not one that was not scalded and burnt with.
it
it in a most frightsul pitisul manner, and made such aa
howling and crying, that I never heard a worse noise,
and, indeed, nothing like it; for it was worth observing,
that though pain naturally makes all people cry out,
yet every nation have a particular way of exclamation,
and make noises as disserent from one another as their ,
speech. I cannot give the noise these creatures made
a better name than howling, nor a name more proper
to the tone of it; for 1 never heard any thing more
like the noile of the wolves, which, as I have said,
I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of Lan-
guedoc.
I was never pleased with a victory better in my lise:
not only as it was a persect surprise to me, and that our
danger was imminent besore; but as we got this victory
without any bloodshed, except of that man the sellow
killed with his naked hands, and which I was very much
concerned at: for I was sick of killing such poor savage
wretches, even though it was in my own desence, know-
ing, they came on errands which they thought just, and
knew no better; and that though it may be a just thing,
because necessary, for there is no net*ssary wickedness in
nature: yet I thought it was a sad lise, when we must be
always obliged to be killing our sellow-creatures to pre-
serve ourselves ; and indeed, 1 think so still; andl would,
even now, suffer a great deal, rather than 1 would take
away the lise even of the worst person injuring me. 'I
believe also, all considering people, who knew the value-
of lise, would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously
into the consideration of it.
But to return to my story: all the white this was do-
ing, my partner and I, who managed the rest of the mer*
on board, had with great dexterity, brought the ship
almost to rights; and having gotten the guns into
their places again, the gunner called to me, to bid our
boat get out of the way, for he would let fly among
them. I called back again to him, and bid him not
offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work with-
out him; but bid him heat another pitch kettle; -which
our cook, who was on board, took card of. But the
enemy was so terrified with what they met with in their
first attack, that they would not come on again; and

ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
some of them, that were sarthest off seeing the ship swim ,
as it were, upright, began, as we supposed, to see their
mistake, and gave over the enterprise, finding it not as
they expected. Thus we got clear of this merry sight;
and having gotten some rice, and some roots and bread',
'with about sixteen good big hogs, on board, two days
before, we resolved to stay here no longer, but go for-
ward, whatever came of it; for we made no doubt but
weshould be surrounded the next day with rogues enough,
perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose of for
us.
We, tWrefore,- got all our things on board the same
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail. 1n
the mean time, lying at an anchor some distance srom the
shore, we were not so much concerned, being now in a
fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any
enemy had presented. The next day, having finished our
work within board, and finding our ship was persectly
healed of all her leaks, we set sail; -we would have gone
into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform our-
selves of what w»s to be known concerning the Dutch
ships that had been there; but we durlt not stand in there,
because we had seen several ships go in, as we supposed,
but a little before; so we kept on' N. E. towards the isle
of Formosa, as much afraid of being seen by a Dutch
or English merchant ship, as a Dutch or English mer-
chant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man
of war.
. When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E. as
if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine islands,
and this we did, that we might not sall into the way of
any ot' the European ships; and then we steered north
again, till we came to the latitude of 22 deg. 20min. by
which means we made the island of Formosa directly,
where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and
fresh provisions, which the people there, who are very
courteous and civil in their manners, supplied us with
. willingly, and dealt very sairly and punctually with us in
all their agreements and bargains; which is what we did
not find among other people, and may be owing to the
remains of Christianity, which was once planted here by
a Dutch missionary of protestants, and is a testimony of
what
what I have often observed, viz. that the christian religion
always civilizes the people, and reforms their manners,
where it is received, whether it works saving effects up-
on them or no.
From hence we sailed still north-, keeping the coast of
China at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond
all the ports of China, where our European ships usually
come: being resolved, if possible, not to sall into any
of their hands, especially in this country, where, as our
circumstances were, we could not sail ef being entirely
ruined; nay, so great was my sear in particular, as to
my being taken by them, that I believe firmly I would?
much rather have chosen to have fallen intov th« hands ot'
the Spanish inquisition. *
Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we' re-
solved to put into the first trading port we should come
at: and standing in for the shore, a boat came off tw»
leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board,
who, knowing us to be an European-strip, came to offer
his service, which, indeed; we were very glad of, and
took him on board: upon which, without asking us'
whither we would go, he dismissed the boat he Game in,
and sent it back.-
I thought it was- now so much in our choice to make
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began to-
talk with him about carrying of us to the Gulph of Nan-
quin, which is the most northern part of the coast of
China. The old man said he knew the Gulphof Nan-
quin very well; hut, smiling, asked us what we would
do there-.
I told him we would sell our cargo; and purchase
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought^filks,
&c. and so would return by. the same course we came.
He told us our best port had been to have put in at Ma-
cao, where we could not sail of a market for our opium
to our satissaction, and might, for our money, have pur--
chased all sorts of China goods, ascheap as we could at
Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of
which he was very opiniated, or conceited, I told him,
we were gentlemen, as well as merchants; and that we
had a mind to go and see the great city of Pekin, and the
l 5 famous
samous court of the monarch of China. Why then,
says the old man, you should go to Ningpo, where, by
the river that runs into the sea there, you may go up
within five leagues of the great capal. This canal is a
navigable made stream, which goes through the heart of
all that vast empire of China, crosses all the rivers, passes
some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates,
and goes up to the city of Pekin, being in length near
2/0 leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our
business now: the great question is, If you can carry us
up to the city of Nanquin, from whence we can travel
to Pekin afterwards? Yes, he said, he could do so very
well, and there was a great Dutch ship gone up that
way just before. This gave me a little shock; a Dutch
ship was now our terror, and we had much rather have
met the devil, at least if he had not come in too fright-
sul a figure: we depended upon it, that a Dutch thip
would be our destruction, for we were in no condition
to sight them; all the ships they trade with in those parts
being of great burden, and of much greater force than
we were.
The old man found me a little consused, and under
some concern, when he named a Dutch ship; and laid
to me, Sir, you need be under no apprehension of the
Dutch, I suppose they are not now at war with your
nation. No, said I, that's true; but I know not what
liberties men may take, when they are out of the reach
of the laws of the country. Why, laid he, you arena
pirates, what need you sear? 'lhey will not meddle-
with peaceable merchants, sure.
If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up in-
to my sace at that word, it was hindered by some stop in
the vessels appointed by nature to circulate it; for it put
me into the greatest disorder and consusion imaginable,
nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but that the
old man easily perceived it.
Sir, said he, I find you are in some disorder in your
thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to go which way
you think fit; and depend upon it, I'll do you all the
service I can. Why, Seignior, said 1, it is true, 1 am
a little unsettled ia my resolution at this time, whither
to s
to go in particular; and I am something more so, for
what you said about pirates: I hope there are no pirates'
in these seas, we are but in an ill condition to meet with
them: for you see we have but small force, and but very-
weakly manned.
O, Sir, said he, do not be concerned; I do not know
that there have been any pirates in these seas these fifteen
years, except one, which was seen, as I hear, in the bay
of Siam, about a month since; but you may be assured
she is gone to the southward: nor was she a ship of any
great force, or fit for the work; she was not built for a.
privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate crew
that were on board, after the captain and some of his-
men had been murdered by the Malaccans, at or near
the island of Sumatra.
What! said I, seeming to know nothing of the mat- -
ter, Did they murder the captain? No, said he, I do ,
not understand that they murdered him; but, as they af-
terwards ran away with the ship,. it is generally believed:
they betrayed him into the hands of the Malaccans, who <
did murdenrum: and, perhaps, they procured them to
doit. Why then,. said I, they deserve death, as much.
as if they had done it themselves. Nay, said the oki
man, they do deserve it: and they will certainly have it
if they light upon any English or Dutch ship: for they
have all agreed together, that, if they meet that rogue,
they will give him no quarter.
But, said I to him, you say the pirate is gone out of.
these seas; how can they meet with him then? Why
that is true, said he, they do say so; but he was, as I
tell you, in the bay of Siam in the river Cambodia, and:
was discovered there by some Dutchmen who belonged
to the ship, and who were left on shore when they run
away with her; and some English and Dutch traders be-
ing in the river, they were within a little of taking him..
Nay, said he, if the foremost boats had been well second-
ed by the rest, they had certainly taken him -..but he,.
finding only two boats within reach of him, tacked about:
and fired at these two, and disabled them before the other -
came up; and then standing off to lea, the others were
not able to follow'him, and so he got away. But they
have all so exact a description of the. ship that they
i< b' will'
-will be sure to know him; and whereever they fines
him, they have vowed to give no quarter to either the
captain or the seamen, but to hang them alt up at the
yard-arm.
What! said T, will they execute them right or wrong,
hang them first, and judge them afterwards? O, Sir!
said the old pilot, there is no need to make a formal bu-
siness of it with such rogues as those; let them tie them
back to back, and set them a diving; it is no more than
they rightly deserve.
I knew I had my old man sast aboard, and that he
could do me no harm; so that I turned short upon him:
'Well, now, Seignior, said I, and this is the very reason
-why I would have you carry us to Nanquin, and not to
put back to Macao, or to any other part of the country,
where the English or Dutch ships come: for be it known
to you, Seignior, those captains of the English and Dutch
ships are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent sellows, that
neither know what belongs to justice, pr how to behave
themselves, as the laws of God and nature direct; but
being proud of their offices, and not understanding their
power, they would act the murderers to punish robbers;
would take upon them to insult men salsely accused, and
determine them guilty without due enquiry, and per-
haps I may live to call some of them to an account for
it, where they may be taught how justice is to be exe-
cuted; and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal
till some evidence may be had of the crime, and that he
is the man.
With this I told him, that this was the very ship they-
had attacked: and gave him a sull. account of the skir-
mish we had with their boats, and how foolishly and
coward-like they had behaved. I told him all the story
of our huying the ship, and how the Dutchmen served
us. I told him the reasons-I had to believe that this story
of killing the master by the Malaccans was not true; as
also the running away with the ship; but that it was all
a fiction of their own, to suggest tnat the men were turn-
ed pirates; and they ought to have been sure it was so,
before they had ventured to attack us by surprise, and
oblige us to resist them; adding, that they would have
the blood of those men, who were killed there, in our
just desence, to answer for.
The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us,
we were very much in the right to go away to the north;
and that if he might advile us, it mould be to sell the ship
in China, which we might Very well do, and buy or
build another in the country: and said he, tho' you will
not get so good a ship, yet you may get one able enough
to carry you and all your goods back again to Bengal, or
any where else.
I told him I would take his advice, when I came to
any port where I could sind a ship for my turn, or get
any customer to buy this. He replied, I should meet
with customers enough for the ship at Nanquin, and that
a Chinese junk would serve me very well to go back
again; and that he would procure me people both to buy
one, and sell the other. x
Well, but, Seignior, says I, as you say they know the
ship so well, I may, perhaps, if 1 follow your measures,'
be instrumental to bring some honest innocent men into
a terrible broil, and perhaps be miirdered in cold blood;
for wherever they find the ship they will prove the guilt
upon the men, by proving this was the ship: and so
innocent men may probably be overpowered and mur-
dered. Why, said the old man, I'll find out a way to
prevent that also: for as 1 know all those commanders
you speak of very well, and shall see them all as they
pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights in the thing,
and let them know that they had been so much in the
wrong; that though the people who were on board at
first might run away with the ship, yet it was not true
that they had turned pirates: and that in particular those
were not the men that first went off with the ship, but
innocently bought her for their trade: and I am per-
suaded they will so far believe me, as, at least, to act
more cautiously for the time to come. - Well, said 1, and
will you deliver one message to them from me? Yes,
I will, says he, if you will give it under your hand, in
-writing, that I may be able to prove it came from you,
and not out of my own head. 1 answered, that I would
readily give it him under my hand. So 1 took a pen,
and ink, and paper, and wrote at large the liory of
assaulting
assaulting me with the long-boats, &c. the pretended
reason of it, and the unjust cruel design of it; and con-
cluded to the commanders that they had don* what they
not only should have been ashamed of, but also, that is
ever they came to England, and I lived to see them there,
they should all pay dearly for it, if the laws of- my
country were not grown out of use besore I arrived there.
My ©Id pilot read this over and over again, and asked
me several times if I would stand to it. 1 answered, I
would stand to it as long as 1 had any thing left in the
world, being sensible that I should, one time or other,-
sind an opportunity to put it home to them. But we
had no occasion ever to let the pilot carry this letter;
for he never went back again. W hile those things were
passing between us, by way of discourse, we went for-
ward directly .for Nanquin, and, in about thirteen days
sail, came to anchor at the south west point of the
great gulph of Nanquin: where, by the way, I came by
accident to understand, that the two DutGh ships were •
gone that length before me, and that I should certainly
sall into their hands. I consulted my partner again in .
this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I was,.
and would very gladly have been sase on shore almost
any where. However, I was not in'suoh perplexity
neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was no
creek or harbour, which I- might put into, and pursue
my business with the Chinese privately, and be in no
danger of the enemy? He told me, if 1.would sail to
the southward about two and forty leagues, there was i,
little port called Quinchang, where the sathers of the
mission usually landed from Macao, on their progress to
teach the Christian religkin to the Chinese, and where-
no European ships ever put in; and, if I thought proper
to put in there, I might consider what farther course to
take when 1 was on shore. He consessed, he said, it
was not a place for merchants, except, that at some
certain times they had a kind of a sair there, when the
merchants from Japan came over thither to buy. the Chi-
nese merchandizes.
We all agreed to go back to this place; the name of
the port, as he called it, 1 may, perhaps, spell wrong;
3 fox
s
for I do not particularly remember it, having lost this,
together with the names of many other places set dowa
in a little pocket-book, which was spoiled by the water,
on an accident which I shall relate in its order: but this
1 remember, that the Chinese or Japanese merchants we
correspond with, call it by a disserent name from that
which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it as
above, Quinchang.
As we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to this
piace, we weighed the next day, having only gone twice
on shore, where we were to get fresh water; on both
which occasions the people of the country were very civil.
to us, and brought us abundance of things to sell to us;
I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea, rice, and some
fowls; but nothing without money.
» We'came to the other port (the wind being contrary)
not till five days; but it was very much to our satissac-
tion; and I was joysul, and, I may say, thanksuls when.
I set my foot sase on shore -r resolving, and my partner
too, that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and ef-
sects any otherway, though not every way to our satis-
faction, we would never set one foot-on board that un-
happy vessel again; and indeed, I must acknowledge,.
that of all the circumstances of lise that ever I had any
experience of, nothing makes mankind so completely mi-
ferable as that of being in constant sear. Well does the
scripture say, 'The sear of man brings a snare;' it is a
lise of death: and the mind is so entirelv suppressed by it,
that it is capable of no relief;. the animal spirits sink, and
all the vigour of nature, which usually supports men un-
der other afflictions, and is present to them in the greatest
exigencies, sails them.here.
Nor did it sail of its usual operations upon the sancy,
by heightening every danger; representing the English
and Dutch captains to be men incapable os hearing rea-
son, or distinguishing between honest men and rogues;
or between a story calculated for our own turn, made out
of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and a true genuine
account of our whole voyage, progress, and design; for
-we might many ways have convinced any reasonable
creature that we were not pirates: the goods we had on
board, the course we steered, our frankly shewing our-
. selves'
selves, and entering into such and such ports; ever*
our very manner, the force we had, the number of meny
the sew arms, little ammunition, and Ihort provisions;
all these would have served to convince any man that
we were no pirates. The opium, and other goods we
had on board, would make it appear the ship had
been at Bengal: the Dutchman, who, it was said, had
the names of all the men that were in the ship, might
easily see that we were a mixture' of English, Por-
tuguese, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board'.
These, and many other particular circumstances, might
have made it evident to the understanding of any com-
mander, whose hands we might sall into, that we were
no pirates.
But sear, that blind useless passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered our
understandings, and set the imagination at work, to
form a thousand terrible things, that, perhaps, might
never happen: we first supposed, as, indeed, every body
had related to us, that the seamen on board the English-
and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so en-
raged at the name of a pirate, and especially at our
beating off their boats, and escaping, that they would
not give themselves leave to enquire whether we were
pirates or no ; but would execute us off-hand, as we cafc}'
it, without giving us any room for a desence. We re-
flected that there was really so much apparent evidence
before them, that they would scarce enquire after any
more; as, first, that the ship was certainly the same,
and that some of the seamen among them knew her,
and had been on board her; and secondly, that when
we had intelligence at the river Cambodia, that they
were coming down to examine us, we fought their boats,
and fled; so that we made no doubt but they were as
sully satisfied of our being privates, as we were satisfied
of the contrary; and 1 often said, I knew not but I
should have been apt to have taken the little circum-
stances for evidence, if the tables were turned, and my
case was theirs; and have made no scruple of cutting
all the crew to pieces, without believing, or, perhaps,
considering, what they might have to ofser in their
desence.
But
But let that be how it will, those were, our appre-
hensions; and both my partner and I too scarce slept a
night without dreaming of halters and yard-arms, that
is to say gibbets; of sighting, and being taken; of
killing, and being killed; and one night I was in
such a sury in my dream, sancying the Dutchmen had
boarded us, and 1 was knocking one of their seamen
down, that I struck my double fist against the side of
the cabin I lay in, with such a force as wounded my
hand most grievously, broke my knuckles, and cut and
bruised the flesh; so that it not only waked me out of
my sleep, but I was once afraid I should have lost two of
my singers.
Another apprehension I had, was of the cruel usage
we should meet with from them, if we sell into their
hands J then the story of Amboyna came into my head,
and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us, as they
did our countrymen there; and make some of our men,
by extremity of torture, consess those crimes they never
were guilty of; Own themselves, and all of us, to be
pirates; and so they would put us to death, with a
formal appearance of justice; and that they might be
tempted to do this, for the gain of our ship and cargo;
-which was worth four or live thousand pounds, put all
together.
These things torjnented me, and my partner too, night
and day; nor did we consider that the captains of ships
lyive no authority to aci thus; and if we had surrendered
prisoners to them, they could not answer the destroying
us,- or torturing us, but would be accountable for it when
they came into their own country. This, 1 say, gave
me no satissaction; for, if they will act thus with us,
-what advantage would it be to us that they would be
called to an account for it; or if we were first to be mur-
dered, what satissaction would it be to us to have them
punished when they came home?
I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I
row had upon the past variety of my particular circum-
stances; how hard 1 thought it was, that 1, who had
spent forty years in a lise of continued difficulties, and
was, at last, come, as it were, at the port or haven which
$11 men drive at, vis. to have rest and plenty, mould be
jcvolua*
a volunteer in new sorrows, by my own unhappy choice 5
and that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my
youth, should now come to be hanged in my old age,
and in so remote a place, for a crime I was not in the
least inclined to,'much less guilty of; and in a place and
circumstance where innocence was not like to be any
protection at all to me.
After these thoughts, something of religion would
come in; and I would be considering that this seemed
to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence; and
I ought to look upon it, and submit to it, as such; that
although I was innocent as to men, I was sar from be-
ing innocent as to my maker'; and I ought to look on,.
and examine what other crimes in my lise were most
obvious to me, and from which Providence might just-
ly inflict this punishment as a retribution; and that L
ought to submit to this, just as I would to a shipwreck,
if it had pleased God to have brought such a disaster. up--
on me.
In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take it»
place; and then I would be talking myself' up to vi-
gorous resolution, that I Would not be taken to be
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless. wretches in
cold blood; that it was much better to have sallen into
the hands of the savages, who were men-eaters, and
who, I was sure, would seast upon me, when they had
taken me, than by those, who -would, perhaps, glut their
rage upon me, by inhuman tortures and barbarities;
that, in the case of the savages, I always resolved to die
fighting, to the last gasip.; and why should I not do so
now, seeing it was rtuich more dreadsul, to me at least,
to think of salling into these men's hands, than ever it
was to think of being eaten by men? for the savages,
give them their due—would not eat a man till he was
dead; and killed him first, as we do a bullock; but
that these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of
death. Whenever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure
to put myself into a kind or sever, with the agitations
of a supposed fight; my blood would boil, and my eyes
sparkle, as if 1 was engaged; and I always resolved
that 1 would take no quaiter at their hands: but even
. at last4 if I could resist no longer, I would blow up the
. N . ship.
ship, and all that was in her, and leave them but Kttle
booty to boast of.
But how much the greater weight the anxieties and
perplexities of those things were to our thoughts while
we were at sea, by so much the greater was our satis-
saction when we saw ourselves on shore; and my part-
ner told me( he dreamed, that he had a very heavy
load upon his back, which he was to carry up an hill,
and found that he was not able to stand long under it:
but the Portuguese pilot came, and took it off his back,
and the hill disappeared, the ground before him shewing
all smooth and plain. And truly it was so; we were all
like men who had a load taken off their backs.
For my part, I had a weight taken off from my
heart that I was not able any longer to bear; and, as
1 said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that
ship. When we came on more, the old pilot, who was
now our friend, got us a lodging, and a warehouse for
our goods, which, by the way, was much the same:
it was a little house or hut, with a large house joining to
it, all built with canes, and pallisadoed round with large
canes, to keep out pilsering thieves, of which it seems
there werenot a sew in the country. However, the
magistrates allowed us all a little guard, and we had
a soldier with a kind of halbert, or half-pike, wno
stood centinel at our door, to whom we allowed a pint
of rice, and a little piece of money, about the value of
threepence per day, so that our goods were kept very-
sase.
The sair or mart, usually kept in this place, had been
over some time; however, we found that there were
three or four junks in the river, and two japanners, I
mean, ships from Japan, with goods which they had
bought in China, and were not gone away, having Ja-
panese merchants on shore.
The -first: thing oik old Portuguese pilot did for us,
-was to bring us acquainted with three missionary Romish
priests, who were in the town, and who had been there
some time converting the people to Christianity; but
we thought they made but poor work of it; and made
them but sorry Christians when they had done. However,
that was not our business. One of these was a French-
man,
man, whom they called Father Simon; he was a jolly'
well-conditioned man, very free in his conversation^.
not seeming so serious and grave as the other two did,
one of whom was a Portuguese, and the other a Geno-
ese; but Father Simon was courteous, easy in his man-
ner, and very agreeable company; the other two were
more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and applied
seriously to the work they came about, viz. to talk with
and insinuate themselves among the inhabitants, where-
ever they had opportunity. We often eat and drank
with thole men; and though I must consess, the conver-
sion, as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity, is so
sar from the true converlion required, to bring heathea
people to the saith of Christ, that it seems to amount to
little more than letting them know the name of Christ,
say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her son, in a
tongue which they understand not, and to cross them-
selves, and the like; yet it must be consei!ed,N that these
religious, whom we call Missionaries, have a firm belief
that these people should be saved, and that they are the
instrument of it; and, on this account, they undergo
not only the satigue of the voyage, and hazards of
living in such places, but oftentimes death itself, with
.the most violent tortures, for the sake o.f this work;
and it would be a great want of charity in us, whatever
opinion we have of the work itself, and the manner of
their doing it, it we should not have a good opinion of
their zeal, who undertake it with so many hazards, and
who have no prospect of the least temporal advantage to
themselves.
But to return to my story: This French priest, Father
Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief
of the miffion, to go up to Pekin, the royal seat of the
Chinese Emperor, and waited only for another priest,
who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go
along with .him; and we scarce ever met together, but
he was inviting me to go that journey with him, telling
me, how he would shew me all the glorious things of
that mighty empire ; and, among the rest, the greatest city
in the world —a city, said he, that your London and
our Paris put together cannot be equal to. This was
the city of Pekin, which, I consess, is very great, and
* infinitely
infinitely sull of'people: but, as 1 looked on those
things with different eyes from other men, so 1 shall
give my opinion of them in a sew words, when I come,
in the course of my travels, to speak more particularly of
them.
But first, I come to my friar or missionary: Dining
with him one day, and being very merry together, I
shewed some little inclination to go with him; and he
pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a great
many persuasions to consent. Why, Father Simon, says
my partner, why should you desire our company so
much? You know we are heretics, and you <io not
love us, nor can keep us company with any pleasure.
O! says he, you may, perhaps, be good catholics in
time; my business here is to convert heathens, and who
knows but I may convert you'too? Very well, Father,
laid [, so you will preach to «s all the way. I won't be
troublesome to you, said he; our religion does not divest
us of good manners; besides, said he, we are here like
countrymen, and so we are, compared to the place we
are in; and if you are hugunots, and 1 a Catholic, we
may be all Christians; at least, said he, we are all gen-
tlemen, and we may converse so without being uneasy
to one another. 1 liked that part of his discourie very
-well, and it began to, put me in mind of my priest
that I had left in the Brasils; but this Father Simon
did not come up to his character by a great deal •; for
though Father Simon had no appearance of a criminal
levity in him neither, yet he had not that sund of Chris-
tian zeal, strict piety, and sincere affection to religion,
that my other good ecclesiastic had, of whom I have said
so much.
But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor
soliciting us to go with him, but we had something
else before us at that time; for we had, all this while,
our ship and. our merchandize to dispose of;' and we
•begari to be very doubtsul what we thould do, for we
-were now in a place of very little business; and once I
-was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam; and
the city of Nanquin: But Providence seemed now more
visibly* as 1 thought, than ever, to concern itself in our
affairs i and I was encouraged from this very time* to \
think,
think, I should, one way or other, get out bf this entail*
gled circumstance, and be brought home to my own
country again, though I had not the least view of the
manner; and when I began sometimes to think of it,
could not imagine by what method it was to be done.
Providence, I say, began here to clear up our way a
little; and the first thing that offered was, that our old
Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who
began to enquire what goods we had 5 and, ip the first
place, he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good
price for it, paying us in gold by weight, some in
small pieces of their own coin, and sortie in small wedges>
of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were
dealing with- him for our opium, it came into my head*
that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the ship too;
and I ordered the ihtei preser to propose it to him. He
shrunk up his shoulders at it, when at first proposed
to him; but in a sew days after, he came to me, with
one of the missionary priests for his interpreter,, and
told me, he had a proposal to make to me, and that was
this: He had bought a great quantity of goods of us
when he had no thoughts (ot propolals made to him)
of buying the ship; and that therefore, he had not
money enough to pas for the ship; but if I would let
the same men who were in the ship navigate her, he would
hire the ship . to go to Japan; and would send them
from thence to the Phillippine islands with another
loading, which he would pay the freight of, before
they went from Japan; and that, at their return, he
Would buy the ship. I began to listen to this proposal,
and so eager did my head run upon rambling, that I
could not but begin to entertain a notion myself of
going with him, and so to sail from the Phillippine islands
away to the South Seas; and accordingly I asked the
Japanese merchant, if he would hot hire us to the
Phillippine islands, .and discharge us there. He said, no,
he could not do that 5 for then he could not have the
Iretunx of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan,
he said, at the ship's return. Well, still 1 was for taking
him at that proposal, and going myself; but my partner,
wiser than myself, persuaded me from it, representing
the dangers, as well of the seas, as of the Japanese, who
are
lire a salse, cruel, and treacherous people; and then of
the Spaniards at the Philippines 5 more salse, more
cruel, more treacherous than they.
But to bring this long turn of our afsairs to a conclu-
sion: the first thing we had to do, was to consult
with the captain of the ship, and with the men, and
know if they were willing to go to Japan; and, while
I was doing this, the young man whom, as I said, my
nephew had left with me as my companion for my
travels, came to me and told me, that he thought that
voyage promised very sair, and that there was a great
prospect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I
tindertook it ; but that if I would not, and would give
him leave, he would go as 4 merchant, or how I pleased
to order him: that if ever he came to England, and I
was there, and alive, he would render me a saithsul ac-
count of his success, and it should be as much mine as I
pleased.
I was really loth to part with him; but, considering
the prospect of advantage, which was really considerable,
and that he was a young sellow as likely to do well in
it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go } but first I
told him I would consult my partner, and give him an
answer the next day. My partner and I discoursed about
it; and my partner made a most generous offer s
he told me, you know it has been an unlucky ship, and
we both resolve not to go to sea in it again; if your
steward (so he called my man) will venture the voyage,
I'll leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him.
. make the belt of it; and if we live to meet in England,
and he meets with success abroad, he shall account for
wne half of -the profits of the ship's freight to us, the
other shall be his own.
If my partner, who was no way concerned with my
young man, made him such an offer, I could do no
less than offer him the same; and all the ship's com-
pany being willing to go with him> we made over half
the ship to him in property, and took a writing from
ijfm, obliging him to account for the other; and away
he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very
punctual honest man to him, protected him at Japan,
and got him a license to come on shore, which the
Europeans
Europeans in general have not lately obtained; paid him
his freight very punctually, sent him to the Philippines,
loaded with Japan and China wares, and a supercargo
of their own, who, trafficking with the Spaniards,
brought back European goods again, and a great quan-
tity of cloves and other spice; and there he was not only
paid his freight very well, and at a very good price, but
b^ing not willing to sell the ship then, the merchant sur-
nished him with goods on his own account: that, for
some money, and some spices of his own, which he
brought with him, he went back to the Manillas, to the
Spaniards, where he fold his cargo very well. Here,
having gotten a good acquaintance at Manilla, he got
his ship made a free ship; and the governor of Manilla
hired him to go to Acapulco in America, on the coast of
Mexico; and gave him a licence to land there, and
travel to Mexico; and to pass in any Spanish ship to
Europe, with all his roen.
He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and
there he fold his ship; and having there also obtained
allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found
means, somehow or other, to go to Jamaica with all his
treasure; and about eight years after came to England,
exceeding rich; of which I shall take notice in its
place: in the mean time I return to our particular
affairs.
Being now to part with the ship, and ship's company,
it came before us, of course, to consider what recom-
pence we should give to the two men that gave us
such timely notice of the design against us in the river
of Cambodia. The truth was, they had done us a con-
siderable service, and deserved well at our hands;
though, by the way, they were a couple of rogues
too, for, as they believed the story of our being
pirates, and that' we had really run away with the
ftip, they came down to us, not only to betray the
design that was formed against us, but to go to sea with
us as pirates; and one of them consessed afterwards,
that nothing else but the hopes of going a*
roguing, brought him to do it. However, the ser-
vice they did us was not the less; and therefore, as I
had promised to be grateful to them, I first ordered the
money
money to be paid to them, which they said was due to
them on board their respective ships; that is to say, the
Englishmen nineteen months' pay, and to the Dutch-
men seven; and, over and above that, I gave each of
them a small sum of money in gold, which contented
them very well; then I made the Englishman gun-
ner of the ship, the gunner being now being made second
mate and purser; the Dutchman T made boatswain;
so they were both very well pleased, and proved very
serviceable, being both. able seamen, and very stout
sellows.
We were now on shore in China. If I thought myself
'banished, and remote from my own country at Bengal,
where I had many ways to get home for my money,
what could I think of myself now, when I was gotten
about a thousand leagues sarther off from home,
and persectly destitute of all manner of prospect of
Teturn!
All we had for it was this; that in about four months*
time there was to be another sair at that place where
we were, and . then - we might be able to purchase all
sorts of the manusactures of the country, and withal
might possibly find some Chinese junks or vefiels from
Nanquin, that would be to be fold, and would carry
us and our goods whither we pleased. This 1 liked very
well, and resolved to wait: besides, as our particular
persons were not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch
ships came thither, perhaps we might have an oppor-
tunity to load our goods, and get passage to some
other place in India, nearer home.
Upon these hopes we resolved to 'Continue here:
but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three journies
into the country first. We went ten days' journey
to see the city of Nanquin, a city well worth see-
ing indeed; they say it has a million of people in
it; which, however, I do not believe; it is regularly
built; the streets are all exactly strait, 'and cross one an-
other in direct lines, which gives the sigure ot it great
« advantage.
But when I came to compare the miserable people of
these countries with ours, their sabrics, their man-
ner of living, their government, their religion, their
vol. iu * wealth
ADVENTURES OF^ROBINSON CRUSOE.
-wealth, and their glory (as some call it) I must con-
sess, I do not so much as think it worth naming, or
worth my while to write of, or any that shall come after
me to read. - ,
It is very observable, that we wonder at the gran-
deur, the' riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the go-
vernment, the manusactures, the commerce, and the con-
duct ot' these people, not that they are to be wondered
at, or indeed, in the least to be regarded, but because,
having first a notion of the barbarity of those coun-
tries, the rudeness, and the ignorance that prevail
there, w£ do not expect lo find any such things so sar
off.
Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to-
the universal commerce of England, Holland, France,
and Spain? What their cities to ours, for wealth,
strength, gaiety of apparel, rich surniture, and an in-
sinite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a
sew junks and barks, to our navigation, our mer-
chants' fleets, our large and powerful navies? Our
city of London has more trade than all their mighty
empire. One English, or Dutch, or French man of
war of 80 guns, would sight with "r.d destroy all
the shipping of China. But the greatness of their
-wealth, their trade, the power of their government,
and strength of their arms, are surprising to us because,
as I have said, considering them as,a barbarous nation of
pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect:
such things -among them; and this, indeed, is the ad-
vantage with which all their greatness and power is .re-
presented to us; otherwise it is in itself bottiing at all;
for, as 1 have said of their ships, so it may be said of
their armies and troops; all the forces of their empire,
though they were to bring two millions of men into
the field together, would be able to do nothing but ruin
the country and starve themselves. 1f they were to
besiege a Itrong town in i landers, or to fisht a disci-

our fortisied towns, and the art of our engineer?, in
assaulting and desending towns; there is not a fortified
town in China could hold out one month against the
batteries and attacks of an European army; and at
the same time, all the armies of China could never
take. such a' town as Dunkirk, provided it was not
starved: no, not in ten years' siege. They have fiie-
arms, it is true, but they are aukward, clumsy, and
uncertain in going off; they have powder, but it is of
no strength; they have neither discipline.in the field,

me when 1 cjpne home, and heard our people say tuch
fine things os the power, riches, glory, magnificence,
and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and knew lhat
they were a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant

to rule such a people; and, in a word, for I am now

-with all the drums and kettles in the country, to fright
the monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm of
bees. .
As this is the only excursion of this kind which I
'have made, in all the account which 1 have given of my
travels, so I shall make no more descriptions of coun-
tries and people: it is none of my business, or any part
of my design; but giving an account of ray own ad-
ventures, through a lise of insinite wanderings, and
a long variety of changes, which, perhaps, sew have
heard the like ois: I shall say nothing of the mighty
places, desert countries, and numerous people, I have
yet to pass through, more than relates to my own
story, and which my concern among them will make
necessary. I was now, as near as 1 can compute, in
the heart of China, about the latitude of thirty de-
grees north of the line, for we were returned from
Nanquin: I had indeed a mind to see the city of Pekin,
which I had heard so much of, and Father Simon impor-
tuned me daily to do it. At length his time of going
away being let, and the other missionary, who was to
go with him, being arrived from Macoa, it was necessary
that we mould resolve either to go or not to go;
so I reserred him to my partner, and left it wholly to
his choice, who, at length, resolved it in the affirma-
tive; and we prepared for our journey. We set out
with very good advantage, as to finding the way; for
we got leave to travel in the retinue of one of their
mandarins, a kind of viceroy, or principal magistrate
in the province where they reside, and who take great
state upon them, travelling with great attendance, and
with great homage from the people, who are some-
times greatly impoverished by them, because all the
countries they pass through are obliged to surnish
provisions for them and all their attendants. Thai
which I particularly observed, as to our travelling
with
with his baggage, was this; that though we received
sufficient provisions, both for ourselves and our horses',
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet
we were obliged to pay for every thing we had fitter
the market price of the country, and the mandarin's
steward, or commissary of the provisions, collected it
duly from us, so that our travelling in the retinue of
the mandarin, though it was a very great kindness to
us, was not such a mighty savour in him, but was,
indeed, a great advantage to him, considering there
were about thirty other people travelling in the same
manner besides us, under the protection of his retinue,
or, as we may call it, under his convoy. This, I say,
was a great advantage to him, for his country surnished
all the provisions for nothing, and he took all our money
for them.
We were five and twenty days travelling to Pekin,
through a country insinitely pupulous, but miserably
cultivated; the husbandry, economy, and the way of
living, all very miserable, though they boast so much of
the industry of the people; I say, miserable, and so
it is, if we, who understand how to live, were to
endure it, or to compare it with our own, but not so
to these poor wretches, who know no other. The pride
of these people is insinitely great, and exceeded by
nothing but their poverty, which adds to that which
I call their misery. 1 must needs think that the naked
savages of America live much more happy, because, as
they have nothing, so they desire nothing: whereas,
these are proud and insolent, and, in the main, are mere
beggars and drudges; their ostentation is inexpressible,
and is chiefly shewed in their clothes and buildings, and in,
the keeping multitudes of servants or staves, and, which-
is to the last degree ridiculous, their contempt of all the
world but themselves.
- I must consess, 1 travelled more pleasantly afterwards
in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary
than here; and yet the roads here are well paved, and
well kept, and very convenient for travellers; but no-
thing was more aukward to me, than to see such ari
haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the midst of
the grossest simplicity and ignorance; for all their samed
a 3 ingenuity
ingenuity is no more. My friend, Father Simon, aad T,
used to be very merry upon these occasions, to see the
beggirly pride of those people: for example, coming by
the house of a country gentleman, as Father Simon called
him, about ten leagues off' from the city of Nanquin, we
had, sirst of all, the honour to ride with the master of
the house about two miles; the state he rode in was a
persect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp ami
poverty.
The habit of this greasy don was very proper for a
scaramouch, or merry-andrew; being a dirty callico,
with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat, such as
hanging-sleeves, tafsety, and cuts and flashes almost on
every tide; it covered a rich tassety vest, as greasy as a
butcher, and which testified that his honour must needs
be a most exquisite sloven.
His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling crea-
ture, such as in England might sell for about thirty or
forty shillings; and he had two Haves followed him on
foot, to drive the poor creature along; he had a whip in
his hand, and he belaboured the beast as sast about the
head as his slaves did. about the tail: and thus he
lode by us with about ten or twelve servants, and we
were told he was going from the city to his country
seat, about half a league before us. We travelled on
gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode away before
us; and as we stopped at a village about an hour to re-
fresh us, when we came bv the country seat of this great
man, we saw him in a little place before his door,
eating his repast; it was a kind of a garden, but he
was easy to be seen, and we were given to understand,
that the more we looked on him, the better he would be
pleased.
He fr.t under a tree, something like the palmettotree,
which efsectually shaded him over the head, and on the
south side; but under the tree also was placed a large
umbrella, which made that part look well enough;
he sat loll ng back in a great elbow chair, be-
ing a heavy corpulent man, and his meat being
brought him by two women slaves, he had two more
whole office, I think, sew gentiemen in Europe would
accept of their service in, viz. one sed the 'squire with a
spoon,
223
spoon, and the other held the dish with one hnnd, and
scraped off' what he let sall upon his worship's bsard,
and taffety vest, with the other ; while the great sat brute
thought it below him to em-ploy his own hands in any ,
of those samiliar offices which kings and monarefis
would rather do than be troubled with the clumsy singers
of their servants.
I took this time to think what pain men's pride puts
them to, and how troublesome a haughty temper, thus ill-
managed, must be to a man of common sense; and,
leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our look-
ing' at him, as if we admired his pomp, whereas we
really pitied and contemned him, we pursued our
journey; only r ather Simon had the curiolity to stay to
inform himself wrjat dainties the country justice had.
to seed on, in all his state; which, he said, he had the
honour to taste of, and which was, I think, a dose
that an English hound would scarce have eaten, if it had
been ossered him, viz. a mess of boiled rice, with a great
piece of garlic in it, and a little bag silled with green
pepper, and another plant which they have there, some-
thing like our ginger, but smelling like musk, and
tasting like mustard; all this was put together, and a
small lump or piece of lean mutton boiled.in it; and this
-was his worship's repast, four or five servants snore at-
tending at a distance. If he sed them meaner than he
was sed himself, the spice excepted, they must sare very
coarsely indeed.
As tor our mandarin, with whom we travelled, he
-was respected like a king; surrounded always with his
gentlemen, and- attended in all his appearances with such
pomj), that 1 saw little ot him but at a distance; but this
I observed, that there was not a horle in his retinue, but
that our. carrier's pack-hories in England seem to roe
to look much better; but tliey were so covered with
equipage, mantles, trappings, and such like trumpery,
that you cannot see whether thc-y are sat or lean. In a
word, we could scarce sec any thing hut their seet and
their heads.
I was now light hearted, and all my trouble and
perplexity that I uad given an account ot being over,
1 had no anxious thoughts about me; which made this
K 4 journey
ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.
journey much the pleasanter to me; nor had I any ill
accident attended me, only in the passing or fording a
small river, my horse sell, and made me free of the coun-
try, as they call it; that is to say, threw me in; the
place was not deep, but it wetted me all over; I mention
it, because it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set
down the names of several people and places which 1 had
occasion to remember, and which not taking due care of,
the leaves rotted,' and the words were never after to be-
read, to my great loss, as to the names of some places
which I touched at in this voyage.
At length we arrived at Pekin; I had nobody with.
me but the youth, whom my nephew the captain had
given me to attend me as a servant, and who proved
very trusty and diligent; and my partner had nobody
with him but one servant, who was a kinsman. As for
the Portuguese Pilot, he being desirous to see the court,
we gave him his passage, that is to say, bore his charges
for his company ;• and to use him as au interpreter, for
he understood the language of the country, and spoke
good French, and a little English; and, indeed, this old
man was a most usesul implement to us every where f
for we had not been above a week at Pekin, when he
fame- laughing, Ah, Seignior Inglese, said he, 1 have
something to tell you will make your heart glad. My
heart glad I said 1; what can that be? I do'nt know
8ny thing in this country can either give me joy or
grief, to any great degree. Yes, yes, said the old man,
in broken English, make you glad, me sorrow ; sorry, he
would have said. This made me more inquisitive.
Why, said, I will it make you sorry? Because, said he,
you have brought me here twenty-five days journey, and.
-will leave me to go back alone; and which way shalt I
get to my port afterwards, without a ship, without a
horse, without pecune? So he called money; being
his broken Latin, of which had abundance to make us
merry with..
In short, he told us there was a great caravan of
Muscovy and Polish merchants in the city, and they
•were preparing to set out on their journey, by land, to
Muscovy, within four or sive weeks, and he was lure
we would take the opportunity to go with- them, and'
leaYÆ-
leave him behind to go back all alone. 1 consess, J
was surprised with this news: a secret joy spread itsel
over my whole soul, which 1 cannot describe, and never
selt before or since; and 1 had no power, for a good
while, to speak a word to the old man: but at last I
turned to him: How do you know this? laid 1: are
you sure it is true? Yes, said he ; I met this' morning, in
the street, an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian,
or one you call a Grecian, who is amon<; them; he came
last from Attracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin,
where 1 formerly. knew him, but has altered his mind,
and is now resolved to go back with the caravan to
Moscow, and so down the river of Wolga to Astracan.
Well, Seignior, said I, do not be uneasy about being;
left to go back alone: if this be a method for my re-
turn to England, it shall be your fault if you go back to
Macao at all. We then went to consulting together
what was to be done, and asked my partner what he
thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would suit
with his affairs? He told me he would do just as 1 would,..
for he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal and
left his effects in such good hands, that as we made a
good voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks,
wrought or raw, such as might be worth the carriage,
he would be content to go to England, and then make
bis voyage back to Bengal by the Company's ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portuguese pilot would go with us, we would bear his
charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased; nor,
indeed, were we to be esteemed over generous in that
part neither, if we had not rewarded him surther; for
- the service he had done us was really worth all that
and more: for he had not only been a pilot to us at
sea, but he had been also like a broker for us on.
shore: and his procuring tor us the .lapan merchant was
feme hundred of pounds in our pockets. So we con-
sulted together about it v and, being willing to gratify
him, which was, indeed, but doing him justice, start very
willing also to have him with us belides, for he was a
most necessary man on all occasions, we agreed to
give him'a quantity of coined gold, which, as I corn-
s' 6- . . :. - pnte
pure it, came to about 175 pounds sterling between us,.
and to bear his charges, both for himself and horse, ex-
tept only a horse to carry his goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called him,
to let him know what we had resolved; I told him, he
had complained'of our being like to let him go back
•alone, and I was now to tell him we were resolved he
should not go back at all-: that as we had resolved to
go to Europe with the caravan, we resolved also he
should go with us, and that we called him to know his
mind. He shook his head, and said it was a lon^
journey, and he had no pecune to carry him thither,
nor to subsist himself when he came thither. We told
him, we believed it was so, and therefore'we had re-
solved to do something for him, that should let him see
how sensible we were of the service he had done us;
and also how agreeable he was to us: and then I
told him what we had resolved to give him here, which
he might lay out as we would do our own; and that as
for his charges, if he would go with us, we would
'set him sase ashore, (lise and casualties excepted)
• either in Muscovy, or in England, which he would,
• at our owd charge, except only the carriage of his
goods. ,
He received the proposal like a man transported, and
told us, he would go with us over the whole world;
and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves for the jour-
ney. However, as it was with us, so it was with
the other merchants, they had many things to do;
and instead of'being ready in five weeks, it was four
months and some odd days before all things were got
together.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when we
set out from Pekin; my partner and the old pilot had
gone express back to the port where we had first put
in, to dispose of tome goods which we had left there;
and I, with a Chinese merchant, whom I had some
knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to Pekin on
his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where I bought
ninety pieces of sine damasks, with about two hundred
pieces of other very sine silks, of several sorts, some
mixed with gold, and had all these brought to Pekin
against
against my partner's return: besides this, we bought
a very large quantity of raw silk, and some other
goods: our cargo amounting in the 'e goods' only,
to about three thousand five hundred pounds stea-
ling, which, together with tea, and some fine cal-
licoes, and three camel loads os nutmegs and cloves,
loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, betides
those we rode upon; which, with two or three spare
horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made
us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses in our
retinue.
The company was very great, and, as near as I can
remember, made between three and four hundred horses
and camels, and upward of an hundred and twenty men,
very well armed, and provided for all events. For, as
the eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by the
Arabs, so are these by the Tartars: but they are not al-
together so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous
when they prevail.
The company consisted of people of several nations,
such as Muscovites chiefly; for there were about sixty of
them who were merchants or inhabitants of Moscow,
though of them some were Livonians, and to our parti-
cular satissaction five of them were Scots, who appeared
also to be men of great experience in business, and very
good substance. jj .
When we had travelled one day's journey, the
guides, who were five in number, called all the gentle-
men and merchants; that is to say, all the passengers,
except the servants, to a great council, as they termed
it. At this great council, every one deposited a certain
quantity of money to a common stock, for the necessary
expence of buying forage on the way,' where it was not
otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting
horses, and the like. And here they constituted the
journey, as they call it, viz. They named captains and
officers to draw us all up, and give the command in case
of an attack, and gave every one their turn of command.
Nor -was this forming us into order any more than what
•we found needful upon the way, as shall be observed in
its place'.
K 6 The
The road all on this side of the country is very po-
pulous, and is sull of potters, and earth-makers, that
is to say, people that tempered the earth for the China
ware; and, as I was going along, our Portuguese pi-
lot, who had always something or other to say to make
us merry, came sneering to me, and told me, he would-
shew the greatest rarity in all the country; and that
I should have this to say of China, after all the ill-hu-
moured things I had said of it, that I had seen one thing;
which was not to beseen-in all the world beside. I was.
very importunate to know what it was; at last he told.
me, it was a gentleman's house, all built with China ware.
Well, said I, are not the materials of their building
the product of their own country ?• and so it is all China.
ware, is it not? No, no, says he, I mean,. it is a house-
all made of China ware, such as you call so in England
or, as it is called in our country, porcelain. Well, said
I', such a thing may be: How big is it:? Can. we carry
it in a box upon a camel? If we can, we will buy it.
Upon a camel! said the old pilot,. holding up both his^
hands, why there is a samily of thirty people lives in it!
1 was then curious, indeed, to see it: and when I came-
to it, it was nothing but this: it was a timber house,..
or a house built, as we call it in England, with lath and
plaster, but all the plastering was really China ware, thafe
js to say, it was plastered with the earth thatmakes China.
ware.
The outside, which the sun shone hot. upon, was.
glased, and looked very well, persectly white, and paint-
ed with blue sigures,. as the large China ware in England/
is, painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt. As to the-
inside, all the walls,. instead of wainscot, were lined
up with- hardened and painted tiles, like the little square-
tiles we call gally-tiles in England, all made of the
finest China, and the figures exceeding fine indeed,.
with extraordinary variety of colours, mixed with gold,.
many tiles^making but one figure,' but joined so artifi-
cially with. mortar, being made of the same earth, that
it was very hard to see where the tiles met. The-
floors of the rooms were of the iame composition,
and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use in.
-4. several!
several parts of England, especially Lincolnshire, Not-
tinghamshire, Leicestershire, &c. as hard as stone, and
smooth, but not burnt and painted, except some smaller
rooms, like closets, which were all as it were paved with
the same tile ; the cielings, and in a word, all the plais-
tering-work in the whole house, were of the same earth
and after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same,
but of a deep shining black.
This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and lite-
rally to be called so \. and, had I not been, upon the jour-
ney, I could have staid some days, to see and examine
the particulars of it. They told me there were fountains
and fish-ponds in the garden, all paved at the bottom and
sides with the same, and fine statues set up in rows on
the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain earth, and
burnt whole. .
As this is one of the singularities of China, so they
may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they
excel in their accounts of it; for they told me such
incredible' things of their persormance in crockery-
ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, as know-
ing it could not be true. One told me, in particular,
of a workman that made a ship, with all its tackle,.
and masts, and sails, in earthen ware, big enough tO'
carry fifty men. If he had told me he launched it, and
made- a voyage to Japan in it, I might have said some-
thing to it indeed; but as it was, i knew the whole
story, which was, in short, asking pardon for the word,
that the sellow lied;. so li smiled, and said nothing tr>
it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan,
for which the leader of it for the day fined me about
the value of three shillings, and told me, if it had.
been three days' journey without the wall, as it was
three days, within, he must have fined me four times as
much, and made me ask pardon the next council
day; so I premised to be more orderly;. for, indeed,.
1 found afterwards the orders made for keeping all
together were absolutely necessary for our common
sasety.
In two days more we passed the great China wall,.
made for a fortification against the Tartars; and a very
great
graat work it is, going over hills and mountains in au
endless track, where the rocks* are jmpassable, and the
precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter, or,
indeed, climb up, or where, if they did, no wa'l could
hinder them. They tell us, its length is near a thou-
sand English miles, but that the country is five hun-
dred in a straight measured line, which the wall bounds,
without measuring the windings and turnings it takes;
'tis about four sathom high, and as many thick in some
places.
1 stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without tres-
passing on our orders, for so long the caravan was in.
passing the gate; I say, 1 stood still an hour to look at
it on every side, near, and sar off, I mean. what was
within my view; and the guide of our caravan, who
had been extolling it for the wonder of the world,
was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told
him it was a most excellent thing to keep off' the Tar-
tars, which he happened not to understand as I meant
it, and so took it for a compliment; but the old pilot
laughed; O Seignior Inglei'e, said he, you speak in co-
lours. In colours! said I: what do you mean by that?
Why you speak what looks white this way, and black
that way; gay one way, and dull another way; you
tell him it is a good wall to keep out Tartars; you tell
me by that, it is good for not-King but to keep out
Tartars; or it will keep out none but Tartars: I un-
derstand you, Seignior Inglesc, 1 understand you, said
he, joking; but Seignior Chinese understand you his own
-way. .
Well, said I, Seignior, do you think it would stand
out an army of our country people, with a good train
of artillery; or our engineers, with two companies of
miners? Would they not batter it down in ten days, that
an army might enter in battalia, or blow it up into
the air, foundation and all, that there should be rio sign
of it left? Ay, ay, said he, 1 know that. The t hinese
wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gave him
leave to tell him a sew days after, for we were then al--
most out of their country, and he was to leave us in a
little time afterwaads; but when he knew what I had
said, he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard
no
no more of his fine story of the Chinese power and great
ness while he staid.
After we had passed this mighty nothing, called a wall,
something like the Picts' wall, so samous in Northumber-
land, and built by the Romans, we began to find the
country thinly inhabited, and the people rather consined
to live in fortified towns and cities, as being subject to
the inroads and depreciations of the Tartars, who rob in
great armies, and therefore are not to be relisted by the
naked inhabitants of an open country.
And here I began to find the necessity of keeping to-
gether in a caravan, as we travelled; for we saw several
troops of Tartars roving about; but when I came to
see them distinctly, I wondered how that the Chinese
empire could be conquered by such contemptible sellows;
for they are a mere herd or croud of wild sellows, keep-
ing no order, and understanding no discipline, or manner
of sight.
Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, taught
nothing, and are fit for nothing; and this we found
the first day we saw them, which was after we entered
the wilder part of the country; our leader for the day
gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting, as
they call it: and what was this but hunting of sheep!
However, it may be called hunting too; for the crea-
tures are the wildest, and swiftest of soot, that ever I
saw of their kind; only they will not run a great way,
and you are sure of sport when you begin the chace;
for they appear generally by thirty or forty in a flock,
and, like true sheep, always keep together when they
fy
In pursuit of this odd fort of game, it was our hap
to meet with about forty Tartars; whether they were
hunting mutton as we were, or whether they looked
for another kind of prey, 1 know not; but as soon as
they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn very loud,
but with a barbavous (bund that I had never heard before;
and, by the way, never care to hear again. We all sup-
posed this was to call their friends about them; and so
it was; for in less than halt a quarter of an hour a troop
forty or fifty more appeared at about a mile distance-
but our work was over tirst, as it happened.
One of the Scots merchants of Muscow happened to
be amongst us: and as soon as he heard the horn, he
told us, in short, that we had nothing to do, but to
charge them immediately, without loss of time; andr
drawing us up in a line, he asked, if we were resolved;
we told him, We were ready to follow him: so he rode
directly up to them. They stood gazing at us like a
mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor shewing the sace
of any order at all; but as soon as they saw us advance,.
they let fly their arrows: which, however, missed us
very happily ; it seems they mistook not their aim, but
their distance: for their arrows all sell a little short of us,'
but with so true an aim, that had we been about 20
yards nearer, we must have had several men wounded, if
not killed.
Immediately we halted: and though it was at a great?
distance, we sired, and sent them leaden bullets for
-wooden arrows, following our shot sull gallop, resolving-
to sall in among them sword in hand: for so our bold'
Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed, but a.
merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and bravery
on this occasion, and yet with such a cool courage
too, that I never saw any man in action fitter for
eommand..
As loon as we came up to them, we fired our pistols-
in their saces, and then drew; but they fled in the
greatest consusion imaginable: the only stand any of-
them made was on our iight, where three of them
stood, and, by signs, called the rest to come back to'-
them ; having a kind of feymitar in their hands, and their
bows hanging at their back.
Our brave commander, without asting any body to
follow him, gallopped up close to them, and with his
susil knocked one of them off his horse, killed the second
with his pistol, and the third ran away: and thus
ended our fight: but we had this misfortune attending:
it, viz. that all our mutton that we had in chace got
away. We had not a man killed or hurt; but,. as for
the Tartars, there were about sive of them killed: how
many were wounded, we knew not: but this we knew,-
that-
233
that the other party was so frighted with the noise of our
guns, that they fled, and never made any attempt upon
us.
We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and
therefore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards: but
in about five days we entered a vast great wild desert,
which held us three -days and nights march; and we
were obliged to carry our water with us in great leather
bottles, and to encamp all night, just as I have heard they
do in the deserts of Arabia.
I asked our guides, whose dominion this was in I
and they told me, this 'was a kind of border that
might be called, No Man's Land; being part of the
Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary; but that how-
ever, it was reckoned to China; that there was no care
taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves;
and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the
whole march, though we were gone over some much.
ferger.
In pasting this wilderness, which I consess, was at the
first view very frightsul to me, we saw two or three times
little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon
their own affairs, and to have no design upon us; and
so, like the man who met the devil, if they had nothing-
to say to us, we had nothing to say to them; we let
them go.
Once, however, a party of them came so. near as to
stand and gaze at us; whether it was to consider what
they should do, viz. to attack us, or not attack us, we
knew not; but when we were pasted at some distance
by them., we made a rear-guaid of forty men, and
stood ready for them, letting the caravan pass half
a mile, or thereabouts, before us; after a while they
marched off, only we sound they assaulted us with five
arrows at their parting; one of which wounded a horse,
so that it disabled him; and we left him the next day,
poor creature, in great need of a good sarrierwe sup-
pose they might ihoot more arrows, which might sall
short of us; but we saw no more arrows or Tartars as.
that time.'
We travelled near a month after this, the ways being;
not so. good as at first, though still in the dominions' of
the
the Emperor of China; but lay, for the most part, In
villages, some of which were fortified, because of the
incursions of the Tartar's. When we came to one of
these towns (it was about two days and an half's jour-
ney before we were come to the City of Naum),
I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty
to be sold all the way upon that road, and of horses
also, such as they are, because so many caravans com-
ing that way, they are very often wanted. The person
that I spoke to, to get me a camel, would have gone
and setched it for me, but 1, like a fool, must be osfi-
cious, and go myself along with him. The place was
about two miles out of the village, where it seems,
they kept the camels and horses seeding under 3
guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company,
and a Chinese, being desirous, forsooth, of a little vari-
ety. When we came to this place, it was a low marshy
ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry,
without mortar or earth among it; like a park with
a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the doors. Haying
bought a camel, and agreed for the price, 1 came
away; and the Chinese man, that went with me, led
the camel, when on a sudden came up sive Tartars
on horseback; two of them seized the sellow, and took
the camel from him, while the other three stepped
up to me, and my old pilot; seeing us, as it were,
unarmed, for 1 had no weapon about me but my sword,
which could but ill desend me against three horse-
men. The first that came up, stopped short upon my
drawing my sword (for they are arrant cowards): but
a second coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the
head, which i never selt till afterwards, and won-
dered, when I came to myself, what was the mat-
ter with me, and where I was, for he laid me slat on
the ground; but my never-sailing old pilot, the Portu-
guese (so Providence unlooked for directs deliverances
srom dangers, which to us are unforeseen), had a pistol
in his pocket, which I knew nothing os, nor the Tartars
neither; if they had, I suppose they would not have
attacked us;. but cowards are always boldest. when there
is no danger.
The
The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart step-
ped up to the sellow that had struck me. and laying hold
of his arm with one hand, and pulling him down by main
force a little towards him with the other, he shot him in-
to the head, and laid him dead on the spot; he then im-
mediately stepped up to him who had stopped us, as I
said, and before he could.come forwar d again) far it was
all done as it were in a moment) made a blow at him
with a scymitar, which he always wore; but, miffing
the man, cut his horse into. thelide of his head, cut one
of his ears off by the root, and a great slice down the
side of his sace. The poor beast, enraged with the wounds,
Vas no more to be governed by his rider, though the sel-
low sat well enough soo; but away he slew, and carried
him quite out of the pilot's reach, and at some distance
rising upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and
sell upon him.
In this interval the poor Chinese came in, who had
lost the camel, but he had no weapon; however, seeing
the Tartar down, and his horse sallen upon him, he runs
to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-savoured weapon he
bad by his fide, something like a poll-ax, but not a pole-
ax neither, he wrenched it from him, and made shift to
knock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old
man had the third Tartar to deal with still; and, seeing
he d_id not fly as he expected, nor come on to siglxt him,
as he apprehended, but stood stock-still, the old man
stood still too and salls to work with his tackle to charge
his pistol again; but as loon as the Tartar saw the
pistol, whether he supposed it to be the same or
another, I know not; but away he scoured, and left
my pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a com-
plete victory. . •
By this time I was a little awake; for I thought,
-when I first began to awake, that 1 had been in a sweet
steep; but as 1 said above, I wondered where I was,
how I carhe upon the ground, and what was the mat-
ter; in a word, a sew minutes after, as fense returned,
1 selt pain, though I did not know where; I clapped
my hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then
1 selt my head ache; and then, in another moment, me-
-' . mory
mory returned, and every thing was present to me'
again.
) jumped up upon my seet instantly, and got hold of
my sword, but no enemies in view. 1 found a Tartar
lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly by him;
and, looking farther, I saw my champion and deliverer,
•who bad been to see what the Chinese had done, coming
back with his hanger in his hand; the old man, see-
ing me on my seet, came running to me, and embraced
me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before that
1 had been killed; and seeing me bloody, would see-
how I was hurt; but it was not much, only what we
call a broken head; neither did I afterwards find any
great inconvenience from the blow other than the place
which was hurt, and which was well again in two or
three days.
We .,made no great gain, however, by this victory;
for we \o& a carnal, and gained a horse; but that whichr
was remarkable, when we came back to the village,.
the man demanded to.be paid for the camel: I disputed
it, and it was, brought to a hearing before the Chi-
nese Judge of the place; that is to say, in Engljsh»
we went before a j.ustice of the peace. Give him hiss
due, he acted with a great deal of prudence and impar-
tiality; and, having heard both sides, he gravely asked
the Chinese man that went with me to buy the camel,
whose servant he was? I am no servant, said he, but
went with the stranger. At whose request ?, said the
justice. At the stranger's request, said be. Why then,
said the justice, you were the stranger's servant for
the time; and the camel being delivered to his ser-
vant, to wit as delivered to him, and he must pay for
it.
I consess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word
to say: but admiring to see such just reasoning upon the
consequence, and so accurate stating the case, 1 paid wil-
lingly for the camel, and sent for another: but you may
observe, I sent for it: I did not go to setch it myself any
more: I had enough of that.
The city of Naum is a frontier .of the Chinese em-
pire:. they call it fortified, and so it is, as fortisications
go there i for this I will venture to affirm, that all the
Tartars
Tartars in Karakathy, which I believe, are some mil-
lions, could not batter down the walls with their bows
and arrows; but to call it strong if it were attacked
with cannon, would be to make those who understand it
laugh at you.
We wanted, as I have said, about two days' journey
of this city, when messengers were sent express to every
part of the' road, to tell all travellers and caravans to
halt, till they had a guard sent to them; for that an
-unusual body of Tartars, making ten thousand in all,
had appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond the
city.
This was very bad news to travellers: however, it was
caresully done of the governor, and we were very glad
to hear we should have a guard. Accordingly two days
after, we had 200 soldiers lent us from a garrison of the
Chinese on our left, and three hundred more from the city
of Naum, and with those we advanced boldly: the three
hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our front, the
two hundred in our rear, and our men on each side of
our camels with our baggage, and the whole caravan
in the center; in this order, and well prepared for battle,
we thought ourselves a match for the whole ten thou-
sand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared; but the
next day, when they did appear, it was quite another
thing.
It was early in the morning, when marching from a
little well-situated town, called Changu, we had a river
to pass, where we were obliged to serry; and had
the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been the
time t6 have attacked us, when, the caravan being over,
the rear guard was behind; but they did not appear
there.
About three hours after, when we were entered upon
a desert of about 15 or 16 miles over, behold, by a cloud
of dust they raised, we s.w an enemy was at hand; and
they were at hand indeed, for they came on upon the
spur.
The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked
so big the day before, began to stagger, and the soldiers
frequently looked behind them; which is a certain sign
in a soldier, that he is just ready to run away. My
old
old pilot was of my mind; and, being near me, he
called out, Seignior Inglese, said he, those sellows must
be encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if the Tar-
tars come on, they will never stand it. I am of your
mind, said I; but what course must be done? Done,
said he, let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on
each wing, and encourage them, and they will fight like
brave sellows in brave company; but without it they
will every man turn his back. Immediately I rode up
to our leader, and told him, who was exactly of our
mind; and accordingly fifty of us marched to the right
wing, and hfty to the left, and the rest made a line of
reserve; for so we marched, leaving the last two hun-
dred men to make another body to themselves, and to
guard the camels; only that, if need were, they should
send an hundred men to assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable
company they were; how many, we could not tell, but
ten thousand we thought was the least. A party of them
came on first, and viewed our polture, traversing the
ground in the front of our line; and as we found them
within gun-shot, our leader ordered the two wings to
advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing with
their shot, which was done; but they went off, and I
suppose went back to give an account of thexreception
they were like to meet with; and, indeed, that salute
clogged their stomachs; for they immediately halted,
stood awhile to consider of it, and, wheeling off to the
lest, they gave over the design, and said no more to us
for that time, which was very agreeable to our circum-
stances, which were but very inditfisrent for a battle with
such a number.
Two days after this we came to the city of Xaum, or
Naunm; we thanked the governor for his care for us,
and collected to the value of 100 crowns, or thereabouts,
-which we gave to the soldiers lent tq guard us: and here
we rested one day. This is a garrison indeed, and there
were nine hundred soldiers kept here: but the reason
of it was, that formerly the Muscovite frentiers lay
nearer to them than they do now, the Muscovites hav-
ing abandoned that part of the country (which lies srom
the city well, for about two hundred miles) as desolate
and unsit for use; and more especially, being so very
remote, and so difficult to send troops hither for its
desence; for we had yet above two thousand miles to
Muscovy, properly so called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two dread-
sul deserts, one of which we were sixteen days passing
over, and which, as I laid, was to be called No Man's
Land; and on the I 3th of April, we came to'frontiers of
the Muscovite dominions. I think the first city, or town,
•of fortress, whatever it might be called, that belonged
to the Czar of Muscovy, was called Argun, being oia the
west fide of the river Argun.
1 could not but discover an infinite satisfaction, that I
was now arrived in, as'1 called it a christian country;
or, at least, in a country governed by christians; for
though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, but jult de-
ferve the name of christians; yet such they pretend to
be, and are very devout in their way. It would certainly
occur to any man who travelsthe world as I have done,
and who had any power of reflection; I fay, it would
occur to him to reflect, what a blessing it' is to be
brought into the world where the name of God, and of
a Redeemer, is known, worshipped, and adored, and
not where the 'people, given up by heaven to strong
delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate themselves
to stocks and stones; worship monsters, elements, hor-
rible shaped animals, ami statues, or images of mon-
sters. Not a town or city we passed through but had'
their pagods, their idols, and their temples, and igno-
rant people worshipping even the works of their own
hands. . ',.';*'
.. (.-Now we came.where, at least', a sace of the christian
-worship appeared, where the knee was bowed to Je-
sus; and whether ignorantly or not, yet the christian
religion was owned, and the name of the true God was
called upon, and adored; and it made the very recesses
.of my lbul rejoice to see it. 1 saluted tbe brave Scotch
merchant I mentis nsd abo^e, with my first acknowledg-
ment of this; and;. taking him by the band, I said to
him, blessed be God, we are once again come among
christians. He smiled,- and answered, do not rejoice too
soon, coLntryman; these Muscovites are but an odd sort of
. . chrif-
christians; and but for the name of it, you may see
very little of the substance for some months sarther of our
journey.
Well, said I, but still 'tis better than paganism, and
-worshipping of devils. Why, I'll tell you, said he;
except the Ruffian soldiers in garrisons; and a sew of the
inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the rest of
this country, for above a thousand miles sarther, is inha-
bited by the worst, and most ignorant of Pagans; and
so indeed we found it.
We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid
«arth, if I understand any thing of the sursace of the
globe, that is to be found in any part of the world;
we had at least twelve hundred miles to the sea, east-
ward; we had at least two thousand to the bottom of
the Baltic sea, westward; and almost three thousand
miles, if we left that-sea, and went on west to the Bri-
tish and French channels; we had sull five thousand miles
to the Indian or Persian sea, south; and.about eight
hundred rniles to the frozen sea, north; nay, if some
people may be believed, there might be no lea north-
east till we came round.the pole, and consequently into
the north-west, and so had a continent of land into
America, no mortal knows where; though I could
give some reasons why I believe that to be a mistake
too.
As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a good
while before we came to any considerable town, we
had nothing to observe there but this; first, that all the
rivers run to the east. As I understood by the charts
which some of our caravans had With them, it was
plain that all those rivers ran into the great river
Vamour, or Gammour. This river, by the natural
course of it, must run into the east sea, or Chinese
ocean. The story they tell us, that the mouth of this
river is choaked up with bulrushes of a monstrous
growth, vi^j'. three seet about, and twenty or thirty
seet high, I must be allowed to say, I believe nothing of;
but as its navigation is of no use, because there is
no trade that way, the Tartars, to whom alone it
belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle; so nobody that
ever I heard of, has been curious enough either to
8°
'go clown to the mouth of it in boats, or come up from
the mouth of it in ships; but this is certain, that this
river, running due east, in the latitude of 60 degrees, car-
ries a vast concourse of rivers along with island finds an
ocean to empty itself in that latitude; so we are sure of
lea there.
Some leagues to the north of this river there are several
considerable rivers, whose streams run as due north as the
Yamour runs east; and these are all found to join their'
waters with the great river Tartarus, named so from the
northernmost nations of the Mogul Tartars, who, the
Chinese say, were the first Tartars in the world; and whoy'
us our geographers alledge, are the Gog and Magog men-
tioned in sacred story.
The .rivers running all northwatd, as well as all the
other. rivers.I am yet to speak of, make it evident, that-
'the northern peean bounds the land also on that.
side J so that it does not seem rational in -the least to.
think, that the land can extend itself t6 join with Ame-
rica on that side, or that there is not a communication
between the northern and the eastern ocean; but of
this I shall. say no more; it was my observation at that
time, and therefore I take notice of it in this place. We.
now advanced from the rivet Arguna, by easy and mo-
derate journies, and were very visibly obliged to the
care the czar df Muscovy has 'taken to have cities
and towns built in as many places as are possible to
to place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, some-
thing like the stationary soldiers placed by the Romans
in the remotest corners of their empire, some of which I
liad read were {fcrticularly placed in Britain for the secu-
rity ofcommerce, and for the lodging of travellers; and
thus it was here.; for wherever we came, though at these
towns and stations the. garrison aiid governor were.
Russians, and prosessed mere Pagans, sacrificing to idols,
:and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the
host of heaven: and not only so, but were, of all the hea-
thens. and pagans that ever I met with, the most barba-
rous, except only that they did not eat men's :fiesh, as
our s/avageSiof America did. . ,
. Some instances. 9s thjs we met with in the country
•befweeo, Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite domi-
vol. it, * mons
rions and a city of Tartars and Ruffians together, cal-
led Nertzinskay; in which space is a continued desert or
forest, which cost us twenty days to tr: vel over it. Ili
a village, near the last of those places, I had the curi-
osity to go and see their way of living: Avhi<h is most
bruttCh aud insufferable , they had, 1 suppose, a great
sacrifice that day ; for their stood out, upon an old stump
of a tree, an idol made of wood, friglitrul as the devil -
:at least as any tiiing we can fhink of to represent the
devil can be made; it nad an head certainly not so much
resembling an v creature that the world e'er saw; ears
as big as goat's horns, and as hi; h:^eyesas big as a
.crown piece; a nose like a crooked ram's horn, and
a mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a lion,
with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under bill;
it was dressed up in the filthiest mAnner that you can
suppose; its upper garment was of sheep flkins, with the
wool outward ; a great tartar bonnet on the head, with
two horns growing through it: it was about eight seet
iigh, yet had no seet or legs, or any otfeer proportion
of parts
This scarecrow was set up at the out-side of the -vil-
lage; and when I came near to it, there were sixteen
or seventeen creatures, whether men or women I
-could not tell, for they make no distinction by their
habits, either of body or head; these lay all flat on the
ground, round this formidable dIocIj: of shapeless wood.
1 saw no motion among them any more than if they
had been logs of wood like their idol. At first 1 really
thought they had been Ib; but when 1 came a little
nearer, they started up upon their sectfc and raised an
howling cry, as if it had been Ib many deep-mouthed
hounds, and walked away as if they were tUTplea'ed at
our disturbing them. A little way off from this mon-
ster, and at the door of a tent or hut, made all of
fheep-ifkins and cow-flsins, dried, stood three butchers;
I thought they were such; for when I «arac nearer to
them, 1 found^they had long knives in their hands,
and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep
killed, and one young bullock, or steer. These, it
seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol;
Tf and these three men piiests belonged to it; and the sc-
Tenteea
.s: .. . /
Veriteen prostrated wretches were the people who brought
the offering, and were making their prayers to that
'stock..
I consess I was more moved at their stupidity, and
this brutish worship of an hobgoblin, than ever I was
at any thing irr my life; to see God's most glorious
and best creature, to whom he had granted so many
- advantages, even by creation, above the rest of tha
works of his hands> vested with a reasonable soul, and
that soul adorned with saculties and capacities adapted
both to honour his Maker, and be honoured by him;
'I say, to see it sunk and degenerated to a degree so
more than stupid, as to prostrate itself to « frightsul no-
thing, a mere imaginary object, drafted up by them-
selves, and made 'terrible to themselves by their own
contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags; dad
that this should be the effect of mere ignorance, wrought
up in hellish devotion. by the devil himself; who, en-
vying his Maker the homage and adoration of his
creatures, had deluded them into such gross, surseiting,
sordid, and brutish things, as one would think should
shock natureitfelf. fj
But what signified all the astonishment and reflection
•of my thoughts? Thus it was, and I saw it before my
eyes; and there was no room to wonder at it, or think
it impossible; all my admiration turned to rage; and
I rode up to the image or monster, call it what you
will, and with my sword cut the bonnet that was on
Uts head in two in the middle, so that it hung down by
one of the horns; and one of our men that was with
-me took hold of the sheep skin that covered it, and pul-
led at it, when, behold a most hideotis outcry and
howling ran through the village, and two or three
hundred people came about my ears, so that I was
glad to scour for it; for we saw some had bows and
arrows; but I resolved from that moment to visit them
.again. 0
Our caravan rested three nights at this town, which
was about four miles off^ in order to provide some
horses, which they wanted, several of the horses havi.
ing been lamed and jaded with the badness of the way,
i 2 and
and our long march over the last desert.; so we had
•some leisure here to' piit my design 'in execution. I
•communicated my project to the Scots merchant of
Moscow, of whose courage I had a susficient teslimony,
as above. I told him what ! had seen, and with what
-indignation I had since thought, that human nature
-could be so degenerate. 1 told him, I was resolved, if
3 could get but four or sive men, well armed, to go with
me, to go and destroy that vile abominable idol: to
let them see that it had no power to help itself, and
-consequently could not be an~ object of worship, or to be*-
iprayed to, much less help them that osfered sacrisices
lo it.
He laughed at rne^ said he, Your zeal may be good;
%ut what do you propose to yourself by it? Propose!
said I, to vindicate the honour of God, which is in-
sulted by this devil-wotlbip. But how will it vindi-
cate the honour of Goes? Grid he, while the people
will not be able to know what vou mean by it, unless
you could speak to them too, and tell them so ; -and
then they will sight you too, I will assure you; fox'
they are desperate seUows, and that especially In de-
sence of their idolatry. Can we not, said I, do-it ia
the night, and then leave them the reasons in writing,
in their own language? Writing! said he, why there
is not, in five nations of them, one man that knows any
thing of a letter, or how to read a word in any lari-'
guage, or in their own. W retched ignorance! said I
to him; however, 1 have a great mind to do it; perhaps
nature may draw inferences from it to them, to let them
see how brutish they are to worship such horrid things.
Look you, Sir, soid he, if your zeal prompts you to it so
warmly, yoU must do it; but, in the next place, I
would have you consider these wild nations of people
are subjectec?, by force, to'the czar of Muscovy's do-
minions; and if you do this, it is ten to one but they will
come by thousandsto the governor of Nertzinskay, and
complain, anfedemand satissaction: and if he cannot
give them satissaction, it is ten to one but they revolt; and
it will occasion anew war with all the'lartars in the
country.
. : This,
This, I consess, put new thoughts into my head for
a. while; but I harped upon: the same string still; and:
all that day I was uneasy to put my project in execu-
tion. Towards the evening the Scots merchant met
me by accident in our-walk about the town, and de-
sired to speak with me:1 believe^ said he,. 1 have
put you off your good design. ;< ,I hay.e been- a little con-:
cerned about it since for 1 abhor the idoLand idolatry,.
as much as you can do^ Truly,j, suid 1, you have
put it off a little as to the execution of it, but you.'
have not put it all out of my thoughts; and, 1 believe, I
shall do it still before 1 quit this place, though I were
to be delivered up to them for satissaction. No, no,
laid he: God forbid they should deliver you up to such-
a crew of monsters! they shall not do that neither
that would be murdering yqu iritkeil. Why, said I,
how would they use me? tile'you ! said he; I'll tell.
you how they served a poor Ruflian who affronted therrv
ui their worship just as you did,. and whom they took
prisoner ; after they had lamed him. with an arrow, that
he could net runaway, they took him.and shipped him.
stark naked, and set him upon the top of the idol mon-
ster, and stood all round nirti, and shot. as many ar-
rows into him as would stick. o/ver his whole body, and
then they burnt him and all;. the arrows sticking in:
him, as a sacrifice to the idol.. And .w^as .this the tame
idol ? said I. Yes, said he, -. the very same. Well, laid.
I, I will tell you a story : so I related the story ot' our men.
at Madagascar, and how they burnt and lacked the vil-
. lage there, and killed, man, woman, and child, for their
murdering me of our men, iust as it is related before ;,
and when I had dene,. 1 added, that L thought we ought
to do so to this village.
He listened very attentively to the story; but when
I talked of doing to to that village, said he, you mistake
very much; it was not this village, it was almost a hun-
dred miles from this place; but it wjjs the same idol,
for they carry him about-in proceliion all over the.
country. Well, said 1, then that idol ought to bs
punisned for it; and it shall, faidi,, if 1 live this night
out.
u 3 In
In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design,
and told me I should not go alone, but he would go-
with me; but he would go first, and bring a stout
fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us; and
one, said he, as samous for his zeal' as you can desire
any one to be against such devilish things as these. Ib
a word, he brought me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom
he called Captain Richardson; and I gave him a sull ac-
count of what 1 had seen, and also of what 1 intended ;-
and he told me readily, he would go with me, if it cost
him his lise. So we agreed to go, only we three. 1 had,
indeed, proposed it to my partner, but he declined it. He
said, he was ready to assist me to the utmost, and upon all
occasions, for my desenae', but that this was an adven-
ture quite out of his way: so, 1 say, "we resolved upon
our work, only we three, and my man-servant, and to put
it in execution that night about midnight*.with all the
secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to
delay it till the next night, because the caravan being to
set forward in the morning, we supposed the governor
could not pretend to give them any satissaction upon us.
when we were out of his power; the Scots merchant, as
'^eady in his resolution to enterprize it, as bold in exe-
cuting, brought me a Tartar's robe or gown of sheep-
skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had
provided the same for himself and his countryman, that
the people, if they saw us, should not be able to determine-
who we were.
All the first night we spent in mixing up some combus-
tible matter with aqua-vitæ, gunpowder, and such other
materials as we could get; and, having a good'quantity
of tar in a little pot, about an hour after. night we set.
out upon our expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night,
!|nd found that the people had not the least jealousy of
danger attending their idol; the night was cloudy, yet
the moon gave us light enough to see that the idol
stood just in the same posture and place that it did
before. The people seemed to be all at thejr rest, only.-
that- in the great hut, or tent, as we called it, where.
24-7
•we saw the three priests, whom we mistook for butchers;
we saw a light, and, going up close to the door, we
heard people talking, as if there were five or fix of
them; we concluded, therefore, that if we set wild fire
to the idol, 'these men would come out immediately,
and run up- to the place to rescue it from the de-
struction that we intended for it: and what to do with
them we knew not. Once we thought of carrying it'
away, and letting fire to it at a diitance; but when
we came to handle it, vre found it too bulky son our
carriage; so we were at a loss again. The second
Scotsman was for setting fire to the tent or hut, and -
knocking the creatures that were there on the head
-when they came out; but 1 could not join with that; 1
was against killing them, if it was possible to be avoided.
'Well, then, said the Scots merchant, I will tell you what
we will do; we will try to take them prisoners, tie their
ban 6, and make them. stand and see their idol de-
stroyeck
As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough
about us, which we used 'to tie our fire-works together
with; so .we resolved to'attack these. people first, and
with as littlenoise as we could. The first thing we did,
we knocked' at the door, when one of the priests
•coming to it, we immediately seized upon him, stopped
his mouth, and tied his hands behind him and led him to
the idol, where we gagged him, that he might not make
a'hoii'e; tied his seet also together, and left him on the
ground;.'''
Two of us then waited'at the door, expecting that
another would come out to see what the matter was;
but we waited so long that the third man came back to
-us'; and then, nobody coming out, we knocked again
geritly, and immediately' out came two more, and we
ferved them just in the same manner, but were obliged
•to go all-with them, and lay them down by the id<jl
some distance srom one another; when, going back,
• we found two -more were come out to the door, and
• a third stood behind' them within the door. We leized
the two, -and immediately tied them, when the third
stepping back, and crying out, my Scots merchant
weut in after them, and taking out a composition we
l 4 bad
had made, that would only smoke and stink, he..set sire
to it, and threw it in among them.; hy that,time the
other Scotsman and' my man taking charge ps. the two
men already bound, and tied together also by the arm,
led them away to the idol, and left them there, to s«e
if their idol would relieve them^ making hast? back. to
us. • i . •
When the sune we had .thrown in-had filled the' hut
with so much smoke that they were almost suffocated,
we then threw in a small leather bag of another kind,
which flamed like a candle,.and, following it. iu,:.Re-
sound there were but four people left, wliOj.it seems,.were
two men. and two women, and, as we supposed, had
'been about some of their diabolical .sacrifices, , -TfaY
'appeared, in short, frighted to death, at least-so .as to. fit
trembling and stupid, and not able to .spe^k fiekher,-.for
the smoke. . . , . • ... . w . 0,, , . .,/<
In a word,We took them, bound them.rts.:we had the
other, and all without any noise. 1 should have said,
we brought them out of the house, of hut, first; for,
indeed, we were not able to bear.the, smoke apy mofe
than they were. When we had done this, w.e carried
'them altogether to the idol; when we.Tcame there w-e
sell to work with him; and first we. daubed him. va1l
over, and his robes also, with tar, and such other
'stuff a's we had, which was tallow mixed with brim-
stone; then westopped his eyes, and ears, and mouth
sull of gun-powder; then we wrapped up a great
piece of wild fire in his bonnet; and then sticking
all the combustibles we had brought with.us upon him,
we looked about to see if we could find any thing else
to help to burn him: when my Scotsman remem-
bered, that by the tent or hut where the rnen were,
there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw or rushes
1 do not remember: away he and ,the other Scotsmap.
ran, and setched their arms sull of. that. When we had
done this, we took all our prisoners, and brought {hem,
having untied their seet, aud. ungagged their roputh^,
and made them stand up, and set them just- before
their monstrous idol, and then. set fire to the
Tashole. ri .:i
'We staid by it a quarter of an< hour, or thereabouts,
till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the
idol blew up, and, as we could perceive, had split and
deformed the shape of it-, and, in a word, till we saw,.
it burnt into a mere block or log of wood; aud then-
setting the dry forage to it, we found it would: be soon.
quite consumed; so we began to thank of going away ;.
but the Scotchman said: No, we mast not go; forthese
poor deluded wretches will afl throw themselves into th'e-
'fire, and burn themselves v.ith the idoi; so we resolved-
to stay till the forage was burnt down.too,.and then we-
came away and left them.
In the morning we appeared among- our sellow tra-
vellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our journey
nor could any man suggest that we had been any-
where but in our beds, as travellers might be supposed!
to be, to fit themselves son the satigues of. that, day's*
'journey.
But it did not end so ;. forthe rtexf day came a greatt
multitude of the country people, not only of this vil—,
lage, but of an hundred more, for aught 1 know, to-
the town-gates,-and, in a most outrageous manner, de-
manded satissaction of the Ruffian governor, for the in-
sulting their priests, and burning their great' Cham-
Ghi-Thaungu; such an hard name they. gave the mon-
strous creature they worshipped: the people of Nert—
iinskay were as sirst in a great consternation.: for, they
ftid, the TaTtars. were no less than 30,000,.. and
that in a sew days more,. they' would be 100,000'
strong. '...
The Ruffian governor sent out messengers to appease
them, and gave them all the good' words imaginable.
He assured them he knew nothing of it, and that there-
had not a foul of his garrison been abroad r that it!
could not be from: any there: and if they would. let-
liim know who it was, they should be exemplarilr'
punished. They. returned, haughtily, That all the
country reverenced the'great Chani-Chi-Thaurigu, who
dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared to-
ofser violence to his image, but some Christian mis-
creant;. so Kbey called them, it seems ; .ant! they there—
id S- foxec
fore denounced war against him, and all the Russians^.
who, they said, were miscreants and Christians.
The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a.
breach, or to have any cause of war,alledged to be given
by him, the Czar having straigbtly charged him to treat.
the conquered country with gentleness and civility,^ gave
them. still all the good words he couldat.last he told
them, there was a caravan gone towards Russia that
morning, aud, perhaps, itwa; some of them who had
done them this injury.; and that, if they would be satis-
fied with that,.he would send .after. them„.to enquire into
it. This seemed to appease them, a- little.; and accord-
ingly the governor sqit after. us, and gave us a particular
account how the thing was; intimating withal, that if
any in our caravan had done.it, they mould make their
escape;. but that, whether they had done it or no, we
should make all the haste forward that was possible; and
that in the mean time, he. would keep them in play as
long as he cpuld<
This was very friendly in the governor. However,
,when it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew
any thing of the matter; arid, as for us that were guilty,
we were the least of -all suspected; none so much as
asked us the question; however, the captain of the
caravan,. fpr the time,. took the hint that. the governor
gave us, and wermarched or travelled two. days and two
nights. without any considerable stop, and then we lajr.
at a village called Plothus; nor did. we make any
long stop here, but hastened on towards Jarawena,
another of the Cxar of Muscovy's colonies, and where
we expected we should; be saser hHt.it is to be--
observed, that.here we began, for two or three day*
march, ta enter upon a vast nameless desert,. of which.,.
1 shall fay more in. its place; and which if we had
noW/been upon it, it is more than.probable,. we had
been, all. destroyed. 1t was the second day's march
from Plothus, that, by the clouds of daft behind us at,
a great distance, some of our p.eople began to be sen-
sible we were pursued; we.had entered the desert, and
bad passed by a great lake, called Schanks Osier, when
we perceived 3 very jjre^t body of horse appear on the
other
other side of the lake to the north j we travelling west;
We observed they went away west, as we did; but
had supposed we should have taken that side of the lake,
whereas we very happily took the south side; and in
two days more we law them not,. for they, believing
we were still before them; pushed on, till they came to
the river Udda;: this is avery great river when it passes
sarther north; but when.we came to it,. we found it nar-
row and formidable.
The third day they either found their mistake,. or
had'intelligence of us> and came pouring in upon us,
towards the dusk of the evening. We had, to our great
satissaction; just pitched upon a- place for our camp
which was.very convenient for-the night :- for as we
were upon a desert, though but at the beginning of
it, that was above five hundred miles over, . we had
no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but
the city Jarawen:v which we- had yet two days* march'
to; the desert, however, had some sew woods in it or*
this fide, and little rivers* which ran all into the great
river Udda. It-was in a narrow streight between two
small, but very thick woods, that we pitched our littler
œrop-for.that.night^ expecting to be. attacked- iu the
night-.
Nobody knew bus ourselves what we were pursued
for ;- but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go>
about-in troops in that desert;. so the caravans alwayst
fortify themselves every night against them, as against.
armies of. robbers:;. and it-was therefore no new thing ta-
bs pursued.
But we-had this nights. os aH the nights os our tra-
vels, a most advantageous camp; for we lay between*
two woods, with a httle rivulet running j ait before our
front ;. so that we coukl not be surrounded or. attacked -
any way, bat in our front ot rear ;. we took care also to>
make our front as strong as we could, by. placing our
packs, with our camels and horses, allin.a line on the
inside of the river,. and we selled-some tree* in our
rear.
In this posture we encamped :for the. night; -but the-
enemy was upon us before we had finished our situa-
tion: they did not com*- on. us like thieves, as we1'

they might bum them with fire:;- and, »p»n this, they
said, they would go. away, and do us no sarther harm-,
otherwise they would: burnt us all with fire.. Our men.
looked very blank at this message, and began to stare
at one another, to see who looked with most guilt in their
saces, but, nobody was the word, nobody did it. The
leader of the caravan sent word, he was well assured
it was. not done by any of our camp; that we were
peaceable merchants travelling on our business; that we
had done no harm, to them, or to any one else; and-
therefore they must look sarther for their enemies, who
had injured them, for we were not the people; so desired
them not to dictarb.us; for is they did, we should desend
ourselves. ot •
They were far from being satisfied; with this for an
answer, and a great crowd of. them came down in the
rooming by break of day, to our.camp; b»t seeing as
in such an advantageous situation, they durst come no
sarther than the brook dst our front,/where. the3' stood,
and shewed-us such a number, as,;intfeed» leTrtfied us.

a cloud of anows.among us; but we were well enough.
fortified for that; for we <vere sheltered under our. bag*
gage; and I do not remember that one man of us was .
hurt. . • ,.,. «'
Some time after this, we saw them move a little to
our right, and expected them on the rear, when a cun.-
ning sellow, a Cossack as they call them, of Jarawena,-
in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the leader o£
the caravan, said to him, I jwi!l send all these people
Sway to Sibeilka; this was'a city four or five days
tourney, at-least, to the sooth, and rather behind us.
So he takes his bow- and arrows.;. and, getting an
horseback, he rides away from our rear directly, as
it were, back to -Nertzincttay; after this, he takes a
great- circuit about,. anct coines to the army of tha

were entirely .obS of our fight, and we never heard anjf

risons of stationary soldiers to protect the caravans, aa$
desend the country against the Tartars, who would
otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his
Czaristi majesty has given fach strict orders for the well
guarding the caravans and merchants* that if there are
any Tartars heard'of in the country, detachments of the
garrison are always sent' to see travellers sase from station
to station;
And thus the governor of Adinslcoy, whom I had an.
opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the Scots
merchant who was acquainted with ham, offered us a
guard of sifty men, if we thought there was any danger^
to the next station.
I thought long before this, that;. as we came nearer
to Europe, we should sind the co.untry better peopled^
and the people more civilized; but I found myself mil-
taken in bothi for we had yet the nation of the Tongueses-
to pals through; where we saw the same tokens of pa-
ganism and barbarity, or worse than before ;- only as
they were conquered by the Muscovites, and entirely
reduced; they were not so dangerous: but for the rude-
ness of manners, idolatry, and polytheism, no people ir»
the world ever went beyond them; They are clothed all'
in the skins of beasts, and their hoasesare built of the
fame. You know not a man from-a woman, neither
by the ruggednefs of their countenances nor their clothes
and in the winter, when the ground, is covered with.
snow, they live under ground in houses like vaults,
which have cavities or caves going from one to another.
If the Tartars had their- Cham-Chi-Thaungu for st.
whole village or country, these had idols in every hut,.
and every cave; besides, they worship the stars, the sun,
the water, the snow, and, in a word, every thing that
they do not understand,. and' they understand but very
little; so that almost evey element, e«ery.. uncommon.
thin0', set* them a sacrificing.
But 1 am no more to describe people than countries,
any sarther than my own story comes to be concerned in
them. 1 met with nothing peculiar to myself ilt-alt this-
country, which, I reckon . was, from .the desert which
I spoke of last* at least, four hundred miles, half of it
btiog
Befog another desert, whi.ch took us up'twelve days* se-
vere travelling, without house, tree, or bush; but were,
obliged again to carry our own provisions, as well water-
as bread. After we were out of this desert, and had tra-
velled two days,. we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city
or station, on the great river Janezay. This river, they*
told us, parted Europe from Asia, though our map-
makers, as I am told,.do not agree to it; however, it is.
certainly the eastern boundary of the antient Siberia,.
which now makes a province only of the vail Muscovite
empire, but is itself equal in.bignefs to the whole empire
of Germany.
And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism still.
prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons; all the
country between the river Oby, and the river. Janezay,.
is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the
Remotest of the Tartars,,nay, as any nation, for aught I
ihowi .ia Asia,. or America. i also sound, which i ob-
ferved to the Muscovite governors, whom I had oppor-
tunity to converse with, that the pagans are not much,
the wiser, or the nearer Christianity, for being under
the Muscovite government; which they acknowledged?
•was true enough, but, they said,.. it was none of their.
business; that if the Czar expected to convert- his Sibe-
rian, orTonguese, or Tartar. subjects,. it should be done
by sending clergymen among them,. not soldiers; and.-
they added, with more sincerity than! expected, that they,
sound it was not so much the concern of their monarchy
to make the people Christians, as it was to make them»
subjects.
from this river, to the great'river Oby, we. crossed a.
-wild uncultivated.country; I cannot say 'tis a barbarous
foil; 'tis only barren of people and good management
otherwise it is in itsels a most pleasant, fruitsul,. and.
agreeable country. What. inhabitants we sound in it:
are all pagans, except- such. as are sent among- them
from Russia; for this is the country I mean on both..
fides the river Oby, whither the Muscovite criminals,
that are not put to death, are banished, and from
-whence it is next to impossible they should ever. come:

• I have nothing'material to lay 'os roy particular'
affairs, till I came to ToboKki, the capital of Siberia,.
where I continued some time on the following'occa-
sion."
'-. We had been now almost seven months on mirfoumev,.
and winter began to come on ap.iee: whereupon my
partner and 1 called a council about our particular affairs,.
rh which we found it proper, considering that we were
1^ound for Kngland, and not for Moscow, to consider
low to dispose of ourselves. They told us of sledges an<l
rein-deer, to carry us over the snow in the winter-time :-
and. indeed, they have such thin. s, as it would be in-
credible to relate the particulars of, by. which means the
Ruffians travel more in the winter than they can in sum-
mer ^because in these sledges they are able to run night
and day: the snow being fiozen, is one universal cover-
ing to nature, by which the hills, the vales. the rivers*.
the lakes, are all smooth, and hard as a stone; and they
run upon the sursace, without any regard to what is-
underneath.
But I had no ocoasion to push at a winter journey of.
this kind: I was bound to England, not to Moscow,.
and my route two ways: either I must go on as the ca-
ravan went, till I came to Jarislaw, and ihen gooff west.
for Narva, and the gulph of Finland, and so either by.
lea or land to Dantzick, where I might pcffibly sell my
China cargo to good advantage, or l must leave the cara-
van at a little town on the Dwina, from whence 1 had
But fix days by water to Arch-Angel, and from thence
might be lure of shipping, either to England, Holland,

•Now to go any of these journies in the winter woulci
have been preposterous ;. for as to Dantzick, the Baltic'
would be frozen up, and h could not-get passage:':
and • to - go by land in those countries, was sar less safe
than among the Mogul Tartars': likewise to Arch-Angel,.
in October all the ships would be gone from thence, and
even the merchants, who-dwell there in summer, retire
sooth to Moscow in the winter, when the lhips are gone:
so that 1 sbonks have nothing hut extremity of cold to
encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie
there

whole, I thought it .much my better way to let the cara-

But this beirig the country where the state criminals*of/
Muscovy, as i oblerVed before, are all banished; this.
eity was sull of noblemen, princes, gentlemen, colonels,
and, in short, all degrees of the nobility, gentry, soldiery,
and courtiers of Muscovy. Here were the samous
Prince Galif ken, or Galoffken, and his son, the old
General Robollitky, and several other persons of note,-
and some ladies. - -
By mean of my Scots merchant, whom, nevertheless,
I parted with here, 1 made an acquaintance with several
of these gentlemen, and some of them of the first rank;
and from these, in the long winter-nights in which I:
staid here, 1 received several pgreeable visits. It was
talking one night wi'h a ceitain prince, one of the ba-
nished ministers of state belonging to the Czar of Mus-
covy, that rriy talk of my particular case began.
He had been telling me abundance of sine things, of
the greatness, the magnificence, and dominions, and the
absolute power of the emperors of the Ruffians. I inter-
rupted him, and told him, 1 was a greater and more
powersul prince than ever the Czar of Muscovy was,
though my dominionswere not so large, or my people
so many. . -' .
The Russian Grandee looked a little surprised, and
fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began.t& wonder what
1 meant. '-
I told him his wonder would cease when- I had ex-
plained myseif. First, 1 told him,. I had the absolute-
disposal of'the. lives and fortunes of all my subjects:
that notwithstanding my absolute-power, I had not One
person disaffected to my government or to my person, in.
all my dominions.
He shook his head at that, and said, There indeed, I.
outdid the Czar of Muscovy.
1 told him, that all the lands in my kingdom were my
own, and all my subjects were not only my tenants,
•Dut -tenants at will; that: they. would all fight for
Die to the last drop; and that never tyrant, sole
such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever so uni-
versally beloved, and yet so horribly seared,*. by. bii
subjects.
After.
Aster amusing them with these riddles in govern-
ment for a while, I opened the case, and told them
the story at large of my living in the island,.. and how
I managed both myself and the people theie that were
under me, just as 1 have since minuted it dawn. They
were exceedingly taken with the story, and especially
the prince, who told me with a sigh, that the true
greatness of lise was to be master of ourselves; that
he would not have exchanged such a state of lise as
mine, to have been Czar. of Muscovy ; and that he found
more selicity in the retirement he seemed to be banishr
ed to there, than ever he found in the highest autho-
rity he enjoyed in the court of his master the Czar: that
the height of human wisdom was to bring our tem-
pers down to our circumstances,, and. to make a cairn
within, under the weight of the greatest storm with-
out. When he came first hither, he said,. he used to
tear the hair from his head, and the clothes from his
back, as others had done before him; but a'little
time and contideration^had made him look. into him-
self, as well as round himself, to things. without
that he found the mind of man, if it was but once
brought to reflect upon the state of universal lise, and
how little this world was concerned in its true seli-
city, was persectly capable of making a selicity for
itself, sully satisfying.to itself, and suitable to its own
best ends and delires, with but very little alfillancc
from the world; that air to breathe in, food to suU
tain lise, clothes for warmth, and liberty for exer-»
cise,. in order to health, compleated, in his opinion, all
that the world could do for us: and though the great-
nets, the authority, the riches, and the pleasures,.
which some enjoyed in the world', and which he had
enjoyed his share of, had much in them that was agree-
able to us, yet he observed, that all thole things chiefly
gratisied the coarsest of our assections: such as ou,r
ambition, our particular pride, our avarice, our va-
nity, and our sensuality; all which were, indeed, the
mere product of the worst part of man, were in them-
selves crimes, and had in them the seeds of all man-
ner of crimes; but neither were related to, or'con-
cerned. with, any of those virtues that constituted u&,
adventures or robinson crusoE'.
wise men, or of those graces which distinguished :us as
Christians: that being now deprived of all the sancied
selicity, which he enjoyed in the sull exercise of all thofe
Vices, he said, he was at leisure to look upon the dark
side of them, where he found all manner of deformity;
and was now convinced, that -virtue only makes a man<
truly wile, rich, and <rreat, and preserves him in the way'
to a superior happiness in a suture state ;. and inthis,.
he said, they were more happy in their banishment than.
all their enemies were, who had the sull possession of all
the wealth and power that they (the banistud) had. left
'behind them.
Nor, Sir, said he, do I bring my mind to this politir
rally, by the necessity of my circumstances, which some
call miserable; but if I know any thing of.myself, I
would not go back, no, not tho' my master, the Czar,.
fliould call me, and offer to reinstate me in-all my former.
grandeur; 1 say, I would no more go back to it, than I
'believe my soul, when it shall be delivered from this pri-
'lbn of the body, and has had a taite.pf the glorious state
beyond Use, would come back to the goal of flesh and
blood it is now inclosed in, and leave heaven, to deal in.
'the dirt and grime os human affairs.
He spake this with Ib much warmth in his temper, so
much earnestness and enotibn of his spirits, which were
apparent in his countenance, that it was evident it was.
the true fense of his foul; and., indeed, there was no room
to doiibfchissincerity.
., 1 told him, I once thought myself a kind of a mo-
narch in my old station, of which I had given him an
account, but that .I. though he was not.a monarch only,
Vut a 'great.'.conqueror; for that he that has got a
victory over his own exorbitant desires, and has the
absolute dominion over himself, and whose reason
entirely governs his will, is certainly greater than he
''that'conquers . a cjty. But, my Lord, said I, shall I:
take theliberty to afky'ou a question? With all my
Tieart, said. he. If.the door of your liberty wasopened,.
said I, would not yqu take hold.of. it to deliyer yourself.

Hold, said he, your question is subtle, and requires
'iome serious just distinctions to give. it a 'sincere an-
swer; and I'll give it you from the bottom of my
heart. Nothing that I know of in this world would
move me to deliver myself from the state of banish-
ment, except these two: First, the enjoyment of my
relations; and secondly, A little warmer climate; but
I protest to you, that to go back to the pomp of the
court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a minister
of state; the wealth, the gaiety, and the pleasures, that
is to say, follies of a courtier; if my master should
send me -word this moment, that he restores me
.to all he banished me from: I protest, if I know
myself at all, I would not leave this wilderness, these
deserts, and these frozen lakes, for the palace of
Moscow. -
But, my Lord, said I, perhaps you not only are ba-
nished from the pleasures of the court, and from the -
.power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed be-
fore, but you may be absent too 'from some of the con-.
veniencies of lise; your estate, perhaps, consiscated,
and your estects plundered: and the supplies left you.
here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of
lise.
Ay, said he, that is as you suppose me to be a Lord,
•or a Prince, &c. So, indeed, 1 am; but you are now
to consider me only as a man, a human creature, not.
at all distinguished from another: and so l can suffer no'
want,- unless I should be visited with sickness and dis-
tempers. However, to put the question out of dispute;
you see our manner; we are in this place five persons of
rank; we live persectly retired, as suited to a state of
^banishment-; we have something rescued from the ship-
-wreck of our fortunes, which keeps us from the mere
necessity of hunting for our food, but the poor soldiers
~who are here, without that help, live in as much plenty
as we. - They go into the woods, and catch sables and.
foxes; the labour of a month will maintain them a year;

I have no room to give a sull account of the most.
agreeable conversation I had with this truly great
man; and in all which he shewed, that his mind was
To inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so sup-
ported by religion, as well as by a vast share of wis-
dom, that his 'contempt of -the world was really as
rhuch as he had expressed, and that he was always the
same to the last, as will appear in the story I am going
to tell.
I had been here eight morit'hs, and a dark dreadsul
winter I thought it to be; the cold was so intense,
that 1 could not so much as look abroad without be-
ing wrapt in surs, and a mask of sur before my sace,
or rather a hood, with only an hole for breath, and
two for sight. The little day-light we had, was, as
we reckoned, for three months, not above five hours a
day, and fix at most; only that the snow lying on the
ground continually, and the weather clear, it was
never quite dark. Our horses were kept (or rather
starved) underground; and, as for our servants (for
we hired servants here to look after our horses and
selves), we had every now and then their fingers and
toes to thaw, aud take care of, lest they should mortify
and sall off.
It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of deer*
dried and cured in the season; good bread enough, but
baked as biscuits; dried fish of several sorts, and some
flesh of mutton, and of buffaloes, which is pretty good
beef. All the store of • provision for the winter are laid
up in the summer, and well cured; our drink was water
mixed with aqua vitac, instead of brandy; and, for a
treat, mead instead of wine; which, however, they
have excellent good. The hunters, who ventured abroad
all weathers, frequently brought us in fresh venison,
very sat and good: and sometimes bears flesb, but we
did not much care for the last. We had a good stock
of tea, with which we treated our friends as above; and
in'a word, we lived Very chearsuHy and well» all things
considered.
1
It was now March, and the days grown consider-
ably longer, and the weathei; at leatt tolerable; so
other travellers began to prepare fledges to carry them
over the snow, and to get things ready to he going;
'but my measures being fixed, as I have siid, for Arch-
Angel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no
•motion, knowing very well, that the ships from the
south do not set out for that p:ut of the world till
May or June: and that if 1 was there at the beginning
of August, it would be as soon as any ships would be
-ready to go away; and therefore, 1 say, I made no
•halte to be gone, as others did? in a word, I saw a
•great many people, nay, all the travellers, go away
before me. It Feems, every year they go from thence
:to Muscow for trade, viz. to carry sur?, and buy neces-
saries with them, which they bring back to turnish
4heir shops; also others weBt on the same errand to
Arch-Angel; but then they also, being to come back
again above eight hundred milesi went out all before
me. i
In short, about thelatter end of May, I began to make
all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this, it oc-
curred to me, that seeing all these people were banished
by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet, when they
.came there, were at liberty to go whither they would;
•why did they not then go away to any part of
-the world wherever they thought fit? and I began
?to examine what should hinder them from making such
-an attempt.
But my wonder was over, when I entered upon that
subject wtth the person I have mentioned, who an-
swered me :thus: Consider, first-, Sir, said he, the
place where we are; and, secondly, the condition we
are in; especially, said he, the generality gj the people
-who are banished hither. We are surrounded, (aid he,
-with stronger things than bars and bolts; on the north
fide is an unnavi'gable ocean, where ship never sailed,
and boat never swam; neither, if we had both, could
we know whither to go with them. liverv' other . way,
aid he, we have above a thousand miles to pass through
he Czar's own dominions,, and by . wajSi utterly
m passable, 'exc pt by the roads made by. the gp^eui-
'' '" ". c merit,
ment, and through the towns garrisoned by his troops;
so that we could neither pass undiscovered try the Toad,
or subsist any other way ^ so 'that is in vain to attempt
'it.
I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they
•were in prison, every jot as secure, as if they had been
locked up in the castle of Moscow: however, it came
into my thoughts, that I mi^ht certainly be made an
•instrument to procure the escape of this excellent per-
son, and that it was very easy for me to carry him
away, there being no guard over him in the country;
and as [ was not going to Moscow, 'but to Arch-Angel,
and that I went in the nature of a caravan, by which
I was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the
desert, but could encamp every night where [ would,
•we might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-Angel,
where I could immediately secure him on board an
English or Dutch ship, and carry him osf' sase along
with me; and as to his.subsrftence, and other particu-
lars, that should be my care, till he should better supply'
-himself.
He heard me very attentveby, and looked earnestly
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his
very sace, that what I laid put his spirits into an exceed-
ing serment; his colour frequently changed, his eyes'
looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it might be
even perceived in his countenance; nor could he im-1
mediately answer me, when I had done, and, as it were,
expected what he would say to it; and after he had
paused a little, he embraced me, and said, how unhappy
are we! unguided creatures as we are, that even our
greatest acts of friendship are made snares to us, and we
are made tempters of one another! My dear friend, said
he, your offelr is so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so
disinterested in itself, and is'so calculated for my advan-.
ta»e, that I must have very little knowledge of the world,
if t did not both wonder at it, and acknowledge the
obligation, I have upon me to you for it: But did you
'believe 1 was sincere in what I have so often said to you
of my contempt of fhe woUd? Did you believe I .spoke
niy very soul to ybu, and' that I'had really maintained
that degree of'felicity hertf, that had place'd 'me above
V
1 that the world could give me, or do for me? Did
you believe I was sincere, when I told you I would not
.go back, if I was recalled even to be all that once 1 was
in the court, and with the favour of the'Czar, my mas-
ter? Did you believe me, my friend, to be an honeft
man, or did.you think me to be a boasting hypocrite?
Here he stopped, as if he would hear what 1 would fay;
but, indeed, I soon after perceived, that lieftopped be-
cause his spirits were in motion; his'heart was full of
struggles, and he could not go on. 1 *ras, I consess,
astonished at the thing, as well as at the man, and I
used some arguments with him'to Urge him to set himself
free: that he ought to look upon this as a door opened
Ijy Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by Pro-
vidence, who has the care and good disposition of all
events, to do himself good, and to render himself usesul
in the world.
He had by this time recovered himself: How do you
'know, Sir, said he, warmly, but that instead of a sum-
• mons from heaven, it may be a seint of another in-
strument, representing, in all the alluring colours, to
me, the shew of selicity as a deliverance, which may in
itself be my snare, and tend directly to my ruin? Here
I am free from the temptation of returning to my former
miserable greatness; there I am not sure, but that
all the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury,
which I know remain in my nature, may revive and
take root, and, in a word, again overwhelm me; and
then the happy .prisoner, whom you see now master
of his soul's liberty, shall be the miserable slave of his
own senses, in the sull of all personal liberty. Dear
Sir, let me remain in this blessed consinement, banished
Trom the crimes of lise, rather than purchase a shew of
sreedom at the expence of the liberty of my reason, and
at the expence of the suture happiness which now I
.have in my view, but shall then, I sear, quickly lose sight
of; for 1 am but 'flesh, a man, a mere man, have passions
and affections as likely to possess and overthrow me as
any man: © be not my friend and my tempter both
together!
VOL, II,
If I was surprised before, I was quite^dumb now, and
stood.silent, looking at him; and, indeed admired what
I saw; the struggle in his foul was so great, that though
the weather was extremely cold, it put him into~a most
violent sweat, and I found he wanted to give vent to his
mind; so I said a word or two, that I would leave him
to consider of it, and wait oh him again ; and then I with-
drew to my own apartment.
About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near
the door of the room, and I was going to open the door;
but he had opened it, and come in: My dear friend,
-said he, you had almost overset me, but 1 am recovered:
do not take it ill that l do not close with your ofser; I
assure you, it is not for want of a fense of the kindness
of it in you; and I come to make the most sincere ac-
knowledgment of it t'p you; but, I hope, I have got the
victory over myself.
My Lord, said I, I hope you are sully satisfied, that
you did not resist the call of heaven. Sir, said he, if
it had been from heaven, the same power would have
influenced me to accept it; but I hope, and am sully
satisfied, that it is from heaven that I decline it; and
J have an insinite satissaction in the parting, that you
shall leave me an honest m£m still, though not a free
man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make pro-
fession to him' of my having no end in it, but a sincere
desire to serve him. He embraced me very passion-
ately, and assured me, he was sensible of that, and
should always acknowledge it; and with that he offered
me a very fine present of sables, too much, indeed, for
me to accept from a man in his circumstances; and I
would have avoided them, but he would not be
resused. -
The next morning I sent my servant to his Lordship,
-with a small present of tea, two pieces of Qhina da-
mask, .and four 'little wedges of Japan gold, which did
not all weigh above six ounces, <^r thereabouts; but
-were sar short of the value of his sables, which, in-
deed, when 1 came to England, I found worth near two
hundred pounds, He accepted the tea, and one piece
4 of
of the damask, and one of the pieces of gold, which had
a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan coinage, which I
found he took for the rarity of it, but would not take any
more; and sent word by my servant, that he desired to
speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what had ,
passed between us, and hoped I would not move him any
more in that affair; but that, since I made such a gene-
rous offer to him, he asked me, if I had kindness enough
to offer the same to another person that he would name
to me, in whom he had a great share of concern. 1 told
him, that I could not say 1 inclined to do much for any
one but himself, for whom I had a particular value, and
should have been glad to have been the instrument of his
deliverance; however, if he would please to name the
person to me, I would give him my answer, and hoped
he would not be displeased with me, if he was with my
answer. He told me* rt was only his son, who, though
I had not seen, yet was in the same condition with him-
self, and ab6ve two hundied miles from him, on the
either side the Oby; but that, if I consented, he would
send for him. •
I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it: I
made some ceremony in letting him understand, that it
was wholly on his account; and that seeing I could not
prevail on him, I Would-shew rt>y respect to him, by my
concern for his son: but these things are too tedious to
repeat here. He sent away the next day for his son, and
in about twenty days he came back with the messenger,
bringing six or seven horses loaded with very rich surs,
and which, in the whole, amounted to a very great
value.
His servants brought the horses into the town, but
left the young Lord at a distance till night, when he
came -incognito into our apartment, and his sather pre-
sented him to me; and, in short, we concerted there the
manner of our.travelling, and every thing proper for th^-
journey.
1 had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black
fox-skins, fine ermines, and such other surs that are
very rich; I say, i. had bought them in that city for
M 2 exchange
exchange for some of the goods brought from China; !h
particular, for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I fold
the greatest part here; and the rest afterwards at Arch-
angel, for a much better- prioe than I- could have done at
London; and my partner, who was sensible of the profit,
and whose business more particularly than mine, was mer-
chandize, was mightily pleased with our stay, on account
of the traffic we made here.
It was in the beginning of June, when I left this re-
mote place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the
world; and, indeed, it islo sar out of the road of com-
merce. that I know not how it should be much talked
of. We were now cr.me to a very small caravan, be-
ing only thirty-two horses and camels in all, and all of
them passed for mine, though my new guest was pro-
prietor of eleven of them. It was most natural also, that
I mould take more servants with me than I had before,
apd the young Lord passed for my steward; what great
man I passed for myself I know not, neither did it con-
cern me to enquire. We had here the worst and the
largest desert to pass over that we met with in all the
journey, indeed, 1 call it the worst, because the way-
was very deep in some places, arid very' uneven in
others'; the best we had.to say for it, was, that we
thought we had no troops of Tartars and robbers to
sear, and that they never came on this side the river
Oby, or at. least but very seldom; but we sound it
otherwise..
My young Lord had with him a saithful Muscovite
fervant, or rather a Siberian servant* who was per-
sectly acquainted with the country; and who led us
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities upon the great road, such as
l'umen, Soloy.-Kamofkoy, and.. several others; because
the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there are very
curious and strict in their observations upon travellers,
a.nd searching lest any of the banished persons of note
should make their escape that way into Muscovy; but
by this means, as we were kept out of the cities, so
our whole journey was a desert, and we weie obliged
to encamp and lie in bur tents, when we might have
ha,d gopd accommodation in the cities on the way:
this she young Lord was so sensible of, that he would
not allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several cities
on the way; but lay abroad himself, with his servant*
in the wdods, and met us always at the appointed
places. '/
We were just entered Europe, having passed the river
Kama, which, in those parts, is the boundary between
Europe and Asia; and the first city on the European sidfc
•was called Soloy-Kamoskoy, which is as much as to say,
the great city on the river Kama; and here we though,!
to have seen some evident alteration in the people, their
manners, their habit, their religion, and their business.;
but we were*mistaken; for as we had a vast desert tp
pass, which, by. relation, is near seven Hundred miles
long in some places, but not above two hundred miles
over where we passed it; so, till we came past that
Horrible place, we found very little difference between,
that country and the Mogul Tartary; the people moli1y
Pagans, and little better that*-tbe savages of America;
their houses and towns sull of idols, and their way
of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities as
iabove, and the villages near them; where they are
Christians, as they call themselves of the Greek church j
but even these have their religion mingled witb
so many reliques of superstition, that it is scarce to
be known in some places foF mere sorcery and witch-
craft.
In pasting this forest, I thought, indeed, we must,
(aster all our dangers were, in'our imagination, el'eaped,
as before, have been plundered and robbed, and per-
haps murdered by a troop of thieves; of what country
they were, whether the roving bands of the Ostiachi,
a kind of Tartars, or wild people on- the banks of
the Oby, Had ranged thus sar; or whether they weiie

but they were all on horseback, carried bows and arrows,
and were at sirst about five and forty in number ;. _they
came so near to us, as within about two mul'qwef shot;
'and, asking no questions, they surrounded us with their
horse, and looked very earnestly upon us twice f dt
length they placed themselves just in ouf way:;' upon
which we drew up in a little line before our camels
*" ' '-• V' 'US'' ' being
being not above sixteen men in all; and being drawn i
up thus. we halted, and sent out the Siberian servants
-whp attended his Lord j to see who they were; his
matter was-the more willing to let him go, because he
was not-a little apprehensive that they were a Siberian
troop sent out after him. The man came up near them
with a flag of truce, and called to them; but though
he spoke several of their languages, or dialects of lan-
guages rather, he could not- understand a . word they
said; however, after some ligiis to hwn not to come
«earcr to them at his peril; so he said he understood
them to mean, ofsering to shoot at him if headvanced;
the sellow came back- no wiser than hewent j only that
-by their dres«r. he said, be believed them-to be some
Tartars of Kalmuek, or of the Circassian hords; and
that there mult be more of them on the great desert, tho-'
'he never heard that ever any of. them were seen so sar
north before.
. This was small comfort-to us; however, we had no
remedy: there was on our left hand, at about a quarter
of a mile's distance, a little grove or clump of trees,
which stood close together* and very near the road ; - I
immediately resolved we would advance to those trees,
iand fortify ourselves as welt as we could there; for,
-first, I considered that the trees would in .a great mea.-
•fure cover -us from their arrows; and, in the next place,
they could not come to charge us in a body: it was^
indeed,' my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it: and
who had this excellency.attending him, namely, that he
was always readiest arid most apt to dkectand encourage
us in cases of the. most danger. We advanced imme-
diately with what speed we could, and gained that little
wood, the Tarlars or thieves, for we knew not what to
call them, keeping their stand, and not attempting to
binder us. When- we.came thither, we found, to our
.great- satissaction that it was a swampy .springy piece
of ground', and, on- the other side, a very .great spring
.of { water,. which, running out i% a little rill or
brook, . was, a littlesarther, joined by another of the
.'like bigness: ami was,-. in (hqrt, the head or source of
fa considerable river, . called afterwards the Wirtska.;
tht trees whish grew about this spr.ing> were not in all
above two hundred, but were very large, and stood pretty
thick; so that as soon as we got in, we saw ourselves per-
sectly sase from the enemy, unless they alighted and
attacked us on foot.
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese^ with
indesatigable application, cut down great arms of the
trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite off, fromv
one tree to another; so that he made a- coatinued sence
almost round us. <
We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours, without perceiving they made any offer to
stir; when about two-hours before night, they cam*
down directly. upon us; and, though we had not per-
ceived it, we found they. had been joined by some more.
of the same, so that they were n.ear fourscore horse*
-whereof, however, we sancied some were women.—-
They came on till they were within half a shot of out.
little wood, when we fired one musquet without ball*
and called to them.in the Russian tongue^ to know what
they wanted, and bid them keep- off; but, as if they,
knew nothing of what we said, they came on with a
double sury directly up to the wood side, not'imagining.
-we were so barricadoed that they could not break in;
our old pilot was our ctiptain, as welKas he had beer»
our engineer; and desired of us, not to sire upon them,
till they came within.pistol-shot,- that we might be sure
to kill; and that when wedid fire we should be sura
to take good aim. . We bade him) give the word of
command; which he delayed so long, that they were,
some of them, within.two pikes length of us.when we
fired.
We aimed so true (or Providence directed our shot so,
sure) that-we killed fourteen of- them at the first volley,
and wounded several others, as also several of th-ir horses;-.
for we had all of us loaded our pieces-with twt or three-
bullets a piece at least.
They were terribly surprised withour-firei and retreated
immediately about 100 rods from us; in which time we
loaded our pieces again, and, seeing them keep that.
distance, we. sallied out, and caught four or five o£L

day. About two hours before night we set out again,
and travelled till eight the next morning, though- rlqt
quite so hastily as before; and about seven o'clock w*e
passed a little river, called Kirtxa, and came to a good
large town inhabited by Rusfians, and very populous,
called Ozemys; there we heard, that several troops or
hords of Calmucks had been abroad upon the desert, but
that we were now completely out of danger of them,
which was to our great satissaction, you . may be sure.
Here we were obliged to get some fresh Rorses, and, hav-
ing need enough of rest, we itakl five days; and mjr't
partner 'and 1 agreed to give the honest Siberian, who
brought us thither, the value of ten pistoles for his con-
ducting us. 'V *
In five days more we came to Venffima, upon she?-
river Wirzogda, which running into the river Dwinar
we were there very happily near the end of our travels by -'.*
land, that rivet being navigable in {even days passagfe to
Archangel: from hence we came to Law*enskby, where
the river joins, the third of July: and wejjtavlded pus— •.'.
selves with two luggage-boats, and a barge, forbur cort- ..'
yenience: we embarked the seventh, and arrived all safe
at Archangel the eighteenth, having been a year, five
months, and three days, on the journey, including our
stay of eight months and odd days at Tobolski.
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for ther*.
arrival of the (hips, and must have tarried longer, had
not a Hamburgher come in above a month sooner than
any of the English ships: when, after some consideration,
'that the city of Hamburgh might happen to be as good a
market for our goods as London, we all took freight with-
.him: and having put our goods on board, it was rpost-
..natural for me to put my steward on board to take care of
them: by which means. my young Lord had a susficient
oppoitunity to conceal himlelf, never coming on shore
again, in all the time we staid there; and this he did,
that he might not be seen in the city, where. some of the
Moscow merchants would certainly have seen and dis-
covered him. . '•
We sailed from-Archangel the twentieth of August, the
feme year; and, aster no extraordinary bad voyage, ar-
rived in the Llbe, the 13th of September : here my partner
and
and I found a very good sale for our goods, as well those
of China, as the sables, &c. of Siberia; and dividing the
produce of our'effects, my share amounted to 34751. 17s.
3d. notwithstanding so many losses we had sustained, and
charges we had been at: only remembering that I had
included, in this, about 6001. worth of diamonds, which
I had purchased at Bengal.
Here the young Lord took liis leave of us, and went
up the Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna, where
he resolved to seek protection, and where he could corre-
spond with those of his sather's friends who were left alive
He did not part without all the testimonies he could give
of gratitude for the service I had done him, and his sense
of my kindness to the prince his sather.
To conclude, having staid near four months in Ham-
burgh, 1 came from thence, over land to the Hague,
-where I embarked in the packet, and arrived in London
the 10th of January, 1705, having been gone from Eng-
land ten years and nine months.
And here, resolving to harrafe myself no more, I am
preparing for a longer journey than all these, having lived
72 yearfc a lise of infinite variety, and learned susficiently
to know the value of retirement, and the blessing of
ending our days in peace.
