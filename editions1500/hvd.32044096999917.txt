PEEFACE.
THE importance, and the practical benefit to be derived from the
study of Intellectual Arithmetic, not only as a preparation for busi-
ness life, but as a means of developing and strengthening the
thinking and reasoning powers, and of thorough mental culture,
can not be over-estimated. Not only is it a necessary study for
young pupils, but indispensable to the more advanced student, as
a preparation for the prompt and accurate business man. And it
is believed that, as a general rule, the most critical, correct, and
ready students of mathematics are those who have been most
thoroughly drilled in intellectual arithmetic.
This work has been prepared more especially for advanced classes,
and is designed for those who have first been well taught in the
primary book, and for such as are pursuing the study of written
arithmetic, or algebra, and who have never been thoroughly exer-
cised in this branch of study.
Only a few of the many points of difference between this and
other similar works, and which, it is believed, renders this superior
to them, will be referred to.
It is more complete, comprehensive, and progressive in its char-
acter. The arrangement and classification are more strictly sys-
tematic, and in accordance with the natural order of mathematical
science. The development of principles, and their applications,
are shown by a more numerous selection, and greater variety of
appropriate examples, progressively arranged, commencing with
those that are simple and easy, and advancing to those more com-
plex and difficult.
At intervals, and especially in the closing sections of each chap-
ter, examples are given containing such a combination of principles,
and forms of analysis, as to require a knowledge of almost every
principle previously taught, thus affording the pupil a thorough
review, as well as requiring him to classify his knowledge of what
he has been over.
One of the most important, and, it is thought, one of the most
original and useful features of this work, is the full, concise, and
uniform system of ANALYSIS it contains, — the result of long expe-
rience in the school-room.
Particular attention is invited to the subjects of Fractions, Per*
centage, and Interest; their treatment is peculiar, and adapted to
obviate many of the difficulties, and greatly abbreviate most of the
operations in them.
The chapter of Miscellaneous Examples -will afford a valuable
and thorough drill to the advanced student of arithmetic or alge-
bra. They contain a great variety of principles, and while they
may be considered difficult, yet the full analysis given of every
principle, and the selection of numbers so adapted to the conditions
of the question as to produce results free from large and difficult
fractions, will render a mental solution of them comparatively easy.
In conclusion, we may be allowed to express the belief, tliat
in this work the thorough- teacher will find a desideratum long
sought in this department of science,—the means of mental dis-
cipline and development such as has been furnished by no
similar treatise.
THE AUTHOR.
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
Pupils of nearly the same degree of advancement should be
classed together. Regular exercises should be assigned to the
class, and sufficient time allowed them to thoroughly examine
their lesson before being called upon to recite.
The use of the book at the time of recitation should be strictly
prohibited, except, perhaps, in some of the more difficult lessons
in the latter part of the work.
Each example should be read but once, slowly and distinctly,
the pupils called upon promiscuously, who should arise, stand
erect, repeat the example, and then give the analysis. This will
secure close attention.
Every question should be clearly and thoroughly analyzed, and
the pupil required to adhere strictly to the forms of solution given,
unless better ones can be substituted; and in no case should he
be allowed to omit the conclusion, commencing with " Therefore."
The class should be encouraged to detect and correct errors in
statement or analysis, to criticise and make propar inquiries, all
of which should be signaled by the uplifted hand.
It is suggested that the class be occasionally exercised upon
"Ringing the Changes," as explained in the Appendix, and which
may be applied to a great number and variety of examples. It
will not only afford a valuable drill, but a pleasant and enlivening
exercise.

G. Addition is the process of uniting several numbers
of the same kind into one equivalent number. The result
is called the Sam or Amount. The sign of addition is
written thus, +, and is called plus. When placed between
two numbers or quantities, it shows that they are to be
added together. Thus, 5 + 3 + 2 signifies that 5 and 3
and 2 are to be added together, and is read jive, plus three,
plus two.
The sign of equality is written thus, =. When placed
between two numbers or quantities, it signifies that the
latter is equal to the former.
1. 6+4+5 are how many?
2. 9 + 7 + 3 are how many?
3. 10 + 6 + 4 are how many?
4. 13 _[- 8 + 6 are how many?

6. 11 + 6 + 7 are how many?
7. 8 + 10 + 7 + 6 are how many?
8. 34 + 25 are how many?
ANALYSIS. As many as the sum of 34 and 25; 34
is composed of 3 tens and 4 units, and 25 of 2 tens and 5
units; 3 tens and 2 tens are 5 tens, or 50, and 4 units
and 5 units are 9 units, which added to 50 makes 50.
Therefore 34 + 25 are 59.

* When it ia necessary to express a quantity less than a unit, we may
regard the unit as divided into borne number of equal parts, and use
one of these parts as a new unit of less value Hum the unit divided.
Thus, if a yard be divided into two equal parts, each of the parts ia
called one lioJJ; when iuto time equal parts, each of the parts is called
one third; wneu iuto ftmr equal parts, each of the parts is called on*
fourth; when iutojive equal parts, each of the parts is culled one-Jtfzh;
two of the parts, twoJift/ui. &c.j when into sic equal parts, each of the
parts is called one sixtft; two pt JUe parts, two stxths, three of the parts,
three sixths, etc.

denominator.
ANALYSIS. 12 is exactly divisible by 4 and 3, and may
therefore be taken for a common denominator. Since in 1
there are -j-f, in £ of 1 there must be £ of -}-f, or -fa, and in
f of 1 there must be % of -Jf, or fa. Therefore £ and $
are equal to -fa and -fa.

76. CHAPTER VILL
PERCENTAGE.
THE terms, percentage and per cent., signify by the hun-
dred, or hundredths, that is, a certain number of parts of each
one hundred parts, of whatever denomination. Thus, by 5
per cent. is meant 5 cents of every 100 cents, $5 of every
$100, 5 bushels of every 100 bushels, &c. Therefore, 5
per cent. equals 5 hundredths, (-rtfoO or -fa. 8 per cent., 8
hundredths, (T§&,) or -f^ of the given number or quantity.
1. A man, having $40, lost 3 per cent. of it; how

can an agent buy for $1230, and retain 2| per cent.
commission for his trouble?
5. A farmer employed a man to thresh his wheat,
agreeing to give him 12 per cent. of all he threshed;
how many bushels must he thresh that the farmer
may retain 6t> bushels?
ANALYSIS. Since the thresher received ^j, or ^ of all
he threshed, the farmer received the difference between -}-$$,
or f | and ?\, which is ff. Then 66 bushels is ff of the
whole number of bushels threshed; since 66 bushels is \f,
jL is 2*2 of 66, or 3 bushels, and $% is 25 times 3 bushels,
or 75 bushels. Therefore, fyc.

86. INTEREST is a sum paid for the use of borrowed
money, or on demands after they become due.
The PRINCIPAL is the money lent, or the sum for which
interest is paid.
The AMOUNT is the sum of the principal and interest.
The RATE PER CENT. is the sum paid for the use of
$100 or 100 cents for one year. Thus, if $6 be paid for
the use of $100 one year, the rate is 6 per cent. per
annum. ,
The interest on any sum for one year is always a certain
number of hundredths of the principal. Thus, the interest
of any sum for one year, at 5 per cent., is 5 hundredths
(TJJ^) or & °f tne principal; at 8 per cent. it is 8 hun-
dredths (-rjj-Q-) or -£% of the principal.
Practically, 30 days are considered a month, and 12
months a year, in computing interest. When no time is
named, one year is always understood.
The rate of interest is established by law; and taking
more than such rates is termed usury.
1. What is the yearly interest of $80, at 5 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. Since the interest is 5 per cent., or Tfor, equal
to ?\f of the principal, the interest of $80 is ^ of $80,
or $4. Therefore, fyc.
Or thus: Since the interest of $1, or 100 cents, is 5 cents
for one year, the interest of $80 u 80 times 5 cents, or 400
cents, equal to $4.•

87. 1. What is the interest of $150 for 3 years,
at 8 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 1 year at 8 per cent.
is .j^, equal to ^ of the principal, for 3 years it is 3
times £5, or fg, of the principal. ^ of $150 is $6, and
& of $150 is 6 times $6, or $36. Therefore, .Sfc.
Or thus: Since the interest of $150 for 1 year at 8 per
cent. is $12, (86,) for 3 years it is 3 times $12, or $36.

interest due, at 8 per cent.?
88. 1. At 8 per cent., what part of $1 equals
the use of it for 3 years 9 months?
ANALYSIS. Since there are 12 months in 1 year, 9
months is -^, or £ of 1 year, and 3 years 9 months are equal
to 3J. or <jk years. Since the interest of $1 for 1 year at
8 per cent. is jg^, equal to ^ of the principal. for 3 years
9 months, it is 3J times, or -i£, of ^, equal to ^ of the
principal, or $T%. Therefore, fyc.

part of the principal equals the interest?
12. At 8 per cent., for 3 years 3 months and 18
days, what part of the principal equals the interest?
ANALYSIS. Since 30 days make a month, 18 days are
-Jo-, or f of a month; and since 12 months make a year,
1 month is TV of a year; ^ of 1 month is ^ of T^-,
or jV of 1 year, and 3f months, equal to -^-, ^s 18 times ^,
or ^ of a year. Hence the interest of $1 for 3-fo, or J§
years, at 8 per cent., is *£%-§ of it. (8Sj Ex. 1.) There-

days, what part of the principal will equal the in-
terest?
89. 1. What is the interest of $40 for 3 years
4 months, at 6 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. 3 years 4 months equals 3^, or if- years;
and the interest of any sum for -y1 years, at 6 per cent.,
equals % of it. (88.) | of $40 is $8, the required in-
terest. Therefore, fyc.
Or thus: Since the interest of $1 for 1 year, at 6 per
cent., is 6 cents, for $40 it is 40 times 6 cents, or $2.40, and
for 3£ years it is 3 J times $2.40, equal to $8.

6 per cent.?
11. What is the interest of $50 for 5 years 7
months and 15 days, at 8 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. The interest of any mm for 5 years 7 months

and 24 days, at 6 per cent.?
9O. 1. What will be the amount of $60 for 2
years 6 months, at 6 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. Since the interest is equal to -fa of the prin-
cipal, (88,) and the amount is equal to the principal and
interest, it follows that |g, the principal, added to ^, the
interest, equals f$, the amount. -fa of $60 is $3, and $ $
of $60 is 23 times $3, or $69, the amount. Therefore, fyc.

2. What principal, in 1 year 8 months, at 9 per
cent., will give $36 interest?
3. What principal in 11 months, at 6 per cent.,
will give $22 interest?
4. What principal in 7 months 15 days, at 8 per
cent., will give $40 interest?
5. A remits a store to B for the yearly rent of $300,
which is 12 per cent. of its cost; what did it cost?
6. A gentleman bought 6 horses, for which he paid
a sum of money which in 2 years 6 months, at 4 per
cent., would have given him $90 interest; what did
he pay apiece for the horses?
7. A person deposits f of his money in the bank,
which brings him an annual income of $1500, at 10
per cent.; the remaining -| he invests in business
which yields him 20 per cent. profit; what are his
entire capital and his yearly income?
8. Two persons engaged in trade; A furnished 4
of the capital, and B \; at the end of 3 years and 4
months they found that they had made a clear profit
of $5000, which is 12J per cent. per annum on the
money invested; how much capital did each furnish?
9. A capitalist invested | of his money in railroad
stock, which depreciated 5 per cent. in value; the
remaining | he invested in bank stock, which at the
end of 1 year had gained $1200, which was 12 per
cent. of the investment; what was the whole amount
of his capital, and what was his entire loss or gain?
93. 1. What principal will, in 3 years 4 months,
at 5 per cent, amount to $700.
ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months, at 5
per cent., is fa of the principal, (88,) the principal |, added
to the interest fa, equals the amount fa; hence $700 is fa of
the principal. Since $700 is fa, fa is + of $700, or $100,
'and $100 is fa of 6 times $100, or $600. Therefore, fyc.
2. What principal in 5 years, at 6 per cent., will
amount to $1300?
3. What principal in 1 year 6 months, at 8 per
cent., will amount to $280?
4. What principal in 4 years 2 months, at 3 per
cent., will amount to $630?
5. What principal in 10 years, at T per cent., will
amount to $340?
6. What principal in 9 months, at 10 per cent.,
will amount to $172?
7. What principal in 18 months, at 4 per cent.,
will amount to $530?
8. The amount due on a bond and mortgage is
$2900, it having been on interest 7 years 6 months,

9. Two men bought 200 acres of land, and at the
end of 2 years sold it for $1500, which was an ad-
vance of 12^ per cent. per annum on its cost; what
did it cost an acre?
10. A man invested | of all he was worth in the
lumber trade, stnd. at the end of 2 years 8 months
sold out his entire interest for $3100, which was a
yearly gain of 9 per cent. on the money invested ; how
much was he worth when he commenced trade?
11. A's money is to B's as 2 to 3; if £ of A's
money be put at interest for 3 years 9 months, at
10 per cent., it will amount to $550; how much
money has each?
93. 1. In what time, at 5 per cent., will $60
gain $15 interest?
ANALYSIS. The gain, or interest, is -Jg, or ^ of the prin+
cipal, equal to 25 per cent. of the principal. (77, Ex. 7.)
Jf a given principal gain 5 per cent. in 1 year, it will re-
quire as many years io gain 25 per cent. as 5 per cent. is
contained times in 25 per cent., or 5 years. Therefore, fyc.
Or thus: Since $60 in 1 year, at 5 per cent., will gain
$3 interest, it will require as many years for $60 to gain
$15 interest, as $3 is contained times in $15, which is 5
times.
2. How long will it take $120 to gain |24 interest,
at 6 per cent.?
3. In what*time will $500 gain $35, at 7 per
cent.?
4. In what time will $120 gain $40, at 10 pet
cent.?
5. In what time will $80 gain $6, at 3 per cent.?
6. In what time will $300 gain $84, at 7 per
cent.?
7. In what time will $160 gain $20, at 6J per
cent.?
8. In what time will $49 gain $12.25, at 5 per
cent.?
9. In what time will any given principal double
itself at 4 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. Since, to douUe itself, any sum of money
must gain 100 per cent., at 1 per cent., it will require 100
years, at 4 per cent., % of 100 years, or 25 years. There-
fore, $c.
10. In what time will a given principal double it-
self at 5 per cent.?
11. In what time will a given principal double it-
self at 7 per cent.?
12. In what time will a given principal double it-
self at 6 per cent.?
13. In what time will a given principal double it-
self at 10 per cent.?
14. In what time will $500 double itself, at 12£
per cent.?
15. In what time will $175 double itself at 20 per
cent.?
16. In what time will a given principal treble it-
self at 5 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. A given principal will treble itself at 1 per
cent. in 200 years; at 5 per cent. in ^ of 200 years, or 40
years.
17. In what time will $100 treble itself at 6 per
cent.? at 7 per cent.? at 8 per cent.? at 10 per
cent.?
94. 1. A man loaned $75 for 4 years, and re-
ceived $18 interest; what was the rate per cent.?
ANALYSIS. Since the gain, or interest, for 4 years, is
ff, or £s of tne principal, for 1 year it is % of ^, or ifa
of the principal, equal to 6 per cent. Therefore, fyc.
Or, thus: At 1 per cent., the interest of $1 for 4 years is
4 cents, and of $75 it is 75 times 4 cents, which are 300
cents, equal to $3. Since $3 interest is 1 per cent. of $75
for 4 years, $18 interest is as many per cent. as $3 is
contained times in $18, which is 6 times, equal to 6 pel-
cent.
2. At what per cent. will $200 gain $49 interest
in 3|- years?
3. At what per cent. will $60 gain $25 interest in
4£ years?
4. At what per cent. will $90 gain $27 in 6
years?
5. At what per cent. will $12 gain $5 in l(y
years?
6. At what per cent. will $400 gain $55 interest
in 2£ years?
7. At what per cent. will $150 gain $44 interest
in 3f years?
8. At what per cent. will $125 gain $37.50 interest
in 5 years?
9. At what per cent. will $800 gain $75 interest
in 1 year and 3 months?
10. At what per cent. will $180 gain $45 interest
in 3 years and 9 months?
11. At what per cent. will $1250 gain $312.50
interest in 2 years 6 months?
12. At what per cent. will $2500 gain $200 in-
terest in 1 year and 4 months?
13. At what per cent. will a given principal double
itself in 5 years?
ANALYSIS. Since a given principal must gain 100 per
cent. to double itself in 1 year, to double itself in 5 years will
require % of 100 per cent., or 20 per cent. Therefore, fyc.
14. At what per cent. will a given principal double
itself in 10 years?
15. At what per cent. will a given principal double
itself in 12 years 6 months?
16. At what per cent. will $200 double itself in 4
years?
17. At what per cent. will $100 double itself in 8
years?
18. At what per cent. will $150 double itself in
15 years?
19. At what per cent. will $500 double itself in
16 years 8 months?
20. At what per cent. will $175 double itself in
2 years 6 months?
95. The present worth of a note payable at a future
time is such a sum as, put at interest at the given rate per
cent. until it becomes due, will amount to the face of the
note.
Discount is an allowance made for the payment of money
before it becomes due, and is obtained by subtracting the
present worth from the given sum or face of the note. --
1. What is the present worth of $180 payable In
3 years 4 mouths at 6 per cent.?
ANALYSIS. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months at
6 per cent. is \ of the principal, (88,) the amount, $180,
is equal to the principal, £, added to the interest, £, equal to
§ of the principal. Since $180 is f of the principal, £ of
$180, or $30, is 1, and $30 is % of 5 times $30, or $150.
Therefore, fyc.
NOTE. The discount is the difference between $180 and $150, which

of E's; how many dollars has each?
ANALYSIS. Since % of A's money equals % of J3"s, 2
halves, or all of A's, will equal 2 times $, or § of S"s; then
A has 6, and B 5 equal parts of the money, and both hai t
11 parts; ^ of $55 is $5. or 1 part; 6 times $5 are $30,
or A's share ; and 5 times $5 are $25, or I?s share. There-
fore, Sfc.

1O1. 1. Benjamin, meeting some beggars, gave
each of them 5 cents; had he given them 7 cents
apiece, it would have taken 8 cents more; how many
beggars were there?
ANALYSIS. Since 2 cents was the increase paid to 1
beggar, and 8 cents the increase paid to all, there were as
many beggars as 2 is contained times in 8, which is 4 times.
Therefore, fyc.
2. Edward gave 6 plums to each of his playmates,
and had 9 remaining; had he given each of them 8,

had he?
3. Three times a certain number is 15 less than 6
times the same number? what is the number?
4. Susan, purchasing calico, found that if she
took that at 8 cents a yard she would have 11 cents

the same number; what is the number?
8. If 24 chestnuts be divided among some boys,
giving 4 apiece to J of them, and 2 apiece to the
others, how many boys are there?
ANALYSIS. Since one boy received 4 chestnuts as often
as another received 2 chestnuts, 2 boys received 6 chestnuts;
there were as many times 2 boys as 6 is contained times
in 24, which is 4 tunes, and 4 times 2 boys are 8 boys.
Therefore, Sfc.
9. Mary gave her chickens 26 grains of corn; £
of them had 5 grains each, the others but 3 each;
how many chickens had she?
NOTE. The above gives the following question: —
10. 5 times | of a certain number, plus 3 times J
of the same number, is 26; what is the number?
11. A class received 29 merit marks; -J- of them
received 5 apiece, £ of the remainder 3 apiece, $ of
the remainder 2 apiece, and the rest 1 apiece; how
many scholars in the class?
12. 26 melons were stolen, ^ of the party getting
4 each, the rest 3 apiece, except 2, who obtained but
2 apiece; how many were there in the party?
ANALYSIS. Had the last 2 obtained 3 each, there would
have been 28 melons; then 4 times £ of a number, plus 3
times £ of the same number, or £, would equal 28. Since
28 is $ of a number, | of 28, or 4, is %, and 4 is £ of 2
limes 4, or 8. Therefore, Sfc. •
13. 4 times \ of a number, plus 3£ times the
same number, is equal to 28 plus 5; what is the
number?
14. Henry said that 4 years more than \ of his

times \ of his ago less 4, would make the sum 50
years; how old was ho?
15. A drover paid $5 a head for ^ of his flock, $4
a head for as many more, f 3 a head for £ of the
remainder, and &2 a head for the rest; the Hock cost
$115; how many sheep had he?
16. A grocer received $10 for a lot of baskets;
for J of them he had 6 dimes each, for -| of the re-
mainder plus 3, 4 dimes each, for £ of the rest plus
2, 3 dimes each, and for the rest 2 dimes each; how
many baskets did he sell?
17. 5 times Henry's age is 3 more than 4 times f
of it increased by 6 times £ of it; how old is he?
ANALYSIS. 5 times Henry's age equals *£, 4 times § of
it, plus G times ^ of it, equals J£, and -ty less -^ equals £
of it, which, according to the conditions of the question, is
8; and 3 is % of 3 times 3, or 9. Therefore, fyc.
18. 6 times a number is 4 less than 7 times | of
it, plus 5 times £ of the same number; what is the
number?
19. Bridget, wishing to get a certain number of
pounds of moat, found, if she took beef at 5 cents,
she would have 4 cents left; if pork at 7 cents, she
had not money enough to pay for it; and therefore
she took -| of the quantity in beef, the rest in pork,
and paid for it; how many pounds did she get?
20. Four times a number is 6 greater than 5 times
-£ of the same number; what is the number?
21. A farmer, wishing to buy a flock of sheep,
found, if he paid $2 a head, he would have $60 left j
if he paid $3 a head, he had not enough to pay for
them; if he took £ the number at each price, he
could just pay for them; how many sheep would
his money buy?
22. Twice | of a number equals the number plus
8; what is the number?
IO2. 1. The sum of two numbers is 27 ;- their
difference 5; what are the numbers?
ANALYSIS. Since 27 t* the sum of two numbers whose
difference is 5, 27 less a, or 22, would be twice the less num-
ber; % of '22 is 11, the less number, which increased by 5
equals 1C, or the greater number. Therefore, fyc.
2. James and John together have 19 peaches;

years ago, A's age was £ of B's; what are their ages
now?
12. A horse and cow cost $124; the horse cost
§4 more than 8 times the cost of the cow; what was
the cost of each?
13. A farmer paid $24 for a colt and cow; £ the
cost of the colt, multiplied by ^ the cost of the cow,
equaled the cost of the cow; what did he pay for
each?
14. A lady purchased a dish and cover for 24
dimes; £ of the cost- of the dish, increased by the
difference between the cost of the dish and cover,
equals the cost of the cover; what was the cost of
each?
15. A grocer purchased 25 pounds of butter of
two 'women; | of the number of pounds he took of
one, increased by the difference between the amounts
purchased of both, equals the number of pounds he

ference between the expense of the two; what was
the cost of each?
18. Emily purchased some lace and some ribbon
for 30 cents; A the cost of the lace, increased by \
the difference between the cost of the lace and rib-
bon, equals the cost of the ribbon; what did she pay
for each?
19. Wilber paid 20 shillings for a pair of skates
and a knife; twice the difference between the cost of
the two, plus \ the cost of the knife, equals the cost
of the skates; what did he pay for each?
20. A horse and harness cost $ 34; | of the cost
of the horse is $1 more than the cost of the harness;
what was the cost of each?
1O3. 1. A grocer paid $12.60 for 30 bushels of
potatoes, giving 50 cents a bushel for good ones, and
20 cents a bushel*for poor ones; how many bushels
were good?
ANALYSIS. If all had been good, he would have paid
$15, or $2.40 more than he did; each bushel of poor ones
made a difference of 30 cents; hence there were as many
bushels of poor ones as 30 cents (the difference on 1 bushel)
is contained times in $2.40, (the difference on all,) which is
8 times, equal to 8 bushels of poor ones; the difference be-
tween 30 bushels and 8 bushels is 22 bushels, equal to the
good ones. Therefore, Sfc.
2. A farmer bought 28 sheep for $76, paying $3
for old sheep, and $2 for yearlings; how many old
sheep?

lost -| of what it cost; what did it cost?
5. A man, employing an equal number of men
and boys, paid each boy 5 dimes, and each man 7
dimes, and to them all he paid $7.20; how many
were there of both?
6. An old lady sold an equal number of chickens
and turkeys for $4, receiving for chickens 3 dimes
each, and for turkeys 5 dimes each; how many fowls
did she sell?
7. A speculator bought an equal quantity of
wheat and beans, giving $1.50 per bushel for wheat,
and $1 for beans; the wheat cost $7 more than the

8. A man engaged to work 25 days, on condition
that he should receive $2 for every day's labor, and
pay $1 for board every day he was idle ; he received
at settlement §38; how many days was he idle?
ANALYSIS. As many days as $3, (the difference made
by 1 idle day,") is contained times in $12, (the difference
made by all the idle days,) which is 4 times. Therefore ho
was idle 4 days.
9. A man was engaged for 20 days to copy, re-
ceiving $2.50 for every day's labor, and forfeiting $1
for every day he was idle'; he received $43; how

of what he had left, and having paid $3 for a pair of
boots, had $5 left; what were his wages?
15. A laborer engaged to work 20 days, on con-
dition that he should have 12 dimes for a day's labor,
and pay 2 dimes for every idle day for board; he

many days was he idle?
104. 1. A rope 28 feet in length was broken so
that | of the longer piece was equal to the shorter;
what was the length of each piece?
ANALYSIS. The longer piece is divided into 5 equal
parts, 2 of which equal the shorter; the sum of the 2
pieces is 7 equal parts, one of which equals } of 28 feet,
or 4 feet; 2 parts equal 2 times 4 feet, which- are 8 feet,
the shorter piece; 5 parts equal 5 times 4 feet, which are 20
feet, the longer piece. Therefore, Sfc.
2. A tree 56 feet high was broken in a storm; £ of
the part standing was equal to the part broken off;
what was the length of each part?
3. Henry and Horace have 45 marbles; Horace

one shall equal the other.
11. Homer and Harlan have 48 apples; | of
Homer's, plus 6, equal the number Harlan has;
how many has each?
ANALYSIS. Harlan has 6 more than J as many as Ho-
mer, which makes the sum 48, 6 greater than if he had but
£ as many; Homer's are divided into 4 parts, of which 3
parts plus 6 apples are equal to Harlan's; then 4 parti
plus 3 parts, plus 6 apples, equal 48, 7 parts equal 42,
and $ of 42, or 6, equals 1 part. 3 parts plus 6 equal
24, the number Harlan has, and 4 parts equal 24, the num-
ber Homer has. Therefore, fyc.
12. Rochester is 62 miles from Geneva, via Vic-
tor; ^ of the distance from Geneva to Victor, plus
4 miles, equals the distance from Victor to Roches-
ter; how far is Victor from each place?

cost of each?
16. "Wilson has 15 oranges and lemons; \ of the
oranges equals i of the lemons; how many of each
has he?
ANALYSIS. Since £ of the oranges equals ^ of the lemons,
f, or all the oranges, equal § of the lemons; we then have
the oranges and lemons divided into 5 equal parts, 2 parts
of which equal the oranges, and 3 the lemons, fyc.

the value of what is in it; what is the purse worth?
21. A person, being asked the time of day, replied,
"The time past noon is equal to \ of the time to
midnight." What was the hour?
ANALYSIS. The time to midnight is divided into 5 equal
parts, one of which equals the time past noon ;<<hen 5 parts
plus 1 part equals 6 parts ;and 12 hours, the time from
noon to midnight, must be f of the time it lacked of being
midnight; since 12 is f, £, which is % q/"f, will be £ of 12
hours, which is 2 hours. Therefore the hour was 2 o'clock.
P.M.
22. What was the time, provided f of the time
past midnight equaled the time to 10 o'clock, A. M.?
23. f of the time from this instant to 5 o'clock,
P. M., equals | of the time past midnight; what is
the time of day?
24. Peter said to John, " If times my age is If
times your age, and the sum of our ages is 36 years."
What was the age of each?
25. A bin whose capacity was 44 bushels was

far was he from Cincinnati?
.27. The number of miles that the distance from
Charleston to Columbia exceeds 100 miles equals 1J-
times the distance it lacks of being 150 miles: how
far is it from Charleston to Columbia?
1O5. 1. Two pieces of cloth contain 38 yards;
\ ol the first piece equals £ of the second, plus 4
yards; how many yards in each piece?
ALTSIS. If\ equal £ + 4, \ will equal £ of\ + 4,
which is -J- + 2, thin is $ of 3 times £ -f 2, or f + 6;
then we have 1 piece equal to % the other plus 6 yards, ot 1
piece divided into 5 parts, and 3 of these parts plus § yards
equal the other piece; hence 5 parts plus 3 parts plus 6 yards
equal 38 yards, or 8 parts and Q yards, equal 38 yards; 38
yards minus 6 yards equal 32 yards, or 8 parts, &c.
2. A lad inquiring his mother's age, his father
replied, "f of my age is 9 years more than % of
your mother's, and the sum of our ages is 72 years."
How old was his mother?
3. Two men built 38 rods of wall; £ of what one

than 1£ times what my age exceeds 64." "What was
his age?
7. A rope was cut into 3 pieces; the first piece
was 5 feet long, the second was as long as the first
plus £ of the third, and the third was as long as the
other two; what was the length of the rope?
ANALYSIS. Since the third piece is as long as the other
two, it must be £ of the rope ; the second piece, being i as
long, is £ ; and the 5 feet which the second exceeds £, with
the 5 feet of the first piece, makes 10 feet, which muat be t.\s
other fourth; 4 times 10 is 40. Therefore, efco.

IOC. 1. Malcom is 8 years old, and Martin 25;
in how many years will Malcom be £ as old as
Martin?
ANALYSIS. 8 years since, Martin was 17 years of aga;
in 17 years from that time, or, since Malcom is 8 years old,
in 17 less 8, or 9 years from this time, Malcom will be 11
years old, and Martin will be twice 17, or 34 years old.
Therefore, Sfc.

son's age is § of the father's; how many years since
the son's age was £ the father's? *
3. Helen is 9 years old, her sister is 22; in now

4. Henry played at marbles with Charles, who
had 45; Henry won as many as ho had to commence
with; when they quit, each had the same number;
how many had both?
ANALYSIS. Since Henry won as many as La had. Tie left
off playing with twice as many as he began with ; and Charles,
now having the tame number, must have had 3 times as
.;';my as Henry when they commenced playiny. 45 is 3
limes -J of 45, or 15, and 45 -f- 15 is GO. Therefore, (Jr.

all?
9. A has 10 sheep, C has as many as A and | as
many as B, and B has as many as A and C; how
many eliccp have they all?
ANALYSIS. Since 13 has as many as A and C, he must
have % of the whole; then 10 sheep, plus 10 -j- § of £,
plus £, equals % -f- 20, or the whole number of sheep; hence
20 equals £ the number, and 20 is J of 6 times 20, or 120
sheep. Therefore, fyc.

direction; one is 27 rods in advance of the other in.
pursuit, who gains upon the foremost 3 rods in a
minute; in how many minutes will he be overtaken?
ANALYSIS. In as many minutes as 3, the number of' rodi
gained in one minute, is contained times in 27, the number
of rods to be gained.

together at 12 o'' clock; when will they next be to-
gether?
ANALYSIS. Since the minute hand passes the hour hand
11 times in 12 hours, if both are at 12, the minute hand will
pass the hour hand the first time in ^ of 12 hours, or in
l-j»T hours, equal to bft minutes past 1 o'clock. There'

APPENDIX.-
THS author desires to call the attention ot teachers to the number and
Variety of cfutnges that may be wrought upon the examples of the Sec-
tions from which the following have been selected, as well as upon many
ptheis of the same class, and which may appropriately be termed " Hing-
ing the Changes." It is not recommended that these changes be ap-
plied to all the examples, but used as an occasional exercise, and limited
according to the time and convenience of the teacher.
It is recommended to teachers to exercise their classes in these
"changes," not so much for the novelty of them, as for the enlivening
effect produced upon the class, and especially for the peculiar facilities
they afford for thorough mental discipline; and while, at first, to soma
they may appear severe and too mathematical, they will very soon become
easy and comprehensible.
'lo aid beginners, the blackboard maybe used to advantage; and to
illustrate, take the example which has been written out in full in Secticb
11, page 171-3: —
f of 35 is $ of how many thirds of 18?
which may be written on the board thus : —
f X 35 = fX 7 X 18?
Call upon some pupil to read the question according to theirs* form,
and to solve the question ac|0rdin£ to the form of analysis given; and
the answer, if correct, placed over the 3, will fulfill the conditions of tha
question; substitute this number, and erase another, thus : —
which is read
f of S5 is $ of § of what number?
Solve this as before, and so continue until all the numbers havo been
erased, and replaced by solution.
When the class have become familiar with the exercise, the use of the
blackboard should be dispensed with, and the pupil be required to "ring
the changes " by simply hearing the first form of the question read.
Each question, and its form of solution, should be given by the pupil.
but he may be allowed to give results in the solution that have been
previously determined by analysis, in order to shorten the work and avoid
monotonous repetition.
Members of the class should be called upon promiscuously, and en-
couraged to ask questions, and to detect errors either in the statement or
solution of questions. The teacher should read an example once, slowly
and distinctly, then call upon some one of the class who shall commence
operations, and continue to give questions, forms, solutions, and conclu-
sions, until signaled to sit, or another pupil detecting an error, raises
the hand, when some other one should be called upon, who should re-
sume where the last one left off; and so on. .
A teacher who has not practiced a class upon these changes, cannot
tonceive of the interest, close attention, and perfect enthusiasm that
may be created, as well as the thorough mental discipline attained, hy this
exercise; and it is firmly believed that, upon trial, it will commend itself
to the judgment and approval of every livt teacher.'
