Ridiculous Robinson Crusoe.
-«**6£t$ & <H£SZ»~~
My name it is Robinson Crusoe,
Whom doubtless you've heard of
before.
I've always found good friends and true,
so
I venture before you once more.
II.
From my earliest days I imbibed,
A longing for life on the sea;
To cure which my old Dad prescribed
Applications made from a birch tree.
 I introduce myself to a Skipper.
I leave home.
III.
One day, as I strolled on the pier-head,
Admiring a beautiful clipper ;
A sailor before me appeared,
Who I quickly perceived was the
skipper.
IV.
" Good morning," says he, " My young
shaver."
Says I, " Good morrow, old chip ;
Please Sir, could you do me the favour,
To take me to sea in your ship ?"
V.
He answered politely, " Most happy!
I'm in want of a first cabin boy."
So I ran home delighted to Pappy,
But he did not rejoice in my joy.
VI.
He said that my conduct was shocking;
My Mammy dropp'd several tears ;
The dogs barked, the getse began
quacking,
And seem'd to give three parting
cheers.
  I climb the mast to feast my eyes once more.
Spread-eagle'd.
The " Flying Foam " sailing on Friday,
The sailors predicted bad luck.
At the home of my childhood I tried a
Last view from the main-royal truck.
VIII.
With a sob and a sigh I descended,
But alas ! I was stopped on the way,
And secured by two men, who intended
That I for my footing should pay.
  I experience the horrors of sea, and dream of home.
A practical joke.
Released from my painful position,
I straightway retired below,
Feeling in that distressing condition,
Which but those who have felt it can
know.
X.
To my hammock at last having clam-
bered,
After many a fruitless attempt,
My troubles soon ceased; for I slunv
bered,
And of home and the future I dreamt, i
XL
In visions delightful I revelled,
Till disturbed by a bump I awoke,
And found that my head had been le<
veiled
With the deck, for a practical joke.
 I swim ashore.
And am much exhausted.
XII,
Nothing happened for days worth de-
tailing, |-way<
The " Flying Foam" sped on her
With a spanking north-east wind prevail-
ing,
We sailed on for many a day.
XIII.
But at length, alas ! the wind shifted,
And quickly increased to a gale;
Masts fell on the deck, we then drifted,-
All the horrors I need not detail.
XIV.
I alone the disaster survived
Of a crew of a hundred or more.
With the aid of a spar I contrived
In safety to swim to the shore.
XV.
On the beach I lay puffing and blowing,
Very like a small whale or a porpoise;
And for awhile I could not stir, owing
To the exhausted state of my corpus.
 I visit the wreck, and discover a Cat and a Dog.
I make a raft, and carry my goods ashore.
However, I quickly recovered,
And then I had time to explore
The Island, and soon I discovered
Thai no one had been there before.
XVII.
The next day I swam to the wreck,
(In the calm she lay there like a log);
And as soon as I climbed to the deck,
I discovered both a cat and a dog.
XVIII.
Spars, barrels, and ropes I collected,
And with them constructed a raft;
Having placed thereon all I expected
Would be useful, I left the old craft.
 I am greatly fatigued, and enjoy forty winks.
With the aid of my dog I conveyed
My gear to the spot which best suited,
I was monarch of all I surveyed,
A fact which the monkeys disputed.

 I discover a cave.

Then I went out, and cut down some
wood,
One day, I determined to roam,
And soon I was pleased to discover
With which I my cave barricaded ;
A cave, which we then made our home—-
Myself—Fan, the cat—and dog Rover.
To be ready if ever I should
By wild beasts or men be invaded.
 Interior of my cave.
I made an arm-chair and a table,
A bed-lamp, cauldron, and kettle,
Et caetera; and so I was able
In very great comfort to settle.
XXIII.
The island abounded with goats,
Whose flesh was my principal meat;
With their skins I made capital coats,
And a good suit of clothing complete.
/
 I hunt.
I make a suit of clothes.
A nice little kid, whose poor mother
Had been killed by my pitiless gun,
A monkey, a parrot, and other
Tame pets, caused amusement and
fun.
XXV.
Thus by me time pleasantly flowed,
Nought occurring for five years worth
mention;
Each day Dame Necessity showed
That she was the mamma of Invention.
One morn on the beach I was strolling
With Rover, when to my surprise,
The dog began barking and howling,
And—could I believe my own eyes ?
XXVII.
I rubbed them,—I surely was dreaming ?
Did I see right—or did I squint ?
Then doubts to my senses came streaming
As I gazed on a human foot-print.
XXVIII.
I wondered and stood, and still wondered,
And left the spot wondering still;
I looked all around, and then wandered
To the top of neighbouring hill.
And behold a horrible sight.
'Twas a sight which I cannot describe,
Made me shiver and shudder and
shake;
Close beneath was a cannibal tribe,
With their victim fast bound to a stake.
XXX.
Quick as thought I ran back to my cave,
Sword, pistol, and rifle to fetch;
Determined, if able, to save
The life of the poor coloured wretch.
XXXI.
I returned to the scene with all haste,
When I found the poor man was free,
And now by the savages chased,
Was running direct towards me.

I rescue Friday from the savages.
Friday begging for mercy.
I levelled my rifle and fired,
When with a fierce yell and a bound,
A cannibal fell and expired,
After struggling awhile on the ground.
XXXIII.
The rest of the horrid black sinners
In alarm beat a hasty retreat;
Whilst the fellow who was for their
dinners
Fell trembling with fear at my feet.
 'Smrti-i >.
Friday and I launch a boat.
And embark our goods.
To this poor man I then gave the name
Of Friday—(it being that day).
My companion and friend he became,
Proving faithful in every way.
XXXV.
I taught him the language of my land,
And contrived soon to understand
his;
When I learnt for the first time, this island
Was that called Juan Fernandez.
 Encounter with savages
Discovery of Friday's father.
At length, I with Friday's assistance,
Felled a tree and constructed a boat;
But its weight offered so much resistance,
We were two years in getting afloat.
XXXVII.
'Twas just at this juncture, when chancing
To climb to the top of a hill,
I discovered some cannibals dancing
Round a man they were just going to
kill.
XXXVIII.
To their boats we soon sent them all
flying,
And then—judge poor Friday's de-
light,—
He found 'twas his father there lying;
We released him, and soon set him
right.
 Adieu
* * .
Next morning my faithful man Friday
Came running in great haste to me,
Crying " Massa, what you tink me spied,
A bery big sheep on de zee!"
XL.
With all speed we rushed down to the
beach,
And embarked on board the canoe;
The ship we soon managed to reach,
And bade Juan Fernandez—" Adieu,"

C PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE ' is an old saying, but we have never
heard of cure being prevention itself, and yet this is true of a cure for Corns recently brought under
public notice. ' Young's Arnicated Plaisters,' which not only cure the Corn, but prevent its recurrence,
soothing pain, allaying inflammation, and removing by mechanical means all pressure on the Corn
itself, thereby speedily effecting a cure of one of the plagues of humanity. The pressure being re-
moved, fresh Corns are prevented, and the poor suffering foot released, even in tolerably tight boots,
from the friction which has originally occasioned the torment. This Plaister can be had of all
respectable Chemists.—Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine for August,

 INFANTS' FOOD!
^^ PATENT EXTRACT
TRADE TOHgir MARK,.
FOR FEEPAElttG
Liebig's Concentrated Patent Milk,
WITHOUT BOILING OR STRAINING.
The only Genuine Substitute for Mothers' Milk, and the acknowledged BEST FOOD for INFANTS AND INVALIDS.
. By simply dissolving a given quantity of the Extract, which is in the shape of a granular powder, in tepid Milk and Water, the most nourishing and easily
digested food is made intone minute. All Farinaceous Food is pronounced by the highest medical authorities to be bad, indigestible and not assimilable, so long
as children have not their teeth. It must therefore'be stated that the Patent Extract contains no farinaceous matter whatever, the flour from which it is made having
been thoroughly transformed into dextrine and grape sugar, by Ltebig's Process.
The following Testimonials from the most eminent Physicians speak for themselves:
" We have been requested to express our opinion on a project for supplying to the infants of poor persons, either gratuitously or at a reduced charge, the preparation of milk
introduced by Baron von Liebig. We have to state that every facility that is given for the purchase and distribution of so good a food as this, will, in our judgment, be
instrumental in reducing the intolerable amount of sickness and mortality among infants that we know to exist at present: and we are satisfied that hospital and dispensary
work will become more hopeful from the time that we are enabled to assist poor infants with appropriate food." v

"I have given Liebig s Patent Exgact a fair trial m comparison with other manufacturers' foods for infants, and I am now fully convinced that there is no other preparation
that contains such nutritive propertie^for the rapid production of healthy structure in the child. I therefore always recommend it in preference to any other kind of diet."
