 His condition
ROBINSON CRUSOE, while still a small boy,
ran away from home. He went to a seaport,
and then on board a big ship to learn to be a sailor.
The captain liked him, and he made several voyages,
without any serious ill luck, until he became a man.
He then sailed on a ship that was going to Africa.
Before they were out many days a great storm came up,
and the ship was driven on the rocks and wrecked.
Everybody was drowned except Robinson Crusoe, and
he was thrown upon the beach almost dead. When he
was able to walk, he went up on a hill, and found he
was on an island, with no sign of other inhabitants.
was lonely enough,
and he was very sad.
Night soon came on;
he climbed a tree, to
sleep, fearing there
might be wild ani-
mals on the island.
In the morning,
when he awoke, the
sky was clear, and
the sea calm. The
ship lay on the rocks,
- and, when the tide
- was low, he was able
to swim out to it.
He found the food
quite dry, and he set

about getting some ashore. He
made a raft of some planks, and
saved all he could from the ship
before she went to pieces. His
next task was to make a place
to live in. He found a cave,
and around the entrance
he drove a row of piles, to
get over which he had
to use a ladder. This
he called his Castle.
After this he made
a table and chair,
and some other use-
ful things. Often, he
went about the island
with his gun, and shot birds and wild goats, whose flesh
he used for food. He also caught a parrot alive; this,
and a dog and two cats that had been on board the
ship, were his only companions. At last he thought
he would capture «jsome goats, and they would supply
him*with milk as well as meat, and clothing besides,
for he could make garments out of their skins. He
also wished to make a canoe, and, after a great deal of
labor, he cut down a large tree, and shaped a boat out
of it. With this he could sail around the island. After
many years had passed, Robinson Crusoe, one day, saw
the prints of naked feet in the sand on the shore; these
tracks were made by savages. Not long after, he saw-
smoke at a distance, and very soon a lot of savages
gathered about a fire. They killed one of two men,

who lay bound on the ground, and placed the body on
the fire to cook. While they were busy, the other man
managed to free himself, and ran straight to Robinson
Crusoe. He decided to try to save him, and fired his
gun at the men when they came near enough.
One was killed ; the others ran to their canoes,
and paddled away. The captive fell on his knees
before Crusoe, who took him with him to his Castle.
He taught him a little English, and named him Friday
—as it was on that day he saved his life. He soon be-
came a pleasant companion, as well as a useful servant.
Nearly two years passed before they saw any more
savages. One morning, Friday came running in, to
tell Crusoe that a large number had landed with some
captives, whom they had begun to kill and eat.
Robinson Crusoe armed himself and Friday,
and both went to attack the savages. They killed
several, and the rest were so frightened that they fled
to their canoes, leaving on the ground a prisoner
whom they had not killed. Crusoe saw that he was
a white man, and set him free. Friday found another
captive in a canoe
left behind. This
was an old man,
and, when Friday
looked in his face,
he saw that it was
his own father,
and embraced and

transport of joy.

One morning, soon after, Friday came running in, say-

an English ship, and saw that a boat had put off for the
shore. He did not think it best to be seen, till he knew
why they were landing, and it was wise that he did not.
Eleven men landed, and Crusoe saw that three of
them were very sad, and kept by themselves, while the
rest scattered about the island. As soon as they were
out of hearing, Robinson Crusoe approached the men,
and spoke to them. They were astonished to see him,
and told him that one was the captain, and the others
the mates ; that there had been a mutiny on the ship,
and that the sailors were going to leave them on the

and the cap-

and, when the men returned, shot two, who, the cap-
tain said, were leaders in the mischief. The others,
taken by surprise, cried out for pardon. This the
captain granted, on condition that they swear to assist
him in recovering the ship, and they all did so,. It
was decided to wait until it was dark before trying to
take the ship. Those on board, ngt knowing the turn
affairs had taken, were not prepared to resist, and, when
the captain had shot the ringleader of the mutiny, the
rest of the men submitted.
The ship set sail the next day, and Robinson
Crusoe left his island, after having spent over twenty-
eight years upon it. He had saved some gold from
the wrecked ship, and this he took with him, but
everything else he left for the Spaniards when they
came from the mainland.
Poor Friday never reached England. One day,
some savages came paddling toward the ship in canoes,
and Friday was sent on the upper deck to speak to
them, and find out what they wanted. At almost the
first word, the wretches let fly their arrows at him, and
he was killed. The ship's guns were fired at the
canoes, and the savages were all killed, but Robinson
Crusoe was not consoled by that for the loss of Friday,
of whom he had become very fond.
When he arrived in England, he found his father
and mother were dead, and few of his friends were
living, and for a time he felt almost as lonely as
when he was on his island. But he married a good
wife before long, and settled down to a quiet, indus-
trious country life. He was blest with children, who
grew up to be his
delight and comfort,
and he spent
his old age
in peace and
happiness.
