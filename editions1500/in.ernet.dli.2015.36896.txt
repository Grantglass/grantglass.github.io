LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

or 

ROBINSON CRUSOE 


1 yri.B linni in lb« year 1632, in tho e!fy of ToA, of a good fanilj, 
ibongh not of that connixj, mj father being a foreigner of Bromea, nrho 
eottl^ flnt at Xtall bo got a g^ e^tato by manhaadaa, and leanng off bis 
trade, lived aftennitds at York ; from vhcaeo be had uamed my mother, 
nrhose relations vrero named Bobuuon, a rtry good fanuly in that eonnfaj, 
and £rom wbom I 'irai called Bobinson Eroutznaer, but, by the nsntd 
eomijitioa of trords in England, ve are no^ callod, — ^nay nrn coll onnolTe^ 
and write onr name, Cmsoo , and so my companions alimya called me 

I bad two iddot broiben, one of whom was Lontraant-colond to an 
English xegimeni of foot in Handen, formerly commoaded by the famons 
Colonel IiMkhart, and was killed at tho battle near DunbrV. against the 
gptuuatds. YThat became of my second brother I never know, any more than 
my father or mother did know what was become of mo 

Bcmg the third son of tho family, and not bred to any trade, my head 
began to bo filled vny early with rambling tbonghta* my father, who was 
vciy ancient, had gnron me a competent share of learning, as far os honse* 
edneation and a eonntiy frce*sehool generally go, and dengned me for the law, 
but I wonld be satisfied with nothing bnt going to sea , and my inclination to 
this led me so strongly against the will, nay, tho commnnda of my father, and 
against oD tho entreaties and petsoadoas of my mother and other fiiends, that 
there seemed to ho something fatal in that propmsiij of natnre, tondmg 
directly to the life of misery whioh was to hefal mo 

ICy btber, a wise and grave man, gave me senons and exedlent eonnsel 
agoiDct what he foresaw waamy design He caUed me one mommg into his 
ehamher, where ho was eoi^n^ by the gmt, and expostnlated veiy warmly

fortones on the other, who wont abroad uponadTeatures, to nae b) enterpnso, 
and mnLethcmselTes famous m nnderbikmga of a nature out of tho common 
toad , that thnigswere all either too far ahore me, or too far hdow m^ 
that “was the middle statOi or 'irhat might bo called the upper station of 

low life, which he bad fomd, by long experience TO the best state in the a 

world, the most smted to human happiness, not eo^ed to tho miseries and 
hoxdshipa, thalahonr and sdffenngs of themcchwuc part of manlond, and not

that Lmgs have frequently lamented the muerablo conseqnence of bemg bom i

extremes, between the mean and the great, that the wise mait gate his 
teshmony to tine, aa the Btsmdaxd of fehmiy, when he prayed to hare neith^ ^ 
poverty nor nehes 

He bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the calamibos of 
life were shared omong the upper and lower port of mankind , but that the 
noddle station bad the fewest dmasters, and was not exposed to eo many 
Ticissitadcs as the higher or lower part of miinbnd , nay, they were not euh- 
jeetedTto so many distempers, and uneasiness, either of body or unnd, as those 
weievrho,by vnnou hviiig,luxary, and extcavaganceaenone hand, or hy hard 
lobonr, vrant of neeessanes, and mean or xnauffioient dmt on the other ln^nd , 


hvmg, that the noddle fitatien of life was calculated for all kmd of virtues

nuddle fortune , tl^ tempeianee, modotatum, qpiefaiess^bealth^ a^ty, all

me, and cndoaTOur to enter me fairly into tbe station of life Trbiob ho had just 
been Tecommonding to mo , and that if I 'ima not very em and hrppy in the 
nrorld, It most bo my mete fate or fault that must hinder it, and that he 
ehonld haTO nothing to anstror for, havmg thus discharged his duty in \ranung 
mo again^it mcnsures ‘vhioh hO kneir trould be to my hurt, m a nuidi that os 
he nould do Tery kind things for me if I xronld stay and settle at home as he 
directed, so he 'vronld not hare so innch hand m my misfortones, as to giro mo 
any encouragement to go away ^ and to elgso al l, he told mo 1 had'my elder 
brother for on example, to whom ho had used the same earnest peiswions to 
keep him from going into ^oXoir Gouniry nraxs, hut could not prevail, his 
young desires prompting him to run into tho army, where he was killed, and 
though he said he would not cease io pray for me, yet ho would Tenturo to say 
to me, that if 1 did tale this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I 
diotdd have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel, 
when there might ho none to assiM in my xecpveiy 

I ohserred in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prpph^o, 
fboT^h 1 suppose my father did not know it to he so himsdf , I say, I 
observed the teats run down bis face very plentifo&y, especially when he spoke 
of my brother who was kdlod, and that when ho spoke of my havmg leisure 
to x^ent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that bo broke off tho dis- 
ooucBO, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me. 

J was dnceroly affecfed^with this discourse, as indeed who could he other- 
" wi&o^ aud I resolved not to fhmk of going abroad any more, hut to settle at 
home accordmg^ my father’s desiro But, alas * a few days womit aH off , 
and, in short, io prevent any of my fs&et’s further importmuties, m a few 
weeks after, I resolved to run quite away from him Howevea:,il &d not act 
ijmte BO hastily as {he -first h^ut of my xeablution prompted, I took: my 
mother, at a tune when I thonghi hei a little' ^asonter than oxdouity, and 
told her that my thoi^hts were so entir ely bent .up on seeing the world, that I 
should never settle to anything with resolation enough to go through with it, 
and my father had better giro mo his consent than force me to go without it; 
ihatl was now ^hteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to^a 
trade, or clerk to on attorney, that I was sure, if I did, I should neier serve 
out my tune, hnt I should cerioiuly run away from my master hefoia mr tune 
was out, and go to sea, and if she would speak to piy father to letmegoone 
voyage abroad, if I came home again, and not like it, rwould go no more , 

and 1 would promise, by a double dthgence, to recover {he time that I had 
lost ' » ^ 

This put my mother mio a great passion, she told ^me she knew it would' 
he to no purpose to speak to my father npon any such enbjeot; that he knew' 
too wdl what was my mterest to give his consent to anything so much for my 
hurt, and that she wondered how I could think hf any suA thmg after the 
dSscourBoI had Irndwrlh my father, and snchkmd and tender expresdons os

if I can^ express at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, 
I was m tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former conTictioiui, 
and the haTxng retoxned foom them to the resolutums I had wiohedly taken at 
first, than 1 was at death ifadf > and these, added to the terror of thestorm, put 
me mto sttoh a condition, that I can by no words describe zt But the worst 
waa not come yet; the stem eontmaed with sudh foxy, that the seamen them- 
pdres acknowledged thq^ had noTor seen a worse, ^e had a good ship, but 
she was de^ laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen erery now 
and then cned out she would founder It was ray adTaniogo m one xct^ect 
that I did not know what ih^ meant by jfounefor, till 1 inquired However 
ttie storm was so noleut, that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the 
hoalswom, and some others more sensible than the rest, at ihoir prayers, and 
expecting overy momant when the ship would go to the bottom In the 
of the n%ht, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men 
that had been down to see, tned out we had sprung a leak , anothw said, 
there was four feet water in tixe hold Then all hands were called tothepnmp 
At that word, my heart, as I "fiionght, died within me , and I fell backwards 
open the side of my bed where I s^ mto file cabin. However, the men 
xousod me, and told me, that I, that was able to do nothing beforo, was os 
well able fo pnmp as another , at which I stured np, and went to the pump, 
and worked yery heartily. 'While this was doing, the master seeing some 
lij^t colhors, who, not able^ to ride but the efozm, were obliged to slip, and 
run awa} to the sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a 
mgnal of distress I, who knew noQmig what they meanly thought the ship 
had broken, or some dreadful thing b^ened. In a word, 1 was so surprised 
that I foil down in a swoon As tins wusa time when every bodrhad his 
own hfo to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me, hat 
another tpan stepped up to the pump, and (hmsfiiig me aside with his foot, 

^ letme he, tiunlo^I^ been dead, and it was a great while befme I came 
to myself 

W^e worked on , but the water inoxeasmg in the hold, it was apparent that 
the dup would founder; and though the storm began to abate a hitle, yet as 
it was not possible sbe could swim till we might nm mto any port, so fixe 
master con&ued firing guns for help; and a hght ship, who had nd it out 
]usta-hea^ of us, ventured a boat out to hdp us It was with tho utmost 
'haxaxd the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get ou boar^ or

appeared hu tone'iras altered , and, looking Tory mdamfiioly, and shnLmg Mu 
h^, he askedme hoir I did, and tdlinghu father who I was, andhoir I had 
come this w^ge only for a tnid, m order to go farther abroad, his father 
taming tome, with a very grare and concerned tone, “yonng man,” saja he, 
**yoa onghtnerer to go to sea any more, yon oi^htto take this for a pimn 
andiinble token that yon are notto be a seafamigman ” "'Why, sir,” said 
1^ ** will yon go to sea no more P” ” That is another case," said he, "it is 
my calling, and thonfora my duty , bat as yon made fans Toyage for a tnol, 
yon see what a taste Heayen has grren yon of what yon are to eiqiect if yon 
persist Perhaps this has all befidlen ns on yonr aeconnt, like Jonah m the 
ship of Terdudi Pray,” confannes ho, “what are yon , a^ on what account 
did yon go to sea P” TJpOn that I told him some of my story, at the end of 
which he burst out into a strange kind faf passion* "What had I done,” says 
he, "that snbh an unhappy wretch should come mto my ship P I wodd not 
set my foot mihe some dup with thee agam for a thousand pounds ” This 
indeed wai^ as I said, an excnnum of his qnnfat, whudi were yet agitated by 
the sense of his loss, and was fauther than he could have anthonty to go 
However, he afterwards talked -very gravdy to me, exhorfang me to go book to 
my father, and not tempt Providence to my mm , tdling me I might see a 
visible hand of Heaven against me " yonng man,” said he, *‘d^end 
npon’it, if yon do not'go back, wherever yon go, yon wdl meet with nothing 
but disasters and disappoinlmenia, fall yonr &thor*a words are fulfilled i^n 
you.” 

We parted sobn after, for I made him httle answer, and I saw him no 
more , which way he went I knew not. Asfor me, having some monqrm my 
pocket I travelled to London by land , and there, as well as on the had 
many stn^les with n^df, what coutae of life I should take, and whether I 
should go home or go to sea - 

As to gdng home, shame opposed the best mofaons that ofiered to mj 
thoughts ; and it immediately oeourrad to ms how I dioidd be laughed at 
among the neighbouis, and should be adiamed to see, not my fa&er and

a larger store of prorisions than ozdinaxy , and bad ordered me to get ready 
three fuses with powder and ehot, which were on board bis ship, for that they 
designed some ^ort of fowling as wdl as fishing. 

1 got aU things ready as he bad directed, and waited the next mommg 
with &e boat washed dean, her andent and pendants out, and everything to 
aocommodate his guests, when by-and-by my patron came on board alone, 
and told me his guests h^ put off gomg, from some business that fell ont, and 
ordered me, with the man and hoy, as usual, to go out with the boat and 
catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house , and com-

I diould steer — onywhere to get oat of that place was my desire 

My first co ntriTa noe was to make a pretence to q»eak to this Moor, to get 
something for our subsistence on board , for I told him we must not presume 
to eat of our patron’s bread He said that was true , so he brought a large 
hadset of rusk or biscnit, and three jars of fresh water, into the boat I knew 
where my patron’s case of bottles stood, which it was enden^ by the make, 
were taken out of some English pnzo, and I couTeyed them into the boat 
while the Moor was on shore, as if they had been there before for our master 
I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat, whicb wdghed above 
haU a hnndredweigbt^ witii a pared of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and

Btsmd oS to sea towards thesii otherwise I sught now easily hare toundsome 
of these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till I 
came to that part where the English traded, I should find some of their 
resBcls upon ihdr usual design of trade, that would rdiere and take ns in 

^ tto best of calculation, that place where I now was must be that 
country wUch, ^ying between the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions and the 
Eegtoes, lies waste and nmnhahited, except by wild beasts , the Negroes 
'having abandoned it, and gone fiirUier south, for fear of the Moors and the 
Moon not thinking it wmih inhahitu^, by reason of its bozzenness and, 
indeed, both foxsakmg it because of the pr^igioos namhen of tigers, lions, 
leopards, and other fonons creatures which ha^pur there , so that the Moon 
use it for their htmtmg only, where th^ go hke an army, two or three 
fhousand men at a time • and, indeed, for near a hundred miles together upon 
this coBst^ we saw nothing hut a waste unmhabited country bf day, and heard 
nothing bat howhngs and roanng of wild beasts by mght 

Onoe twice in the day-tune, 1 thought I saw the Pico of Tenenffe, 
bdng the high top of the Mountain Teneiifie m jthe Gananes; and had a 
groat mmd to venture out, in hopes of leaohmg thither , hut having tned 
twice, I was forced in agam by contrary winds, tiie sea also going too high 
for my little vessel; so I resolved to pnzsoo my first design, and keq^ along 
thedioze 

Sevcral^tunes I was obliged to land fhr fresh water, after we had left this , 
place, and once in parhcnlar, being early in &e mommg, we came to an 
anchor under a little pomt cd land, which was pretty h^h , and the tide 
beginning to flow, we lay still to go Burtber in. Xury, whose eyes were mote 
about him than it seems muie were, calls scitly to me, and tells me that we 
had heat go farther off the shore, “for,” sayshe, “ look, yrnder lies a dreadful 
monster on the side of that hillock, £i^ aslwp ” I looLri where he pomied, 
and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a temble great lion that lay on 
the side of the dioze^ uni^ the shade of a piebe of the hill that hung as it 
were aStUe over lum “Xuxy,” says I, “yon shall go on shore and kill 
him ” Znzy looked fiighfed, andsaid, “Me kill ’ he eat me at one mouthy ”

St* Sahrador, xrhich ims onr port » and that, m my duconnes among fhem^ 
1 had freqnently giren them an account of my two voyages to tho^coast of 
Ooinea, the manner of trading with the Negroes there, and hew eaqr it was 
to purchase i^on the coast for tniles — such as beads, toys, knires, scissors, 
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like — not oxdy gold dns^ Gumea grains, 
dephanb* teeth, &e , bat Negroes, for the service of the firasils, m great 
numbais* 

They listened always very aitentiTely to my discouxses on these heads, but 
especially to that part which related to the buying Negroes, which was 
atrade, at that time, not only not far entered into, but^ as far as it was, had 
been earned on by the ossxentos, or permission of the longs of Spam and 
Portugal, and engrossedinthe^blio stock, so that few Negroes were brought, 
and those ezcessiTely dear. 

It happened, being m company with some merchants and planters of my 
acqoamtance, and talking of those tilings very earnestly, three of them came 
to me the next moniing, and told me h^ been musing very much upon 
whatlhaddiseouzsed wifhihemof the last night, and they came to make a 
secret pn^svl to me, and, after enjouung me secrecy, th^ told me that 
th^ had a mind to fit j^ut a ship to go to Guinea ^'^iSatHhej had all plonta- 
tzona aa wdl aa I, and were straitened for nothing so much as servants; tiiat 
as it was a trade that could not be earned on, becanse they could not 
publicly sell the Negroes when thq^ came home, so they demed to male but 
one Tcyage, to bring tiie Negroes on diore pnvatdy, and divide them among 
their own plantations . and, m a word, the question was, whether I would go 
their superca^ in the ship, to manage the tradufg part upon the coast of 
Gumea , mi they Offered me tiiat I shoulA have my equal share of the 
Negroes, without providing tmj part of fhe stock 

This wst a four proposal, it most he confessed, had it been made to any 
one that had not had a setflement and a plantation of his own to look after, 
whidi was m a four way of conung to be very considerable, and with a good 
stock tpon it But for me, that was thus entered and established, and had t 
nothing to do but to go on as I had begun, for three orfour yeaxamore, and to

and with that litQe addition, could scarce hove foiled of being worth three or 
four thonsand pounds sterling, and that ineceasmg too — for me to think of 
such a voyage was the most prepostmns thing that ever man in snoh

But I, that was born to be own destn^er, could no more resist the 
offer, tiian I could restn^ my first rambling designs, when my fother^s good

Cape St Anguakna ; so that ho found he was upon the coast of Guiana, or 
tbo north part of Bnsil, bojond the rrrer Amaaons, towards that of the nrer 
Oroonoquo, commoxdy c^ed the Great Biver , and began to consult with me 
what course he should take, for the ship was leaky, and very much Suabled, 
and he was going directly back to the coftst of Bra^ 

I wae positiTdj ogai^ that , and looking over tbo charts of the sca^coost 
of America with him, we concluded there was nq inhabited country for us to 
hare recourse to, till we came within the circle of the Ganbbee islands, and 
therefore Tesolyad to stand away for Barhadoes, which, Iqr keeping ^ at 
sea, to UToid the m-draft of bay or gulf of Menoo, we might easily 
perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days’ sad , whereas we could not 
possibly make our '\oyago to the coast of Afnca withont some assutanco both 
to our ship and to otradyes 

T7itli this design, we changed our conrse, aud steered away K W by W , 
in order to xeadisoiaeof our Eng^h idands, where I hoped for rdief, but 
our Toyage was otherwise detonmued , for, bemg in the latitude of twdve

,away With the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the wa% of 
all kumnn commerce, that had all (mr lives been saved os to the sea, wp were 
rather in danger of being devour^ by saviiges, t^an ever retuming to our 
own country 

Jn this distress, the wind still blowing very bard, one of our men early in

hut to titmh of sating our lites as wall as wa oould T7e had a boah at onr • 
stem }nst before the etonn, but she was first atarod by dasbmg against the t 
ship’s rudder, and, in the next place, she broke away, and either sank, or was 
dnrea off to sea , so there was no hcqpe from her We had another boat on 
board, bnt howto get her off into the sea was a doubtfnl thing, however, 
(hero was no tune to debate, for we isnoud the ship would break in pieces ^ 
evexj mnmte, and soma told us die was actually brokra already 

In this distress, the mate of onr tessd laid hold of the boat, and'wiih the 
hdp of the rest ol the men, got her slung over the ^ip’a side , and getting 
all into her, let go, and committed ounelves, being eleven in iiumber^ to 
Ood’s men^ and the wild sea ; jtor though the storm was abated considerably, ' 
yet the sea ran dreadfully high upon (he shore, might be well called 4 toi j 
wild tee, as the Dutch the sea m a atonn 


And now onr case was very dismal indeed , for wo all saw plainly, that 
tho sea went so high, tiiat the boat could not hve, and that we diould'^be 
inevitably drowned As to mokii^ sail, we had none, nor, if we hu d , could

TTiter I tooV ra I lutd bo mocli presence of mmd| as 'irdl as breath left* that 
seeing myself nearer the mam land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and 
erdeaToii^ to make on iowaids the land as fast as I could, before another 
noTo 4umld return and take mo up agam, but I soon found xt ^ms impossible 
to nrold it • for I saw tbo sea como after me as high ns a gre<«i hill, and as 
furious 08 an enemy, wluoh I hod no means or strongtli to contend with my 
burincss was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could , 
and 80 , by swimming, iO preserre my btoaihing and {njot myself towards tbo 
sboro, if possible, my greitest concern now brag, that the sea, as it wonid 
carry mo a great way towards the shore when it came on, might not carry me 
back again with it when it gave back towards tbo sea 

Tho wave that came upon me again, bnned me at once twenfy or thirfy 
feet deep in lis own body, and I could fed myself earned with a m^bty 
force and switmess towards fiie shore a xery great way , hut I hdd my 
breath, and assisted myself to ewim still forward with all my might I was 
ready to burst with holding my breath, when, os I fdli myself raising up, so, 
to my immediate relief, 1 found my head and hands shoot out ahoxo the 
surface of the water , and though it was not two seconds of time that I conld 
ko^mysdf so, yetitrehoyod mo grcatl}, gavo me breath and now courage 
I was coymred again with water tt good while, hut not so long but I held it 
out; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck 
forward against tho rotum of tho waves, and fdt ground agun with my feet 
I stood bQi a few moments, to lecovar breath, and till the waters went from 
me, and then took to my heels and ran, with '‘what strength T had, farther 
towards the diore But neither would this ddixer me from the fury the 
sea, which came ponrmg in after me again ; and twice more I was lifted up 
by the Waxes and earned fhtwards os before, the share being yexy flat 

Tho last tune of these two had wdl mgh been fatal to me , for the sea 
haying hurried me olong, as before, landed mo, or rather doshed me, against 
a piece of a rook, and that with such f orco, as it loft me senseless, and mdeed 
helpless, os to my own ddixenmce , for the blow taking my side and breast, 
beat the breath, as it were, goiteontof my body, and had it retained again 
immediatdy, I musthave been singled in the water* bnti reeoTeced a litfle 
before the Totnra of the waxes, and seomgl should he covered again with the 
water, I icsolred to hold fast ^ a piece of the rook, and so to hold my breath^ 
if possible, till the woie went back Now, as tho waves were not so high os 
atfixst, being nearer land, Ihdd my hold hll the wave abated, and then fetched 
another run, which brought me so near the shore, that the nest wave, though 
it went over mo, yet did not so swallow me up as to cony me away , and the 
nest run 1 took, I got to the mam laud , where, to my great comfort, I 
de mbere d up the ehils of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free 
from danger, oud quite out of the reach of the water 

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look jxp and tha n k God 
that my bte was'savri, in a cose wherdn there was, some mmntes before, 
Bcaxoe any room to hope * 1 hdieve itis impossible to express, to the life,

, TThen I li was broad daj, the y\e ithor do ir, and fhe stonn abated, 
fio ibat the sea did not rrge and swdD os before , bat that which sozpnsed me 
most was taat the ship was lifted off in the night bam the sand whore she 
lay, by &e swelling of the tide, and was dmea np almost ns fox as the rook 
which I at first mentioned, where I had been so bruised^ by the ware dashing 
me against it This being wiihm about a mile &om ibe shore where X was, 
and the ship seenung to stand npnght stOI, I wished mysdf on board, that 
at least I zn^ht sOTe some necessary things for my use 

"Vnien I come down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me 
again, and the first thing I found was the bort, which lay, as the wmd and 
sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on lur right hand I 
walked as far as I could upon the shore to hare got to her, but found a neck, 
or inle^ of water between me and the boat, which was about half a nolo 
broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting at the 
^ship, where I hoped to find something for my present subsistence 

A litQe after noon, 1 found tho sea rety calm, and the tide ebbed so far 
out, that I could come witbin a quarter of a nulo of the ship And here Z 
fouud a fresh lenevnng of m} gnef, for I saw endenth , that if we had kept 
ou hoard, we had been all safe * that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, 
and I had not been so iniserablo ns to be left eutirel} d estitnta of all comfort 
and company, as I now was This forced tears to my eyes agom , but as 
"tbeio was htUo relief in tha^ Izesohcd, if possible, to gel to the ship , so 
"I pulled off my <dofhes, for the weather was hot to estromitr, and took the 
‘water. But when I c.ime to the ship, my difficnlfy was stJl greater to know 
how to get on board, for, os she lay pground, and hijh out of the wafer, 
there was nothing wilLin my reach to la^ hold of I swum round her tince, 
end the second time I spied a small pece of rope, which I wondered I did not 
see at first, hung down Ij tho foie-cduuns so low, that with great difficulty 
I got hold of ‘it, and by the help of that rope I got up into the forecastle of 
the slup Here I frund that the dup was bulged, and had a great deal of 
water m her hold, but that she lay so on the s^e of a bonk of bard sand, or 
rather earth, that her stem lay hfted up upon tho hank, smd her head low, 
almost to the water By this means all her quarter was free, and nil that 
wosm that part was diy, for tou maybe sure my first work was to search 
and to see w^t was spoiled and wbat was free And, first, Z found that all 
tbelibip’s pronsions were dry and untoudied by the water, and being very 
well dispos^ to eat, X went to the hread-rDom, and filled my pocLola with 
Tnspmi and'eaf it as I went about other things, for I had no‘ tune to lose. X 
also found some rum in the great cabm^ of which I took a large dram, and 
which I hod inde^n^ enough of tospixit me* forwhatwas before me. Kow 
X wonted nothing but a boat, to fum^ mjsdf with many ffaisgs which

I had three encouragements Ist, a smooth, calm sea, 2ndly, the tide 
rising, and setting in to the shore, 3idly, irhat little mnd there mts blecr 
me tomiids the land And thus, hanng found t\ro or fhroo hiohen oan 
hclongtng to tho boat, and besides tools which were in the chest, two saws, 
an axe, and a hammer with this cargo I put to sea For a mile, or there- 
abouts, my raft wont vezy well, only that I found it dnio a little distant from 
the place where I hnd l^dcd before, by which I poredred that there was 
some indraft of the water, and consoqucntly, 1 hoped to find some oreeh or 
nverthere^ which I might maho nse of as a port to got to land with mynazgo 

Ab 1 unpgined, so it was There appeared before me a ktQe opening of 
tho land, and I found a strong currant of tho tide set into it , so 1 guided my 
raft, as well os I could, to keep m the middle of tho stream 

But hare I had liLo to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, 
1 flunk, TerQy, would Jiaxo broke my heart, for, knowing nothing of' file 
coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shod, and not being 
aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my caxgo had slipped 
off towards fho end that was afloat, and so fallen into tho water I did my 
utmost, by setting my baefir agaiubt the chests, to keep them in their places, 
hut could not thrust off the raft with all my strength, neither durstl stir 
from the posture I was m , but bolding up the chests with all my might, I 
stood in that manner near half an hour, m which time tho rising of the water 
brought mo a little more upon a level , and, a little after, the water still 
tisiug, my raft floated ngam, and I thrust her off with the oar 1 had into the 
channel, ond then dnvuig up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth 
of a litflo n^er, with land on both sides, and a strong current or tide runmng 
up 1 looked on both sides for a proper place to get to fliore, for I was not ^ 
wiUing to be dnven too high np the mer hoping, in tune, to see some ship / 
at sea, and therefore resolved to place mysdf os near the ooa^ os I could. 

At length 1 qpied a little cove on the nght shore of the creds:, to whudi, 
with great pain and difBculfy, I guided m} raft, and at lost got so near, that 
reachug ground with my oar, I could thrust her direcQy in But here I had 
like to ha^e dipped all my cargo into the sea ogam, for that shore lying 
pretty steep — ^that to soy, dopmg,— 4h6re was no place to land, hut where 
^ one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would he so high, and the other sink 
lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo ogam All that I could 
do, was to wait till the tide was at the highest) keqpmg tho raft with ni} oar 
hke an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of 
ground, which I e^q^ectod tho water would flow over , and so it did. iji soon 
as I found water enough, for my nft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her 
on upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by shcLmg 
my two broken oars into &e groundr'^o tm one dd% near one end, and one 
on the other nde^ near the other end , and thus I lay till the water ebbed 
away, and leii my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.

I got on board the abp as before, and prepared a second raft , and, 
tmnng^'^had expencnco of tlio firsts 1 uc^tlicr modo tbu so immeldy, nor 
loaded it so hard, but toi I brought anai scroxnl things tgit useM to me , 
as, iixsii in the carpenters stores, I found tno or three bags lull of naib and 
spikes, a great atreu'-jneki a dozen or two of hatohets, and, ahora all, that 
most useM tbng called a grmdsfone JJl iheso I secured, together with 
soreral things belonging to iho gunner , porticuhrly two or three iron ctows, 
and two bamis of musket bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-picco, 
onth oomo smaU qnanlit} of powder more , a largo bagful of small shot, and 
a great xdll of sheet-lead , hut this last was so heavy I could not hoist it xsp 
to get it over the ship’s side 

Besides these things I took all the men’s clothes that I could find, and 
a sparo fore-top sad, a ^mmoek, and some boddmg, and with fins I loaded 
my second raft, and brought thorn cdl safe on shore, to my very great comfort 
I was under some apprehension, dunng my abence from the land, (hat 
at least nxy pnmsions might bo devoured on sboro • but when I came back, I 
found no sign^ol any visitor ; oul\ there sat a cteaturo like n wild cat, upon 
one of the ^ests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a littlo distance, 
and then stood stQl She sat very composed and unconcotned, and looked 
full in my face, us if she had a mind to bo acquainted with me I presented 
m] gun to her, bu^ as she did not uudorstand it, she was perfectly nnconcemod 
at it, nor did she ofior to stir away, upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, 
though, by the way 1 was not lery free of it, for mj store was not great 
howoictt I'Spored her a bit, I sa}, and sho wont to it, smelled at it, ond ate 
it, and looked (os if pleased) for more, but I thanked her, and 'vtuld qiaro 
no more: so sho marched off 

Having got my second cargo on shore,— though I was obliged ^ open the 
barrels of powder, and bni^ them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being 
large casks,— I went to work to make me a htQo tent, with the and 
some poles which I cut for that purpose * and into this tent I brou^t every- 
thmg that I know would ipoil either with rain or son, aud I piled all the 
empi) chests and casks up in a cirde round {ho tent, to fortify it ir im any 
sudden attempt, eifher from man or beast 

'When I had done this^ 1 blocked np the door of the tent with some hoards

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 




Ifimled iomjsoU aitlie inghiof {hismon^ drug’*’ said I aloud,

off tho ground : one of ihoso buTos is urorth all this heap 1 have no manner 
ot use for theo, e’en xemvan where thou art, and go to tho bottom, as a 
' creituro whoso life is not worth saxing/* ISonever, upon second thoughts, 
tooL it away ; and wrapping all in a piece of oaniass, I began to thmig oi 
malong another raft ; but while I was prepanng thu, I found the skj over- 
c.ist, and the wind Ixgpax to nso, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh 
gale &om the shore It presently occurred to me, that it was m ram to pre- 
tend tomakoa raft with the wind of! shore, and that it was my busmess to 
be gone before tho fade of flood began, otherwise I might not be aUo to reach 
ibo shoro at olL Accordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam 
across the channel which lay between tho ship and the sands, and even that 
with difficolfy enough, partly with tho weight of the things I had about me, 
and partly from the roughness of tho water , for the wmd rose Texj hastily, 
and before it was quite high water it blow a storm 

But I bad got homo to my little tent, uhexe I lay, with all my wealth 
about me very secure It blew very hard all that night, and in the mommg, 
when I looked out, behold no more ship was to bo seen f I was a little sur- 
prised, but reeoveied myself with this satisfoctoxy reflection, that 1 had lost 
no fame, nor abated any diligence, to got eTerytbii^ out of her that could be 
useful to ine , and that, indeed, there was litUe left in her that I was aUe to 
bring away, if I hod b^ more fame 

1 now gave over any more thoughts of the dup, or of anTthing out of her, 
except what might dnre on shoro from her wrcc^ , os, indeed, ^veie pieces 
of her afterwards did, but those things were of sms^ use to me 

My thoi^hts were now wholly employed aboni securing myself agamst 
erther savages, if any shoifld appear, or wild beasts, if any were m the ii^d « 
and I bod many tboughfs of tho method how to do this, and what land of 
dwellmg to make,— whether I should make me e cave in the earth, or a tent 
upon the earth* and, in short, 1 resolved iqpon both, the manner and 
descnpfaon of which, it may not bo improper to give an account of. 

I soon found tho plnco I was in was not fit for my settlement, because it 
was iqKm a low, moondi gronnd, near the sea, and I beheved it would not be 
wholesome, and more particnlarly because there was no fresh water near it, 
so 1 resolved to findn more healthy and more convenient qmt of ground. 

I consulted several things m my situation, which I found would be proper 
for me 1st, health and fresh water, I ]ust now menfaoned 2ndly, shelter 
from the heat of the sun Srdly, seonriiy from ravenous ereatores, wfie^er 
men or boasts idfhly, h viewto ibesca, fhaiif God sent aur ship in sigift,!* 
might not loso any advantage for my d^verance, of which 1 was not willing 
to banish dl my eiq^tafaon yet 

In seorcth of a place proper for this, I found a litQe plain on the^de of a 


mnng hdl, whoso front towards this little phin was steep as a honsb^nde, so 
that nottung could come down upon me from the top On the sxdq^rfho rock

It cost me much labour and many days boforo all fboso things srero 
brought io perfection , and ihorofore 1 must go back to some other things 
< ivlucb took up some of my thoughts At tho samo time it happened, aftur I 
hod laid my soberao for the eoUing up my tent, and majving tho cavo, that 
a btorm of ram falling from a thick, dark oloud, a sudden llnsli of lightning 
happened, and after that, a great clap of tiiunder, os is naturally tho ^eot of 
it I sras not so much surprised uiUi tho hglifumg, as I urns -with a thought 
irhieh dartod into my mind as swift os tho lightning itself . 0 my powder * 
Hy my heart sank within mo when I thought that, at one blast, all my 
powder might be destroyed , on wlucli, not m} defonco onl}, but tho providing 
mo food, as ,I thought, ontiroly depended I was nothing near so amaous 
about mj own danger, though, had the powder look fire, I diould never have 
known who had hint me. 

Buell impression did tins make upon mo, that after the storm was over, I 
laid aside all my works, my building and for(if}iiig, and applied myself to 
make hags and boves, to separate tho powder, ond to keep it a litUe and a 
little in a parcel, m hope that whatovor might come, it might not all take fire 
at once , and io keep it so apnrf^ that it should not bo possible to make one 
, part fire another I finished this work m about a fortnight , and I tlunk my 
powder, which m all was about two irandred and forty pounds weight, was 
. divided into not loss than a hundred parcels. As to tho barrel that had been 
wot, I did not apprehend any danger fiom that; so 1 placed it in my new 
cave, which, m my fancy, I called my kitobon, and the rest I hid np and 
down m holes among the looks, so that .no wet might como to it, marking 
very coxofully where I laid it , 

, In’ tho interval of time srhilo this was doing, I wont out onco at Icostovory 
day mih my gun, os well to divert myself’, as to see if I could kill aiytlimg 
fit for food , and, os near as I oould, to nequaint myself with what llio island 
produced Tho first time 1 went out, 1 piesently ^oeovercd that thrre were 
goats in the iidand, which was a great satisfacbon to me , but then it \ras 
' attended with this misfortuno to mo, vis , biat they weto so shy, so suhtio, 
and so swift of foot, that it was the ^ifioidloBt thing m tho world to como ot 
them , but I was not di8caur(^,cd at tins, not doubling but I might now and 
then shoot one, os it boon luupened , for after I hod found tliou: haunts a 
little, I laid wait in this manner for thorn I pbsoned if thoy saw mo m the 
valleys, thongh they wore upon tho rooks, they would, run away, os in a 
'iomblo fright , but if tlio) were Ibodmg in tbo valleys, nnd I was upon the 
, rocks, thiy took no notice oil me , from wbonco I concluded, that b} tbo 
poubon of thmr ophes, their sight wits so directed downward, that thiy did 
not loadily see objects that wore aboio tbem, so afterwards, I took this 
thotbod,— I always climbed the rooks first, to get above them, and then had 
, frequently a fair mark.

things as easy to me as 1 could. 

I have almdy desenbed my habitation, vriuch \ras a tent under the side of 
a rock, surrounded vrith a stremg pale of posts and cables , but I might novr 
rather call it a troll, for I xmsrd n kind of vnill up against it of torJ^ about 
itro feet duck on the onidde: and xkfter some tune (I think it teas a year and 
a-half)I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatened or covered 
it tnih boughs of trees, and'aach things as 1 conld get, to keep out the xuiu , 
vHch I found at some times of the year voty violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into tUs pale, and 
into the cave winch I had made bobindmo But I xirast observe, too, that at 
fiT«t tins tnis a confused heap of goods, whidi, as»tb^ lay in no order, so thev 
took up all my place , I had no room to turn mvsclx * so I set mjs^ to en- 
large my cave, and work faTthecinto the earOi, for it was a loose oandvrock, 
which yidded easily to the labour Z bestowed on It and so when I found 
I was pretty safe as fo beasts of prey, I worked 6idewa)s, to the nght 
hand into the rook, Bnd,thcRi^timimg to the right again, worked quite out, 
and made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification 
This gave me not only egress and'xbgrKs, as it was a book-way to mv 
tent and to my storebonse, but gave me room to store my goods 

And nowl began to apjdy myself to make such necessary things as I found 
I most wanted, porhenlarl) a dunr and a table, for without those I was 
not able^to exqoy the few comforts 1 had in the world , I coidd not wnte, or

All the rest of the day I qpent m afflicting mysdf at the dismal cizcuni- 
stances I ms hronght to, tiz , I had neither food, honse, clothes, mipon 
nor place to fly to * and, m deq^air of any rdief, saw nothing hut death 
heforeme either that I shonld be devoured by wild beasts, mmdeied by 
savages, or starved to death for wont of food At the approach of mght 
I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatoies; but slept soundly, though it 
rained all night 

Oef<^ 1 —In the monnng I saw, to my great suxpnse, the ship had 
floated with the high tide, end was driven on shore ogam much nearer the 
island , whidi as it was some comfort, on one hand, for seeing her sitnpnght, 
and not broken to pieces, I h(^ed if the wind abated, I mighi get on hoard, 
and get some food and necessaries out of her for my relief, so, on the other 
hau^ it renewed my gnet at the loss of my comrades, who, I imaged, if 
we had all stayed on hoard, m^ht have saved the ship, or, at least, that ih^ 
would not have been all drowned, as they were, and that, had the men been 
saved, we might perhaps have bi^t us a boat, out of the rums of the ship, to 
have oaixied us to some other port of the world. I spent great part of this 
day id pexplesing mysdf on these things , but, at length seeing the ship 
almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on 
hoard This day also it contmned rammg, fiiongh with no wind at all 
Erom the 1st of OcMer to the SUth — ^AU these days enhrdj spent in 
many several vopgos to get all I could out of the ship, which 1 brought on 
shore, every tide flood, Tspon rafts Huch ram also in the days, though 
with some mfeiTals of fair weather, but it seems tins was the ram) season 
Oct 20 —I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it, but 
being in dioal water, and the fhmgs bemg chiefly heavy, I recovmed many of 
them when the tide was out 

Od 25 — It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wmd , 
during which tune the ship broke in pieces, tiie wind blowxug a little harder 
ihon before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that 
only at low water I spent this day in covering and secunng the goods 
which I had saved, that the nun might not spoil them 

Oct 26.— I walked about the shorn almost all day, to find out a place to 
fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure mvself from anv attack m the 
nighty dther from wild beasts or men Townxds n%ht, I fixed upon a proper 
place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encampment , wdncih

StfO Uf 15} 16 —These three days I ^ent in making little squoxe chests, 
or hoses, 'which might hold ahoiit a ponnd, or two pounds at of 
powder, and so, puttmg the powder in, I stowed it in places os secure nnd 
remote from one another as possible On one of these three days, I killed a 
large bird that was good to eat, hut I knew not what to call it 

Jfyo li , — ^Xhis day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to mnke 
room for my further conYomem^. 

Note — Three things I want^ exceedingly for this work, yiz , a pickaxe, 
a shord, and a wheelbarrow, or bosket ; so I desisted from my work, and 
began to oonmder how io supply that want, and make xno some tools As for 
the pidoixe, I made use of the iron crows whidi were proper enough, though 
heavy; hut the next thing was a sherd, or spade , this was so absolutd} 
necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing efiectuoUy without it , but uhai 
kind of one to mako I knew not 

Nbo 18 — The next day, in Eearching the woods, I found a tree of that 
wood, or Hke it, which, in the Bnuob, call the iron-tree, for its 
excee^ng hardness , of fins, with great labour, and almost spoilmg mv axe, 
I cut a ^ce and brought it home, too, with difficult enough, for it was 
cxceoding heavy The excessive hardness of the wood, and my having no 
other way, made mo a longwhde upon this machine, for I worked it 
eflectoally, by little and little, into the form of a shovd or spade , the handle 
exactly shaped like onrs in England, only that the hoard part having no iron 
shod npon it at bottom, it would not last me so long , however, it served well 
enough for the uses wbichl had occasion io put it to ; Imt never was a shovel, 

I bdieve, made after tint fashion, or so long in making* 

I was still deficient, for I wanted a hasLst, or a whedbarrow A hrsket 
I could not make b} any means, having no such thxnga as twigs that would 
bend to make wicker-ware — at least, none yet iouud out , and as to a whed- 
harrow, 1 fancied I could make all but the whed , hut that I had no notion 
of, neither did 1 know how io go ahont it; bsddes, I had no pebble way 
to make thoixon gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the whed to mu in , so 
I gave it over, and so, for carrying away the earth w^ich 1 dug out of the 
cave, I mode mo a thing like a hod, whch the labourers cany mortar in 
when they servo fixe bneklayers Tins was not so £fficalt to me os the 
making the shovd , and vet this and the shovel, and the attempt which 
t made m vain to make a whedbarrow, took me up no less than four days 
I moon olwavsi excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom 
foiled, andTexy sddom failed also hnngipg home eometinz^ fit to aat

Jan 3 —I begaa my foncoi or indl , wfaicli, leing still jeslons of my 
hemg aifeiGLed someb^Vt I resolved to mabe vezy thick and strong 

K B.»Tais vrall bang descnbed before, I pniposely omit vrbat vras said 
in the jonnuil • it is soffiaont to observe that I was no less time fhoa from 
the Srd of January to the 14th of April vrorlong, fin&hmg, and perfecting 
this irally fhongb it was no more than about twenfy-fonr yards m length, 
being a bolf-ei^e, from one place in the xocL to another jdace^ ahont oght 
prdsfromit, tHe door of tiio care being in the centre behind 

AE this -^e I worhed vexj hard, the rams bindenng me many davs, nay, 
Eomefimes weeks, together , hnt I fhonght I should never be perfectly seonxe iOl 
this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour every- 
thing was done with, especudly the brmging piles out of the woods, and dnvmg 
ihem mtc tiie ground , for I made them much bigger than I needed io have done. 

Wben this aoU was fimshecl, and the outside double-fenced, with a turf 
wall raised up do^ to it, I persnaded mysdf that if any people were io come 
OR shore thore they wotdd not perceive anvihmg hke a baktation « and it 
was Te^ wdl I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable 
occadon. 

Dunng this thno I made my rounds in the woods for game every day, 
when the ram permitted me, and made frequent discoveries m these wdks of 
something or other to my advantage; parbcnlarly I found a kind of wild 
pigeons, which build, not as wood-pigeons in a tree, but ratber as house- 
pigeons, in the holes of the rocks , and talnng some young ones, 1 endeavoured 
to breed them up tame, and did so , bat when they grew dder they flew 
away, which perlmps was at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothmg 
to give them; however, I frequently found thdr nesie, and got their young 
ones, which were verr good meat And now, in the mai&ging my household 
aSaixs, I found myself waning in many fh^gs, which t Qiought at fitbt it 
was imposdble for me to make, ns, mdeed, wiQl some of them it was for 
instance. I could never make a cask to be hooped. 1 had a small nmlet or 
two, as I observed betore, bnt I could never amve at the capacity of maldng 
one by them, though I spent many weeks about it ; I could neither put in 
the heads, or yoin the staves so trae to ono another as to make them hold 
water , so I gave that also over. In the next piece, 1 was at a great loss 
for candles ; so that as soon as ever it was darl^ which was generall} by seven 
o’dock, I was obliged to go to bed I remembered the lump of bees* -wax 
with which I made candles m my African adventure , bnt I had none of that 
now, the onlv remedv 1 had was, that whtn I had killed a goat 1 saved the 
tallow, and with a htile disb m^o of day, which I haked m the sun, to 
which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp , and this gsve me 
light, though not a dear steidy light hke a candle In the middle of all my 
labours tt happened that; rumma^ng my things, Pfonnd aiitOe bag, which, 
eslhmted before, had been fillod with com for the feeding of ponlfr},— not

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


6X 

In the xalafii^ what is alreadj past of my story, flus will he the more 
easily bdiorcd, whea I shall add, that through all the vanefy of xmaenea, 
that had to this day hefollen me, I never had so mu(di as one thought of it 
being^he hand of God, or that it was a just punxshxneat for my sm My 
Tohcdhous behaviour against my father,— or my present sms, which were 
"great,— or so mndi ia a punishment for ^ general coume of my wicked life 
Tnien I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of AinMi^ I 
uevwhadsomuoh as one thought of what would become of me, or one wish 
to God to direct mo whither 1 should go, or to keep me from the danger which 
apparently sunounded mo, as well from voraoious creatures as cruel savages 
But I was merely thoughtless of a God or a Proridence, acted like a mexe 
brute, iitnn the pnedples of nature, and by the dictate of common sense 
only, and, indeed, hardly that 'When I was delivered and token up at sea by 
the Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as well 
os chantablvy I bad not the leik thankfulness m mv ihoi%hfs When, agam, 
I was shipwrecked, rumed, and m danger of drowning, on this island, I was 
OS far from remorse, or lookug on it as a judgment I only said to myself 
often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and bom to be always miserable 

It 18 tra^ when I got on shore fot her^ and fonnd all my ship’s crew 
drowned, and mjsdf spired, 1 was surprised with a kind of ecst^, and some 
trau^orts of soul, which^ had the grace of God assisted, might have come up 
to tme thankfnln^, but it ended where it began, in a mere common flight 
of joy, or, 08 1 may say, bemg glad I was alrro, without the least reflection 
upon the distmgaished goodness of the hand whu^ had preserved me, and had 
singled me out to be presened when all the rest were destroyed, or an inqnixy 
whv ProTidoneo'hod been thus mermful unto me Even just the some common 
sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they axe got safe ashore from a 
shipwreck, which the) drown all in the next howl of punch, and forget almost 
as soon as it is over , and all the rest of my life was like it. Even when I 
wosj afterwxwds, on duo considerutiQn, made scnsihle of my conditian, how 
I was cast on this dreadful place, out ^ the reach of human kmd, out of all 
hope of Tchef, oeproq^eot of Te&inptum, as soon os I saw but a proqiect of 
living, and that 1 should not stone and penidi for hunger, all the sense of my 
afflioti^ wore off, and 1 began to be verv easv, apphed myself to the worla 
proper for my preservation and supply, and was far enough being afflicted 

at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as the hand of God against 
me these were thoughts whidi verj sddom entered my head 

The growmg up of tho com, as is hinted in my Journal, had, at^fizst, 
some little influence upon me, and began to affect me with senousnoss, as 
long as I thought it had something miraculous in it, hut as soon as ever that 
part of the fhonght was removed, all the impression that was raised from it 
wore off also, as I have noted already Even the earthquake, though nothmg 
could he mote terrible m its nature, or mote immediately dizectix^ to iho 
invi^lo power which alone dixecb such filings, yet no sooner was the flzst 
fnght over, hut tho impression it bad made went off also 1 had no more

weak, that I could hardly carry a gun, for I never went out without fho^ so 
I went hut a little way, and sat down upon the ground, lookmg out upon the 
sea, which was just b^ore me, and very calm and smooth As I sat here, 
some sudi thoughts os these occurxed to me,— what is tins earth nnd sea, of 
which 1 have seen so much? 'Whence is it produced? And what am I, and 
all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and hmtalP Whence aro wo ? 
Bure we axe all made by some secret power, who fonned the earth and sea, 
the air and And who is that? Then it followed most naturally, it u 
God tiiat has made all Well, but then, it came on siiangely if 6^ has 
made all these things. He gmdes and govoms them all nnd all things that 
concern them, for the power that could make all things must certainly have 
power to 'guide and direct them If so, nothing can happen m the great 
mxemt of His works, either without His knowledge or appomtment 

And if nothing happens without His knowledge, He kno\T8 that I an 
hero, and am in iUs dreadM^oondition , and if nothing happens without Hia 
appomnuent, He has appointed all this to hefal me Kothuig occurred to my 
thought, to contradict axqr of these oondusums, and therefore it rested upon 
me with the greater force, that it must needs he that God had appomted all 
this to,heflil me,«that I was brought into this misexahlo oircunistauee by 
His directum, He havug the solo power, xu>t of mo only, but of evcrytlu^'g

thing sbonld ever happen, yet to enclose mysdf among the hills and woods in 
the centre of tho island, was to anhcipato m} hondage, and to render such 
an alTair not only improbable, but impossible, and that therefore I ought 
not by anr means to remore noirorer, 1 was so enamoured of this place, 
that I spent mneh of my tuno thoro for tho whole of fho remaining part of 
the month of July ; and thongh, upon second thoughts, I resolred not to 
tomoTO, yet I bnilt me a littlo Lind of a hower, and snrronndod it at a distanco

«tnlied, and filled between with broshwood , and here I layTexyseooze, some- 
times two or three nights together , alwa}a going over itwithaloddor, so 
that I landed now 1 had my country honso and my sea-coast honso , and 
this work took mo 1 ^ to tho beginning of August 

I bad bnt newly fimshod m> feneo and began to enjoy my labour, whon 
iito rmns come on, and made me stick dose to my first habitation , forfhough 
1 had mado me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sad, and spread it 
very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to Loop mo from storms, nor a 
care behind me to retreat into when the rams were exfiaordmary 

About tho begmning of Angnst, as I said, I had finished my bower, and 
began to enjoy myself Tho 3rd of Angnst, I found the grapes I had hung 
up perfectly dned^ and indeed wore excollont good raisms of tho siin, so I 
began 4o take them down from tho troos, and it was yoxy happy that I did 
so, for tho rains which followed would hare spoiled them, and I hod lost the 
best port of m} winter food , for I hid above two hundred largo bunches of 
them. No sooner badi taken thomall doim, and earned most of them homo

Angnst, it rained, more or less, every day till the middle of Octobor, and 
sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for serera]

my seed in Fobmarj^a little before theTomal equmoi., and tiua h*>Ting 
the rainy months of Mnioh and .Vpnl to tvuter it, sprung up rery plcasantlT, 
and ndded a Ttry good crop , but huTing port of the seed left onlr, and not 
danng to sow all that I had, I had but a smnB quantity at last, my wholo 
crop not amounting to ubore half a ps^k of each kind But by this 
expemnuut I was made master of my business, and knew exaetl) when the 
proper season was to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times, rud two 
horresta every year 

'While this com was growing, 1 made a little discovery, which was of use 
to me afterwards* As soon as the rams were over, and the weather began to

il IS suitca credible how beautiful a figure thegr grew into in three years ; 
so that though tiio edge made a code of about twenty-five joxds in diameter, 
jet the txeos, for such I might mow eaU ftiem, soon covered it, and it was a

resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me n hedge like this, m a semi- 
circle round my wall mean that of my first dwelling], which 1 did; and 
placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards distance 
from my first fence, they grew presently, and uera at first a fine cover to my 
habitation, and afterwards served for a defence also, as 1 shall observe 
in its order*

I menfionGd before that I had a greit mind to see the whole island, and 
that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I bnilt m} bower, and 
whore I had an qiening qnite to tho sea, on the other side of the island I 
now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shoro on that side , so, takmg 
my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger qnantit\ of powder and shot 
tlum usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of nisms in my pouch 
for my store, I began mr journey liVhon I had passed the vale where mj 
bower stood, as above, I came uithin new of tho sea to the west, and it being 
1 very dear day, I &irl) dtsenod land,~wbether an island or a contment 
I could not tell , -but it lay very lugh, attending from the to the \7 S 
at a very great distance , by my guess, it could not be less tban fifteen or 
twenij leagnes off« 

Iconld not toll what part of the world this might be, otherwise than that I 
knew it must be part of America, and, as I condnded, by all my observations, 
must ho near fiio Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all inhabited by 
savrges, where, if I had landed, 1 had been in a worse condition than 1 was 
now • and therefore I aoqniesc^ in the dispositions of Prondence, whioh I 
oegannowto own and to oeliere ordored evotything for the best, I say I 
quieted my mind with this, and left off afihctmg mjself with fraitless wishes 
of being there 

Scsides, after some thoughtnpon this affair, I considered that if this land 
'was tho Spanish coast, I should certainly, one tune or other, see some vessel 
pass or repass one way or other, but if not, then it was &e savage coast 
between &e Spanish country and Biasila, where axe found the worst of 
\ savages , for they are cannibals, or men-eateis, and foil not to murder aud 
devour all the human bodies that foil into their hands 

'With these considerations, 1 walked very leisurdly forward , I found that 
side of tho idand where 1 now was mndh ^oasonter than mine, — the open or 
s«avDxiiiah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and fdl of very fine 
woods I saw ahnndonco of parrots, and fom I would have oaught one, if 
possible, to have kept it to he tame, and taught it to speak to me I did,

Thmii and m this duponhon of nund, I began my fhixd year, and 
tliongb 1 hare not g^Tcn Iho reader (ho tronble of so parhcular an acconnt 
of my ^orks this year as the first, yet in gonexal it may be obsexred, that 
I ras Teiy seldom idle, but havuig regularly dinded my tune accotdi^ to 
Qie tOToi^ daily emploments that acre before mo, such as, first, my dntj* to 
&od,’^and the reiding fho Scrtptnres, ^rhioh 1 constantly set apart some time 
for, thrice every day, secondly, the going abroad mth my gon for food, 
irbidi generally took me np three honrs m ereiy moxmng, when it did not 
ram; Ihixdly, tho otdetmg, catting, preserving, and cooking, what I had 
killed or can^t for my supply these took np great part of the day , also, 
it IS to be considored, that in the nuddle of the day, when fho siin was in the 
eenith, the vudenee of tho boat was too great to stir out ; so that about fonr 
tionis in the evening was ail the tune X conld be supposed to work in, with 
ihis exception, that sometimes I changed my hoars of hunting and working, 
uid went to work in fho morning, and abroad with my gun in the afternoon 

To this short time allowed for labour, 1 desire may he added tho exceed- 
ing lahononsness of my work ; the many hours which for wont of tools, want 
of help, and want of skill, everything I did took out of my timo for 
9xam][»le, I was foil two and forty days in making a board for a long shelf, 
which 1 wanted in my cave , whereas, two sawyers, with their tools and a 
saw-pit, weald have cat six of them out of tho same free m half a day. 

My case was this it was to bealargo troewhichwas to be cut down, 
bocanse my board was to he a broad one This tree I was three days in 
Butting down, and two moro cutting ofi! the boughs, and reducing it to a log, 
It piece of timber lYith inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced 
both the sides of it into chips till it began to bo light enou^ to move , then 
[ turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board &om end to 
md, then turning that side downward, cut the other side, fill I brought 
the plauk to be about three inches fhv^, and smooth on both sides Any 
me may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work, hnt labour 
tnd patience earned mo through that, and many other things, I only 
^setvo ibis in parhcular, to diow the reason why so much of my time went 
iway with so littio work, m , that what mighi he a little to he done with 
idp and tools, was a vast labour and reqnir^ a prodigious tune to do alone, 
md by band. But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I got 
hrough everything that my cucumstanoes made necessary to me to do, as 
nil appear by what fdlows 

I was now, in the months of Xfovember and December, expecting my 
sop of barley and nee The ground I had mnnnred and dug up for them 
vas not great , for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the 
[uantity of half a peck, for I had lost one whole cic^ by.sowing in the 
Ixy season . but now my crop promised vetj wdl, when on a sudden I fonud 
[ was m danger of losing it aU again by enemies of several sorts, which it 
iraa scarcely posstble to kc^ from it, as, first the goits, and wild creatures 
ivhich I called harei, who, tasting the sweetness of foe blade, lay in it

a great basket irlaek 1 had made, and so Tabbed it out lath my bands , and 
.atthe end of all my hanrestmg, Z fbnzid that out of my hal&pedk of seed I 
iliad near tiro bnshds of zioe, and about two bnshels and a half of barl^, 
^tbat IB to say, by my gness, for I had no measure at fliot time 

However, il^ ^was^ a great enoonxagement to me, and I foresaw ihat^ 
mtime, it wonld please God to supply me with bread and yet, hero I was 
^ poipleved agnm, for I neither knew how to grind, or make meal of my com, 

, or indeed, hovr to dean it and part it , nor, if made into meal, how to nta feg 
bread of it, and if howto make it, yeti knew not how>io bake it, these 
^things bemg added to my desire of having a good qnontiiy for store, and 
^ to seooro a constant snpply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, hut to 
^ preserve it all for seed against the next season , and, in the meantime, 

^ to employ all my study and honxs of working to accomplish tins great work 
[*pt providing myself with com and bread. 

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. I bdieve few 
' people hove ihdnght mnoh upon the strange mnltitode of litfle things 
necessary m the providing, prodnemg, onxing, dressing, making, and finishing 
tins one article of bread ^ 

I, that was rOdneed to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily 
) dxsconragement, and was made more sensible of it orexy hour, even after 
il had got the first handful of seed-com, which, as I have said, came up 
unexpectedly, and indeed to a suxpnsb. 

First, I l^d no jdou^ to turn up the earth, no spade or tiiovel to dig 
it '"WoU, this I conquered by makmg me a wooden spido, os 1 observed 
before, but this did my work but in a wooden manner, and though it cost 
me a' great maiy days to make it, yei for want of ifon, it not only wore out 
soon, but made my work the harder, and made it hoiperformed much worse 
However, tins I bore with, and wis content to work it out with patience, 
and bear with the badness of the performance TVhon the com was sown, 

I hod no^ barrow,, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a groat heavy 
bough of a tree over it,, to scratch it, as it may be odlod, rather than zake or 
harrow it 'When it was growing, and grown, I have observed already how 
many tiungsl wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry 
' it home, thrash, part it txm tiie chaff, and save it Then I ranted a null 
to gnnd it, sieves to dress it^ yeast and nit to make it into bread, and an 
ovmi to bake it, but all these things I did without, as diall be observed, 
and yet the corn was an incshmable comfort and advantage to me, too All 
this, as I nid, made eve^^tbing labonous and tedious to me, but that there 
was no hclpfo, neither XfOsmy tono so much lo«s tome, beennse, as X h'^d 
, dividifd it, a certain port of it was eroxy diy ap^xnnted to the^e works , and

saw the pots lu the insido red-hot quite , through, aud ohserred that they did 
not crack at all , when X saw them dear red, 1 let them stand in that heat 
about £to or mx hours, tiU I fcaind one of them, though it did not ezack, 
did mdt or rvn , for iho sand which was mixed with the oLa} melted b} 
the violeuce of ihe beat, and would hare run into gloss if I had gone on , 
so I slacked my fire gradually till iho pots began to abate of the red colour, 
aud watcTimg them all night, that I might not let the fire abate too fast, 
in the mormng I had three vory good (1 will not say handsome) pipkins, 
aud tuo other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could bo desired, aud one of 
them pexfcotly glazed with the running of the sand 

After this evpenmtni, I need not 6a> that I wanted no sort of eaxfhon- 
uare for my use, but I must needs say as to {ho shapes of fliem, they were 
very indifferent, as au} one xOay suppose, when 1 1^ no way of making 
them, but as the cbildnm make dirt pies, or os a woman would make pies 
that never learned to raise paste 

Ko ]Oy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mme, when 
X found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fixe , and 1 had 
hardly patience to slay till were cold, before I set one on the fire 
again, with some water in it, to boil mo some meat, which it did admirably 
wdl, and with a piece of a kid I made same vexy good broth, though 1 
wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it os good 
as I would have hod it been 

hly next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some 
com in , for as to the null, there was no thought of ammg at that per- 
fection of art with one pair of hands To supply this want, I was at a 
great loss , for, of aU the trades in the world, I was as petfeoily unquoMed 
lor a Btone-cutier, as for any whatever , neither had I any tools to go 
about it with 1 spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to 
cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except 
what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way io dig or cut out, nor

N It need not le \a>ndered at, if all these flmga took me up most part of 
the thud yeari.of tny ahodo hexe , for, it is to he ohserred, that m the 
intorrahi of these things, 1 had my no'w harvest and hnshandry to i^na^e , 
for 1 reaped my com in its season, and earned it home as as I cot^, 
and hud it in the ear, in my laxge haskots, till I had time to rah it ont, 
for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instramont to thrash it s\ith 

And now, indeed, my stock of com inoreasmg, I really wanted to hnild 
my hams-^hi^er , 1 wanted a place to lay it np in, for the increase of the 
com now^ yielded me so mnoh, that X had of the barley about twenty 
bushels, and of the xioe as mnch, or more, insomudh tiiat now I resolved 
to begin to use it iredy , for my bread had been qmte gone a great while; 
also I resolved to see what quantity would bo sufiioient for me a whole yeatj^^ 
and to sow hut once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty hushds of hadey and nee were 
much more than I could consume in a year; so 1 resolved to sow 3 ust the 
same quantity everr year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity 
uould fully provide me with bread, &c 

All the while these things were doing, you may he sure my thoughts ran 
many times upon the proqiect of land whi^ I had seen from the other side 
of the idond, and I ras not without secret wuhes that I were on shore 
there, fanoymg that, seeing the mam land, and an inhabited counfrv, I nught 
find someway or other to convey m 3 sdf farther, and perhaps at last find 
Bomocmeans of escape ' 

But all tlus while I made no allowance for the dm^xs of such an 
undertaking, and how X might fall into the hands of savages, and pexhaps 
sttdi as Ixu^t have reason to think flir worse than the lions and tigers of 
Africa, that if I once came in their power, I shoidd run ahazoid of more 
than affhouBond to one of heing'lalled, tmd peihap of hmug eaten, for I 
had heard that the people of the Oaxibhean covst were canmnals, or man- 
eaters, and I Inew by the latitude that I could not he fir from tnot dioxe 
Xnen, supposing they were not cannihals, yet they might kill me, as many 
Europein8*who had fallen mto fiieix hinds hid been served, even when they 
had been ten or twenty together— much more I, that was h^ one, and could 
meko httle or no defence, nB'those ihmgs, I say, which I ought to have 
coa^idered wdl, and did dome into my thoughts afterwards, yet gave me no 
apprdiensions at first, and my head ran xmgHtily upon the thought of 
getting overio the shore. 

iCbw I wished fox my hoy Xury, ind the long-hoai with tho shoulder-of- 
mutton sail, with which 1 vsailcd above a thousand miles on tho coast of 
Africa hut this was m vain then 1 thought I would go and look at our 
ship^s boat, which, as I havo said, was blown up upon tiie diore a great wav 
in the storm, when we wero first cast away She lay almost where she did 
at first, but not quite « and was turned, h} tihe force of tho waves and the 
winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ndge of heaohy, rough snnd, 
hut no water about her If I had^had hands to have refitted her, and to 


ROSINSOir CRVSOE. 

hove lamohed liet into flio water, tlie loai would have done well mongli, 
end I haye gone lack into the Bnunla wifli her easily onongh , lut 
I migM. haTO f oicsoon that I conld no more tarn her and set her npnght npon 
her bottom, than I coidd remove the island , however, I went to tho woods, 
and out levers and zoUen, and hronght them to the boat, resdving fa try 
whatl ootdd do, snggestmg to myself, that if I coeld hut turn her dow^ 

I miiriit repair the damage she had received, sad she would bo a very good 
boa^ and I might go to sea m her very oasdy 

I spared no pains, indeed, in thia peoe of fnulless toil, and spent, I 
Hnni, toa or four weeks about it, at las^ iindmg it impossible to heavo 
It up with my litQe strength, I fell fa diggmg away the sand, to undezmmo 
It, and so to maiirn it Ml down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and gmde it 
right m the fall 

But when I had done this, 1 was unable to stir it up agam, or to got 
rmAuf it, mroih less to movc it lonviiid towards tho water , so 1 was forced 
to give it over, and yet, though 1 gave over the hopes of the boat, my 
desire to ventnie over the main uureased, rather Hum decreased, os the 
means for it seemed impossible 

This at length put me upon thudong whether it was not possible to moke 
myself a canoe, or penagna, such as the natives of faose dimites mike, even 
without tools, or, os 1 mi^t say, without hands, of the trunk of a great 
tree This I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself 
extremely with the thoughts of makmg it, and with my havmg much more 
convemenoe for it than any of the Kegroes or Indians , but not at all oon- 
sidermg the paxbonlar inoonvemenoes which 1 lay under more than the 
Indians did, vu , want of hands fa move it, when it was made, into the 
water— a diffioulfymnoh border for me to sormount than all the oonsegnenees 
of want of todia could be to them , fin what was it to me, if when I had 
chosen a vast tree m the woods, end with mmdi trouble out it down, if I 
bad been able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into the proper 
shape of a boat, and bum or cut out the inside to make it hollow, so fa 
moke a boat of it— if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I 
found it, ond not be able to launch it mto the water P 

One would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon 
my mind of my cucumatanoes whfle I was makmg this-boat, but I 
have immedmtely thought how I should get it into the sea, but my 
thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over the sea m it, that I never 
onoeccnsideredhowlBhonldgetitoSof the land and it was really, m its 
owsi nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-fivo miles in sea, than 
abontforty-flva fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat m fl*o water ' 
I wont to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did, 
who bad any of his senses awake I pleased mjsolf with the 
nOmi dotonnimng whether I was ever able to undertake it , not but that 
the difficulty of launidung my boat come often mto mvhead, butlnut a stop 
to my mguines mto it, by this foolish aiiswar, i,luch I gave myself « let

medrstmalceii, I 'warrant I 'wiU find some wav or other to get it along when 
It 15 done” * 

This was a most prepobterons method , hnt the eagerness of my fanci 
provniled, and to work I wont I felled a cedar tree, and I question much 
nhother Solomon ever had sndh a one for the building of the Temple of 
Jerusalem f it was five feet ten inohes diameter at the lower port nezt the 
stump, and four feet doven xnohes diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, 
after whioh it lessened for anhxle, and then parted into branches It nas 
not without infinite labour that I foiled this tree, I was tuenfy days 
Inclong and hewmg at it at tiie bottom , I was fourteen more getting the 
branches and limbs, and the vast spreading head cut off, which I hacked and 
hewed through with axe and hatchet, with inexpressible labour after this, 
it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to something 
like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright ns it ought to do It 
cost me near three months moro to dear the inside, and work it out so as to 
makeon exact boat of it this I did, indeed, without fire, hy mere mallet and 
ohisd, and by the dint of hard labour, tiU I had brought it to he a very 
handsome penagna, and big enough to have carried six and twenty men, and 
consequently big enough to have earned me and dll my cargo 

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted with it 
The boat was really muoh bigger than ever I saw a canoe or penagna, that 
was made of one tree, in my life Many a weary stroke it had cost, you 
max be sure and had I gotten it into the water, I make no question but 1 
should have begun the maddestyoyage, and the most unlikely to he performed, 
that exor was undertaken 

But all my dexices to get it into the wafer failed me , though tiiqr cost 
me mfimte labour too It lay about one hundred yards from the water, and 
not more , but tiie first inconxenienee was, it was up hill towards the creek 
Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolxed to dig into the surface of 
the eartii, and so make a deohxify this I began, and it cost me a piodigions 
deal of pains (but who grudge pains that haxe &6ur delixerauoe m view ?) , 
but when this was worked through, and tins difficulty managed, it was sbll 
nmdi the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than I could the other 
boat Then I measured the distanocTof ground, and resolxed to cut a dock 
or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could uot bnng the 
cauoe down to the water Wdl, I began this work , nnd when I began to 
enter upon it, and calcnlnie how deep it was to he di^, how broad, how tho 
stuff was to he thrown out, I found tiiat, by the number of hnnds I had, 
being nono^^bat my oiwn, it must haxe been ten or twdxe years before I could 
haxe gone through with it , for the diore lay so high, that at the upper end 
it must hare been at least twenty feet deep ; so at length, fiiough with great 
rductanqy, I gaxe this attempt oxer also 

This gnei^ me heartily , and now I saw, though too late, the folly of 
hegummg a work heforo we count the cost, and before so judge ng^fly of 
cur own strength to go through with it , 



86 ROBINSON CRVSOE. 

In tilie middle of this 1 finished my fourth year in this place, and 
hept my annivereaty TFith the same devotion, and Vfith as much comfort as 
ever hefore , for, by a constant study and senons application to the "Word of 
God, and In the atsisHnee of Hia grace, I gamed a different knowledge horn 
what I had hefore I ontertamed different notions of things I looked now 
upon the world as a thing lemoto, whidi I had nothing to do with, no 
expectation from, and, indeed, no desires abont sn a word, I bad nothing 
indeed to do with it, nor was ever likely to have , so I thought it looked, as 
we may perhaps lot^ upon it hereafter, nr , as a place I had lived in, ^ but 
was come out of it , and well might 1 say, as leather j&braham to Dives, 

** Between me and thee is a great golf fixed ” 

In the first place, I was removed from all tbo wickedness of the world 
hero , I had neither the Insts of the flesh, the lusts of the oyo, or the jnide 
of Ilf e I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now capable of 
en]oying, I was lord of tho wbde manor, or, if I pleased, I might call 
mys^ king or emperor over the whole counic} which I had possession of , 
there were no nvals , 1 had no competitor, none to dispute sovereSgnty or 
Qommaud with tne I might have raised dap-Ioadmgs of com, but I had no 
use for it, so I let 08 little grow as I thought enough for my occasion I 
had tortoise or totilo enough, but now and then one was ns much os I could 
put to any use I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships , and I 
had grapes Chough to have made wine, or to have cured into xaisms, to have 
loaded that fleet when it had been built 

But all I could make use of was aU 'Giat was valuable I bad enougb to 
eat and supply my wonts, and what was oil ihq rest to me P If I killed more 
fibsh than 1 cohld eat, the dog must eat it, or Tormm , if I sowed more com 
than I could eat, it must bo spoiled , tho trees that I cut down w ere l}ing to 
tot on the ground , I could make no more use of them but for fad, and 
that I had no occasion for bnt to dress my food 

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to mo, upon just 
reflection, that all tiio good things of this world are no farther good to us 
than they axe lot cur uso , and that, whatever wb may heap up to give 
others, we mjoy just as much, as we can use and no more ' The most

mill to gnnd my com, nay, I would hsve given it all for a sixpenny-worth 
of turnip and carrot seed out of Dngland, or for a handful of peas and beans,

of all liTCB, 18 fhe most doBbtiste ol the fear el God, though hxs terroxs aie 
alvkays before them, I say, falling early into the eoafanng life, and into 
seahnng company, all that little Benae of religion aluch I had ont^amci! 

laughed out of me by my messmates, by a hardened despising ct 
dangers, and the Tiews of death, 'uhidh grew habitual to me , by my loii„ 
absence from all manner of oppoitnnities to oonvorsewith anything but what 
was liko mysdf , or to hear anything that was good, or tended towards it 

So TOid was I of everything lint was good, or of the least sense of what 
I was, or was to he, that, m the greatest ddivexancos I enjoyed— sudh os my 
escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the Portugueso master of the 
ship my bemg planted so w^ m the Bianls , my receiving the cargo from 
EngLind, and the like— 1 never had onoa the words, ** Thanh God,’* so mudi 
as on my imnd, or in my mouth , nor in 13ie greatest distress had 1 so much 
08 a thought to pray to him, or so mu<di as to say, ** Lord, haie mercy upon 
me* ** no, nor to mention the name of God, miless it was to swear by, and 
blaspheme it 

1 had terrible zoflcctionB npon my mind te many months, as 1 havo 
already ohserred, on account of n^ wioked and hardened life past , and uhen 
1 looh^ about me, and considered wbai pattumlar providences had attended 
me since my coming mto this ^ce, and how God had dealt hountifoU) with 
me— had not only punished me less than my iniquity hod deserved, hut had 
so plentifnlly provided for me-^this gave me great hopes that my repentance 
tvos accepted, and that God had yet mercy in store for me 

'With these refleohons, I worked my mind up, not onlj to a resignatiou 
to the will of God m the present disposition of my ciroumstanoes, but even 
to a sincere thanVfnlnoss for my eondition , and that 1, who was yet a living 
man, ought not to complain, seeing Ihod not the due punishment of my sms , 
that I enjoyed so many mexmes which 1 had no reason to have esr^eoted in 
that ^ace, that 1 ought never more to repme at my condition, hut to 
rejoice, and to give daily thanks for ^t daily bread, which nothing hut a 
crowd of wonders could have brought , that I oi^ht to consider I had been 
fed even by a miracLe, even ns great as that of feeding Bhjah by ravens, 
nay, by a long senes of miiaoles and that I could hardly havo a 

plaoe m the uninhabitable port of the norld where I could have been cast 
more to my advantage , a place where, as I had no Bomet}, whioh-nas my 
aiDiction on one hand, so I fonnd no ravenous beasts, no funons wolves or 
tigois, to ihxeaton my life , no venomous creatures, or poisons, wluidi I might 
feedon tomyhnrt, no savages to murder and devour me In awoxd, as 
my Ilfs was a life of sorrow quo nay, so it was a life of mercy , and 

I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able to makemj 
sense of God's goodness to me, and care over me in this oonditum, he my 
daily considaiion, and after I did make a just improvement of ^ese things, 
1 went away, and was no more sad I had now been here so long, that 
many things which I brought on diore for my hdp were miher quite gone, or 
very much wasted, and near spent

boat , the same day of the year I was horn on, txs , the 30th of September, 
that same day I had my hfe so miracnlonsly saved twenty-six years after, 
when I was cast on shore in this island, so that my wicked life and mj 
solitary life began both on a day 

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread, I mean 
the hisouit whidi I brought out of the ship, this I had husbanded to the 
lost degree, allowing myself hntone cake of bread a day for aboveayear, 
and yet I was quite without bread tot near a year before I got any oom of 
my own, ond great reason I bad to be thonkfol that I had anj at all, the 
getting it being, as has bean already ohserred, next to miraculous 

My dotiioa, too, began to deoay , as to linen, I hod had none a good 
while, except some chequered shirts which I found in the chests of the other 
seamen, and which 1 carefully preserved , because many tunes I could bear 
no other dothes on but a shirt*; and it was a very great hdp to me that 1 
bad, among all the men’s dothes of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts 
^niera were also, mdeed, several thick watcA-ooats of the seamen’s which 
were left, but thqr ^ure too hot to wear and though it is true that the 
weather was so violently hot that there was no need of dothes, yet I could 
not go quite naked, — ^no, though I had been indmed to it, which I was 
iiot , — nor could I abide the thought of it, thoiigh I was alone The reason 
why I oodd not go naked was, I could not hear ihe heat of tho sun so well 
when quite naked as with some dothes on, nay, the very heat freqnenth 
blistered my skin , whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself i^e some motion, 

whisilmg under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it No more 
could I ever hnng myself to go out in tho heat of the sun without a cap or 
ahat , theheat el thesnn, heating withsochTidence as itdoes m that place, , 
would give me the head-a^e presently, by dotting so directly on my head, 
without a cap or hat on, so that I could not hear it, whereas, if I pat on 
my hat, it would presently go away. 

Upon these views, I began to consider ahont putting the lew rags 1 had, 
which I called dothes into some order , I had worn out all the waistcoats

However, fhongb my Lttle pexi&gna was fimsbed. yet the sire of it was

the dzscovenes I made in that httie journey made me very e^ger to see other 
parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I ihou^t of notiiing but safluig

IV)t this purpose, tnat I nu^t do cvesytbing with discrerion and con-

some of fhe jdeccs oi the ship's sails wKch lay in store, and of which I bad 
a great stoifi: by me. Hanng fitted my most and soil, and tned the boat, I

gj ROBINSON CRUSOE 

Itxn» thoathof Naromber, in the nxth ym of xnymgn, or my cnpfiTily, 
vrhioh yon plewe, that I set ont on thui vonge, and I found it mucli longer 
than I expected , for though the island itself nras not Tcry largo, yet nrhon 
I came to tho east side of it, I found a great lodge of rocks lio out about tvo 
leagues into the sea, some above water, some under it, and boyond that a 
shoal of sand, lying dry half a longue more, so that I was obliged to go a 
great way out to sea to double the pomi 

'When first I discovered them, I was gmng to giro over my enterprise, 
and come hack, again, not knowing how for it might ohligo mo to go out to 
sea , and, above all, doubting how I should get hack agnm so I camo to on 
auehor, for I had made a kmd of on anchor wifli a pieco of a broken gtnp« 
pliwg which 1 got out of tho ship 

Havmg seoured my boat, I took my gun nnd went on shoro, dimhing up 
a h ^l^ , which seemed to overlook that pomt, where I saw the full extent of 
ity and resolved to ventuxe 

Tn my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a strong 
and, indeed, a most fanons enxrent, which run to the east, and oven came 
dose to the pomt , and I took the more notice of it, because I saw there 
might he some danger, that when I came into it, I might bo earned out to 
sea by the strength of it, and not be able to mi&e tbe idind again and, 
udeed, had I not got firrt upon this hill, 1 beliove it would have been so , r 
for there was the same current on the other ndo tho idand, onl> that it 
set off at a farther distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the 
diore, Bolhadnothingtodohuttogetoutof thefixstGUxxent,andl8hould 
presently he m an eddy 

I lay hero, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at 
E S E , and ihnt being ]ust contraxy to the current, made a great hreadi of 
^ the sea upon the pomt , so that it was not safe for me to keep too dose to 
the dioTP for the hreadi, nor to go too for o^ becanse of tho stream 

The third day, m the morning, tiio wind having abated overnight, tho 
sea wa* edm, and X ventured hut X m** a wanux^ to all xadi ig^onnt 
pilote , for no sooner was 1 come to the pomt, when 1 was not oven mv boat's 
length from the shore, hut X found mysdf in a great dqkth of water, and n 
onzTcnt like the dnice of a mill it earned my boat along with it with snoh 
vidence that allX could do could not keep her so nmoh as on tho edge of it, 
but X found it hnmed me farther and farther ont from the eddy, whidh wras 
on my left hand There wns no wind stixnng to help me, tmd dl 1 could 
do with my paddles signified noihmg and now I begin to give myself over 
for lost, fornstheennentwason both sides of flie island, I knew in a few 
lengnes distance thsy must ]om agam, and then I was irxecovorablv gone , 
nor did X BOO any possilnliiy of avoiding It, so that I had no prospect before 
me hut of pexishing, nokhythe sea, for that was calm eniwigh^ hut of siarnng 
&om hunger I ha^ mdeed, found a tortoise on the shoro, as big almost aa 
1 could lift, and had tossed It into the boat, and I had a groat ]iir of

out my hands to it, with eager wishes '*0 happy desert*’* said I, 
shall ncTcr seo thco more 0 miscnble creatoie* whithor am I goingP” 
Tlien I reproached mpelf with my unthankful temper, and that I had 
ropmed at my sobtaty condition ; and now what would Z give to be on shore 
tbero ng^in * Thus, we never see the trno state of out condition till it is 
illustrated to us b) its contnnes, nor know how to value wlmt wo en^oy, but 
by the want of it It is rcarcely possible to imagine the consternation I was 
now in^ being linven from my bdoved island (for so it appeared to me now to 
be) into the wide oocan, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of 
ever tecovezing it ogam IIoweveT, I worked hard till indeed my strength 
was almost exlmusi^, and kept my boat as mnbh to the northward, that is 
lowazds tho sido of tho current which the eddy lay on, as posdbly I could , 
when about noon, as tho enn passed tho meridian, I thought I felt a litdo 
breeze of wind m my face, springing up from 8 S E This cheered my heart 
a little, and espec»^\ when, iu about half an hour more, it Ucw a pretty 
gentle ^e B\ this time, I had got at a fnghtful distance from the island, 
nnd had the least doudy or ha^ weather intorrened, I had been undone 
another way, too ; i6r I bad no compasa on board, and should never have 
Known how to have steered towards tho island, if 1 W but once lost sight of 
it ; but tho weather continnmg dear, I ap^od myself to get up my mast 
agam, and spread mj sail, standing away to the north as mudi as possible, 
to get out of the current 

Just as I had set my most and sail, and the boat began to stretch away, 

I saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of tiie cnxxent was 
near; for where the onnentwos sostrong the water wis foul, but perceiving 
the water deir, I found the cnzxent abate , andpresentljlfoimdtotheeast, 
at about bdf a milo, a breach of the sea upon some rocks these rooks I 
found caused the ooxrent to pirt agam, nnd as the mam stress of it ran away 
more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by 
the repulse of the rooks, and made a strong eddy, which ran hack again to 
the north-west, with a very sharp stream 

Tho} who know what it is to have a zepneve bronght to them upon the 
ladder, or to be zesened &om thioves just going to mudor them, or who have 
been in snob estzomities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was, 
and how {^dly I put my boat into the stream of tiiis edda , and the wind 
also freshening, how gladlj 1 spread my sail to it, znnning cheotfdly before 
tho wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot 

This eddj earned mo about a league in my wav back again, direotly 
sowazds the island, hut about two leagues more to the northward than the «

^Taen I hod made Boxnethmg inoro than a leogne of 'vny hj tho help of 
Ous coirent or eddy, I found it irae spent, and sened me no farther 
Hower, I fonnd that being between tao great currents, nz that on tho 
foatii side, rluch had huiried me asray, and that on tho north, \?hich lay 
about a league on the other side , I say , between these two, in tho vraLo of 
the island, I found tbo water at Icist etiil, and running no way , rnd hhnng 
still a breeze of wind fair for mo, I kept on steezing directly for tho island, 
though not makmg suoh fre^ way as 1 ^d before 

About four o’clook m tho oienmg, homg then within a league of tho 
uland, I found the point el the rocks which occasioned this disaster, stretching 
out, as IS desonbod before, to the southward, and casting ofi tho eurxent moro 
Ecnthoily, hod, of conxso, made another eddy to the north , and (his 1 found 
very strong, hut not dtfcofly setting the way my oonrso lay, which was duo 
west, but almost full north However, hanngafr&idx galo, I siteiohed across 
this eddy, dantmg north-west, and in about on how came within about 
a mile of tho shore, where, it bemg smooth water, I soon got to land* 

'Whcnl was on dunre, I fell on my knees, grro ^d thahLjt for my

and refreshing mysi^ nth such things os I hod, I brought my boat dose to 
the diore, in a littte oo\e that I had spied under some trees, and laid mo 
down to sleep, hting quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the wovugo 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat, 1 hod 
run so much hazard, and know too much of the coso, to think of attempting 
It by tho way 1 went out, and wbat might boat the other side (I mean the 
west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any moro ventures so I 
resolved on the next morning to make my way westward along tho shore, and 

to see if ^eto was no erode where 1 might lay up my frigate in safety^ BO as 

to have her agam, if J wonted her ia. about three miles, or thcroabouts, 
coasting the diote, I came to a vary good inlet or bay, about a mile over

However, oveu though I knew it was fhe parrot, and that indeed it could

I found them oH stnndmgi and jet the bait eaten and gone * thSi iras 
diseonxaging Hoiireveri 1 altered mj traps ; and, not to trouble yon tnth 
particular^, Sotng onemonung toseo my traps, I found in tme of thema largo 
old be*g03t ; and in one of tho others, three kids, a male and tno females 
At to the old one, I knew not whit to do nith him • he was so fierce, 
1 durst not go into tho pit to him , that is to say, to bring him away alive, 
which was nhat I wanted; I could have killed him, but fiiat was not my 
bnnress* nor would it answer my end so I even let him out, and ho ran 
awny as if bo had been foghtoned out of hia wits But I (Si n^ then know 
what I afterwards learned, that htmgor will tame a lion If 1 had let him 
stay there throe or ferax dajs without food, and then have earned him some 
water fo dnnk, and then a littto com, he would have been as tame as one 
of the Lids, for they are mighty sagacious, traotable features, where thsy 
are well used 

However, for tho present I lot him go, knowing no better at that tune 
then I went to the three lads, and, taking them one by one, I tied them with 
strings together, and with some difficult} brought them all home " 

It was a good wlulo before the) would feed , but throwing them some 
sweet com, U tempted tiiem, and they began to be tame And now I found 
that if I expected to supply myadi with goats* flesh, when I had no powder 
or shot loft, breedmg some np tame was my only way, when, perhaps, I 
might have them aWt my house like a flock of sbeop. But, then, it 
oeenxred to me that I must keep the fame from the wild, or dsa they would 
always run wild when they grow up , and the only way for this was to have 
some enclosed piece of ground, wdl fenced eiflim with hedge or pale, to 
keep them in so eficetnnlly, that those withm might not break out, or those 
without break in 

" This was a great undertaling for one pair of hands , yet, as I saw there 
was an absolute neccssify for doing it, my flmt work was to find ont a proper 
pieco of ground, whore there was likdy to be herbage for them to eat, water 
for them to dnnk, and cover to keep them from tho sun 

Those who understand suoh endosuies will think I had very little con- 
trivance, when I pitdicd upon a plaoo vexy proper for all tiiese (bemg a 
plain open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our pecqple call it in the 
western colonies), whidi had two or three IitUe drills of fresh water in it, 
and at one cad was very woody,— I say, they will simlo at my forecast, 
when 1 diall tell them I began by endosing this piece of ground in such 
a manner, that mr hedge or pale mnst have been at least two miles about 
Kor was Ao madness of it so great as to the compass, for if it was ten miles 
about, I was liLo to have bme enough to do it m , hut I did not consider 
that my goats would be as wild m so mudh compass as if they had had the 
whole island, and 1 shoifld have so much room to dhase tiiem xn that 1 should 
never catch them* 

My hedge was begunland earned on, I behove, about fifly yards when 
this thought oconxzed to me , so I presently stopped short, and, for tho

in my mind to go down to the point of tho island, where, as I have said in 
my Lost xomhlo, I went np the hill to see how the shore lay, and how tho 
enrxent set, that I might see what I had to do , this inclination increased

I had a great high shapdess cap, made of a goafs sbn, with a flap 
hanging dowat behind, as well to keep the son from me as to shoot the ram 
ofi from running into my neck, nothing being so hnrtfal in these climates 
as the ram npon tho flesh under the dothes 

I had a short jacket of goafs skm, the skirts coming down to about the 
jmddle of the thigns, and a pair of open-kneod breeches of the same ; the 
breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hong down 
each a length on either sido, that, like pantaloons, it readied to the middle 
of my legs, stocLzugs and shoes I had none, but had made me a pair of

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


Uyl)eaxdl]uid once suffered to grow till itjm about a quarter of a yard 
long, but as I had both soissoxs and razors suilioiont, I had cut it pretty 
diort, except Trhat grow on my upper lip, which I had tnnuned into a largo 
pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks at 
Sallee, fw the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did, of these 
mousiaohiOB, or whiskers, I will not say the} wore long enough to hang m) 
hat upon them, but they were of a length and shipe monstrous enough, and 
such as in England would have passed for frightful 

But all this 18 by the bye , for, as to my figure, 1 had so lew to obsorro 
me, that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more of tiiat In 
this Innd of dress I went my new 3 oum 0 y, and was out fiye or six days 
I traveled first along the sea-shore, directly to the place where 1 first 
brought my boat to an anchor to get upon tlio rocks , and having no boat 
now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way to the same height 
that I was upon hdore, when, looking fdrward to the pomts of the rocki 
which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as is said 
above, I was surprued to see the sea all smooth and quiet, — ^no nppling, no 
motion, no current, any more there than in an} other places I was at a 
strange loss to understand tins, and xesolTed to spend some time in thoi 
observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it , but 
I WBS prosontly cannaced how rt was, vis , that the tide of ohb setting torn 
the west, and joining with the current of waters from some great nver on 
the shore, must he &e occasion of &u ooixent, and Umt, according as the 
wind Mew more fermhly from ihe west or from the north, this ouzzeni came 
nearer, or went farther from the dioxe , for, waitmg thenahonts till evening, 
I went up to the rook again, and then the tide of ebb being made, 1 plainly 
saw the enzzont ogam as before, only that it ran farther off, being near 
hidf a league from the shore, whereas in my case it set dose upon the shoro, 
andhum^me and my canoe along with it, which at another tune it would 
not have done 

This observation oonvinoed me that I had notbng to do hut to observe 
the ebbmg and the flowing of the tide, and 1 might very easily bring my 
heat about the island again , hut when 1 began to think of putting it in 
pzaohee, I had such tenor upon my spoils at the xememhiance of the 
danger I had been m, that I oodd not think of it again with any p^^tiouce 
but, on ihe oonbary, I took up another resolution, which was mm safe* 
though more labonouB,— end this was, that I would build, or rather make*

op mik the loxga earihea pota, of ^hioh I hare giren an aoeoiinf, and with 
fourteen or fifteen gro*tt baskets, which would hold fire or six bushels each, 
where 1 laid up mr stores of provisions, espeoiallj my com, some in the ear, 
off short from the stnw, and the other rubbed out with my hand 
As for my wall, made, os before, with long stakes or pdes, those piles 
grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so very 
muoh, that there was not the least appearance, to any one’s view, of any 
habitation bdmd them 

Near this dwdlmg of mme, but a little farther withm the land, and upon 
lower ground, lay my two pieces of com land, which I kept duly ooltivated 
and sowed, and whii^ dul> pelded me their honest in its season , and when- 
ever I had occasion for more com, I had more land adjoining as fit as that 
Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable plantation 
fiiere also , for, first, I had mr little bower, as I colled it, whidi I kqit in 
repair--that is to say, I k^t the hedge, which encircled it in, constantly 
fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing always m the inside I 
kept the trees, which nt first were no more than stakes, but were now grown 
Tery firm and tall, always out, so that they might spread and grow thick and 
wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which they did effeotuslly to my 
mind In tho middle of this I had mj tent always standing, ben^ a piece 
of a snil'spread over poles, set up for thot purpose, and which never wanted 
any repoir or renown^ , and under this 1 had made me a squab or couch, 
with iho skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and 
blanket laid on them, such ns belonged to our seo-beddmg, which I had 
saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me And here, whenever I had 
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, 1 took up my oountxy habitation 
Adjoining to this, I had my endosnios for my oattlo, that is to say, my 
goats ; and I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and endloso 
this gronnd I was so aimous to see it kept entize, lest the goats shonld 
break through, that 1 never left off hll, with infinite labonr, I had stneik the 
outside of tito hedge so fall of small stakes, and so near to one another, that 
it was rather a polo titan a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hind 
through between them, which afterwards, when those stakes g^w, ns they 
all did m the next xamy seison, made tiie endosnxe strong like a wall, 
indeed stronger than any wall 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, ond that I spared no pains to 
bnng to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support, for I 
considered the keepmg up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand would 
be a living magOEine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as long ns I 
lived in the ]^oe, if it were to be fqrty years , and that keepingthem in my 
reach depended entirely upon my pmf eoting my endosnros to snoh a degree, 
that 1 might be sue of keepmg them together, whioh, by this method, mdeod, 

I so effeotnally seonred, i^t when these little stakes began to grow, I had 
planted them so verv tiuck, that I was foxced to pnll some of them xtp again.

of the aaln-ltnd opposite, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and 
eitner driven hy the caxxents or hy eontnxy winds, had made the island, and 
had been on «hoie, bat were gone away again to sea , being as loath, perhaps, 
to have stayed in thu desolate island as 1 wonld have been to have had them. 

‘VTiiQe these reflections were piling in my nund, I wu reiy ftantfi.! is 
lay taonghts, that 1 was so happy as not to be thereabonfs at that tune, or 
that fhqr did not eee my boat, by which they wotdl have condnded that some

Then tcnible thoagbts raefc^ my imagination about their having found out

have them come again in greater anmhexs, and devour me : that if it sbonid 
happen that they should not And me, yet they would find my enclosure, 
deetxoy all my com, and casty away all my flock of tame goats, and I shoald 
pet!*h at last for mere want. 

Thus my feat banished all my rehgioas hope, all that former confidence 
vt God, wMch was founded upon aadi wonderful expenence os I had had of 
JEbs gwdnevs , as if He that had fed me hy miracle hitherto could not 
pteserro, by power, the provision which He had made for me by IHs

in t%TO mumtes* time ; this Trail 1 nras many a mazy month in finishing, and 
yet neicr thought injsdf safe till it Tras done 

'VTben this ms done, 1 stuek all tho gronnd mthont my Trail, for a great 
length erezy tia), as ioU mth stokes or sticks of the osior-Iiko mod, Trhioh 
I found so apt to grow, as thej could neli stand , insomuch, that I helzero I 
might set in near twenty fhonsand of them, loanng a pretfy huge space 
betneen them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and 
theymighthore so shelter irom tho young trees, if theyattemptod to approach 
my outer mil 

Thus, in two year*' time, 1 hid n thick groro , find in fire or rix yens’ 
time 1 bad a wood before my dwelling, growing so monsttonsly thick and 
strong that it wis indeed perfectly impa^ioie and no men, of what Lind 
soever, could ever imagine that there was out thing beyond it, much less a 
habitation As for the my which I proposed to myself to go in and out (for 
1 Jeir no mnuo), it was by sottug two ladders, one to a part of the rock 
wluch was low, and then broke in, ind left room to place onother ladder 
upon that; so when the two ladders were taken doivut no man hving could 
come down to mo without doing himself muciuef , aud if they had oome 
down, thi^ were shU on the outside of my outer wall 

liius 1 took all tho measures hnman ptodonce could suggest for my own 
preserraison , aud it will be seen, at length, that tho} were not altogether 
without just rcuon , though I foresaw nothing at that time more than my 
mere fear suggested to me y 

TThile this was doing, I ms not altogether careless of my other affairs , 
for I had a great ooncomupon me for my little herd of goafs they wexo 
not only a ready supply to me on erct) occasion, and began to be sufficient 
for mo, withont tho expense of powder and shot, but also without the fot^e 
of huniing after tho wild ones, and I was loath to lose the advantage of 
them, and to have them all to nurse up over again 

For this purpose, after long coneideratton, I coidd fhmk of but two Trays 
to preserro them one wras, to find another convement place to dig a Gave 
undor ground, and to drive ffiem into it every night, and the other Tras to 
enclose two or three httlolnia of land, remoto from one another, and as mndi 
concealed as I conld, whoro 1 might keep about half a dozen young goats in 
each plaeo , so that if any disaster happened to the flock in general, J might 
bo able to raise them again latb little tronblo and time * and this, though 
it would require a good deal of tune and labotur, 1 thonght was the most 
rational design* 

Accofdin^y, I spent some tune to find ont the most retired parts of the 
island , and 1 pitched upon one, wHoh was as private, indeed, oa my heart 
ecnld wish for, it wras a litilO damp piece of ground, m the middle of the

hoUdw and thick vooda, \ 7 h 9 ta, as is oluierFad, I almort lort myieli once 
before, enaeaTourmg to come back fliat^ffay from the eaatem part of ifbe

xemored tw yonng she-goats, and two be-goats, to tins pece , and, when 
they were there, I oontxnoed to perfeet the fence, itil I had made xt asseonre^ 
08 the other, which, however, I did at mcnw lei^, smd it took me np more 
time by a great deal All this labonr I was at the expense of, pmdy from 
m) apprehensions on the aeoonnt of the pnnt of a sum’s foot, for, as ye^ I 
hod ncrer seen any human ereatnre oomo near the ishind , and 1 had now 
lived two pm under tins nneasmess, winch, indeed, mode my bfe smeh less 
comfortable than xt was before, 00 n»y he well xmagmod by any who know 
what It IS to lire ut the constant snore of the fsar of man And this I xnnst 
observe, with gnel, too, that the duoomposnre of mymmd had great impres- 
sion also upon thoj^b^ons part of my thoi^hts, for the dx^ and taaor 
of fallmg into the hands of sarages and cannibals lay so upon my spinis, 

that I seldom fonndntpdfm a due temper lior application to my l^er, at 

least, not with the sedate oalnmess and resignation of soul which 1 was wont 
to do I rather prayed to Grod as under great affliction and pressure of 
snrrotmdod with danger, and m mqpectation every night of being murdered 
and devoured before uonnng , and I must testify, ftom my expenenoe, that 
a temper of peace, tbankfnlness, love, and oilechcs, is much the more poper 
frame forprajerthm tiuitd tezzorand discomposnte, and that under the 
dread of mischief impending, a man is no more &b hr a coxntorting perform-

the dtsoomposure of the nnnd must neoessanly be as great a disabilify as that 
of the bod), and mudi greater, praying to God being pti^erly an not of the 
mind, not of the body* ^ 

But to go cm after 1 had thus seonred one part of my httie liting stoek. 
I went about the whole ishmd, soarchmg for another pnvato place to mh£ 
snch another deposit, when, wandenng mote to the west point of fha

it was a boat or not, 1 do not know, hat as 1 descended ftom the hill 1 could

tdfheot a perrpeclire gUn m my pocket When I tras coma dovra the hill to 
tho end of the s^land, irhoio, inde^, I had never been before, I \ea8 piesenfly 
eonvincvd that tho seeing tho print of aman’s foot vras not endh a eirange thing 
in tho island as I imagined * and bnt that it vms a special providence that I 
na* ca^t upon tho ride of ihe inland Trhezo tho amges never came, I ritotild 
easily have knonm that nothing ins xnoto freqnent than for the canoes from 
tho sraui, 'nhen they happened to be a little too fax out at sea, to dioot over 
to tint side of tho ulasd for hirbonr liLenise, as they often met and fought 
m fhoir canoes, tho vietom, having taken any prisoners, v^onld bnng them 
over to this shore, vrhere, according to their dreadfol enstoms, being all 
eanmbals, they nodd kill and eat them ; of irUdli hereafter 

When I vras come dosm tho lid! to tho shore, as I said above, being ihe 
S W point of the island, I ivas perfectly confounded and amazed , nor is it 
po«tsiblo for mo to express the horror of xn} mind, at seemg the shore spread 
nnth eknlls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies ; and porticuhirly, 
I observed a place nbere fhexa hod been a fire made, and a oude dng in the 
earih, like a cockpit, vrhore I supposed tho savage wretches had aat down to 
thdr inbmnan feast mgs upon the bodies of tiioir fdlow-oreatnres 

I was 80 aslomshed with the sight of these things, that I entenamed no 
notions of any danger to myself from itfor a long while • allmy appiehensioiiB 
were bnned in the thonghts of sneh a pitch of inhmnanii hellish bmtality, 
and the horror of the degeneracy of human natnre, which, though I had 
heard of it often, jot I never had so near a view of before , in short, I turned 
away my face from tho homd ^eclaclo , my stomneh grew sick, and I was 
ynst at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from my 
stomach; and having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, 
bnt could not bear to stay in the place a moment , so I got up the hill again 
With all tho speed I conld, and w^ed on towards my own habitation 

When I came a httle out of that part of the island, I stood still awhile, 
asamared, and then, recovenng myself, I looked up with the utmost ofiection 
of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes gave God thanks, riiat hod 
cast my first lot in a part of tho world whore I was distxngniriied from snob 
dreadfd creatures as these; and that, fhongh I had esteemed my present 
condition very tmsorablc, had yet given me so many comforts in it that I had 
still more to give thanks for than to complam of and this, above all, that I 
bad, even m tbia miserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of 
and tho hope of His blessing which was a friicity more tbiin snffi- 
oicnily eqnivalont to nil tho misery which I had suffered, or conld suffer 
In this frame of thankfulness, 1 went home to my oa^, and began to be 
mnrii casiOT now, as to the safely of my cmsamstances, than over I was 
before, for I observed that these wrefehes never came to this idand in search 
of what they conld get , perhaps not seeking, not wantmg, or not expectmg, 
anything here, and having often, no doubt, been up in ihe covered, wo^y 
part of it, without finding anything to their ptuqpose. I knew I had been 
hero now almost eighteen yean, and never saw the least footsteps of human

entirdy concealed where 1 was, unless 1 found a hetier sort of creatures thah ’ 
eannibals to make myseli known to Tet I entertained such on ahhotrence 
of the saTage wretches that I haTO been speabng of, and of the wretched, 
inhuman costom of their devonnx^ and eatmg one another up, that"* I 
conhnued pensm and sad, and kept dose within my own circle, for almost 
two years after this when I say my own mrde, I mean it my three 
plantations, tiz , my castle, my eonntiy seat (which I called my howor),** and 
my enolosnre m the woods nor did I locdc after this fhr any other use than 
as an endiosare for my goats , fox theaTexsion which natnre gaveme to these 
helhsh wretches was sneh, ttmt I was as feaxM of seeing them as of seeing 
thedciil hunself I did not so mnidiasgoto look after my heat ell this 
time, hnt began rather to think of making another, for I eov^ not think of

me, Ifi^ I ahouli meet with some of those ereatoxes at sea in Which oase,if 
I is^ happened to havo fallen mto fheix hands, I Inew what would hare 
been my lot ' 

Tunc, however, and the satisftobon I had that I was in no danger of 
being dismeted these peo^e, began to wear oft my uneasiness about 
them, and Ibegan to lire ]ii&t m the same composed manner as before, only 
with this difterence, that I used more cantioii, and kept my ^es more about 
me than I did before, lest I shonld happen to he seen by any of them , and 
parhculaidy, 1 was more cautious of firing my gon, lest any of them, being 
on the isla nd , should happen to hear it It was, &erefore, a Tory good 
providence to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, «tftd 
that I hod no need to hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at t hftm ^ bnd 
if 1 did eatdi any of them after this, it was by traps and pugr e g , as I had 
done before so that for two years after this, I bebere X nerer fired my gun 
emee oft, tbongh I never went outwits and, v^t was more; as 1 bad

After I bad tima laid the scheme of my design, a:^ m my

people 'were offenders against me, and what right I had to engage in tiie 
quarrel of that blood whidi they shed promiscuously upon one another I 
debated this yexy often ‘with mjsdf thus ** How do I know what God 
hunsdf judges m ihiB parhoulax case? It is certain these peo;^e do not 
commit this as a cnme, it is not against their own oonsoiences xepronng, or 
their light reproaching them , thqr do not know it to be an offence, and then 
commit it in defiance of dmne justice, as we do in almost all the sms we 
commit They think it no more a crime to kiU a captiTO taken in 'war, than 
we^do to kill an ox, or to eat human fiesh, than we do fo eat mutton " 
When I considered tins a little, it followed necessarily that I was 
certainly in the wrong, that these people were not murderers in tiie sense 
that I had before condemned them m my thoughts* &ny more than those 
Christians were murderers who often pnt to death the prisoners taken in 
battle, or more freqnentlv, npon many occasions, put whole troops of men 
to the sword, without ginng quarter, though they threw down their arms, 
and submitted In the next place, it occurred to me, that although the 
usage they gaye one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was 
really nothing to me these people had done me no mjuxy tl^t if they 
attempted, or I saw it necessary, for my immediate preserratum, to foil 
upon tiiem, something might be said for it but that I was yet ont of their 
power, and they really hod no knowledge of me, and consequently no design 
upon me , and, therefore it could not be just for me to foil upon them , 
that this would Justify the oonduot of file Spaniards m all their barbanties 
practised in Amenca, where they destroyed millions of these people , who, 
however they were idolaters and barbarians, and bad sereral bloody and 
barbarons ntes in their onstoms, sadh as saenfieing human bodies to fheir 
idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very umoeent people, and that the 
rooting them ont of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhoxrence 
and detestation by even the Spaniards themselyes, at this time, and by all 
other Christian nations in Europe, as a mere butcheiy, a bloody and 
unnatural piece of cruelfy, unjustifiable either to God or man, and for 
which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be foightfol and temble 
to all peo]^ of humanity or of Ohnstian compassion , as if the kingdom of 
Spam were particnlarly exnment for the produce of a race of men, who were 
without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the 
miserable, which is reckoned tdbe a marl: of generoas temper m the mind 
These considerations really ]^t me to a pause, and to a kind of a full 
stop , and I began, by little and litfie, to be off my design, and to conclude 
I had taken wrong mc3:»ures in my resolntxfm to attatd: tiie sayages , and

laxgo, thit 18 to say, sufficient for me to stand npnght in it, and perhaps 
another vnSti me^ hat X most confess to yon that I made more haste out 
than I did in« 'when, looking ferther into the place, and which was perfectly 
dark, I sow two hroad ehining ^es of some creatore, whether deni or man 
1 knew'not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim 14[ht from the cave’s 
month shining directly in, and making the reflection However, after some 
pin^e, I recovered myself, and began to call myself a thonsand fools, and 
to think that he that was afraid to see the deni, was not fit to live twenty 
years in an idand all alone ; and that I might well think there was notinng 
in this cave that was more, frightfol than mysdf TTpon this, plndang 
my conxage, I took np a fixelmnd, and m I mshed again, with the ^ck 
flaming in my hand* Ihad not gone three steps in, befoielwas almost as 
mnch frightened as before ; for I heard a vexy loud s^h, like that of a man 
in some pain, and it was followed hy a Iroken noise, as of 'words half 
expressed, and then a de^ sigh again. I stepped hack, hnd 'was mdeed 
strnck with sneh a snrpnse tiint it pat me into a cold sweat, and if I had 
had a hat on my head, I will not mswer for it that my hair might not have 
lifted it ofi. Bnt still pluckmg np my spirits as 'well as I cohld, and 
enconraging myself a litfle with considexing that the power and presence of 
God wak everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forinird again, 
and by the light of the firebrand, holdmg it np a little over my head, I saw 
lying on the ground a monstrous, fnghtfdl, old he-goat, jnst making his 
as we say, and gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of mere old age 
I stirred him a little to see if I conld get him out, and he essayed to get np, 
bnt was not able to raise himself, and I thought 'with mysdf he might even 
lie there, ~for if he had fnghtened me, so he wonld certainly fnght any of 
the savages, if any one of them shonld be so hardy as to come in there while 
^ he had any life xn him 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when 
I found the cave was but verv smsSi , — ^that is to say, it might be about 
twelve feet over, but in no manner of sbape, neither round nor square, no 
hands havmg ever been employed in making rt but those of mere Katuxe. I 
observed also that 'Qiere was a ]^ace at the foxther ride of it that went in 
further, bnt was so low that it Teqmred me to eieqp npon my hands and knees 
to go into if> and wbifhet it went I knew not , so, having no candle, I gave 
it over for that tune, but resolved to come agam the next day provided with 
candles and a tinder-boi^ which I had made of the lock of one of the

degree, that I was obhg^ to shoot seroral of them at first, to keep them 
from devonring me and all I had , bnt, at length, when the two old ones I 
brought with me were gone, and after some tune conimnally dnvmg them 
^from mo, and lettmg them have no provision with me, thqr all ran wild into 
the woods, except tno or three favonntes, whidi I kept tame, and whose 
young, when they had any, I always drowned, and these were part of my 
family. Besides these I dways kept two or filuree household kids about me, 
whom I taught to feed out of my hand , and I hod two more parrots, which 
talked pxotfy well, and would all call ''Bobin Orosoe,’’ but none like my 
first, nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had done 
'Wifli lum 1 had also several tame sea-fowls, whose names I knew not, that 
I caught upon the diore, and oat thou wings , and the htile stakes wbdi I 
Ji&d planted hetoro my castle-wall being now grown np to a good thick grove, 
these fowls all lived among fiiese low trees, and bred there, which was very 
agreeable to me, — so that, as I said above, I began to be very wdl contented 
with VtxB life I led, 'if I could have been seeured from fiie dread of the 
savages /But it was otherwise directed , and it may not he amiss for all 
poq^o who shall meet with my story to make this jnst observation fiom it —

examples of thia'm ilie course of my unaoooimtahle life,— hut in nothing was 
it more partioulaTl} remartoLhle than in the oueomstanoes of my last years of 
Bobtaiy residence in this island 

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenly-third 
year , and this, bemg the sonthem solstice (for wmter I cannot call it), was 
the particular time of my harvest, and required me to be pretty much abroad ' 
in the fields, when, going'out early in the morning, even before it was 
fhorougb. daylight, 1 was surprised with seeix^ a light of some fire upon the

idaud where X had observed some savages had been, as before, and not on the 
other aide,— bnt, to my great ai&otion, it was on my side of the island 
' I was indeed tcxnbly surprised at tiie sight, and stopped short withm my < 
grove, iBot daring to go out, lest I might be surpnsed , and yet I had no 
more, peace withm, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in 
xambiing over the ishind, should find my com standmg or cut, or any of my 
works and improvements, thqr would immediatdy condlude that there were

me espeeinlly os^ going down to ibe shore, I could see the marks of horror 
vhich the dismal TOkrk they had been about b*id left belmid it, m , the blood, 
the bones, and port of the flesh of himtin bodies eaten and devoured hy those 
vrtetches mfh memment and sport I vras so filled vath indignation at the 
nght| that I now begin to premeditate the destmotion of the nest that I saw 
there, let thm he wnom or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that 
the visits which ther made tans to this islpnd were not very fceqnent, for it 
was ibove fifteen months before any more of them came on ^ore fhere again, 
~that is to say, I neither saw them nor any footsteps ox signals of them in 
all that time ; for as to the xamv seasons, then ihej axe sore not to come 
abroad, at least not so far, yet all this while I hved nncoiBfDrfably, by 
reason <^f the constant apprehensions of their coming npon me by mupriss, 
from whence I observe, thit the expectation of evil is more hitter than the 
snihsxing, c^eciallyif there is no room to shake ofi that e^ctation, or those 
apprehensions 

Snemg all this tune I was in the nmxdexxng hnmonr, and spent most of 
myhonrs, which shonld have been better employed, in contriving how to 
eixcnxnvcnt and fell npon them the very next time I shonld see them, — 
especially if they shodd he divided, ns thev were the Inst tune, into two 
parties ; nor did 1 consider at nil that if I killed one party— si^pose ten or a 
dozenr-I was still the next dav^ or week, or month, to kill another, and so 
aiiotaer, even ad uinniium, till I shonld be, at length, no less a murderer 
than they were in being mnn-eatetb — and perhaps mndi more so. I spent 
my days now in great pe^exitv and anxiety of mmd, expecting that I should 
one day or other fsU into the hnnds of these merciless creatnies; andifldid 
abany tune Tenlnre abroad, it was not without looking zoned me with the 
greatest care and caution imaginable And now I found, to my great com- 
fort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of goab» for 
I durst not iqioa any account fire my gun, especioOr near that side of the 
idand where they nsu^y came, lest I diould alarm the savages , and if they 
had fled from me now, I was sue to have them come again with perhaps two 
or three hundred esnoes with them m a few days, and then I knew what 
to Gi^ect However, I wore out a year and three months more before I ever 
saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I diall soon 
ob’^erte It is true thev n^ght have been there once or twice; hut either 
t fheymndenostay, orat leastldidnotseeihem, but, in the month of Slay, 
as neu asl could calcnlrte, and in my fou-and-iwenuefh jear, 1 had a vexy

of one of my fdlow Chnstians would have heon to me But it wasnotio ho , 
either their fate or mine, or both, forbade it, for till the last year of my 
being on this island, I never knew whether any were saved out of that ship 
or no, and had only the affliction, some days after, to see the coi^e of a 
drowned hoy come on riiore at the end of the island which was next the 
shipwreidc He had no clothes on hat a seaman’s waistcoat, a pair of open- 
kneed Imen drawers, and a hlna Imen shirt , hnt nothing to diroct me so

two pieces-of-eight and a tohaGoo-p*pe — the last was to me of ten tunes more

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out m my boat to

that there might be yet some livmg oreatore on board, whose life I might not 
only save, hntmigh^ by savmg timt life, comfort my own to the last degree; 
and this thought dung so to my heart that I could not he qmet night or &ay, 
hnt I must venture out m my boat on board this wreck, and committing the 
rest to God’s providence, I ihought the impression was so strong upon my 
mmd thit it codd not he resisted, that it must come from some invisihle 
direction, and that I dionld he wantmg to mysdf if I did not go , 
Under the power of this impression, 1 hastened back to my castle, 
prepoxed evetyihmg for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a gre^ pot of 
fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of mm (for I had still a great 
deal of that left), and a basket of raisms , and thus, loading mysdf with 
everythmg necessary, I went down to my boat, got Ihe water out of her, got 
her afloat, loaded all my cargo m her, and tnen went home again for more 
My second cargo was a great hag of nee, the nmhreilla to set up over my

hni small, if any little galo of mnd shooid rise, I shonld be mentahly lost 
These thonsdits so oppressed xny mind, that I began to give over mj 
enterprise ; and having hauled my boat into a litde creeh on the shore, 
I stopped out, and nt down npon a nsing bit of gronnd, very pensive and 
anxions, between fear and desiiv, about my voyage pwhen as I was mnsmg, 
1 conld perceive tnat the tide was turned and the flood come on; npon 
nu^cb, mr going was impnoRnaldc for so mini hours Upon this, presently 
it occurred to me, that I shonla go up to the highest piece of ground I could 
find, and observe, if 1 could, hou the sets of the tide, or cnxrenfs, lay when 
the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was dnven one way out, 
I might not expect to be driven another way home, with the same xapidi^ 
of the emrents Tius thought was no sooner m my heid thin 1 cast mr eje 
upon a little hill, which sufllcicntlj overlooked the sea both ways, and from 
whence 1 had a deir view of the currents, or sets of the tide, and which w*iy 
I wus to guide myself in my return Here I found that as the current of ehb 
set out do^e bj the south point of the isl ind, so the current of the flood set in 
do^e by tbe shore of the north «ide , and th^t I had nothing to do but to keep 
to the north side of the idand in my return, and 1 shouU do wdl enoi^h 
llhconrDgcd with this observation, I resolved, the next morning, to set 
out with the first of the hdo ; and, reposing mysdf for the night in mv canoe, 
under the great watdmioat I mentioned, I launched ont I first made a 
Ltile ont to •c«i, full norOi, till I began to fed the benefit of the current, 
wluch set eastward and which earned me at a great rate; and yet did not so 
hurt} me as the cunent on the south side had done before, so as to fake 
from me all government of the boat ; but, having a strong steerige with my 
piddle, I went, at a greit rate, directly for the wreck, and in lees jthan two 
hours I came up to it It was a dismd sight to look at the ship, which, 
by its building, was Spanish, stu& fast, jammed in between two rocks all 
the stem and qnarter of her were beaten to pieces by the sea ; and as her 
forecasfle, wlu^ stuck lu the rocks, had run on with great violence, her 
mainmast and foremast were brought by tbe board, that is to say, broken 
sbortofi; bnt her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm 
Whan I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me oomiiig, 
jdped and cried ; and, as soon os I called lum, jumped into the sea to come 
to me 1 took him into the boat, hut found him almost dead with hunger 
and thirst I gave bun a cake of my bread, and he devonxed it like a 
ravenous wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow I then gave 
the poor creature some fresh water, with which if I would have let him, ho 
would have burst himsdf After tins I went on board , bnt the first s^ht 
I met with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship, 
with their arms fast about one unothor I concluded, as is indeed probable,

into the boat, without examining what was in them Had the stem of the 
ship been fixed, and the forepart broken oS, I am persuaded I might haTe 
mniin fi good voj^e ; foT, by what I found in these two chests, I had room 
to suppose the ship 1^ a great deal of wealth on board, and, if I may guess 
from the eouxse she steered, she must have been bound from. Bnenos Awces, 
or the Bio de la Plata, in fhB south part of America, heyond the Biasils to 
the Havannah, m the gidf of Hemeo, and so perhaps to Spam She had, no 
doubt, a great treasure m her, but of nonse, at that tim^ to anybody, but 
what heeame of the crew I then knew not 

I found, besides these dhosts, a little cask full of liquor, of about twenty 
gallons, whuh I got mto my boat with nmeh difficnlty ^ere were sevend 
muskets in the cabm, and a great powder-hom, with about four pounds of 
powder m it as for the muskets, 1 hod no occasion for them, so I left them, 
but took the porder^hom I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted 
extremely , as also tao little brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, 
and a gndiron , and with this cargo, and the dog, 1 came away, the fido *

1 reposed that night m the boat , and m the momir^ 1 resedved to harbonr 
what I had got in my new cave, and not cany it home to my castle After 
refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began to exanune ihe

we bad at the Bmsils , and, m a word, not at all good , but when 1 came to

sweetmeats, so fastened also on the iopihat the salt water hod not huxtthem , 
and two more of the same, which the wafer had Spoiled. I found some very

the feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two

were not like onr English shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what 
we call pumps than shoos I found in this seaman’s chest about fifty pieces- 
of-eight, in nals, hut no gold I suppose this bdonged to a poorer man than 
the other, whidx seemed to bdong to some officer T^dl, however, I lugged

1 had brought from our onn ship, hut it was a great pity, aalsaid, that the

Havrng nowhiought all my things on shore, and secured them, 1 went 
hack to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, 
where I hud her up, and made the best of my way to my dd habitation, 
where I found everything safe and quiet. I began now to repose myself 
live after my dd fa^on, and take care of my fpnulyafiaizs; and for awhile 
I lived easy enough, only'that I, was more ngilant than I used to he, looked 
out oftonor, and did not go abroad so ..muoh , and if, at any time, I did 
atir with any freedom, it was always to the east part of the island, where 
I was pretty wdl satisfied the savages never came, and where I oould go 
withont so many precantions, and suoh a load of anus and ammunition as 
I always earned with me if I went the other way. I lived in this condition 
near two years more; bui my unlucky head, that was always to let me 
know it was bom to make my body miserahle, was all these two yean filled 
with projects and designs, how, if it were possible, I might gei away from 
this i^nd for, sometimes I was for making another voyage to the wreck, 
though my reason told me that there was nothing left there worth the hazard 
of my voyage , sometimes for a zamUe one way, sometimes another and J

ttus one • Jlov infixutely good that Providence is, Trhxch has pronded, in its 
gotemment of mankind, such naxxow hounds to his dght and knowl^ge of 
things , and though he 'walbs in the midst of so many thonsand dangeis, the 
dght of vrhich, if discovered to him, vronld distract his mind and smk his 
spirits, he is ke]^t serene and calm, by having the events of thmgs hid from 
his i^es, and kaovong nothing of dangers 'nhieh snironnd him 

iLfter these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I oame to leflect 
SGTionriy upon the real danger I had been in for so many years m this T613 
island, and how I had walked about in tho greatest seonnty, and vath all 
posriblo tianqniUify, oven when perhaps noflnng hut the brow of a hill, a 
great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been between me and the 
worst kmd of destmohon, viz that of follmg into the hands of cannibals 
and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view as I would on 
a goat or a turtle , and have thought it no more onmeto kiU and devour me, 
than I did of a pigeon or a curlew. I would unjustly dauder mysdf, if I 
s'&ould say I was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose 
singuIaT protection I aoknowledged, with great humihty, all these unknown 
ddivenmces were dn^ and without which I must inentahly have fallen into 
thdr merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some tune token up 
m eonsidenng the nature of ihibsa wretched creatures, I mean the savages, 
and how it came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of all things 
should give up any his creatures to such inhum'imfy, nay, to sometZiing 
so much hdow otou brutality itsdf, os to devour its own kmd hut os this 
ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it ocouned to me to inquire, 
what port of the world these wretches lived inP how &r off the const was 
ikom whence they came? what th^ventuxed over so for &om home for P what 
kind of boats th^hndP andwhyl m%;ht not order myself and my busmess 
so, that I might he os able to go over thither, as th^ were to come to me P 

I never so much as tzouUed myself to consider what I should do vnth 
mysdf when I went thither , what would become of me if I fell into the 
hands of the savages; or how I should escape them zf they attacked me , no, 
nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and not be 
attacked by some or other of them, without any possibility of ddivenng 
mysdf and if I should not fall info thrir hands, what I shoidd do for 
provision, or whither I diould bend my coune* none of these thoughts, I 
say, so much as came in my way ; hut my mmd was whcdl} bent upon tiie 
notion of my passu^ over in my boat to the mam land I looked upon my 
present condition as the most miserable that could possibly he. that I was 
not able to tiixow myself into anythis^ but death, ffiai could he called worse ; 
and if 1 reached the diore of the main, I mi^t perhaps meet with rehef, or 
I nught cdast along, os I did on the Afncan diore, fill I came to some 
inhabited countxy, and where I m^ht find some x^ef; and, after all, 
perhaps Inught Mi in wiQi some Gtosban ship that nught take me in; 
and if the worst came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an end

to aQ these miseries at once. Pray note, all this *was the fimit of a disturbed 
mind, an impatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by the long 
contmiuince of my troubles, and the disappointments I had met in the ■wreck 
I had bten on board of, and where I had been so near obtaining what I po 
cmestlr longed for, somebody to speak to,und to learn some knowledge 
from them of the ^ace where I was, and of the probaUb means of my 
dehmance I ■was agitated wholly hyfhese thoughts , all my cahn of mind, 
in nuT resignation to Prondcnce, and ■waiting the issno of the dispositions of 
Heaven, seemed to ha suspended , and I had, as it were, no power to turn 
mv thougnts to anything hut to the pnqect of a voyage to the mam} which 
came upon me with snch force, and such on impetuosity of desure, that it was 
not to ^ resisted. 

MThcn this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such 
■nolence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as if 1 
had been in n fever, merel} with the exfzaozdinar) feirour of my mmd about 
It, Isature, as if I bad been fatigued and exhausted with the very thoi^hts 
of it, threw me into a sound sleep One would have thought I should have 
dreamed of it, hut I did not, nor of anythmg xelatuig to it but 1 dreamed 
that as I was gomg out in the monung os usual, from my castle, I saVnpon 
the chore two canoes and eleven savages, coming to land, and that th^ 
brought with them another savage, whom they were gomg to kill, m order 
to evt hen, when, on a sudden, savage that they were going to kill 
jumped away, and ran for his life , and 1 thought, m my deep, that lie 
came running into my little thick grove before my fortification, to hido 
himsdf , and that I, seeing him nlono, and not perceiving that the others 
sought him that wav, showed mvself to him, and smiling upon 
tnenuxaged him that he kneeled down to me, soemmg to pray me to assist 
him« upon which I showed him my ladder, made him go up, earned 
hini mto my cave, and he hceame my servant and that as soon as I had got 
this trvn, X said to myself, ** Now I mav oertainl} venture to the mam land, 
for this fellow *will serve me as a pilot, •md will tell me what to do, and 
whither to go for provisions, and whilher not to go for fear of bting 
doioured ; what places to venture into, and what to shun *• I waked with 
this thought and was under such mevprcssihle impressions of joy at the 
piMfcct of mr escape in my dream that the disappomtments wMdi I felt 
T^on coming to mjsclf, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were 
cquall} extiavagaut the other waj, and threw me mto a very great dcnection 
s£ cjiinto 

Upon this, hovcver, I made this conclusion; that my only way to go 
about (o att«r-pl an escipe was, if pos<iblo, to get a savage into my possession , 
and, 11 poscH le, li should be one of their pnsoners, whom they hod oondetnned

now, Tiz that fhose men were enemies to my life, and would derour me if 
they could; that it was self-prescnution, m the highest de^ee, to deUrer 
myself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence as mudi 
as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like , I say, though these 
things argued for it, yet the thoughts of diedding human blood for my 
ddiTeianceweore Tcxyiernhie to me, and such aslcohld bynomeansxecondle 
myself to for a great while Howerer, at last, after manj secret disputes 
with myself, and after great pexplemhes about it(f 6 r all tiiese arguments, 
one way and another, struggled m my head a long time), the eager pxeTniling 
desire of ddirerance at length makered all the rest; and I resolTed, if 
possible, to get one of these savages into my hands, cost what it would, hly 
next thmg was to contnre how to do it, and this indeed was very di&cult to 
resolve on , but as I could pitch upon no prol^ible means for it, so I resolved 
, to put myself upon the watch, iosee them when th^came onshore, and leave 
:the:i^ to t)ie event, taling such measures os the opportimity should pr^ent, 
let what woiddbe 

« 'With these resolutions in my thoughts, I sat mvsdf ivpai the scout as 
often as possible, and indeed so often, that I was heartzly tired of it , for it 
was above a year and a half that I waited ; and for great part of that time 
went out to the west end, and to the soufh-west comer of the idand almost 
every day, to look for canoes butnone appeared ThiswasvexTdiseouxaging, 
and began to trouble me much, though I cannot say that it did m this case 
^ (os it had done some tune before) wear off the edge of my desire to the fhmg, 
but the longer it seemed to bo delayed, the more eager I was for it * in a 
word, I w 08 not at first so careful to diun tbe sight of tiiese savages, and avoid 
being seen by 'them, as I was now eager to be upon tiiem. Besides, I ftmoled 
mvsdf lUe to manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to 
moke thorn entirdy slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to 
prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt Itwas agreat while 
that I pleased mysdf with tins affiur , but nothing still presented itself , all 
my fancies and schemes came'io not^g, for no savages came near me for a 
great while 

About a year and a half after I entertained these ^notions (and bT 
musing had, as it were, zesdved them all into nothing, for want of an 
occasion to put them into exeentum), X was surpxised one morning hy seeing 
no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and the^ 
people who belonged to them all landed andjmt of my sight Thenumberof 
them broke all mv measures ; for seeing so many, and knoxnng that tney 
always came four or six, or sometimes more m a boat, 1 could not tell what

two canoo^ till at lost, with great difficnUy, 1 found he meant it mast he in a 
large boat, as h% as two canoes This part of Fnday’s dxseonxse 1 began to 
rdish very well , and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one tune 
or other, I xn^ht find an opportnniiy to make my escape from this ^ce, and 
that this poor savage might be a means to help me 

Sunngthe long time that Fndayhad now been with me, and that he began 
to speak to me, and understand me, I was sot wnntuxg to lay a foundation of 
reli^ous knowledge in his mind, parbcnlarly I aAedhimonetimo,who]iuide ^ 
him. The poor creatuxe did not understand me at all, but thought I had asked 
himwhowashis&ther bntltookitnp by another himdle, andadcedhim, who 
made thesea, Ihe ground we walked on, ai^ the hills and woods He told me. 
It was one Benamnckee, that lived b^ond all , ” ho conld descnbe nothing of 
this great person, but that he was very old, much older,” hesaid, ^^thanthe 
sea or the land, thnn the moon or the stars ” I aakedhimtheni if this old person 
hadmado all things, why did not all things worship him P He looked very grave, 
and, with a perfect look of umocenco, said, ** All things say 0 to hmii” I asked 

hmijifthepeoplowhodieinluscoanttywentawayfligwhezeP Heseid, <<Yes, 

they all went to BenamuckeO.” Then I asked him whether those th^ eat ixp 
went thither too? He said, Yes ” 

From these ihihgB, I began to instmot him m the knowledge of the true 
Ood. I told him that the great Maker of all things lived 15 there, poinfang ^ 
up towards heaven , that He governed the world by the same power and 
providence by which Ho made it, that He was ommpoient, and oouH do 
everything for ns, give everythii^ to ns— take everything from i» , and thus, 
by degrees, I opened hia eyes He listened with great atteniiOD, and recOTrf 
With pleasure the notion of Jem Christ being sent to redeem ns, and of tho 

manner of making our prayers to God, and His being able to hear

him explam it to me, their religions, or clergy, and that they vent to say 0 
(so he called saying prayers), then came hack and told them vhatHena- 
xnnekee said By this I observed, that there is pne&terafi even among the 
most blinded, Ignorant pagans in the vodd , and the policy of making a secret 
of idigion, in order to preserve the venexaiion of the people to the deigy, is 
not only to be found in the Bomon, but, perhaps, among all rebgions in the 
vorld, even among the most bmtish and Sharons savages 

I endeavonred to clear np this fraud to my man Bnday , and told him that 
file pretence of their old men going np to the monntains to say 0 to their god 
Bcnamnckee vas a cheat , and fixeir bringing void from fhcnce vhat he said 
vas much moro so , that if they met vifii anr ansver, or spake tnth any one 
thei^ it most be vith an enl epmt and then I entered hclo a long discourse 
vxihhim ahont the devil, the ongin of him, his rebellion against God, hm 
enmity to man, file reason of it, hu sethng himself np m the dark parts of 
the vorld to be vorshipped instead of God, and as God, and tho many strata- 
gems he made use of to delude mankind to their nun, hov ho hod a secret 
access to onr passions and to onr affections, and to adapt his snaxes to onr 
indmafaons, so as to causa ns even to he onr ovn tempters, and nm npon onr 
destruction onr ovn choice 

I found it vas not so easy to impnnt r^ht notions in his mind ahont fiie 
deni as it vas ahofnt the hemg of a God natnie assisted all mr azgnments 
to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause — on ovenruli^, 
governing Powers— a secret directing Providence ; and of the eqmty and 
justice of pavmg homage to Him that made ns, and the like, but them 
appeared nothing of this kind m the notion of an evil spint; of his ongm, 
bis bemg, his natnie, and, above all, of his mchnation to do e^, and to draw 
ns m to do so too and the poor creature puzzled me once in sneh a manner,

better than I could from an island forty milos oS the shore, alone, and without

and told him I would give him a boat to go back to his own nation , and, 
accordmgly, I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other side of the 
ishmd, and having cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk m water), 1 
brought it out, showed it him, and we both went into it. J found he wes a 
most dexterous fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost as swift 
again os I could. So when he was in, I soid to him, "'Well, now, Friday, 

‘ shall we go to your nation?'’ He looked very dnllatmy sapagso , which it 
seems vras because he thought the boat too small to go so far. I then told him 
I had a bigger* so the neztday I went to the place where the first boat lay 
whiehl hod made, hut which I conld not get mto the water He said that 
was big enough hut then, as 1 had taken no care of it, and it had lam two

Upon the whole, as I found hy all his disooniso a settled aff^cfaon to me,

desire to go to own country was laid m his ardent affection to the pcc^le, 
and his hopes of my doing fhi^ good , a thing whudi, as I had no notion of 
mysdf, so I had not the least thought or intention, cor desure of undertaking 
li Bui ^aSI a stsoag attempting my escape, founded 

on the snpposiiion gatheied trom the disocuxse, that there were seventeen 
bearded men there , and therefore, withont any more ddav, I went to work 
with Fndav to find out a great trM proper to f^, and make a largo penagna, 
or canoe, io undertake the vi^ge There were trees enough in the udand to 
have bmlt a little fleet, not of penagnas or canoes, but even of good laige 
vess^ , but fhe main thing I looked nt was, to get one so near the wafer that 
wo might launch it when it was made, to avoid the tni« t^lce I commitfed at 
first. At last, Fnday pitched a tree, for I found he knew much hetfer 
than I what kind of wood was fittest for rb, norcan I tdl, to this day, what 
wood to call the free wo cut down, except that it was very hke tho tree we call 
fustic, or between that and the Kicoragna wood, for it was mneh of the same 
colour and smell !Ekiday wished to bum the hollow or cavity of this tree 
on^ to mike itlor a boat, but I showed him how to cutxt with tools, which, 
afte I had showed him how to use^ he did vary handily, and m about a 
month^B hard labour, we finiabed it and it very , eternally, 

when, with our axes, winch I showed hmi how to handle, we cut and hewed

indeed, moat of them were so However, I found two pieces, which appeared 
pretty good, and with these I 'went to work , and with a great deal of poms, 
ond awkwo^^atitchmg, yon may bo sure, for 'want of needles, I at length mode 
a three-cornered i^ly thing, like what we call in England a ahouldor-of- 
mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a httle short spnt at the top,

to manage, as it was such a one as I hod to the boat in which I made my 
escape from Barharj, ns related in the first port of my story 

Iwas near tno months porfomung this lost work, viz ngging and fitting 
my mast and^sails; fori finished them very complete* making a small stay, 
and a sad, or foresail to it, to assist if we should tuxn to windu aid, aud'ubat 
was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stem of her to steer with I was but 
a bungling shipwnght, yet as I knew the usefulness, and even nocessify of 
such a thmg, I iqpphe^ myself with so much poms 'to do it, that at lost I 
brought itto puss, though, considering the many dull contrivances I had for 
it that failed, 1 tlunk it cost me almost as much labour as mabng the boat 
t After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what belonged 
to the navigation of my boat, for, though he knew very wdl how to paddle 
a canoe, hb knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a rudder , and 
was the most amazed when he saw me work tho boat to and agam m the 
sea by the rudder, and how the soil gibhed, and filled this 'uay or that 
'ivay, OB tho couzso we smled changed, I say, when he saw this, he stood 
hko one ostomdied and amazed However, with a little use, 1 made all 
these things familiar to him, and he become on expert sailor, except that 
of tho compass, I could make him understand very little On the other 
hand, as ftere 'was very ^little dondy weather, and seldom or never any 
^ fogs m those ports, there 'was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the 
sion were always to he seen by night, and the shore by day, except m the

water mark, 1 made my man l^day dig a httle dock, jnst big enough to hold 
her, and jnat deep enough to give her water enough to float in, and then, 
when file tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the 
water out, and so she lay dry aa to the tide from the sea* and to keep the 
ram off, we laid a great manybonghs of trees, sotbic^ihatsbe wasas wdl

the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of pronaions, being the

iho dock, and launch out our boat I was bu^ one monimg upon something 
of this l^d, when I called to Friday, and bid him to go to the sea-sbote^ and 
see if he codd find a tuztla or tortoise, a thing which wo generally got once a 
week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh. Enday had not been long 
gone when he came running back, and flew over my outer wall, or fences like

by my glass, that there were ono>8nd>twcnty saTsges, three pnsonois, and 
fhnes canoes , and that their whole bnsmess seem^ to be the tcxnmphoni 
banquet upon these three human bodies; a barbarons feast, indeed* but 
nothing more than, as I had obserred, was nsnol with them. I obsetred 
also, that they had landed, not where they had done when Friday made his 
escape, hni nearer to my creok, where the shore was low, and whm a thick 
wood came almost close down to the sea This with the abhorrenea of the 
inhuman errand these wxetdies camo about, filled me with snch Midig natum

In this fit of fny I divided the arms wbieb I bad obaiged, as before,

upon bis ebohlder, and 1 took one pistol and the other Area gnns myaelf , and 
in this posture we morohed out Itooknsmall bottle of mm in my pocket, 
and grro Friday a large bag with mote powder and huUets , and os to orders, 

'l chflxged him to keep cl^ behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do

he did with great swiftnesS} and then gituig him my musket, I sat down 
mysdf to load aU the zest agam, and bade them come to me when they 
wonted. 'While I was loading thm pieces, there happened a fierce engage- 
ment between frie Spaniard and one of the sarages, who made at him with 
one of their great wooden swords, the weapon that was to have lolled him 
before, if I h^ not prevented it The Spaniard, who was os hdd and bxaTe^ 
as codd he imagme^ thoogh weak, had fonght the Ihdiiin a good Whfle^ 
and had eat two great wounds on ^ head, bat the savage hdng a stoat, 
lusty^frUow, dosmg in with him, hod thrown him down, being famt^ and 
was wnngmg my sword oot of bis hand , when the Spaniard, though mider- 
most, wisdy quitting the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, dioi the 
saTage through the body, and lolled him upon the spot^ before I, who woe 
running to hdp him, co^ come near hinu ^ • 

Friday, bemg now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches. With 
no weapon m his hand bat his hatchet , and with that he despatdied those 
three who, as I said before were wounded at first, and fallen, and dl the 
rest ho could come 19 with and the Spaniard coming to mo for a gan, I 
garo him one of the £owling»pieces, with which he pnzsned two ot the 
sarages, and wonnded them both, bnt^ as he was not able to run, they 
both got from him mio the wood, where Fnday pmsoed them, and killed 
one of them, bat the other was too nimble for him, and tbongh be was 
wounded, yet hud plunged bimself mio the sea, and swum with all his might 
oil to tho*^ two who were left m (ho canoe, which three in the canoe, with 
one wounded, that we knew not whether he died or no, were all that escaped 

oat haud« 0! ono-and-iwen^ The account of the whole is as follows 

three killed at our first ^ot from the tree, two lolled at the next shot, 
two killed Fnday in the boat, two killed by Fnday of those at fim 
wonudod; one Joned by Fnday in the wood, three killed by the Spamurd, 
four killed, being found dropp^ bexo and Ihete, of the wounds, or killed by 
Fnday m his chase of them , fonr escaped in (he hoa^ whereof one wounded, ^ 
if not dead— twenty one in all. ^ 

The*** (hat were in (he canoe worked hard io get out of gonahot, and 
though Fnday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he hit 
ary of inetn Xnday would fain have had tno take one of their canoes, * nd

baflo Friday lollcnr xno , but >rlieu I x^na in tho canoe, I xma enipiued to 
find another poor oreatmo lio fhexe, hound hand and foot, as flio Spaniard 
vas, for tho elanghlor, and almost dead mth fear, not knowing what was 
fho matter $ for ho had not been able to look up orer the aide of the boai^ 
he was tied so bard neck and beds, and had been tied eo long, that he had 
> really but btUo Lfo in him. 

I uumediotcily out the twisted daga or rashes, which they had bound him 
with, and would haro helped him np , but he could not atand or apeak, but 
g*t>aned most piicoudy, hdienng, it seems, still, that he was only unbound 
in order to be killed. TThen Friday came to him I bode him qieok to him, 
and tell him of hia ddirexanco , and pnlling out my hottle, made him give 
the poor wxofoh a dram , which, with the news of his hemg ddiTo^, 
xemed him, and ho aat up in the boat But when Fnday came to hear 
him speak, and look in his face, it would hare moved any one to tears to 
ha%o Been how Friday kiasod him, embraced him, hogged him, cned, laughed, 
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung i then cned again, wrung hia hands, 
heat Hb own faeo and head , and then aung and jumped about agam, like 
a distracted creature It wos a good while before I could make hm qpcak 
tome, or fdl mo whnt was flie matter, but when he came a htOe to bini^, 
ho told me that it was hia father. 

' It IS not COB} for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy and 
fihal affection hod worked in this poor savage at the sight of hia fiither, and 
of hia bemg delivered from death, nor, indeed, can I deaenbe half the 
extravagances of his affection after this , for he went into the boat, and out 
of the hoo^ a great many tunes when ho went m to him, he would nt down 
by him, open his braost, and hold his father’s head olose to his bosom for 
many minutes together, to nonnsh it, then he took his arms and ankles, 

^ winch were munhed and staff with the bindmg, and chafed and tabbed them 
wifhhiB hands, ond I, perceiving what the case was, gave him some mm out 
of my botUe to rub ffiom with, uhich did them a great deal of good 

This ftffnir put an end to our pnismt of the canoe with the other savages, 
whoworenowalmost out of sight, and it was happy for us that wo did not, 
for it blow 80 hard within two hours after, and before they could be got a 
quarter of their way, and eontmned blowing so hard all night, and that from 
, fho norih*-west, which was against thorn, that I could not suppose their boat 
could live, or that they ever readied their own coast , ^ 

But to jotnrn to Fnday , he was so busy about his fatW, that 1 conld 
not find it in my heart to take him off for 'aome time , but I thought 
ho could leave him a little, 1 called him io me, and he came jumping 
and loughing,"and pleased to the highest extreme, then I odeed hrm if he 
bad given his father any broad. He shook his head, and said, None, ugly 
dog cat all up adf.” I then gave^him a cake of bread, out of a little pouch 
I conied on piuposo , I also gave him a dram for himself, ‘^bnt ho wonld not

fben 1 spoke to the Spaniard to lot Friday help him up, if bo could,

hard too , so he brought them both safe into our creek, leaving them in 
tbe boat, ran awario fetch the other canoe As he passed mo 1 ^ko to

Um, and asked him thither he T^ent He idd mOi “ Go fefioli moze boat ” 
so away ho wont like the wind, for suxo never man or hoxse xan like him , 
and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by 
land| so he wafted me over, and then went to help onr new guests out of 
the boil^ which he did , hat they were nather of them able to walk, so tiiat 
poor Fc^y knew not what to do 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and oaDiiig to Friday to 
bad them at doirn on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kmd of 
hand-banow to lay them on, and Fnday and I earned them both up together 
upon it between ns 

Bat when we got them to the outside of onr wall, or foxtifioahon, we 
were at a wone loss than before, fee it was impo^ible to get them over, and 
I wis resolved not to break it down, so I set to work agam and Fnday 
and I, in about two hours* time, made a very handsome tont^ covered with 
old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, beix^ in the qiace without 
our outward fence, and between that and fbe grove of young wood which I 
had plmtcd, and here we made them two beds of such things as I had, m , 
of good nce-straw, with blankets laid upon it^ to he on, end another to cover 
them, on each bed 

Hy lalond was now peopled, and I thought mysdf verynoh in subjects, 
and it was a merry refleotian, which Z frequently made, how like a long I 
looked First of ill, the whole country was my own property, so that I had 
an undoubted nght of domimon Secondlj, my pooide were perfectly snb- 
jeeted I was absolutely lord and law-giver they all owed their lives to me, 
and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been occasion for for 
me It wns zemarl^ble, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of 
three diiforent robgions my man Fnday was a Protestant, his fa&er was a 
Fagan and a canmbal, and the Spaniard was a Papist However, I allowed 
hberty of conscience t^ughont my domimons — But Bus is by the way 

As soon as I bad secured my two weak, rescued pnsonera, and given them 
shdter, and a ]|^e to rest them npoh, I began to think of m^ng some 
provision for them and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take a 
yoarhng goat» {betwist a bd and a goat, out of my paitumlar flock, to bo 
killed , when I cut off the hinder-quarter, and chopping it into small pieces, 

I set Fndqr to work to boiling and stewmg, and made them a very good dish, 

I assure yon, ef flesh and broth * and as I cooked it without doors^ for I made 
no fire within my inner wall, so I earned it all info the new font, and havxi^ 
set a table there for them, I sat 'down, and ate my own dmner also with ihem, 
and, as wdl as I conld, cheered them and enconriged them Fnd«gr was toy 
mteipreter, especially to his father and, mdeed, to the Spaniard too, for the 
Bpamard qpoke the language of the savages pretty well 

After we had dmed, or rather sipped, I ordered Fnday to toko one of the 
canoes, and go and fetch our mulcts and oBier fire-anns, which for want of 
tune,, we had left upon the place of battle, and, tbe next day, loideredhim 
to go and bnzy the dead bodies of the savage^ which lay open to the son, and

good oik, uoar tiro feet brond^ flurfy*fiTO foot long, and from two indies to 
four inches thiolc: irhat prodigious labour it took up, any one maj irni^no 

At tho aaxno hmoi I roninved to increase my liUlo flock of tame goafs as 
mndi as 1 conld , and, for this purpose, I made Fnday and tho Spaniard go 
out ono di}, and myself lafh Fnday the next day (fox uro took onr toms), and 
hr tht« means 'iro got ihout tirenty young kids to breed up mth the rest , for 
irhcncrer wo shot tho dam, ire saved the bds, and added them to onr flock. 
But, aboTo all, tho reason for curii^ the grapes coming on, I censed snoh a 
prodigions quintUy to he hung np in tho sun, that, I hekeie, had ire been at 
Alieint^ where the raisins of tho sun are onrod, wo could have filled sixty or 
eighty baneb; and these, with our bread, fotmod a great part of our food- 
very good hung too, I assuro yon, for th^ are exceeding nonnshing 

It was now harvest, and our crop m good ordor it was not the most 
plcntifnl incrciso I had seen m tho island, hut^ however, it was onongh to 
answer onr end; for^, from twon^-two bushds of harl^, wo brought m and 
thrashed out aboro two hundred and tirenty bosheb , and the hko in proportion 
of the rice, which was itoro onongh for onr food to the next honest, though 
all tho sivfm Spaniards had been onshore with mo , or, if we had been ready 
for n voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to have corned 
UB to any part of tho world, that is to say, any part of Amenca liThen we 
had thus housed and secured our maganno of com, we feU to work to ind.e 
more wieker*ware, nz , great baskets, in which ire kept it , and tho Spaniard 
ims very bindy and dexterous at this port, and often bbmed me that I did not 
make some tiungs for defence of this bnd of work , but I saw no need of it 

And now, hnving a full supply of food for all the guesfs I eiqpected, I gave 
the Spaniard leave to go over to the mam, to see what he could do with those 
ho had left behind him there. I gave hima stnot charge not to bring onyman 
with him who woifld not first swear, in the presence of himself and the old 
savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the person ho dionld 
find in tho island, who was so bnd os to send for them m order to their 
ddiverance; but that thqr would stand by bun and defend him against all such 
attempts, and wherever they went, would be ontirdy under and subjected to 
his command, and that tlm shodd be put in writing, and m^ed m their 
hands How thoy wore to have done this, when I biew fhi^ hod neither pen 
or ink, was a qneshon wboh we never asked. Under these instructions, the 
Spaniard and the old savage, tho faflier of Fnday, went away in ono of the 
Cannes which thoy might be said to come in, or rather ware bzdnght in, when 
thoy came as pnsonors to bo devoured by tho savages I gave each of them a 
musket, with a firdook on it, and about eight charges of powder and boll, 
ohorgmg them to ho very good hnsbands c< both, and not to use either of 
them hut upon nigont oecnsionB

than before, as yon thU see presenOj, I had not kept myself long in this

to thrust in ai^ for the convenience of kmdmg, however, as they did not come 
quite &r enough they did not see the little inlet where I fonnedy landed my 
rafts, bntnmfhidr boat on dioxe upon the beach, at about half a ™le from 
mo, which was \ecy happy for me , for othorwiee they wonld have landed jnst

perhaps hpve plundered me of all I hid When they were on shore, 1 was folly

Batch, hot it did not prove so , there were in all eleven men, whereof three of 
them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought^ bound, and when the first 
four or five of tiiem were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the 
boat, es prisoners * one of the three I could perceive using the most passionate 
gestures of entreafy, affiichon, and despair, even to a kind of extravagance, 
the other tvTo, I codd perceive, lifted up their hand sometimes, and appeared 
concerned, indeed, but not to such a degree as the first I was perfectly

iJl this while I bad no thought of what the matter really was, but stood 
trembling with the horror of the sight, eiqieoting every moment when the

it presently occotted to me that in a bttlo while the dup*0 exow, wondenng 
what xm become of their ooxnrades and of tho boat, wonld ccriamly come on 
shore in their other boat to look for them, and that then perhaps they might

this, I idd bim the first thing we had to do was to etare the boat, which lay 
upon the beach, so that the) might not cany hot ofl^ and tslong emylhing

wenton board, took tho arms wbieh were left on board onto! her, and what- 
ever dse we ionnd there,— whieh was a botflo of brandy, and another of mm, 
a few hisomt-cales, a horn of powder, and a groat lamp of eugnr in a piece 
oanvas (tho anger was five or six pounds) , all which was very welcome to 
me, especially tho brandy and sugar, of nhiohlhad had none left for many years. 

'When we had earned aU these things on riiore (the oars, most, sail, and

They had not been long put off with the boat^ when we percaved t h e m all

This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss what to do,

Terr uneasy, wnen, ^ter long consultation, we saw them all start up, and 
maxdi down towards the sea: it seems they had such dreadM apprdensions 
of the danger of the phee, that they resohed to go on board the ship again, 
giTD thdr companions oTer for lost, and so go on with their intended Tojage 
with the ship. 

As soon as I percidrod them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be as 
it resll} was, that they hadgxren orer tbeirseacch, and were going hack agam , 
and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the 
rpprchensions of it bat I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them

Upon tbs. Will Atfans cried out, “For God’s sake, ci^tain, give me quarter,

and presently fiie captain rephed, <*Tdl hu Ezcdlem^ I am jnst ooming.^

to pnt it in execution the next mommg But, in order to execute it with 
mote art, and to be seonre of success, t told bun we mnst divide the prisoners, 
ondthathesbonldgoandtake Atbirs, and two more of the worst of them, 
and send them pimoned io the cave where the others lay. This was com* 
nutted to Friday and ihe two men who came on shore with tiie captain They 
convoked Biem to the cave os to a prison and it was, indeed, a dismal place, 
especiaUy io men in fheir condition The others I ordered to my bower, as I 
called it, of which Ihavo given a full desmption and as it was fono^ in, 
and ibiq puuoned, the place was secure enough, oonsidenng they were npon 
their bobavionr 

To these m the motmng I sent the captain, who was to enter into a parley 
with them, in a word, to try them, and teQ me whether he ihonght they 
might be inistod or not to go on board and snxpnse the ship He talked to 
thorn of the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to, and that 
ibongb the governor had gives them quarter for tteir lives as to the present 
action, yot that if they were sent io England, they would aQ bo hanged in

Any one may guess boi readily snch a proposal would be accepted by men

With (he deepest imprecations, that they wonld be faithful to him to the lost

udstanta, and that tha goTomor would ke^ the ofiier tfro; and ike fiixae 
ihai were sent pxieonere to the oaatlQ (my cave), as hostages for tho fidehtj of 
those five $ and that if they proved unfaitiifiil in the execution, the five hostages 
should be hanged id ehai^ ahve on the shore. This looked severe, and con- 
vinced theniiihat the governor was in eaniest, howevtr, thqr hod no way left 
them but to accept it , and it was now the hui^esB of the pnsoners, as much 
as of tho captain, to persuade the other five to do tfieir,du<y 

Our strength wos'now thus ordered for the expedition first, the caplain, 
his maio, and passenger second, then the two prisoners of the fint gang, to 
whom, having tiieir eharocter from the captain, I had given their liberty^ and 
trusted them with arms thud, the other two that I hod kept till now in my ^ 
hower pinioned^ hut, on the captson’s motion, ,had now released ionxth, 
these five rdeased atlast, so that fh^ were Mlvo in all, besides five we 
k^i prisoners m the cdvo for hostages 

1 asked the eaptsin if he was willing to ventare with these hands on hoard 
thoehip, but as for me and my man Fn^y, I did not thmk it was proper for us 
to stir, having seven men left behind , and it was emplo}m6nt enough for us 
to keep them asunder, and supply them with nctnola. As to the five in the 
cave, 1 resolved to ke^ them bast, but Fnday went in twice a day to them, to 
supply Ihem with necessanos and I made other two oorzy provmons to a 
certam distanco, where Fnday was to take it 

When I ehowod myself to tho tuo hostages, if whs with the captain, who 
told them I was the person the govomor had ordered to loqk after them; and 
*thit it was tho governor’s pleasure ihej should not stir anywhere hut by my 
direction, that if ih^ did, they would be fotohed into the castle, and be laid 
in uunS * so that at wo never suffered them to see mo os governor, I now 
appeared as another pereon, and qsoke of the governor, &e gamson, tho 
* easile, and the like, upon all occasions 

captain now had no difilcalty hefore him, hut to funnsh his two 
hoots, stop the hroadi o£ one, and man them Ho made his passeuger 
captain of one» with four of the men, and himself , his mate, audfivemore, 
went in the other, and they contrived their business very well, for ih^ oame 
up to tile ship about midnight As soon as th^ came within call of the ship, 
he made Bobinson hail them, and tell thorn fh^ had brought off tho men a^ 
the boat, hut that it was a long time before ftey hod found them, and tho 
like, Tudding them in a ohat till they eame to the ship’s itide; when the 
oaptnm the mate entenng fixs^ with theii arms, immediately knocked

nAd captain lay, wbo, haTuig taken the alann, had got npi and \nfh two 
men and a hoy hod got fire-anna in their hands, and when the mate, with a 
crow, ^ht open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among 
them, and wounded the mate with a mnshet baU, whioh broke hia aim, and 
wounded two more of the men, bat killed nobody The mate cal ling for help, 
mshed, howerer, into the roand-honBe, wounded aa he was, and, with hu 
pistol, shot the new captoin through the head, the bullet entemig at hia mouth, 
and came out again behind one of his eare, ao that he nerer spoLe a word 
more npon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, wi&out 
any more bres lost 

As soon as the chip waa thus secured, ffie captain ordered seren guns to ho 
fixed, which was the aignal agreed cpon with me to give me pohoe of his success, ' 
which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, havmg sat watching upon 
the shore for it till near two o’clock m the morning Having thus heard 
the Dgnal plainly, I laid me down, and it havn^ been a day of great faf^ne' 
to me, I d^t very sound, till I was surprised with the noise of a gun, and 
presently starting np, 1 heard a man me by the name of ** Govetnor 1 
Governor \ and presenlly I knew the captam’a voice, when dimbmg up to 
the top of the hill, there he stood, and, pomtmg to Ihe ship, he embraced me 
in his nmis “ Hy dear fnend and d^verer,” says he, ** &ere^s your ehqi, 

fox she 18 bH yours, and so ore we, and all that hdongtoher ” I cast my 
eyes to the sHp, and them die rode, withm little more ball a mile of 
the shore, for thqr had weighed her anchor os soon as thqr were masters of 
her, and, the weather bemg fair, had brought her to an anchor jnst against 
the month of the bttle cxedc , and, the tide being np, the captain had hronght 
the pinnace in near .the ]^lace where I at first landed my xtdia, and so landed 
lust at my door iWas at first ready to sink down wiffi the surprise , for 1 
saw my dohveranco, mdeed, visibly put into my hands, all thing s easy, and a 
la^ehip lustrcadytocanymeaway whither I pleased to go At first, for 
somfi time, I was not able to answer him one word , hnt as he had token me 
m his arms, I held fast by him, or I aboiild base fallen to the ground Ho 
perceived the surprise, aud immediately pulled a bottLo out of his pocket, aud 
gave mo a dram of eora*!!, which ho 1^ brought on purpose for me 
X had drank it, X sat down upon the gronnd , nnd though it brought me to 
mys elf, yet it was a good while before I could spook a word to him this 

timo the poor man was in as great an ecstacy os I, onlynotunderony surprise 
as I was , and he said a thousand land and tender things to me, to uompoae 
and bring me to myself but sneb was the flood of in mybreas^ that it 
put nil my ^to mto confusion at last it broke out into tears , and, in a 
hitio while after, I recovered my speech I then took my turn, and embraced

as a roan sent from Heaven to deliver me, and ihai iho whole toansoetion

a trildctaew, and m such n desolate coaditioo, but from vhoai every dehver-

'Whea we had talhcd a while, the eaptua told aie he hod brought me

' that had been so long hu nuisieta had not jdunder^ him of Upon he 
coiled idond to the boat, and bade his men bring the fha^ ashore that were 
for the governor , and, indeed, it was a present as if 1 had been one that was 
not to ^ carried away with them, but as if I had been to dwdl upon the 
island sfaQ Post, he had brought me a case of bottles fall of Ariwllant 
cordial waters, six largo bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts 
each), two pounds of exodlent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship’s 
beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about aa hundred weight 
of biscmt, he also brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of 
lemons, and two bottles of lime>}aice, and abundanee of other tbmgs But 
besides those, and what was a tiionsond times more useful to me, he brought 
me dx new (^n shuts, six very good neekdoths, two pair of gloves, one pair 
of dioes, a hat, and one pau of stookings, with a very good smt of dothes of 
his own, which had been worn but very little in a word, he dothed me from 
head to foot It was a very kind and agreeaMe present, as any one may 
imagine, to one in my Gironmstanees ; but never was ai^ihing mthe world of 
that kind so nnplcaaant^ awkward, and nnea^ os it was to me to wear anoh 
dothes at first 

After these ceremomos were passed, and after all hu good Hungs were 
broi^ht into my litflo apartment^ we began to oonsnlt what was to be done 
with the pnsimfira we h^ , for it was worth oonsidexuig whether we might 
venture to take them away with us or no, especially two of them, whom he 
knew to he inoomgible and refractory to the last degree , and ^ captain 
said ho knew they were such rognes that there was no obhging them, and if 
ho did eotty them away, it most he m irons, as malefiiotors, to be ddiveted 
over to jnsbee at the first Snghsh colony he cohId come to , end I found that 
the captain himseU was very anxious about it. Upon thu, I told bun that, 
if he dossed it, I would undertake to hnng the two men he epoke of to make 
It their own request that he should Aeave them upon the isli^ *' I dionld 
be very glad of thot,” says the captain, “with ell my heart” “Wdl,”

I "was fho same pcxson tvIlo took np the land for the plantii^ the end planta-

Kerer ifas eajihtng more honontable than the pzooeedixigs upon this 
promuahon ; for in less than ae^en months I zeeeived a large padkei from the 
Borrivors of my tnistees, the merchants, for whose account I went to sea, in 
which were fiie following particular letters and pq^era enclosed 

fkst, there was the account-current of the produce of my farm or planta- 
tion, from the year when their frfhere had balanced with my old Pmtugal 
captain, beang for ox years, the balance appeared to be one thousand one 
hundred and sevenly-fonr moidores in my favour. 

Secondly, fhme was the account of four years more, while fiiey the 
efidets in their hands, before fiie government claimed the adnum^xaiion, as 
bmng the effects of a person not to be found, which fhqr called mvil death ; 
and the balance of fi^ the value of the plantation increasing, amounted to 
mnctecoi thonsand four hundred and forty-six crusadoes, bei:^ about three 
thousand two hundred and f orfy moidores 

Thirdly, there was the Bnor of St Angnstme^s accounf^ who had received 
fho profits for above fonrieen years, but not being to account for what was 
disposed of fho ho^ital, very honestly deda^ he had eight hundred 
and sevenfy-two mmdores not dmtnbnted, which he acknowledged to my 
account* as to fiie ku^^spaii^ that refunded nothing. 

There was a letter of my partner's, cougxatiilating me ve^ affectionately 
upon my being ahve, pvmg me on account how the estate was in^rove^ 
and what it produced a year, with the parhculars of the number of squares 
or acres that it contained, how planted, how many dares there were upon 
it' and ,«»alang two-and-twenfy crosses mr blessings, tdd me he had said 
somany AceJUanos to thank ^ Blessed Yii^ that 1 was ahve; mnimg 
me very passionately to come over and take possesion of my own , and, in 
the mean tune, to give him orders to whom he should ddiver my effects, if 
I did, not come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his frienddiip, 
and thaVof hisfai^y, and sent me, as a present, seven fine leopards* skins, 
which he liad, it seems, received £ 1 ^ Afrira, by some ofiier ddp that he 
had sent thifher, and which, it seems, hod made a better voyage than I 
Ho sent me also five ehesfs of oxcdlent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of 
gold uncoined, not qmte so large as moidores By the same fleet, my two 
mcieLant-trubte^ slnpped me one thousand two hundred diesfs of sugar, e^hf 
hundred rolls of tobacco, and ihe xert of the whole aoeonnt m gold 

I might wdl soy now, indeed, fimt the latter end of Job was better than

a wind from the Pyrenean mountains so very keen, so seveidy cold, as to be 
mtolontble, and to endanger benumbmg and penshing of our dngeis and toes 
Poor Ftidoy was xeall} frightened when he saw the mounfams all co\ered 
with enow, ond^lt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before in 
his life To mend the matter, when hve come to Fampelnna, it contmued 
snowing with so nnuJi violence and so long, that the people said winter was 
come before ifs tune , and the roads, whii^ were diftciilt before, were now 
quite impassable , for, in a word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us 
to travel, and bemg not hard frozen, as is the case m the northern oonntnes, 
t there ivas no going without bemg in danger of bemg buned ahve every step 
'W'o stayed no less than twenty days at Pompduna , when (seemg iho winter 
> eomingon, and no likdihood^ its bemg better, for it was &6 severest winter 
all over Europe &at hod been known in the xaemozy of man) 1 proposed that 
we should go away to Fontarabia, and there toke sluppmg for Poidoaux, 
which was a very httle voyage But, while L was oonsidcnng this, there 
come in iohr French genUemen, who,, having been stopped on the French side 
of the passes, as wa were on the bpam^, had found out a gmde, who, 
tFavexBing the country near tiie head of Languedoc, had brought them over 
the moimtaos by such ways that Hxej were not miuh insominoded with the 
snow, for where th^ met with snow in any quantit}, they said it was frozen 
hard enough to bear them and their horses \7e sent for this guide, who told 
ns he would undertake to cany us the some way, with no hazard from the 
snow, provided we were armed sufSmeiitly to protect onrsdTe& from wild 
beasts, for, he said, in these great snows, it was frequent for some widves to 
diow &einselves at the foot ^ the mountains, being made tavenons for want 
of food, the ground bemg covered with snow 'W‘e told him we were wdl 
enough piquu^ for such oreaiutes as they were, if he would ensure t» from a 
land of two-legged wolves, which, we axe told, we were in most danger from, 
especially on the French side of the mountains vHo satisfied us that there 
was no danger of tiliat kind in the way that we were to go, so wereadily 
agreed to follow us aid also twelve other gentlemen, with their servanto, 

' some French, some Spam^, who, as I said, had attesq^ to go, and were 
obliged to come .back again ^ 

Aocordmgl), we set out from Bmipeliina with our guide, on the Ifith of 



tSg ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

KoTember , and, indeed, T "was surprised, ^hen, instead of forward, he 
came ditecUy back with ns on the same road that we came firom Hadnd, 
about twenty miles , when, haTing passed two nrers, end come into flie plain 
country, we found oursdres in a warm chmate agoin, where the country was 
pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a euddon, turning to bis left, he 
approached the mountains another way , and though it is true tho bills and 
precipices looked dreadful, yet he made eo many fours, sudi meanders, and 
led ns I7 BQch winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the ^ 
monntains withont heing much encumbered with the snow , and, all on a 
sudden, he showed us tho pleasant and frnitful provinces of Lai^edoo snd 
Gascony, all green and flonnshing, thosgh, indeed, at a great distonce, and 
we hod some rough way to pass stiU 

'We were a liMe uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day 
ard a nightso fast thatwe could not travd, hut he bid ns he easy, woshonld 
sifon be past it all we found, indeed, that we b^an to descend eroty day, and 
to come more north than before , and eo, dependmg upon our guide, we went on 

It was about two bouts before mght, when, our guide being something 
before us, and not }nstin sight, out rushed three monstrous wobes, and after 
11 cm n Imv, fma a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood two of the wolves 
inode at the guide, and, had ho been far before us, he would have been 
devoured before wo could have helped him , one of them testened upon his 
boTse, and the other attacked tho man wi& such vicdence, that he had'not 
time or presence of mmd enough to draw his psfol, but hallooed and oned cat 
to ua most lustily My man Fnday bemg next me, I bade him nde up, and 

what was the matter As soon as Fnday came in sight of the he 
halloood out as loud asihoother, “0 mastori 0 master’ ” but, like ahold 
fellow, rode directly up to fho poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf 
that athicked him in the head 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Fnday ; for, having 
been used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon 11™^ but 
wnitclcADupiohimandriiothim, whereas any other of us would have fired 
Li a farther distance, and have perhaps cither missed the wolf, or endangered 
shooting tho man 

But it was enough to have ioxxified a bolder man than I , and, indeed, it 
alarmed all our complny, when, vnfh the noise of Fnday»a pistol, wo heard 
on both sides tho most dis m al howling of wolvos, and the redoubled by 
the echo of tho mouutems, appeared to us os if there had been a prodigious 
umber 0! them, and pcrliapti there was not such a few as that wo hod no 
can*0 of apprehension however, as Fnday had killed tlua wolf, tho other 
that had fosteacd upon the homo left him immediately, andlled, withonfrdoing 
him aoy danngc, hanng happily fastened upon hu head, where the bosses of 
the hricBo had alaek in hu teeth But the man was most hurt} for tho 
createt had bit him twice, once tn the ann, and the other timo a little 
above bis knee , and though he had made some dcfonco, he was just tnmhllng 

down ty the dxsordor of his horse, when Fnday anno up and shot fho wolt

Friday had di^gaged the poor gude, though we did not presently discem 
what land of creatnre it was he had killed 

Sat never was a fight managed so hardily, and in snch a smpnsmg 
manner, as that which ioHowed between Fndaj and the bear, whioh gave ns 
all, though at first we were snrpnsed and afraid for Inm^ the greatest drveiaion 
imaginable As the bear is a heavy, dnmsy creatme, and does not gallop'as 
the woUt does, who is swift and hgh^ so he has two pnihenlar gnalitie^ 
whioh generally are the nde of his aotums fiis^ as to men, who are not his 
proper pi^ (lu does not nsnaUy attempt them, except they first attack 
unless he he excesdvely hungry, which it is probable might now be the case, 
the ground being cove^ with snow), if yon do not meddle with him, he will 
not meddle with you; bat then yon most take care to he very eivfl to Tum, 
and give him the road, for he IS a very mce gentleman, he will notgoastep 
ont of his way for a pnnce , nay, if yon ate reaQya&md, your best way m to 
look another way and ke^ gomg on, for sometimes if yon stop, and stand 
Bhll, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an aSront , hut if yon throw 
or toss onythmg at him, and it hits him, fhongh it were hot a btof shdcasbig

■ hll he has his zeiengo, hut follows at a good round rate fill he overfaitei you. 

3£} man Friday h^ ddivered our gmde, and when we came up to hun, 
he was helpmg off from his horse, for the man was both hurt and 
ftnjrhtmiwl, when on a sudden wa e^ed the bear come out of the wood, and a 
moDsiroas one it was, the biggest Iqr &r that ever 1 saw. ITe were all a 
htfle surprised when we saw hm ; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to 
see joy and courage m file fellow’s countenance. '* 0, 0, 0 ! " says Fo&y, 
three times, pmnting to him; "Omasiet! you give mete leave, me shakeete 
handwifhhm, me makee you good laugh.” 

I was Euipnsed to see the feilowao well pleased '’Yon fo<d,” says I, “ he 
will eat you up ” — "Eatee me up< eafee me says Friday, tvrics over 
again, "me eateehimnp, me makee you good laugh , yonidlshiyhere,me 
show yon good laug^” So down ho sit^ and gets o& bis hoots m a moment^ 
andputsonapair of puteps (as we call tto fiat shoes they wear, and which he 
hod in his pocket), gives my other servant his horse, and with his gnu away 
he flew, sw^ like the wind. 

The bear was walking soffiy on, and ofiered to meddle with nobody, till 
Eriday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand him, 

« ye, hark ye,” savfFrHay, "me speakeo with yon.” We followed at

says Fnday, *'y(m no eono fnithei, mo go ; yon no come to me^ me come to

Friday stepped op ciloae to bun, clapped the mnzrle of his piece into Ins ear, 
and shot 1^ dead Then the rogno turned about to aee if we did not laugh , 
and when he saw we ware pleased, by our looks, be began to Hugh voxy loud 
“Sowohll bear in my country,” says Fnday. “Soyonkill&omP” says 
I ; “why, you have no guns ” — “ No,” save he^ “no gun, but shoot great

the howhng of wolves ran muoh in my head , and, indeed, except Ae praise

The ground wasstiU covered wifli enow, ihaagk not so deep and dangerous

^ I was now come to the centre of my travels^ mid had in a liiQe tune all 
my now-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which I 
brought with me havuig been very currently paid 

Uy pnneqial guide and privy-counsellor was my good, andeut widow, 
who, in gmtitade for the money I had sent her, thoi^ht no pains too much 
nor care too great to employ for me , and I trusted her so eniirdy with ever}- 
- thing, ^fhai I was perfectly easy as to the secunty of my effects, and, indeed, 

I was very happy from the beguming, and now to the end, in the un^oifed 
integnfy of thm good gentlewoman 

Rni now, having resolved to drspose of my plantation in fhe Biamb, I 
wrote to my' old fnaid at Lisbon, who htcnng <^ered it to fhe two merchanb, 
fhesnrrrvmof mvirostee^ who lived in the Brazils, th^ accepted the offer, 
and remitted thiriy-three thousand picces-of-eight to a correspondent of

Ho, and fifty moidores afterwards fo his son ibr his He, which Z had promised 
them, and which the plantefion was to moke good as a rent-chaxgo. And 
thus I have given the first part of a He of fortune and adventure,— He 
of Providence’s cheqnet^work, and of a vanety which the world will sd-

years* nflhcfion, and a Tonefy of unhappy oiroomstanees, nrhioh few meni if 
any, eror wont thxongh before, and afto near eeren years of peace add 
enjoyment in the Mness of all things, grown old, and when, if ever, it 
might be allowed mo to hate had oxpenenco of erery state of middle life, 
and to Ijiow which was most adapted to mako a man completely happy , 
1 say, after all this, any one would hire thought that tbe native propensity 
to xamblmg, whidh I gave on account of in my first settmg out m the world 
to hare boon so predominant in my thoughts, should ha worn out, thoTOlatile 
part be folly ovaooatod, or at least condensed, and I might, at sixty-one 
years of age, have been a little inelined to stay at homo, and haire done 
Tontunng life and fortune any more ^ 

Nay, farther, the common mohyo of foreign adventoros was taken away 
in me, for 1 had no fortune to make , I had nothing to seek, iflhad gamed 
ten tliousind pounds, 1 had been no richer , for I had already sufficient fbr 
mo, and for those Ih^ to leave it to , and what I had was visibly inoreasn^ , 
for, having no great fbmily, I could not spend the income of what I hi^, 
nxdess I would set up fbr an espensave way of living, subh as a great family, 
servants, equipage, gaiety, and tho like, which were things I had no notion 
of, or indinal^ to , so that I had nothing, indeed, to do but to szt atdl, and 
fully onjoy what I had got, and see it tnorcase daily npon tnyliands Tet oU 
theso things had no e&et upon me, or at least not enough to resist the 
strong induntion I had to go abroad again, which hung about mo like a 
chronical distemper In partioular, the desire of seebg my new planta- 
tion in tho island, and tho colony I left there, ran in my head continually » 
I dreamed of it all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day , it 
was uppermost in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily -md 
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep , in short, nothing oould 
remove xt out of my mind ' it even broke so violently into all my dis- 
courses that it made my conversation t!resome,^te I could talk of nothing

I hare often heard penons of good judgment eajr, that all the ebr people 
make in the rrorld aliont ghosts and apparitions is omng to the atzm^ih of 
imagmahon, and the poirerfnl opexahon of fancj in their minds ; that there 
IS no such, ^ing as a spxnt appearing, or a ghost TraHang, that peojdo’e 
ponng affectxosatdp npon tho past conversation of their deceased ftiends, so 
realizes ft to tiiem, tb^ are capable of fani^ing, npon some extxa- 
oidin&zy cucnmstances, that thef see thexni talk to them, and ere answered 
by them, when, in trolh i there is nothing but shadow and taponr in the 
thing, they really know no&uxg of the matter 

For mv part, 1 know not to this hour whether titore ora anv each things 
as real appantuma, spectres, or walking of people after they are dead, or 
whether there is anything m the stones they tdl ns of Aai kind more than 
the product of vapooxs, sick muds, and wandering fancies, hnt Ais Iknow, 
that my imagination irozked np to sadi a height, and brought me into such 
excess of Taponxs, or what else I may call it, fttat Z aotnally snpposed xnysolf 
often upon tiiespo^ at my old castle, behind the trees; sawmydd Spaniard, 
Friday’s laftxer, and the reprobate Bailors I left npon the island, nay, X 
X iolk^ with them, and looked at them steadily, thongh I was 
broad awake, as at persons jnst before mo , and tins I did till X often 
frightened myself wifti the images my fancy represented to me One !^me, 
in my sle^, X had the Tillany of the three pirate sailors so lively idated to 
me by the first Spaniard and Fnday^s father, that it was suxpnsmg; they 
told me how Siev barbarously attempted to murder all the Spanxa^, and 
that ftiay set fire to the promwns they had laid np, on purpose to distress 
and starve them , things that X had never heard of, and thai^ indeed, were 
never all of them tree in fact bat it was so warm in my imagination, and 
so realized to me, that, to the lionr I saw them,! could not be persuaded bnt 
that ^was, or woidd be, tine also howl resented xt, when the Sponiard 
complained to me ; and how X brought them to 300^6, tned them, and 
ordered them idl three to be hanged. What there was really m this be 
seen In its j^ee fbr however I came to form sndh things in my dream, and 
whai secret canvexse of spirits mjected it, yet there was, I say, much of it 
tree I own that ibis dream had nothing in it IrtezaUy and ^n^cally true , 
bnt the generd partwas so tree, — the base, tiUanoos bdiationr of these 
three hardened tegnes was sock, and had been so much worse than all I can 
describe, that the dream had too much similitude of the fact, and as 
I ivoidd afterwards have pmuahed them severely, so, if I had hanged f lieni 
all, I had been much in the zght, and even shocddliave been 3 nBfified bofti

her vhy she did not go on, and say out arhat she uras going to say P Bui I 
perceived that her heart uras too full, and some tears etood in her eyes.} 
*• Speak out, my dear," said I , ** are yon willing I should go P "STo,”

This aiieotionate hehaaionr of my anfe's hronght me a little ont of the

This put me m mind of the life I lived m my kingdom, the island , where 
I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did not waiit li , and hrod no 
more goats, beoanse 1 hod no more nse for them where the money lay in 
the drawer till it grew monldy, and had scarce the fayon^ to he looked npon

When I came to London, 1 was still as nncasy as I wo^ before, I had no

ceased her expostulations, and ]oined mthme, not only in maifnig pionsum 
for my voyage, but also in settling my £unily affinwi for my absence, end

In order to io ttds, I mode my mil, and setUed tiie estate I had in 
each a manner lor my children, and placed in tndh hands, that I mis 
perfeotly easy and satisfied they vronld have justice done them, ’whatever

with a euifioiont maintenance to herself for her core* all which she niMy 
deserved, for no mother could have tahen more care m their ednagtinn, 
or nnderatood it better and as she lived till I earns home, I also hved to

bly nephew 'waa ready to soil abont the beginmng of Tanuaiy, 1694 - 5 , 
and I, 'W1& myman Enday, went on board, in tho Downs, the 8th having, 
besides that sloop, which I montioacd above, a very considerable cargo of all 
kmds of neocssoiy things for my colony , whudi, if I did not find m good 
condition, I resolved to leave so 

First, I earned with me some servants, whom I purposed to place there 
as inhabitants, or at least to set on work &ere, upon my account, while I 
stayed, and either to leave them there or cany them forwwd, as they should 
appear willing , porticalarly I earned two carpentais, a smith, and a very 
handy, mgonious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and was also a general 
munhanio , for he wns dexterous at makmg wheels, and hand-mills to grmd 
iMirii, was a good turner, and a good pot-maker, he also'iaade anything 
flint wiis proper to moke of earth or of 'wood, m a word, 'we call^ hnn 
oor lack-of-oU-trades. 'With these I camod a tailor, 'who had offered 
iiiwinnlf to go a passenger to the East Indies with my nephew, but after- 
wards consented to stay on onr new plantation, and -who proved a most 
necessary, handy fellow, as could be desired, m many other bnsmesses 
{fnifiapn that of his trade , fbr, as I observed focmedy, necessity arms ns 
for idl employments 

Hy cargo, os near ns I can recoUeot, for I have not kept account of the 
particulars, consisted of a sofficient quantity of Imen,and some English ihm 
for clothing the Spaniards tiiat I expected to find there , and enough 
of th en * , as, by my oalonlation, might oomfortably supply them for seven 
years if 1 right, tho materials I earned for olothmg them, with 

gloves, hats, shoes, stodkmgs, and all anidi things os they codd want for 
Weanngi amounted to above two hundred pounds, mdudmg some beds, 
beddmg, and honsehdd stuff, particularly kitohan utensils, 'mfli pots, 
kettles, po'wter, brass, &o , and near a hundred pounds more in iron-work, 
nitiU, tools of every kmd, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary 
thing 1 could think of

what extromitieB I was pronding for, 1 earned a hundred barreb of powder, 
besides snoxds, onUasses, andibe non part of eomo pikes and halbirts, so >

took in several live hogs, and two cows with their calves , whidi X resolved,

Xi IB impOBSilfle for me to express ihe several gestores, tho strange

fear ate eaefly de8Gnl)ed; tears, groans, and a vsiy few motions of 
the head and hands, makeup the sum of its ranefy, hut an excess of joy, a 
sotpnae of 307, has a thousand oxtraTaganoes in it There were some in 
tears , some raging and tearing ihemsdres, as if thej had heen in the 
greatest agonies of soxrow , some stark xaTing''and downright lunatic , some 
rauahont the ship stamping with their feet, others wnngmg their hands 
some were dinoing, some singing, some laighing, more ozying, many ^mte 
dumb, not able to speak a word , others sidk and Tomiiuig, nBror^^lyir n n itiiig 
and ready to faint , and a few were ozossing tbemselTes, and eiTom God 
thanks 

I would not wrong them either, there might be many that were thankfol 
afterwards , but tiie passion was too strong but them at fixs^ and ih^ were 
not able to master it, they were thrown into ecstasies, and a kind of 
frenzy, and it was but a Tory few that were composed and senoua in their 
3 oy 

Perhaps, also, the case may haTO some addition to it from the particular 
oixcumstance of that nation belonged to , I mean the French, whose 
temper is allowed to he more rolatile, more passionate, and more sprightly, 
and their spunis more fluid than in other nations I am not philosopher 
enough to determine the cause , but nothing I hod erer seen befora came 
up to it« The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he 
found hiB father in the boat, came the nearest to it , and the surprise of the 
master and his two eompanions, whom I deliTeied from the villains that set 
them on shore in the island, came a little way towards it , hut nothing 
was to compare to this, either that I saw in I^aday, or onywhere else in 
my life * 

It IS further observahle, that fiiese extravagances did not show them- 
selves, in tiiat different manner I have mentioned, in different penons only , 
but oU the vanefy would appear, in a short succession of moments, in one 
and the same person A man that we saw this minute dumb, and, as it 
were, ^pid and confounded, would the next minnte be dancing and hallooing 
l|irA an aatio , and the next moment be tearing his hair, or pulling his dotbes 
to pieces, and stamping them under his feet like a madman, in a few moments 
after that, we wo^ have him oU in tears, then sick, swooning, and, had 
not immediate help been, had, he would ih a few moments have been dead , 
and thus it was, not with one or two, or ton or twenty, but with the greatest 
part of them , and, if I remember right, our surgeon woe obliged to let Uood 
of about thirty of &em 

There were two pnests among them • one an old man, and the other a 
yonng man, and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was the 
worst As soon as he set his foot on hoard our slup, and saw himself safe, 
he dropped down stone dead to all appearance , not the least sign of life 
" couldbepeioeiTedinhim. our surgeon immediatdy applied proper remedies 
to recover him, and was the only m& in the ship that hdieved he was not

them as vrell as our ship 'wonld allow, and th^ had slept heartily— -as most 
'of them did, being fiiii^ed and finghfened— ^ihqr were quite another sort of 
people fhe next day« 

Nothing of go^ manners, or mvil aoknowledgments for the hmdneii 
shown them, was wanting , the French, it is known,' are natmally apt' 
enofoghio exceed that way The captain and one of tfaepnestS oametOjme 
the next day, and desired to epeak with me and my nephew, the oommander 
began to oonsnlt with us wbat riionld be done with them, and, first, thev 
told ns we had saved their lives, so all they had was little euongh for a retucn 
to us for that kindness received* The captain said they Imd' saved soma 
monqr and some things of value in their boats, caught hastily dot of the 
flamesi and if we wonld accept it, they wore codered to make an offer of it 
nil to us , they only desired to be eet on shore somewhere ^in our way, where, 
if possible, they might get a passage to France Hy nepkew wished to 
accept iheir money at first wooed, and to consider what to do with them 
afterwards, but I overruled him in that port, for I knew whatit was to be 
set on shore in a strange country, and if fhe Portf^ose captain that took 
, me up 'jst sea bad served me so, and taken sU I had for my dehveninee, I 
must have starved, or have been os much a slave at the Branls as I had been 
I aVB&xbory, the mere being sold tea Mahometan exempted, and perhapah 
, PJortuguese is not a much hotter master tiian a Turk, if not, in solne cases,

I therefore ibid the ]?renbh captain that we had taken them up in iheir 
" distress, it was trae, but that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow- 
oroxtores ; and we wonld desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like, ox 
) any other extremity, that we had done nothing fox them but what we bdioved 
they wonld have done for us, if we bad been in their ease, and they in ours; 
but that we took them to save them, not to plunder fliem , and it would 
be n mostbarbatouB thing to take that little from them which they had saved 
ont of the fixe, and then set them on shore and leave them, that ibia wonld 
^ ' be first to save them from death, and then LiU them onxsdves; sate tiieta 
from drowning, and ahandoa ;^em to starving , and, therefore, 1 would not ^ 
f let the least thing he taken from them* As to setting them on shore, I told 
fhom, mdeed, that was an exceeding difiieully to us, for tbU Ibe Slup was 
hound to the East Indies, and though we were dnven out of our course to 
the westward a very 'great way, and perhaps were directed^ by Heaven on , 
purpose for, their deliversnoe, yet it was impossible for us wilfally to change 
our vuyftge on ihtix particular acoount , nor could my nephew, the captam.

ROBINSON CRUSOE. 


onswor it to ilie freiglitorB, \ntlL \rlioiii ho vao under charter io pniano U» 
voyage by the tray of Brual | and all 1 knew we could do for ihcni tras, 
to pat oaisolrea in the my of mooting with other ships homeward bound 
from the West Zndics, and get them a passage, if possible, io Ungland or 
Fronce 

The first part of the proposal trai so gonerons and kind, they coidd not 
but be TOiy thankful for it, but they wore in very great eonstomation, 
espeeinlly the possengon, at the notion of being earned away to the Ilost 
Indies , they then entreated mo, that as Z was ^ron so for to the westward 
before 1 met with them, I would, at least, keep on the same coarse to iho 
Banks of Nowfoondland, whore it was probable I might meet with some 
ship or sloop that they nught hire to carry them Imck to Canada, from 
whence they came 

I thought this was bat a reasonaUo request on their port, and ihoreforo 
I mdmed to agree to it , for, indeed, I considered that to cany this whole 
company to the East Indies, would not only bo an intolerable sovonty upon 
the poor people, bat would bo raining our whole voyage, by devoaxing all ^ 
GOT pronsums, so 1 ibooght it no breach of choxtcr-jKirfy, hnt what an 
unforeseen aemdont made absolutoly necessary to us, and in which no one 
could say we were to blame , for tho laws of God and nature would havr 
forbid tlfot we shodd lofase to take up two boats fall of people in bucIl « 
distressed condition , and the nature of the thing, as w^ respecting onr- 
sdves as the poor people, ohbged ns to sot them on shore somowhoro or 
other for their ddiveranoo So 1 consented that wo would carry tliom to 
Newfonndlimd, if wind and weather would permit, and if not, that I would 
cany them to Ifarbmco, m the West Indies 

The wind contmned foesh easterly, but the weather pretty good, and os 
the winds had contmoed in the points between K E and S E a long time, 
wre missed sereral opportanihes of sending them to France, for wo mot 
sevend ships bound to Eoxopo, whereof two were French, isxaa St Ghxis- 
topher’s , hut they had been so long beating up against tho wind that they 
durst take in no passengers, for fear of wonti^ provisiona for tho voyage, 
as wdl for ihemsdTes as for those th^ Should take in , so we were obliged 
to go on It was about a week after this that we made the Banks of Eew* 
fonhdland , where, to shorten my story, wre pnt all onr French people on 
board a bmk, whidi th^ bixed at sea there, io pnt them on shore, and

At all ; Trhen Are met Anth another subject for onr humanity to Trork upon, 
almost 3$ defloxable as that before 

It sms in the latitndo of 27 degrees 6 muntes north, on the I9fli day of 
hfaxoh, 1624->5, irhen spied a sail, onr eonxso S E and by 8 • iro soon 
perceived U xms n laxgo vessel, and that she boro np to ns, hot oonld not at 
fist knovr nrhat to moko of her, till, after eoming a little neater, vre fonnd 
sho had lost her m*an*topmast, foremast, and howspnt , and presently she 
fired a gon,as a ngnalof distress, the weather atbs prettygood, Timdat 
N.FT.W. a fresh gilo, and xro soon Came to speak tnth her 

Wo fonnd her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barhndoea, hnt had 
been Moth ont of the TO*id at Birbadoes a few diys before die was ready to 
fill, by a tomble hnmeano, while the captain and chief mate were both 
gone on shore , so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were in an 
indiSeront case for good artists to hnng the ship home They had been 
already nine weeks at soa, and had met with another teniblo storm, after the 
hnrr«cano was over, whidi had blown them qnite ont of their knowledge to 
the westward, and in whidi they lost their masts They told ns thqr 
ovpecti4 io have seen the Bahama Ldands, bnt were then dnven away again 
to the soafh^east, by a strong gale of wind at £*£ W , the same that 
blow now * and having no sails to work the ship with bnt a nminconne, 
and a Lind of square sail upon a jnxy foremast, whioh ih^ had set np, they 
oonld not lie near the wind, bnt were cndeavonnng to stand awny the 
Canancs. 

Bat that which was worst of all, was, that thqr almost starved 
for want of provisions, besides the fatigues ih^ had undergone their 
bread and flesh were quite gone, the} had not one onnee left in the ship, 
and had hod none for deven days The only relief they had was, their 
water was not all spent, and they had abont half a barrel of flour left, tiiey 
had sugar enot^h , some snccades. Or sweetmeats, they had at first, hut they 
were nil dovonx^ , and they had seven casks of nun 

There was a youth, and hxs mother, and a maid-serrant on board, who 
were passengers, and thinking the ship was ready to soil, nnhappil} came 
on board the evening before the Inmcane heg^n, and having no pro- 
visions of their own left, the} were in a more deploraUe condition 
the rest* for the seimen, being reduced to onoh an extreme necessi^ 
themselves, had no compassion, we may he sure, for the poor passengers, 
and they were, indeed, in such a condition that their misery is vexy hard 


to desenbo 

I had perhaps not known this part, if my cunositv had not led me (tiie 
weather being fair, and the wind abated) io go on board the ship The 
second mate, who 'upon this occasion commanded the ship, had been on 
beard oar ship, and ho told me, they had tibm passengers in the great

tmd Iqr fius caution he pr^erred the men, who woidd othenriBO have killed 
tiiemsdres with that very food that was pvea them on purpose to save 
their lives 

At the same tuno^ I ordered the mate io go into the great cabin, and 
eee what condition fte poor passengoxs ware in, and if they were hbro, 
to comfort them, and grre them what refreshment was proper and the 
surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with some of the prepared broth whidi he 
hadghentheamte&atwas cm board, and which he ^ not questicm would 
restore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this but, as I said above, having a great wifnJ 
to see the scene of xmsexy whush I knew the ship itself would present 
me with, in a more lively manner than I could have it by report, I took 
the captain of the dup, as we now called him, with me, and went myself, 
a little after, in their boat 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, to get the victuals 
out of the boiler before it was zeadv; but xi^mate obserred his orders, and 
kept a good guard at the cook-room door , and fhe man he placed there, 
after using all possiblD persuasion to have patience, kept them ofi br force 
however, he caused some biscmt cakes to he dipped in the pot, and softened 
with &e liquor of tiie meat, which they colled breuis, and gave them every 
one some, to stay tiieir stomudis, and told them it was for ftelr oun safetv 
fhathowas obl^^ to give them but little at a time. Butitwasallm 
vaini and had I not come cm board, and their own commander and officers 
with mo, and witii good words, and some threats also of giving them no ^ 
more, Ibdlieve they wunld have broken into the oocdc-room Iqr force, and 
torn the meat out of the furnace , for words axe indeed of very Bxaall force 
to a hungry bdly . however, we pamfied them, and fed them gradually and 
cautiously for fhe first, and the nest time gave them more, and at last filled 
their bellies, and the men did well enough 

But file misery of tiie poor passengers in the cabin was of another nature, 
and far beyond fhe rest , for as, first, the ship's company had so little fox 
themsdTe<(, it was hut too true that thqr had at first kept them very low, 
and at last totally neglected them* so that for sis or seren days itmight 
be said they had really no food at all, and for several days before very little 
Xhe poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman of sense and 
good breedmg, spared all she could so oSechonatdvfor her eon. that at 
last she entu^y eunk imder it, and when the m*ite of our ship went in, she 
sat upon the floor or deck, with her book up egomst fhe sides, between two 
f|>8»iTi8^ winch were lashed fast, and her head snuk between her shoulders, 
like a corpse, though not qmte dead 'ily mate said all he could to xenTe 
turd eseouxage her, and with a spoon pntamne broft mto her moafh. She

too late for her, Imt pointed to her cluld, as if she wonld Iuito eaid they 
ehoidd take care of him Houerer, the mate, who ine exceedingly moYcd 
with the nght, endeavonted to get eomo of the hrofh mto her mouth, and, 
as he said, got two or three epoonfitle down, ihoi^h I question wholher 
he conld be euro of it or not hut it was too late, and she died the same

The yoti&, who was proserred at Qie pnee of has most affccUonaie

Btxotohed out, with hardly any life left in him Ho had a piece of an old

his throat, and he began pennblj to remo , though by giving him, some 
time after, hut two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he wus rety sick, and 
brought it up again

The history of then coming to, and oondnot in, the idand, after my gomg

part of my relation will hdp to understand, and whiiA will, in most of

In order to do tlus sneometiy, and as intelligibly os I can, I must go 
back to' the oircnmstanoes in which I left the island, and in which the 
persons were of whom I am to speak And first, it u necessary to repeat 
that I hod sent away Friday’s hither and the Spaniard (the two whose lives ' 
I had resened from the savages) in a large canoe to &e mam, os 1 then 
^TinngTit it, to fctidi over the Spaniard’s companions that he left behmd him, 
in order to save them from the like calamity that he had been m, and in 
order to sneconr them for the present and that, if possible, we aught to« ^ 
gethor find some way for our ddiverance afterwards > 

I "When I sent them away, I had no vuiUe appearance of, or the least 
room to hope for, my own dehvoiance, any mote than I had twenty years 
befoxo,— much less had I nay fbi^owledge of what afterwards happened, 

I of on Tgnglmh ship ooming on shore there to fetch me off, and it 
not he bnt a very great snrpnee to them, when they came biuh, not 
only to find that I was gone, but to find three efiangers left on the spot, 
possessed of all that I had left behmd me, which would otherwue have been 
their own. 

The first tiung, however, which I inquired mfo, that I might begm where 
1 left off, was of their own part, and idesixed the Spaniard wonld give me

They were in all three weeks absent , 'uid in that time, imlaokily for

The Spaniards ironld haTe been satisfied mth ibis, had the others hot 
let them alone » vhkih^ however, thqr oonld not find in then: hearts to do 
long; bnt, Hke the dog in the manger, they would not eat themselves, 
neither would th^ let the others eat ThD di&renoes, nevertheless, were 
at first but invi^ili and such nsare not worth relatog, bnt at last it broke 
oat into open war and it began with all tho radeness and’ insolence 
that can he imagued, — without reason, without provocation, contraiy to 
nature, and, indoed, to oommon sense and thot^h, it is true, the first 
relation of it came &om tho Spaniards themedvesi whom I may call the 
accusers, yet when 1 came to examine file fellows, they oonld not deny n 
word of it 

But before I come to the pirtichlaxs of fins part, I must supply a defect 
xamy fonneridation, nndfiuswas, I forgot to set down among the rest, 
that just as wo were weighing the anchor to set sail, there happened a little 
quazxd onboard of oar ship, which I was once a&axd would have turned to a 
second mntuxy, nor was it appeased till the captain, rondng up his connge, 
and inking ns all to hu assistance, parted them by force, and, making two 
of the most refraotory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons and as fiiey 
liad been nefivo in the former disordoiB, nnd let fall some nglv, dangerous 
words, the second time ho threatened to cany them m irons to England, and 
have them hanged there for mutiny, and running away with the ship This, 
it seems, though the captam did not mtend to do it, frightened some other 
men lU'&o ship , and some of them had put it into the heads of the rest, 
that tho captam only gave thorn good words for the present, till they should 
come to some English port, and t^tthen they should he all put mio gad, 
and tried for their lives The mate got mielligence of this, and acquomted 
us with it, upon which it was desired that I, who still passed lor a great 
maudmong them, diodd go down with the mate, end sntisfv flie men, and 
idl them that they might be assured, if they behaved well the rest of fiie 
voyage, all they had done for the time post diodd be paxdoned So Iwent, 
and after passing my hononi’s word to them, they appeared easy, and the 
more so when I caused the two men that were m itoub to he tdeased and 
foxgiien ' 

But this muhny had hronght us to an anchor for that night , the wind also 
edm next moming, we found that our two men, who had been laidin 
irons, had stolen each of them a musket, and some other weapons (what 
^ powder or shot they had we knew not), and had taken the ship’s pinnace, 
which was not yet hded up, and ran away with her to their companions m 
toguezy on shore As soon ns we 'found this, I ordered the long-boat on 
shore wifii twdve men and the mate, and away fiiey wcat to seek the rogues , 
hut they could ncafiier find them or any of the test, for they oU fied mto the 
woods when they caw file boat coming on shore The mate was onco xe*

have nothing to do with them , nor could lh<^, for a good while, bo persuaded 
to giro thorn any food as for the Spaniards, they were not yet como. 

‘When the Sponinxda eatno first on diore, tho hnsiness began to go for<-

fomily, Vnt they would not hear of it so the two p^r fdlows lived by 
themselves, and finding nothing hut industry and application would make 
them live e^ortahly, they pitched their tents on the north shoro of iho 
island, hnta little more to the west, to be out of danger of tho savages, who 
always landed on the east parts of tho island 

Hera they ‘bmlt them two huts, one to lodge in, and tho other to lay np 
their magasines and stores in , and the Spamakb having given them some 
com for seed, and some of the peas which lhad left them, thqr dug, planted, 
and entdosed, alter the pattern 1 had set for thorn all, and Vi^n to lim 
pretty well Then first erop of com was on the ground, and though it was 
hut a httle hit of land whidi they had dug np at hnt, having had hut a hltle 
txmo, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find them with bread and other 
eatables , ond one of the follows being the cook’s mate of the ship, was very 
ready at making semp, puddings, and sndh other preparations as iho nee, and 
the milk, ond sueh little flesh as they got, fonushed him to do 

They were gomg on m this little thnving position when tho fiuee nn* 
natural rogues, their own countrymen too, m mere humour and to insult 
them, came and bullied them, and told them the island was them i&itho 
governor, meaning me, had given them the possession of it, and nobody idm 
had any right to it , that they shonld hmld no houses upon thOir gnmnd, 
wdesslhey would pay rent for them* 

The two men, thnikiiig they were yeshng at first, asked them to come in 
and Bit down, and see what fine houses they were that they had Vult, and to 
tdl them what rent they demanded, and one of tiiem memly said, if they

and made unprorements, they would, aoeotding to the custom of landloids 
giant a long lease and desired they wmdd get a sonvener to draw the

The others had firoMkrms with tiiem too, bnt ono of the two honest men, 
bolder than lus comrade, and made desperate by his danger, told them, ii 
they offered to more hand or foot, tiieyworo dead men, and boldly oom«

rognenes, snch as treiding down their com, diooting throe young kids and a 
dio>goit, which fho poor men had got to breed np tame for their store, and, 
in a wor^ plagidng them night and day m this manner, it fotoed the two 
men to'snoh a desperation, that they resedred to fight them all three, the first 
itmo they had a fair opportiunty. In order to do this, they resolved to go to 
the casffe, as they i^ed it (that was my old dwe^g), where the three 
rognes and the Spomards all bred together at that time, intending to have a 
fair hatUe, and the Spmiaxds should stand by to see ioax play so they got 
tip in the mommg before day, and came to the place, and oall^ the English- 
men by their names, tdling a Spaniard, &at answered, that they wanted to

It happened that the day before, two of the Spaniards, having been mthe

baxborons usage they hod met with from their three oeantzymen, and how 
they had rmnod their plantation, and destroyed their 00m that ffiey had 
labontod so hard to bring forward, and killed &e mildi-goai and their three

they kept to look abroad gars notioe of ihu intlun, nith tiiis addition, to 
• our men'a great satisfaction, nz , that the conquerors had not pursued tin™,

man of humonify, nonld not suffer them to kill the titree fogifaves, M 
sending three men ont by the tiqi of the hill, ordered tiiem to go roimd, 
come in behind them, and sutprua and fake them prisoners , nhicb nas

krxH thus the Spaniards had the island sgam ftee to tbemsdres, their flight

After they neto all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, and

into Budi measurea again, aa bronght "fiiem into a great deal of 

trouble 

They had taken three pnsonexa, as I observed , and these three being' 
lusty, stout young fellows, they made tiiem servants, and taught them to 
work for them ; and as daves they did well enough, but th^ did not tato 
' their measures with them as I did by my man Friday, tiS , to be^ 
With them upon the pnndple of having saved their lives, and then instmot 
them in the rational ptmoiplos of life, much less of rdigion,— mviluing 
and reduomg them lij kmd usage and aifeoSonate arguments, but ns 
they gavQ them their food every day, so they gave them their work*’ too, 
and kept them fully em^oyed in drudgery enough , hut they toiled m this 
by it, that tiufy never hid them to assut them and fight for them -as I 
had my man Friday, who was aa true to me as the Tory fiesh upon my

But to coma to fiio tomily part Being all now good toiends, lor 
common danger, as I said above, hod effeetually reconciled them, ih^' 
h(^ to coneidor their general mronmalanoos , and the first thing that 
came under consideration was whether, seeing the savages parhouladiy 
haunted that sida of the uland, and that there were more remote and reined 
parts of It equally adapted to their way of living, and mamf Ostly to their 
advantage, they diould not rather more their habitation, and plant in some 
more proper place tor their sa&ly, and especially tor the security of thmr 
cattlo and com. ^ 

TTpon thu, 'after long debate, it was conduded that they would not

consisted entirely in their being eonooiled, of which they were now folly- 
cOnvineed, they sot to work to cover and cenoeal the ^ceyotmore efitotnally 
than before Per this pntpose, ae I planted trees, or rather fhmst in

thosa atakea also being of a wood very forward to gxtnr, as I have noted 
iormetly, they took care to have them generally mnoh latgei and faltwr than 
those which I had planted , and as they grew apace, so they planted ttiwn 
so very tbiok and doss together, that when fh^ had h^ three or fear years 
grown, there was no pisxoing with the eye any considBiahIo way into the 
jdantation, and os for tiiai port which I bad Ranted, the trees were grown 
ns thick 08 a man's thigh, and among them they placed so many othor short

wound he had received, that it was thought he oonld not live Bat the 
governor Spaniard still said no ; it was on Englishman that had saved all 
their lives, and he would never consent to put an Englishman to death, 
though be had murdered half of them,— nay, he said if he had been killed 
himssli by an Englishman, and had time Irft to speak, it should he tiiat 
they should pardon him 

-Xhis was so positively insisted on by the govemor Spaniard, that there 
was no gainsaying it , and as mcroifol counsels ore most apt to prevail, 
where they ore so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it ; hut then it was 
to he considered what should be done to keep them fiom domg the muehzef they 
designed, for all agreed, govemor and all, that means were to he used for 
piesomng the society from danger After a long debate, it was agreed, fin^ 
that they diould he farmed, and not permitted to have either gon, powder, 
shot, sword, or any weapon , and dundd ha tamed out of the society, and 
left to live where they would, and how they would, by themselves; hut that 
none of the res^ either Spsniaxds or English, should eonversa with them, 
speak with tilioin, or have anyflung to do with them that they AouM he

Thus they dismissed them tho soeiolj, and tamed them out to stnit for

About font or five days after, they emne again for somevietaals, and gave

in it 

Ahoat ihxoo qnnrtcrs of a year after tbu separation, a new froho took 
theso xegnts, whkh, together with the former xillany they hod committed, 
brought mis^ief enough upon thorn, and had Tory near been the mm of the 
whole colony. The thieo now nssomates began, it seems, to be weary of the 
laborions life they led, and that without hope of beitenng their oixcnmstanees 
and ft whim took them that they would make a voyage to the oonlment, from 
Thence the savages came, and would try if they oould scizo upon some 
.pritonm among the natives there, and bnng them home, so as to make them 
do the hboxious part of the work for them. 

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no farther Bui 
they did nothing, and proposed nothing, bnt had eithor mischief in the 
'design, or miselucf lu the event And if I may pve my opmion, they 
seemed to he tinder a bbst from Heaven, for if we will not alio w a visible 
eutso to pursmo visible ernnes, hon shall wo teconcila the events of things 
with the Dinuo jnstieoP It was eertaml} on apparent vengeanee on ihsir 
crime of mntmy and pixaoy that brought them to the state they were m ; and 
they diowcd not the least remorse for the enme, hut added new vdlanies to 
it, mchas the piece of monstrous orueify of wounding a poor dare beeanse 
he did not, or pexhaps conld not, understand to do what he directed, and to 
wound him in such a manner as made him a onpple all his life, and in a 
place whore no surgeon or mediome could bo had for his ooze , and what 
was ahll worse, tho murderous mtent, or, to do justice to the crime, the 
mtentional murder, for bucAl to bo sure it was , as was afterwards the 
formed design they oil laid, to murder the Spaniards m cold Uood, and m 
their deep. 

But Z leave observing, and tetoxn to the story .—The three idlows 
came down to the Spaniard one morning, and in very humble terms desired 
to bo admitted to speak with them The Spaniards very xeadQy heard what 
ftoy had to^ say, which was this .---that they were tired of living zn tho 
maimer they did* and that th^ were net han^enon^ to maketiia neces- 
I sanes thiy wanted, and that having no hdp, they found they should be 
starved; hut if the Spamozds wotdd give them leave to take one of toe 
canoes which ih<y came over m, and give them anus and ammuxiztam pto« 
^portioned to their defence, they would go over to too main and' seek toeu 
fortunes, and so ddiver them from toe trouble of srq[iplying them wito any 
other provisionf •

The men replied andocionsly, they should be eteirod if they stayed hcrci

wires or children to cry after tiiem , and| in sborti insirtod importimatdy

Tho Spaniards told them, with great LindnesSy that if they were resolred 
to gO| they should not go like naked men, and be in no cordition tn defend 
themsolvos , and that though they could ill eparo their firo-armSf hating not 
enough for themselrcag yet they would let them hnro two tunskctii a pistolg 
and a cutlass, and each man a hatchot, whidi they thought trn enfQcient for

to serre them a month, and giton them as mneh goats’-flosh as they could 
eat while it was sweet, and a great basket of dnod grapes, a pot of &eih 
water, and a y onng kid ohro, they boldly sot out in the canoe for n tqrago

The boat, indeed, was a largo one, and would teiy well hato earned

He that draw to choose first went away by himsdf to the hnt where the

observing, that he that chose first took her that was reckoned the homobeat

of the island, so that thqr oontiniied separated as before , and thus mj 
Iras peopled in three plaees , and, as I might say, three towns were began 
to be bnilt 

And here it is Tety irell worth obserring, that, as it often happens not the 
world (what the wise ends of God’s prondence are in snih. a disposition of 
things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two worst wires ; and 
the three reprobates, tiiat were seaxee worQi hanging, that were fit ihr no** 
thug, and neither seemed bom to do themselres good, nor any one dse, had 
three derer, diligent, oarefal, and ingenious wires , not that the first two ^ 
wero had wires, as to their temper or humour, for all the fire were most 
willing, qmet, paisire, and luhjeoted oreatnres, rather Ixkeslares than wires , 
but my meaning is, they wire not alike eapable, ingenious, pr industnoxu, or 
alike deanly and neat 

Another ohsenration I must make, to the honour of a diligent application 
on one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the 
ofher, that when I came to the {dace, and newed the several xmprorements, 
plantmgs, and management of the sereral litUe colonies, the two men had so 
far oulgone the three, that there was no companson Th^ had, indeed, 
both of them as much ground laid out for com as th^ wanted, and the reason 
was, because, according to my role, nature dictated that it was to no 
purpose to sow more com than thqr wanted, but the differeace of the 
GolUration, of the planting, oi the fmces, and, indeed, of erexything dse, 
was easy to be seen at first new. 

The two men had xonumetahle young trees planted abont their huts, so 
that, when yon came to the place, nofh^ was to he seen but a wood * and 
though they had twice had their plantation demoluhed, once by their own 
countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall he idiown in its place, yet they 
had restored all agam, and everything was thriving and flourishing about 
them tii^ had grapes planted in order, and managed like a nueyard, 
though they had themsdves never seen anything of that kind , and, by 
their good ordering fheir vines, their grapes were as good again as any

Bat Inow come to a scene different from oil that had happened before, 
either to them or to me, and the otigm of the story vns this ---Early one 
morning, there came on shore five or six canoes of Indian a or savages, call 
them vhich yon please, and (here is no room to donbt they came upon tho 
old errand of fredjng upon their daves , bnt that part vas now so fanuHox 
to the Spaniards, and to out men too, ttiat they did not concern themselves 
ahont li, as I did bnt hating been made sensiblo, by their ei^nenco, that 
themoidy hti8mcmiwa8to>heeoneefded,an^ that li they wore not seen by 
any of the savages, they would go off ogam ynxeQy, when (hfliy ^boshiess 
was done, havuig, as yet, not the least notion of there being any inhabitants 
in ttie island , I say, havmg been made sensible of dns, th^ hod nothing to 
do but give nofaoe to all the Ihree plantations to hoop within doorB, and not 
diow (hemselW| only placing a scout m a proper place, to give notme when 
the boats went to sea again 

This was, wilhont doub^ very right, bnt a duastor spoiled aU^theso 
measoxes, and made it knoim among the savages that there wore ihhaKtant* 
thsre , which was, m the end, ttie dcscdation of almost whole' edemy 
iftsr the canoes with tho savagos were gonb off, the Spaniards peeped

' The Spaniards were greatly sniptised at this sight, and perfeofly' at a loss 
what to do.' Tho Spanish goremor, os it happened, was with them, and hu 
adrioe was asked, hot he professed he knew not what to do As for slaves, 
they had enongh alrOody ; and as to LSlmg them, there were none of -theih

no 'wrong, invaded none of their property, and tiiey thonghi they had no 3n8t

&ne This thooght temfiod them ezeeodis^y , for th^ condoded, and that 
notwithont good oanso, indeed, that if this fellow came homo safe among h» 
eomiades, he wonld certainly giro them an account that there were people 
m the island, and also hew few and weak they were ; for this mag^ as 
ohserred before, had nerer been told, and it was Tory happy ho had not, how 
many there were, or where th^hred , nor had he erer teen or heard the fire 
of any of tiieir guns, mneh lets had they shown him any of their other retired 
^ees, such as the caTO m the jall^, or the new retreat which the two 
Englishmen had made, and the like 

The first testimony they had that this fellow had giren intdligeneo of 
them was, that about two months after this, six canoes of eatages, with 
about leren, eig^t, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the north 
nde of the island, where th^ nerer used to come before, and landed, about 
an hour after sunnse, at a oonTement place, about a mile from the habitation 
of the two ‘Rn gliAmwij where this escaped man had been kept As the 
Spaniard goremor said, had they been all there, the damage would not hare 
been so mudh, ter not a man of them would hare escaped, hut the case 
differed now rerr much, for two men to fifty was too much odds The two 
men had the happiness to ducorer thorn a^ui a league off, so that it was 
ahoye on hour betexo they landed , and as they landed a mile from their 
huts, it was some time before ih^ oould come at them. Now, hanug great 
reason to hdiere that they were hetiayed, the first thing they did was to 
hmd the two dares whieh were left, and cause two of the throe mon whom 
they hnmght with the women (who, it seems, prored rety teithful to them), 
to lead &em, with their two wires, and whaimr th^ could carry away 
with them, to their retned plaeea in the woods, whidi I hare ^oken of 
above, and there te bind the two fdlowa band and teot, till thq- heard

Li the next ^e, seemg the savages were all come on shoro, and that 
th^ had bent their eourse directly that way, fh^ opened the fences when 
the nuldh-cowB were kept, and drove them all out , leaving there goats to 
strag^e m the woods, wlntber th^ pleased, that the savages might tiunk 
they were all bred wild, hut the rogue who camowith them was too «nnwiTig 
ter that, and gave them an account of it all, ter th^went directly to the 
place 

inien the two poor teightoned men hod seenxed didr wives and goods, 
they sent the other skve th^had of fho three who came with the women, 
and who was at their place by acodent, away to the Spaniards with^iill 
speed, to give them tiie alarm, and desire speedy help, and. in the mean^

littlo army of fhoir eneuucs come on directly to their habitation, and, in a 
moment mote, eoold aee all thor huts and household stuff flanung up 
together, to their grett gnef and mortification , for they had a Tory great 
lots, to them itretneralde, at least for tome time They kept their station 
for a trhile, tdl they found the savages, like mid beasts, spread thenudves 
all over the place, rummaging every nay, and every place they could think 
of, m search of pr^ , and in particular for the people, of vrhom, non, it 
plainly appeared they had intelhgenee. 

The two ‘Rngluthm im seemg this, tmnking themselves not seenre vrhere 
they stood, because it vres likdy some of the mid peo^o might come that 
mty, and fheym^ht come too many together, thought^it proper to make 
ano&er retreat about half a mile farther , hdievmg, as it afterwards ' 
happened, that the farther they strolled, the fewer would be together 

Thdr next halt was at the entrance into a very ffnok-grown part of the 
woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and vastly 
largo; and in this tree they both took their standing, resolving to see there 
what might offer. They had not stood there long before two of the savages 
appeared Tunning direofly that way, as if they already had notice where they 
stood, snd were ooudng up to attack them , and a little way farther they 
• espied three mote comng after them, and five mote beyond them, all coming 
tho same way hendes which, they saw seven or eight more at a disfamee, 
running ano&etway, for, in a word, they ran every way, like sportsmen 
heating for their game 

The poor men were now in great per^exity wheffier they should stand 
and keep ffieir posture, or fiy , but, after a very short debate with them- 
Bslves they considered, that tf the savages ranged the country thns before 
help came, they might perhaps find out their retreat in the woods, and ffien 
all would he lost; so they resolTed to stand them there , and if they vreie 
too many to deal with, then they vnmld gat np to the top of the tree, from 
whence they doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their 
ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were landed, whuih was near 
fifty, were to attack them. " , 

^ving resolved upon this, they next considered whether ffi^ should fire 
at the first two, or wait for file Hum, and so take the middle paxfy, by which 
file two and the firethaifollowed would hb separated, at length they resolved 
to let the first two pus ly, unless they should spy them in tho ttee, and 
come to attack them.' The first two savagu eenfixmed them also ia this 
rff gnlftficm, by tunung a litUe from them townxds another part of fiie vrood* 
hut the three, and fiie five after them, came inrvratd dneefiy to the tree, es

escaped to inform &e rest, as 'wdl id 'what iheyihad done as of nrhat had 
happened to them, and to vhet them on to another enterprise of the same 
nature , Trhich they, it seems, resolyed to attempt, Tdth sufficient force to^ 
carry ^ before thm • for except vhat the Jfirrt man had told fhem^ol 
inhabitants, th^ could say little of it of their oiminonrledge, for they nerer 
saw one man , and the fellow being blled that had affirmed it, they had lio 
other witness to confirm it to them 

It was fire or six months after tins before they hoard any more of the 
saTages, in whieh tune our men were in hopes they had either forgot their 
former had Indc, or g^ven orer hopes of better, when, on a sudden, they 
were invaded wi& a most formidable fleet of no less than eight and twenty 
canoes, fall of savages, armed with bows and anowB, great dubs, wooden 
swords, and sudi lilm eng^es of war, and they brought such numbers with 
them, that, in Aort, it put all our people mto the utmost consternation. 

Ab they come on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost nde of the 
ishmd, our men had that night to oonsnlt and consider what to do , and, m 
the first place, hnowmg that their bemg entixdy concealed was their <^y 
safety before, and would he much more so now, while the number of their 
enemies would he so great, thqr therefoxa xesdved, first of all, to take down 
the huts which were built for the two Enghsbmen, and dnve away their 
goats to the dd cave , becafise they supposed the savages would go dizecfly 
thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old game orer again, though they 
did not now land withm two leagues of it In the next place, tiiey drove 
away all the flocks of goats they had at the dd bower, as I esJheA it, which 
bdonged to the Spaniards , a^, in short, left as little appearance of in- 
habitants anywhere as was possible and the next morning eady th^ posted 
fhexQsdves, with all their foroe, at the plantation of the two men, to wait

Oar men being {has hsxd laid at, Afldns Troonded, and two other men

and fliey were eo desperate, timt fhoagh atiore fiftjr of tiiem were killed, and 
more il^ as many wounded, yet they eame on in the teeth of oar men, 
' fearless of danger, vnA shot their arrows like a dood ; and it was ohsenred 
that iheir woonded men, who were not quite disat)led, were made ontxageous 
by their wounds, and fo^ht like madmen 

TThen our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the ^Sn glmiiTnATi 
that were killed behind them , and the savages, when they came up to them, 
killed them over agam in a wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs, and 
heads, with their clubs and wooden swords, like true savages , but finding 
onr men were gone, they did not seem to puxauo them, but drew themselves 
up in a ring, whndi is, it seems, their onstom, and shouted twice, in token of 
fhmr viotory , after which, thc^ had the mortification to see several of their 
wounded men fell, dying with the mere loss of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together upon a 
dsing ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would ^ve had them march 
and charge again all together at once but the Spaniard replied , — ** Seignior 
. Atkins, yon see how their wounded men fight , let thorn alone till morning, 
oil tue wonnded men will be stiff and sore with their wounds, and faint with 
the loss of blood , and so we shall hare the f^er to engage ” Thu adnoe

Wdl, Seignior Atkins,” says the Spaniard, ** you have behaved gallantly, 
and done pnr part, we will fight for you if jon^cannot oome on, but 1 
think it best to stay till morning. ** so they waited 

But as it was a dear moonlightnight^ and th^found the savages in great

I confess I was struck with fho thuig itself, hut much more with the

fhon^ they had no deigymen upon the q^ot, yet a formal contract on both

all agreed to be bound Inr, though it had bean bnt breaking a stick between

ihuih of parting mth him, and that for many reasons he had been the

affectionate to the last degree ; and I had resblved to do something con- 
Bidorable for him if he outlived me, as it ires probable he irould Then I 
know that as I had bred Fnday up to he a Bcoteafiont, it would quite 
confound him to hxing Urn to embrace another xeli^^on, and he viWd 
never, widle bis eyes were cqmn, believe that his old master was a heretic, 
and would he damned ; and this might in the end rum the poor fellow’s 
pnnaj^es, snd so turn him back agom to his first idolatry. However, a 
sudden thought tehoTod mem this strait, and it was this * Iteld himlcould 
not eaj that I was wiling to port with Fnday on any account whatever, 
though a work that to him was of more valno than his life, ought to he to 
me of much more valno than the keeping or partmg with a servant But, 
on tho other hand, I was persuaded that Fndav would by no means agree to 
part with me , and I could not force him to it without his consent, nithout 
xnanifest injnsiiee, because 1 had promised I would never send fam away, 
and ho had promisi^ and engaged to me that he would never leave me, nnl^

I come back novr to the first port of his olqecbons "When vre come to 
the ’RwgiMhmiinj I sent for them all together, and after some account given 
them of what 1 bad done for them, via what necessary things I had provided 
for them, and how th^ were distobntad, which they were very sensible of, ' 
and very tbanliiil for, I b(^an to talk to them of the soandalons life th^ 
led, and gave tiiem a foil account of the notice the deigynian had taken of 
it , and arguing how unohnstuin and irreligious a life it was, I first asked 
thorn if ihqr were married men or bachelm ? They soon ec^lamed their 
condition to me, and showed that two of them were widowem, the other 
three were smgle men, or bachelors I asked them with what oonscienoe 
they conld ^take these women, and oaU them their wives, and have so many 
duldrenby them, and not be lawfully momed to them? -- - ' 

They all gave me the ansuor I erpeoted, viz that there was nobody to 
marry -^em, that they agreed before the governor to keep them as theur 
wives, and to maintain them and own them as their wives, ihqr thoiigh^ 

as things stood with them, fh^ were as legally married ns if th^ had been 
mamedby apaxson, and with aU the fonnahties in the world , 

I toM them th^ no donbt they ware mozxied in the aighi of 60^ and 
were bound in conscienoe to ke^ them as their wives , bnt that the laws of 
men being otherwise, 1h^ might desert the poor women and clnldron 
hereafter , and that fheir wives, hesng poor desolate women, fhendless and 
moneyless, wonld have no way to hdp themselves I therefore told them 
that, unleas I was asured of Iheir honest mtent, I could do nothing ior 
them, but wonld fake core that what I did should be for the women and 
children without them , and that, unloss they would give me some assurances 
that they would many the women, I conlid not think it was convemeni 
they should contmno together as man and wife , for that it was both 
scandalous to men and ofiensive to God, iriio they oouldfiiot thmiE would 
blessthamif they went on thus * ^ < 

All this went on as I expected fmd&^tdldmo, espeeially T7ill Atkins, 
who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved their wives'as well 
ns if thcT hod boon bom m thesr own native country, otifl would not leave 
them on anv aocoimi whatever, and they did venly hdieva that their whres 
were ns virtuous and as modeb^ and did, to the utmost of their ddn, asAiuch 
for them and for their idiiLdzon, as any women conld possibly do , fh^ 

would not port with them on any account and If^ill Afbns, fen his own 
parhcular, added, that if any man would tdee him away, and after to iaxej 
him homo to England, and make him captain of the hesiman-of-wnr in the 
navy, ho would not go with hnn, if he might not cany his wife e nd ehildzon 
with bun, and if there was a clergyman m the ahip, he would be moined to 
herhovr with all hu heart ^

ftu 7 were &r from doming to part with their wives, and that th^ meant 
nothing but whatwos vety honest when they chose them So I appomted 
them to mediae tho next morning, and, m tho mean tune, they should lot 
their wives know the meanmg of the marnago law, and that it was not only 
to proront any acnndal, but also to obhge them that they sboiild not loianko

The women wore easily made sensible of tho meamng of tiie thing, and 
were Very woU sahafiod with it, as indeed ih^ bad reason to be eo they 
failed not to attend altogether at my apartment next moxnuig, where I 
brought ont my clergyman and though he hod not on a minist^a gown,

**Why, truly, Ailans,” said I, am afraid thou qteakest too mudi

ho was impatient to know. ”Oh,” said the pnest, «<tell him fhera is one

world, and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of the resurreehon 
and of the last judgment. Let him but repent himsdf, he will bean ezcdleni 
pznaeher of xeponionce to his wifo ” 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very senons all the while, and 
who, wo could easily perceive, was more than ordmanly affected with it. 
when being eager, hardly auffding me to make on end— know all 
this, master,” says he, and a great deal more, hut I have not the unpu* 
donee to talk flins to my wife, when God and my coxucienea know, and my

BO xepxoadied him with hu homd, ungodly life, that he trembled at the 
oppr^ensions that her knowledge of him should lessen the attention she 
should give to those things, and make her rather contemn rdigion than 
recoiTCit, but ho was ossuced, he said, tnnt her mind was so disposed to 
teceire doe impressions o! all those ihmgs, and that if 1 would hut discourae 
with her, she would make it appear to my eatisfacbon that my labour would 
not be upon her 

Accordingly, I called her in, and plaoiiig mysdf as interpreter hehreen 
my religious pnest and the woninn, I entreated him to hogm with her , hut 
sure sn^ a eennon was never preached by a Popish pnest in these latter ages 
of the world , and, as 1 tohl him, I thought he had all tho zeal, all the 
knowledge, all the sincenty of a Christian, without tho error of a Homim 
Catholic, and ttiat I took him to he each a clergyman as the Boman bishops 
wore, before the Ohuxdi of Borne assumed spintnal sovenuguty over the

knowledge of Chnst, and of redempbon by Bsm, not with wonder and 
astonishment only, as she did the firrt aobone d a God, hat with jcy and 
faith f with an affeebon, and a suzpnsmg d^yeo of understanding, scazoa to 
be imagmed, mndi less to be expressed , and, at her own request, she was 
baptized 

'When he was prepanug to baptize her, I entreated him that he wonld 
perform that office with some canbon, that the man might not pezeeiTe he 
was of the Boman Chmoh, if possible, because of other ill consequences 
whudi might attend a diffiarence among us in that very rdigion which wa 
were instmcting the other ul He told me that as he had no eonseciutod

manner that I should not know by it tbat he was a Boman Cathoho mysdf,

I know this must be the young woman who was his mothor^e servant, for 
there was no other Ohnstian woman on the island so I began to paesuade 
him not to do anvihing of that kind rashly, or because be found himsdf in

and as for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober, and i^giona 
yoimgwoman, had a very good shine of sense, was agreeable enough in her 
person, spoke very handsomdv and to the pmpose, always with doconoy and 
good manners, and was neither too backwnxd to speak when requisite, not 
imperhnenfly forward when it was not herhuainess, very handr add house,

The match bemg proposed m tUs maimer, we mamed them the same

udeperdent, and, indeed, unemployed, for, exceptmg toe providing thom-

without being absolute dares, lor I would not pennit them to make them 
doves by force, by any means ; because they had their liberty given them

to break. 

Thef most wiilmgly embraced toe proposal, and came all very cbeertoUy

how her nustress was starved to death, and died on hoard that unhappy ship

Bust, sir,’* said she, we had for some days fared exceeding hard, and 
suffered very groat hunger , hut at last we were wholly without food of any 
kind, exc^ sugar, and a little wine-and-water. The fint day after I had 
received no food at all, I found myself towards evening first empfy’and sick

I set up the doop, and left it amoi^ them, they would, upon, erezy light

tiumed puates, and so made &e island a den of thieves, inst^ of a jdantation 
of sober and religions people, as I mtended it, nor did I leave the two 
pieces of brass cannon that I had on board, or the two qnarter«deek guns 
that my nephew took extraordinary, for the same reason* I thought it was 
enongh to qualify them for a defensive war against any that shonld imrada 
them, hot not to set them op for an offensive war, or to go fibroad to aitacjr 
others , whidh, m the end, would only bring mm and dcstmotion npim

another way, as I shall observe m its place 

Having now done with the xdand, I left them all m good oircumstances,

6th of May, having been about twenfy^flve days among them , and as they 
were all reqdved to stay upon the idand till I came to remove them, I 
promised to send them farther rehef from the Brazils, if I could possibly 
find on qpportonily, and, particnlarly I promised fo send them some cattle, 
sndi as sheep, hogs, and cows * as to the two cows and calves which I 
brought from England, we had been obliged, by the length of our vqysge, 
to kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed them*

and arrived at bay of All Saints in the Brazils, m about twenfy-two

sea were at an end, — ^my future mbs and cross monts were to hefid mo on

as the sea 

Onr ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supoxoirgo on board, who 
htis to direct all her motions after she amved at tho Cape, only being limited 
to a certain number of days for stav, by diarter-parfy, at fhe^several ports 
she WHS to go to This was nono of my business, neither did I meddle with 
it, my nephew, tiio captain, and the snpereoxgo, adjusting all those things

'We stayed at tho Cape no longer than was needftd to take in fresh water, 
but made tho best of onr way for tiie coast of Coromandel We 'ivero, indeed,

enough to name the ports and places whieh wo iondted and what ocontred

of tho trorld i^hQniTer I camCi 'went on ihoro aa often as I could It was on 
the fa^i sido of iho island fkat wo went on shore ono OToning and the 
peoplot who, hy the way, are Tory numerous, cixne thronging about ns, and 
stood irinng at ns at a diatinco but as we had traded freely with them, and 
h id btcu kSndlv used, wo thought onrsdves in no danger , but when we saw 
tbo people, wo cut three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them np at a 
distance from n^ ; which, it seems, is a mark in that country, not only of 
a trace and fnendship, but when it u accepted, the other set side np three 
poles or bongba, which i« a signal that tber accept the trace too, bat then 
thi« tree is a known condition of the trace, that yon ore not to pass b^nd 
ihnr three poles towards them, nor they to come past pnr three pdes, or 
boughs, towards you, so that you are porfeetl} secure within iho three poles, 
and ^11 tho space between your poles and theirs is allowed like a market for 
free eonrerse, traffic, and commerae When you go there, yon must not 
carry your weapons with tou and if they couio into that qiace, thqr ctick 
np thexr jatelins and lances all at the fint po^es, and come on unarmed , but 
i£ any Tiolcnce is offered them, and tho trnco thereby broken, away ihey ran 
to tho polc^, and hy hold of their weapons, and the trace is at an end 

It happened one eTcmng, when we wont on shore, that a greater number 
oi tbeir peqile came down than usual, but all Texj fnendly and citO , and 
they brought ^renil kiuds of proTiBions, for wludh we satisfied them with 
such toys as we had; tho women also brought ns nulk and roots, and 
eoToral things ronr aecoptabls to vs, and all was qmet, and we made ns a 
htUe hnt or hnl of some bought or trees, and hy on shore all night 

1 know not what was tho occasion, but I was not so well satisfied to lie 
on diore as the rest, and the boat riding at an anchor at about a stone’s 
cast from the land, with two men in her to take caro of her, I made one of 
them come on shore, and geitang somo boughs of trees to coTcrns also in 
the boat, 1 spread tbo swl on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the 
coier of tbo bmekes of tbo trees all night in tho boat 

Abont two o’clock in the monung, wo heard one of onr men mako a 
tcmblo noise on the shore, calling cut, for God’s sake, to bring the boat 
in, and eomo and help them, for they were all like to be murdered, at tbo 
same time, I heard the fite of Brt muskets, which was the number of gnus 
they had, and that throe times orer , for, it seems, the nahres here were 
not so ct^y frightened with guns os tho savages were in America, where 
I had to do with them All this while 1 know not what was the matter, 
bnt tousmg immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to 
bo ilmut in, and resolved, irith three fusees wo had on board, to land and 
assist onr men

We took np seres of osr men, andiTith difficult enough too, three of 
them bemg rexy ill wofinded, and that which was still worse was, that 
while we ^od in the boat to falm osr men in, we were in as much danger 
as they were m os ^ore , for they poured tiieir arrows xn spon ns so 
thick that we were glad to bamcado the side of &e boat np with the 
henehes, and two or three loose boards, which, to onr great aatis&ciaon, 
we had by mere accident in the boat And yet, had zt been dayhght, they 
arsi it seems, each exact marksmen, that if they conid hate seen hat the 
leort part of any of ns, th^ would hare been sore of ns We had, by 
the light of the moon, a IitQe nght of them, as thc^ stood pelting ns from 
the shore with darts and arrows and haruig got ready onr hre-aims, we 
gave them a ToUey, that we conid hear, by the ones of some of them, had 
wonnded several , however, the^ stood thus in battle array on the shore till 
hresde of day, wludi we si^^posed was that they might see the better to take

of the men taking the end of a tow-lme in his hand, and keeping one

ofihred some todeness to the wench that was with her, it whitdi the old 
woman made a great noise , howerer, the seamaiL would not qmi his pnze, 
but earned her out of the old woman’s sight among the trees, it beiig 
dmost dorh * the old woman went away without her, and as we may suppose, 
made an ontety among the people sho camo from ; who, npon notice, raised 
this great army npon us in three or font honxs, and it was great o^ hat 
wo an been d^troyed. 

One of out men was lolled with a lance thrown at him just at the 
beginning of the attach, as he sallied ont of the tent ihqrhad made: the 
rest camo off free, all bat the fellow who was the occasion of all the mis- 
dhiot, who paid dear enough far his black unstress, for we ooidd not hear 
what became of him for a great wbde We lay upon the shore two days 
after, though the wind presented, and made sigs^ lor him, and made 
our boat sail up shore and down share sereral leagne^ bnt in Taio, so 
we wero obliged to gnre bun orer, and if he alone had scared for it, the 
loss had been less 

I could not satisfy myself however, without Tentiiring on shore ouce 
more, to try if I could leom anything of him or them it was the third 
night after the aotion that I had a great mmd to learn, if I conld by any 
meansi, what xmsehief we had done, iaai how the gome stood on the Indiims* 
ddo I was careful to do it m the dork, lest we shonld he attacked agam , 
but I ought, indeed, to have boon sme that the men I went with had been 
under my command, before 1 engaged in a thing so hazardous and misohievous 
as I was brought into byit, without design* , 

We took twenty as stout fellowB with us as any in the ship, besides the 
ST^sreaxgo and myself, and we lauded two hours before midnfyht, at the 
same place where Ae Indians stood drawn up in the evenmg before I landed 
here, because 117 design, as I hate said, was chiefly to see if they had 
qoitied the field, audit *ihey had left any nmrkshehmd them of the mischief 
we had! done them , andlthonght ifwecoidd sarpriseoneortwoof them, 
perhaps wd^mfyht get onr man again, by way of engage 

Wo lasoided withont any noise, and divided our men mto two bodies, 
whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the other We neither saw 
nor heard anybody stir when we landed and we marched tq», one body 
at a distance, frmn &e other, to (he place, hut at first codld see nothing, 
it being very dark , tiU^by-aud-by our boatswain, who led the first party, 
etmnbled and fell over" a dead body This made them halt a while , for 
knowing by the mrcamstancm that th^ were at the place where the Indians 
had stood, they waited for my coming xx^ there We concluded to holt till \

Tucy went on a htUe war, aud found a cow tied to a tree , this, th^

cow went on before tbem, directly to tho town, which, as they reported, 
consi^cd of above two hundred houses or huts, and m some of these th^ 
found «eTCtal families bnng together. 

Here they found all in sdenee, os ptofounSlr secure as deep could make

The sight of theg poor inangled*Gomiade so enraged them, as hefoz^ that 
th^ srore to one anotiier th^ vcndd be revengedi and that not an 'Indian 
that mto their hands should have any quarter f and to work thejr 'VTont 
immediaidy, and yet not so madly as might be eo^ecfed from ihe rage and 
fury ihqr veto in. Their first care ifBS to get aomeibing that Tnmld soon 
take firoi but, after a httle search, thqr found that Trould be to no purpose, 
for most of the houses were lov, and thatched Tnth flags and rushes, of 'irbich 
the country is full, so thi^ presently made some uildfire, as yire call li^ by 
'iretfing a httle porrfo m tim palm of their hands, and in a quarter of an hour 
they set the tormon fire in four or fi.Te ^ces, and parbonlarly that house 
where the Indians were not gone to bed. ^ 

Ab soon as the fixe began to blaze, the poor frightened creatures h^gan 
to rush out to save their hres, hut mot with their fate m the attempt , and 
eapeaally at the door, where they droTO them back, the boatswain hunself 
killing one or two with hfr poleaxe The house bemg large, and many is 
it, he did not care to go in, bat called for a hand giennib, and threw it 
among them, which at first foghiened them, but, when it hnrst, made andi 
havoc among them that they cried out in a hideous numuer Ih short, most 
of the Indians who were in the open part of thehouse were killed or hurt 
with the gienado, except two or three more who pressed to the door, which 
the boatswain and two more kept, with theor bayonefe on the muzzles of their 
piecei^ and de^iched all that came in fheir way; hut there was another 
apartment m the house, where the piinca or inxg, or whaterer he was, 
and sereral others, were; and these were kept in tdl the houses which 
was by this time all in a light flame, feU m i^on them, and ih^ were 
smothered together 

AM this while they fixed not a gun, because they would not wdeen &0 
peoj^e faster than thqr could master thorn, hut the fire began to waken 
them fast enough, and our fdlows were glad to a little together in 
bodies, for the fire grew so raging, all the houses bemg made of, light 
combustible stuff, that thc^ oodd hardly bear the street between them', and 
their business was to follow the fixe, for the surer execution as fast as the 
fire either forced the people out of those houses which, wroe huziung, or 
fioghiened them out of others, our people were ready at their doors to knock 
them on the head, still cal li n g aid haDomng one to another to remember

the poor fellow hanging, with Ii& throat out* 

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time would have been

remembered Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi—*’ Onrsed be their 
anger, for it was fierce , and fhmr wrath, for it was cruel ” But I had now 
a new task upon my bands; for when the mou I earned with me saw the

had with the others, nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and fold 
me, in their heanng, (hat he was only oonceimed for fear of the men being 
overpowered, and as to tho people, he thought not one of them ought to 
live , for thoy had all glutted themselves wiSi the muidor of the poor man, 
and that thoy ought to bo used like nnudoreis Upon these words, away 
ran eight of my men, with the boatswain and bis crew, to complete their

I confess, to ventnro baok as it were alone , for as it began now to bo almost

armed with lances and bows, at the little place where the tirdve or thirteen

Thb ww a hAitl oHicIq upon him, vtio Icueu his ohbgntion to mo, and did 
not know hotr 1 might inkc it , so ho began to talk smarQy to thorn , told 
them f hot I was a rety considerahio otmor of iho sbip, and that^ in jnstzeo, 
bo could not put mo out of my own houso , that this was next door to serving 
mo 05 (ho famous pttnto Kfdd had dono, who made a mntmy m the ship, set 
the raptam on shoxo on on uninhabited island, and ran away with tiio dup , 
that let thorn go into what ship thqr would, if orer tlioy came to 
again. It would eo«t them Tory dear, that iho ship was mine, and that he 
could not put me ont of it , and that ho woidd rathmr lose toe ship, and the 
TOfTOi^ too, th in <lt«ohhge mo so much , so they might do as they ]^ea8ed 
UowGicr, ho would go on bhoro and talk with mo, and mrited the boatswain 
to go with him, and perhaps they might accommodato the matter with me 
fiat they oU rejected the pn^nl, and said they woidd hare nothii^ to do 
with me any mote; and if I camo on board, thi^ would all go on shore 
'^TToll,” said tho captiin, <'iC yon are all of this mind, lot mo go on shore 
and (ilk with him So away ho enmo to me with this account, a littio after 

the mcssigo hod been bronght to me from iho coxswain 

I was rory glad to seo ray nophow, I must confoa , for 1 was not without 
apprchcn.«iDn« that they wotdd conflno him by vxolonco, sot snal, and nm away 
with tho ship , and then I had boon stripped naked in a romoto eountxj, 
htiing nothing to help mjsolf , m short, I had boon in a wone case than 
when I was alone in the island, fiat they had not oomo to that length, it 
seems, to m\ saiiRfoction, and when my nephew told luo what they had said 
to lorn, and how they bad awom and shook hands that they wonid, one and 
all, Wro Qio ship if I was ^crod to come on board, I told him be dionld 
not bo concct*ied at it at all, for I wonid stay on shore I only desired be 
would toko caro and Sfind mo all my nceos^inry tlunga on shore, and learo me 
a sufficient sum of mon^i and T would find my waj to England as well as 
1 could. 

Uiis was a heiTj pioco of news to my mqphew, but there was no way to 
hdp it hot to comply, so, in short, ho went on hoard the ship again, and 
sntisfiod the men (bat bis uncle had jidded to thmr unportanify, and had sent 
for his goods from on board iho ship, so that the matter was orermafew 
Iionni, iho men relumed to their duty, and 1 began to consider what course 
I shoidd steer. 

I was now alone in the most remote port of tho world, as I think I may 
call it, for I was near three thousand longues by sea farther off from 
England, than! wos at my island , only, it is true, I might tmvd here by 
land over tho Great Mogul’s country to Surat, nught go from thence to 
Hasson by sea, up tho Gulf of Foraa, and take tho way of the coraTans, 
oTcr tho ficsort of Arabia, to Aleppo and Scanderoon, firom thence by sea 
again to Italv, and so OMicland into France, and this put together, might 
at least bo a full diameter of the globe or mors 

I had another way hoforo me, whioh was to wait for some Ei^bsh ships.

come amiss to me. 

It was, however, some tune before we eonld get a ship to onr Tnftrd*?, and 
when we had got a '\esse 1 , it was not easy to get English sailors « that is to 
say, 80 many as wore neoe^saxy to goiem tbe^vo}age oiid managd the 
saQoxs which we shonld pick up there After some time we got a mote, 
a boatawom, and a gunner, English, a Outdi carpenter, and three foremast 
men 'With these we found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen, 
such as they wme, to male up 

There are so many travellerB who have written a history of iheir voyages 
and txaveb this way, that it wouM be lory little diversion to anybody to give 
a long account of the places ww went to, and the people who inhabit there , 
theso -Oungs I leave to others, and refer the reader to those journals and 
tzavds of Englishmen, of whidi mox^ I find ora pnbli:»hed, and more 
promised everj day, it is enot^h for mo to tdl you that we made this 
voyage to Aebm, in the idond of Sumatra, and from thence to Sicnu where 
we exchanged some of oux waiOb for opinm and some orrad:, the Urst 
a commodity which hears a great pnee among the Chinese, and which, at 
that tinie, was much wanted there In a word, we went up to Suskan, made 
avery great voyage, were eight months out, and returned to Bengal, and I 
was very wdl satisfied with my adventara I ohserve that our people m 
ygngbnd often adnuie how officers, whidi the Company send into India, 
and the merchants which generall) stay there, get vezy great estates 
as they do, and sometimes come home worth sixty or seventy thousand 
pounds at a tune, hut it is no wonder, or at least we shall see so much 
farther into it, wheii we Consider the nmumerahle ports and places where 
they have a fr^ commerce, that it wiU he none; and much leas it will be 
BO when we consider that at those places and ports where the English ships 
come, there is such great and constant demands for the growth of aU other 
counfzies, that there is a certam vent for toe xetoms, as well as a market 
abroad for the goods corned out 

In dior^ we mode a very good voyage, and I got b 6 mudi money by my 
first adventure, and such an insight mto toe method of getimg more, that 
bad I been twenfy years younger, 1 should hare been tempted to have 
stayed here, and sought no farther for making ooy fortune, but wbat was 
all this to a man upwards of three-score, that was xioh enough, and came 
abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than a 
Govetons de^ of gaimng by iiP And, indeed, I tbii^ it is with great 
justice I now call it restless desire, for it was so. When I was at home, 
I was rcfUess to go abroad; and when I wras abroad, I was restless to be 
at homo I say, what ras this gam to me? I was ndi enough already,

tcLuig do\m fheir sail, and runnu^ all to the head of the boal^ to keep her 
from fiiuling; so she ky and 1 ^ enough of it, but seeing the foremost 
boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particidnr Tniile 
this was doing, one of ihe three boats that was behind, being forwarder than 
the other two, made up to the boat whiidi we had disaldcd, to relieve her, 
and we could see her take out the men we called again to the foremost boat, 
and ofiered a truce, to parley again, and to know what her hnsmess was with 
us , but had no answer, only she crowded close under our stem Upon ibis, 
our gunner, who was a very dexterous fdlow, ran out his two ohose-gun^ 
and fired again at her, but the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, 
waved their caps, and come on , but the gunner, getting quu&ly ready again, 
fired among them a second time, one diet of wiuoh, though it missed the boat 
Itself, yet fdl in amoi^ the men, and we could easily see hod done a great 
deal of misobiof amoiig them, but we took no notice of that, wore the sliq> 
ogam, and brought our quarter to bear upon them, and ixmg throe guns 
more, we foimd the boat was almost spbt to pieces , in particnlar, her rudder 
and a piece of her stem was shot qmte away, so they handed her sail imme- 
diately, and were in great disorder But^ to complete their misfortune, our 
gunner lot fly two guns at them again; where he hit them we oould not tell, 
butwe found the boat was dnking, and some of the men already in the wato 
upon Ihi^ I immediatdy manned out our pinnace, which we kept dose by 
onr side, with orders to pid. np some of the men, if they could, and save them 
from drowning, and immediatdy come on board the ship with them, beoanse 
we saw the rest of tho boats began to come np Our, men in the ^nnace 
idlowed ihdr orders, and took up threo men, one of whom was just drown- 
ing, and it was a good while before we could recover him As soon as th^ 
were on hoard, we crowded dlfhe sail we could make, and stood farther out 
to soa, and wo found that when the other three boats come up tothefixs^ 
they gave over their chase. 

Bdng thus ddivered from a danger, whidi, thoii^ X knew not the reason 
of it, yet seemed to be much greater tW I apprehended, I resolved that we 
sbonld obange onr oonne, and not let any one know whitber we were going , 
50 we stood ont to sea eastward, qmte ont of the course of all European ships, 
wheth er they were hound to Ohma or anywhere else, within the commexce of 
the European nations 

When we were at sea, we h^an to consult with the two seamen, and 
inquire what the meaning of all this should be , and the Duichmaii let us mto

some of our goods . upon this^ thoy took it ior^uted tre all belonged to 
then, andairay they cane directly upon our nen^ as if it had been in a line* 
of^haitle 

Our men sedhg so many of them, begin to be lightened, for ire lay bnt 
in an ill posture to dght,aBd med out to ns to hnow what th^y should do 
I immediately called to the men that worked upon fke stages^ to dip 
them down, and got up the side into the and hade those in the boat to 
tow round aud cone on board , and the few who were on hoard worked with 
oU iho strength and hands we had to bnng the ship to rights* bnt, howerer, 
neither the men upon the stages nor those in the boats c^d do as ther were 
ordered, before Uie Goehm Ctunese were upon them , and two of their boats 
boarded our Jo&g*boat, and began to lay hdd of the men as their pxiaimem 

The first roan they laid hold of was an Engli^ seaman, a siont^ strong 
fellow, who haring a musket in hu hand, nerer o&xed to ^ it, hut laid it 
down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought , but he understood his business 
better than 1 could teach him for he grappled &e Pagan, and 
by mam force out of tbeir boat into ours, where, takmg him by the ears, he 
beat his head so against the boat's gunnel, tfait the felioir died in his hands , 
and, xn the mean time, a Dutchmen, who stood next, took rsp the musket, 
aud with tho butt-end of it so laid about lum, that he knocked down fire of 
them who attempted to enter the boat. Buttiiis was doing little towards re* 
»sting thirty or for^ men, who, fmless because ^oxant of their danger, 
b^u to tluw themselves into the long-boat, where we had but fire men in 
all to defend it; but the ioUowix^ aemdent, which deserved our laughter, 
giro onr men a complete victorv. 

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship, as wdl 
05 to pay the seams where he hod calked her to stop tiie leaks, had got 
two kettles }ust let down into the boat, one filled with boSmg pitch, and 
tbs other with zo«xtt, tallow, and ml, and sndi stuff ns tite shxpwnghts 
use for that work ; and the man that attended the carpenter had a great 
iron ladle in lus band, with winch he suppHed the men that were at 
work with the hot stuff* Two of the enemy's men entered the boat jost 
where this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets ; he immediately saluted 
them with a laSe-fdll of the stuff, boiling hot, winch so burned and sc^ed 
them, bong half-naked, that iher roared out bulls, and, enraged with toe 

fire, leaped boto into the sea The carpeuter saw i^ and cried out^ **^€11

takes one of the mtp^ and dipping it to the pitoh-pot, he and Ins man threw 
it among them so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in the ttoe boats,

till wo came to the latitude of 22 degrees 30 minutes, by which means wo 
made the island Formosa directly, where ire came to an anchor, in oxder to 
get water and fresh proTisions, which tha peojde there, who are Texy coartoons 
and oinl in them maxmezB, supplied us with willmgly, and dealt Tory fairly 
and punotually with ns in all their agreements and Imgains , which is what 
we did not find among other people, and may be owing to the remains of 
Chnstianity which was once planted here by a Dutch missionary of Pro- 
testants, and 18 a testimony of what I hare often observed, vu , that the 
Ohnstian religion always civilizes the people and reforms their manners, 
where it is received, whelber it works saving effects upon them or no 
'From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at an 
equal distance, fill we knew we wore he}ond aU the ports of China where 
our European ships usually come, being resolved, if possible, not to foil 
into any of their hands, especially in this country , where, os our cixcnm- 
stanoes were, we could not fail of beuKlg entirely ruined 

Bmg now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolied to put into 
the first trading port we should come at, and standing in for the shore, a 
boat came off two leagues to us with an old Portuguese pilot on board, who, 
knowing us to be an European sbip, came to offer his service, which, indeed, 
we were glad of, and took lam on hoard, upon which, without asking ns 
whither we woidd go, he dismissed the boat ho came in, and sent it back 
I thoi^ht It was now so much in our choice to make the old man carry 
us whither we would, that I began to talk to him about carrying us to the 
Gulf of Kanquin, which u the most northern part of the coast of Ctima 
The old man said ho knew the Gulf of I^onqum very well, but «>miling, 
asked us what we would do there P I told him wo would sell our cargo and 
purchase China wares, calicoes, raw dike, tea, wrought silks, d.c , aud so 
would return by the same course we came He told ns onr best port would 
have been to pui in at Macao, where we could not have failed of a market 
for our opium to our satisfaction, aUd might for our money have purchased 
all serts of China goods as cheap as we could at S'anqmiL 

Hot bsuig able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he was very 
opinionated cr conedted, I told him we were gentlemen as well as merchants, 
and that we had a mind to go and seo the grcit city of Pekin, ana tho

W'o all agreed to go laelc to this plaoe, the name of the port, u he

, fpondod rvith called it by a different name from that rrhieh onr Fortogneso

mtec, on both whieh occasions tho people of the conntry were very cinl to 
n*, and breoghi abnndanco of things to sell to us , I mem of provisions, 
plants, roots, tei, nee, and some fowls , but nothing without money 

We did not come to tho other port (the wind being contrary) for five 
days, hnt it was very much to onr saUslaotion , and I was joyfd, and I 
may sar thanUnl, when I set my foot on shore, resolving, and my partner 
too, that if it was possible to dispose of onrsolvos and effeots any other 
wa^, though not every way to onr eihsfaohon, we would never set one foot 
on ^td that unhappy vessel more , and indeed, 1 must aclnouledge, that 
of sU tho cmmmstanecs of life that over I hod any experience of, nothing

Wdl does tho Scnptnro say, "The fear of man hnngs a snare ” it u 
a life of death, and tho mind is so entuely oppressed 1 ^ that it m 
capable of no relief 

Nor did it fall of its nsoal operations upon tho fiincy, by hdghtening

tho coniso we stoored, onr franlly showing onrsolvos, snd entering into 
snch and snch ports, and even out very manner, tho fbioe we hod, tho 
number of men, tho few arms, the litilo ammunition, short provuuma, 
all these would have served to convinoo nny men that we were no pirates 
Tho opmm and olhot goods wo Lid on hoitd would mike it appeir the

that I, nho hnd spent forty jeatb in a life of eontmnal difficdties, and

After these thoughts, something of religion tronld oome m, and I 
tronld bo considonng that this seemed to me to he a disposition imme- 
diate Prondeneo, and I ought to look npon it and submit to it as such , 
that although I xm innocent as to men, I nas far from being umocent as

In 1(1 itom, natoxal courage would somotimos take its phee, and then 
I would be talking myself up to vigorous rescdntions , tiiat 1 would not 
bo taken to bo birbazously used by a parcel of meroiless wretches, in cold 
Idood; thii it were mn6h better to have Mien into tho hands of tho 
savngos, thongh I was snre they would feast upon me when they hod 
taken mo, than those who would perhaps glnt their rage upon me by 
inhuman tortures and barbanties, t^t in tho case of the savages, I always 
resolved tc die fightmg to the lost gasp, and why should I not do so now, 
seeing it was much more dreadful, to me at least, to think of fallmg mto 
these men^s hands, than ever it was to think of being e*iten by men P for 
tho samges, give them ihtSx dno, would not eat a man till he was killed 
and dead, bni that these men had many arts beyond the cmeltv of death 
Whenever these thoughts prevailed, 1 was sure to put myself into a kind 
of fever with tho agitation of a supposed fight, my blood would boil, and 
my eyes spnrUc ns if I wn<i engaged, and I always resolved to take no 
quarter at their hands, but, eion, at list, if I could resist no longer, 
I would blow up the ship and all that was in her, and leave them but 
little booty to boast of 

The greater weight {he ansieUos and porplonhes of these things were 
to our thoughts while we were at sea, tho greater was our satisfaction when 
wo saw ourselves on shore , and my partner told me he dreamed that he 
had a very heavy load npon his back, which ho was to cany np a hill, and

csiiavans ore subject to be at^kedby the i^bs, so are these b^ the Tartars, 
but the) are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so harbarous 
when they prevail * 

The company consisted of people of several nations, but tiiere were 
above sixty of them meicbanta or uduLbitanta of liosoow, though of thm 
some were InTonians , and to our parbenlax satuhiotion, five of them were 
Scots, who appeared also to be men of great expenence in busmess, and of 
very good substance 

Vnien we had travdled one day’s journey, the guides, who were Sve in

for the necessary expense of buying forage ou the way, where it wae not

waro. Tho outside, which the sun shono hot upon, was i^sed, and looked 
rety well, perfectly white, and painted with Uno figures, as the laige China 
ware in England u pointed, and^hard at if it had boen bmed. As to 
tho tnnde, all the walls, instead of wainsco^ were lined with hardened 
and painted tiles, like tho little square tiles wo call golley-tdes in England, 
all made of the finest China, and the figures exceeding fine indeed, with 
extxaoidinaxy Tanety of eolonn, muod with gold, many tries making but one

that it was rccy hard to see where the tilos met Tiio floors of the rooms

In two days moroi mto passed the great Cimawaili made for a forfifioa1i6n

I stood still an hour or thereabonts without trespas«iDg our orders (for so

“ Seignior, do you think it would stand out an army of our country people, 
with a good tram of artdlery, or our engineers, with two companies of

he was dumb all the test of the way, and we heard no more of lus fine story

After we passed this nughty nothing, caQed a wall, sometidng like the 
Plots' wall, BO famous in Northumberland, built the Somans, we began 
to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people rather oonfined to live in 
fortified towns and mhes, as being subjeot to the inroads and depredations of 
the Tartars, who rob m great s^es, and therefore are not to be resisted by 
tiie naked uduibitants of an open oonntry And here I began to find the

loss than ten minutes, a troop of forty or fifty more appeared, at aboat a 
milo distance , bnt our work svas over first, as it happened 

One of the Scots merehants of Moscow happened to bo amongst ns, and os 
soon os he heard the horn, ho told us that wo had nothing to do but to charge 
them immediately, withont loss of time , and drawing us up m a Ime, ha 
naked if wo wero resolved Tre told him we were leaSy to fidlow him , so 
ho rode directly towards them Thei stood gazing it us like a mere etowd, 
drawn up in so order, nor showing the face of any order at all , hot as soon 
as thoy saw ns adnnee, they lot flv their arrows, whiidi, however, mused 
ns very happily it seems they mutook not their aim, bnt their distance , ^ 
for their artoira all fell a little short of ns, bnt with so trne on aim, that had 
wo been about twenfy yards nearer, wo must have bod sevprnl men wounded, 
if not killed 

Immediately we halted, and thongh it was at a greit distance, we fired, < 
and sent them leaden bnllots for wooden itrows, following our ehot full 
gallop, to fill m among thorn ewoxd in hand, for so om bold Scot that led 
ns duceted Hb was, ihdeod, but a mendiant, bnt be behaved with such 
vigour and bravery on ton occasion, and yot with snob cod oooiage too, 
that I never saw any man in action fitter for eommind As soon as we 
up to them, we fired onr putols m then foees, and then drew, bat 
thoy fied m the greatest oonfdsion imiginable. The only stand any of 
them made was on onr right, where three of them stood, and, by signs, 
fpPaa the rest to oome hook to them, having a land of seimitat m their

had not a man blled or hurt, tmt as for Ihe Ihxtari^ there irexo about hra 
of them bUed, how many were wounded we Imew not , but this wo knew, 
that the other parfy wore bo fiightened with the noise of our guns, that 
they made oif, and never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all thu while in the Ohmese domnuons, and therefore tbo 
Tartars were not so bold as afterwards , but In about five dap we entered 
a Tast, great) wild desert, wiudh held us three dap' aud nights' mirohi 
and we were obliged to cany our water wiQi us in great leathern bot^es, 
and to encamp ^ n^ht, ]uat as I hare heard they do in the desert of 
Arabia 

I asked our guides whoso dominion this wus in and they told mo this 
was a kind of border, that might be called no man’s land, being a part of 
Great EaraLathy, or Grand Tartaxy , but, howeter, it wus all reokoned as 
bdonging to Qlu^, but that there was no care taken here fo preserve it 
from the inroads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert 
in the whole march, fiiongh we were to go over some much huger, 

Li passmg this wilderness, which was at first very frightM to me, we 
saw, two or ihxee times, little parhes of tiie Tartan, but they seemed to be 
upon fheir own affam, and to hare no design t^on us, and so, bke the 
man who met the devil, if they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing 
to say to them we let rtiem go Once, however, a parfy of them came so 
near as to stand and gare at us, whetto it was to consider if they should 
attack us or not, we knew not , but when we had passed at some distonoo 
by Ihom, we made a rearguard of forty men, and stood ready for- them, 
letting the caravan pass half a mile or fiiexeabouts before us, but after 
a while they manhed off, only we found they saluted us with five arrows 
at their parting, which wounded a horse so that it disabled him, and we 
left him the nest day, poor creature, in great need of a good fomer ibey 
might shoot more arrows whush mig^t fidl short of us, but we saw no more 
arrows or Tartars that time 

travelled near a month after thu, the wup not being so good os at 
first, though utdl in the domimons of the Emperor of Obina, hut lay for 
the most part m the villages, some of which were fortified, because of the 
mcursums of tha Tartars we were came to one of these towns (it 

was about two dap and a halfa ]Oum^ before we came to fihe afy of 
ETanm}, I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenfy to be sold aU' 
the way upon that road, and horses also, such as they are, because, so many 
caravans oommg ihat way, ih^ are often wonted. The person that I spoke 
totogetmeacamd, would have gone and fetched one forme, butl,like^

gioond, walled tomid with a stono wall, piled ap dry, without mortar or 
e*iTth among it, liko a park, with a litUe gaaid of dunese soldiers at the 
door Having honght a camel, and agreed for the pnee, X came away, 
the Chuicso man that went with me led the camd, when on a sudden come 
up five Tartars on horseback, two of them sdzed the fellow and took the 
CTOd from him, while the o&er three stepped np to me and mr old pilot, 
seeing ns, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about mo but my 
sword, which could bat ill defend me against three horsemen The first • 
that came np stopped diort upon my drawing my sword, for they are arrant 
cowards ; hut a second, coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the head, 
which I never felt till afterwords, and wondered, when I came to myself, 
what was the matter, and where I was, for he laid me flat on the ground , 
hut my never-feiluig old pilot, the Fortngnese (so Fnmdonoe, nolooked for, 
directs ddiremnoes from dangers whioh to ns are unforeseen), bad a pistol 
in his pocket, whioh I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars either , if they 
had, X suppose they would not have attacked ns« bat cowards ore always 
boldest when there is no danger The old man seeing me down, with a 
hold heart stepped to the fellow that had strode mo, and laying hold of 
his arm with one hand, and polling him down by mam force a little towards 
him, with the other diot him xn the head, and laid him dead upon the ^ot 
He then unmediatdy stopped np to him who had stopped ns, as 1 said, and 
lefore he could come forward agam, made a blow at him with a scimitar, 
which he olways wore, hut missing the man, struck his horse in the side 
of his head, cat one the ears off the root, and a great slice down by 
the side of his fiioo The poor beast, enraged with the woond, was no 
snore to bo governed by his nder, though the fellow sat well enough too, 
but away ho flew, and -earned him quite out of the pilot’s reach, and 
at some distance nsing upon hia hmd legs, threw down the Ghrtar, and 
fell upon him 

In this interval, the poor Chmese came in who had lost the camel, but 
be had no weapon however, soemg the Tartar down, and hu horse ^en 
upon him, away he mns to him, and seizing npon on ugly lU-fiivonzed 
weapon he hod hy his ade, something like a poleaxe, but not a poleaxe 
neither, ho wrenched it £com him, and made sl^t to knock his Tutanan 
brains out with it Bat my old man had the thud Tartar to^deal with 
still, and seeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor come on to fi^ht him, 
as he apprehended, hnt stood stoidr still, the old man stood still too, and 
fdl to work with hu tadUe to charge hu putol agam , bat as soon as the 
Tartar saw the pistol, away he seoa^, and left my pQo^ my champion I * 
called bun afterwards, a complete victory 

By tins tune I was a little recovered , lor I thought when I first began 
to wnLe, ihatlhad been m a sweet doqp , but, as I said above, I wondered 
where I was, how I came npon the ground, and what was the matter but

a few momenta after, aenao tdtnmedi I felt pain, though I did not know 
where, ao I clapped my hand to m) head, and took it awayhioodj i then 
I felt my head odio ; and then m o moment memor> rotunxcd, and ever}* 
thmg was present to mo again I jumped upon mj fcot mstantlj, and got 
hold of my tword, bnl no eUoiiiios were in tiow I found a tartar lying 
dead, and his horse Bionding tdr) qtiietl) hj him , and, lookuig farther, 

I saw my champion and deliverer, who had been to see what tho Chinese 
had done, coming back with his liangcr in lus hand ; the old man, seeing 
me on my feet, came mnning to me, nnd embraced me with h grcit dell' 
of joy, being afraid beforo that I had boon killed , and seeing me hloodtr, 
woidd see how X was bars, but it was not much, onlj what we call a 
broken head, neither did I afterwards And any great inconvoaieneo from 
the blow, for it was wdl again in two or tiirce d*i^s > 

TTo made no great gam, bowevor, by this vieioqr, for wo lost a camel 
and gamed a horso; Imt that which was remarkable, when wo came back 
to tho Tillage, the man demanded to bo paid for iho camel, 1 disputed it, 
and it was brought to a hearing before the Chmeso judge of the place *to 
giro him hiS dno, ho acted with a groat; deal of pmdenet and impturtuLtj , 
and, haTing heatd botli sides, ho gxarely aSkod the Oltineso man that went 
with me to hnj iho camel, whoso aerrant ho was F X am no semnt^*'

I confess the thing was so dear, that I had not a word to say ; hat, 
admixing to see sudi jnst rcaSuniug upon iho conseqnenbe, and an accurate 
statmg of the case, X paid wiUmgly for the camel, and sent for anoihtr; 
hut, jon maj obsorvo, I did dot go to feieh it mjsolf any more, for I had 
had enough of that ' 

The oity of Naum is a frodtier of the Chinese empituj the) call it 
fortified, and bo it is, os forhficaboiu go there , for this I will Tontiuo to* 
affirm, that all the Xarlaxa in Aaxakaiha}, which, 1 behcTc, are somo 
milbons, could not hatiitr down the Walls lath their haws and arrows , but 
to call it strong, if it were attacked with cannon, would be to make those 
who understand it laugh at yon 

Wo wanted, as X have said, above two days' jdnrnqr of flus cur, when 
messengers were sent express to every part of tho road to tell nil travdlors 
and oaravans to halt tdl thby had a gudtd sent for them , for that an 
nnnsuri Ix^ of Tartom, making ton thousand in all, had appeared in iho

This was very bad news to travellers J however, it was carefully done 
of the governor, and wo were tety glad to hoar we should have a guard.

ti was early in the moraing, when, rearehing from a well aahmted little

fetry , and, had the Tartars had any intaUigenoo, then had been the tuna 
to liaro attacked when the camTon beu^ orer, the rear goaid was 
behind, bni they did not appear there. About three Iionn after, when we 
were entered npon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles otoc, behold, 
by a dond of dust they xaued, we saw an 0 noni> was at hrad* and filer 
were at band i»deed| for they eamo on npon the spur 

The Chmose, car guard in the front, who had talked so big the day 
before, began to stagger , and tho soldiers frequently looked behind thorn, 
which is a coriain sign in a soldier fiiat he is just ready to tun away Hy 
old pilot was of mj mind, and boizig near me, oaUed out, ** Seignior

and the TCtft made a Imo of rosene , and so we marched, leaving the last 
two hundred men to make a body by themselves, and to guard thf camels , 
only that, if need were, they should send a hundred men to assist the 
last fifty* 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an umnmexabte company they 
were* howmany weeouU not tcU, bnt ten ihoosand, we thonght, was the 
least, a party of them came on fimt and mewed onr posture, tcaversing the 
ground m the front of our Ime and, os we found them withm gunshot, 
our leader ordered the two wings to advanco swiftly, and give thmn a salvo 
on each wing with their shot, whidi was done, andthey went ofT, I suppose 
back, to give an account of the reoepiicn they wexo like to meet with , and, 
indeed, that salute deyed iheir stomachs, for th^ immediately halted, 
stood nwhile ib consider of it, and wheeling off to tho lefl^ they gaie over

'We \iraz6 &ow latmdhed into the greatest piece of solid ^s Tth| if 1

three thonsand, if we left tiiat sea, and went on west, to the Bniuh and 
Freneh ohannds we had full five ^onsand miles to the Indian 0 ^ Persian 
sea, sonth , and abont eight hnndred to the Frozen sea, north. Nay, if some 
people may be bdieved, there might be no sea north-east till we came round 
tho pole, and eonseqneufly mto the noifh-wesi, and so had a continent of 
land into Amerioa, the Iiord knows where , though I could give some 
reasons wli^ I believe that to be a mistake. 

As WD entered into the Unteovite dominions a good while before we c ^m e 
to any oonndexable towns, we had nothing to observe there but this, first, 
that all the nvers mn to the east as I understood hj the dhaxts, which 
some in our caravan had with them, it was plain dl those nvers ran mto the 
great nver Tamour, or Gamonr, which xivet, by the natnral ooone of i1^ 
must run mto the Bast Sea, or COnnese Ocean The story fh^ tell ns, that 
the moadi of thu nver u <hoked up with bulnuhes of a monstrous gmwth, 
VIZ , throe feet about, and twenty or thirty feet high, I mnst be allowed to 
say, Ibdievenoihmgof it, but, as its navigation la of no use, because there 
u no trade that way, the Thrtais, to whom it alone hdongs, dealmg m 
nothmg bat cattle, so nobody that over I heard of has been canons enough 
either to go down to the mouth of it m boats, or come up from the mouth of 
it m dups, as far as I can find but this is oertam, that tins nver zunnmg 
east, in the latitude of about 60 degrees, oaixies a vast concourse of tivezs 
along with it, and finds an ocean to empty itself in fliat latitude co we are 
sure of sea there 

Some leagues to the north of this nver, there are several considerable 
rivers, whose Btxeams run as due north as Yamour runs east, and these 
ore found to ]om their waters with the great nver Tartarus, named So 
from the noxtheramost nations of the Mogul Taxtaxs , who, as the Chmeso 
say, were the first Tartaxa m the world, and who, as our geographers 
allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned m saered history. These nvers 
running all northward, as wdl as all the other nvers I am to speak 0 ^ 
it evident that the nor&em ocean bounds the lands alro en that side ; 
so fiiat it does not seem rational m the least to think that the land can extend 
itself to ]om with Amenca on that ride, or that there is not a commumeation 
between the northern and eastern ocean but of this I riiall say no mote , it 
was my observation at that time, and therefore I fake notioe of it m this

If It cost lum his life So we agreed to go, only we three, I had, indeed,

me to the utmost, and upon all occasions, for my defonee , hnt this was an

we three and my man-serrant, and to put it in exeention that night ahont 
midnight^ with all the seeres} imagiimhle 

Howeror, upon second thoughts, we were willing to delay it tdl tiie next 
night, because the caiaran being to sot forward in the monnng, we supposed 
the governor could not pretend to give them any satis&ohon upon us when 
we were out of his power. The Scots merohant, as steady in hu xesdution 
for tho enterpxisD as bold in exeoutmg, brought me a Tartar* s robe or gown 
of shooposkins, and a bonno^ with a bow and arrows, and had provided the 
same for himself and his countcymen, that the poc^Ie, if th^ saw us, should 
not determine who we were 

All the first night wo spent in miting up some oomhuatiUe matter with 
aqua vifo, gunpowder, and suoh other materials os we could get , and hamg 
n good quanhij of tar in a bttle pot, about an hour after night we set out 
upon our expedition 

TV'e came to tho place ahont deven o*oloek at nighty and found that the 
people had not the least jealousy of danger attending their idol The night 
was cloudy, }ot the moon gave ua l^ht enough to see that the idol stood 
just in the same posture and place that it did before 31ie people seemed to 
he all at their rest, only that m the great hnt, or tent, as we called it^ 
where wo saw the three priests, whom we mistoi^ for bntohers, we saw a 
l^ht, and going up dose to the door, we heard people talkmg as if there 
were five or six of fliem , wo condudod, therefore, that if we set wildfire to 
the idol, theso men would come out immediatdy, and run up to tiie place to 
roscQo it fxom tho destruction that we intended for it , and what to do with 
them wo knew not Once we thonj^t of oanying it away, and seitmg fire 
to it at a distance, hnt when we came to handle we found it too bulky for 
our carriage , so we were at a loss The second Scotsman was for 

setting fire to tho tent or hut, and knookmg the creatures that were there on

ifiHing thorn, if it were possiUe to avoid it ** ‘Well, then,’* said the Soots 
merchant, "I will tell jou what we will do, wo wall try to make them 
prisoners, tie thoir hands, and make them stand and see their idol destcoyed ” 

As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough ahont us, whi^ we 
used to tie our firelocks together with so wo resolved to atiaeik these people 
first and with as little noise as we ooidd The firstihing we did, we knocked 
at the door, when one of the pnests, coming to it, we immediately seised 
upon stopped his .month, and ti^ his hands behind him, and led him 
to the idol, where we gagged him tiiat ho might not make a noise, tied his 
feet also together, and left him on the ground

man, taking dhargo of iho two men oltend j bound, and lied together alto by 
tho arm, led them away to the idol, end left them ihero to sea if their idol 
wDidd x^ero them, making hasto back to xu

In a word, we took them, hound them as wo hud dono tho other, aud all 
without any noise 1 should have said wo brought them out of the honso or

ButtheafEairdidnotendso, the next day came a great number of the

satufoohon of the Bussmn gorernor for the insoltuig fhenr priests, and burn* 
ing them gre*it Cham Chi-Thaungu The peoj^e of Sertsin^hay 'were at 
first in a great eonsternafion, for they said the Tartars -were already no less 
than fiurty thousand strong The Snssisn gorernor sent out messengers to 
appease them, and gare them all the good words imaginable , assuring them 
that he knew nothing of it, and fiiat there had not a soul in his garrison 
beenabroad, so that it could not be from anybody there but if ih^ could let 
him know who did it, they Aould be CDcemjdanly pnnidied. Th^ returned 
haughtily, that all the country tefretanccd the great Cham Ghi^Thaungn, 
'Who dwdt in file sun, nnd no mortal would hnye dared to ofier nolenoe to

cxeanfs and Christians 

The govemor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach, or to hare 
any cause of 'war olle^ to he giyen by him, fiie Czar haring stnctly 
charged him to treat the conquered counby 'with genflenens and cinlify, 
gave them stQl all the good words he could At last he told them there was 
a cararen gone towards Sussia that monung, and perhaps it was some of 
them who had done them this injury; and that if they would he satisfied 
with that, he would send after them to inquire into it This seemed to 
appease them a litfie , and accordingly the goyernor sent after ns, and gave 
ns a particular account how the filing waa intimating 'withal, thatif anyin

I haro notiung matonal to say of my particular nStSxB till I mwA to 
Tobolsk}, tho capital oity of Siberia, where I oomtinned some time on the 
following acoount 

Wo hid novf hoen almost seven months on ofur jonrnoy, and winter began 
to como on apace , whoronpon my partner and I called a eounoil about oar 
particular aHhin, in which we found xt ptoper, as we were bound fpr 
Hogland, and not for Moscow, to consider bow to dispose of oursdves 
Tho) told ns of sledges and Temdeor to carry ns over tho snow in the winter 
time, and, indeed, they have such things that it would be incredible to 
relate tho particulars of, by wbidh means tho Rnssiana travel xuorp m wmtor 
than they can in summer, as in those sledges they ore able to run night and 
day , tho snow, being frmen, is one universal oovonng to nature, by which 
the hills, Mdes, mera, and ^kes ate oil smooth and herd os a stone, and 
the) nm upon tho surface, without any rpgnxd to what is nndemeaih 

Cut I had no occasion to nrge a winter journey of this kind I was 
hound to England, not to Moscow, ond my route lay two ways either I 
must go on os tho caravan wont, till I came to Jarodaw, and then go off west 
for STatva, and tho Gulf of Fu^nd, and so cn to Santzio, where 1 might 
posBiU) sell my Ghtna cargo to good advantage, or I mnst leave the 
eamvan at a liitie town on ^ Dwina, from whence I had hut sh days by 
water to Archangel, and from thenoo might be sure of sbippuig either to 
England, Holland, or Hambntgh 

How to go any of these journeys in the wmtor would have been pze« 
posterous ; for as to Hanizio, tho lUtio would have been frosen up, and 1 
could not got passage , and to go by land in those oountnes was for less 
safe th an among the Mogul Tartars, likewise, to go to Arohangd in 
October, oil tho ships would ho gone from tbcncei and eyen the merohantp 
who dwdl there in sniumor retire sonRi to Moscow m Rie winter, when the 
dnps OTO gone , so that I conld haro nothing bnt extremity el oold to 
enooimtor, with a searmfy of provisions, and must lie m an empty town Ml 
the winter so that, upon the wholei I thought it muih my better way to let 
the caravan go, end mako provision to winter whore I was, at TobMski, in 
SiboTja, in the latitade of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of throo 
things to wear out a odd wmtor with, v» , ptonty of provisums, sodi as 
the country afforded, p warm bouse, with fool enough, and excellent

it IS nest to impossible tho\ should erer get away 

I here nothing material to say of m} pariionlat a&ixs till I came to 
Tobokki, the capital city of Siboxin, where I oontinned some tune on the 
following account 

We hrd now been almost soren months on onr journey, and winter began 
to come on apace , whereupon my partner and I called a council about onr 
patiicnlor affain, in which we found it proper, as we were hound for 
England, and not for jUoscqw, to consider how to dispose of ourselTes 
They told ns of sledges and reindeer to carry us orer the snow in the winter 
time; and, indeed, the> have such things that it would be incxedihle to 
relate tho parhealars of, by which me *us the Bussians travel more in winter 
than they can in summeri as in these sledges they ore aUe to run night and 
day 9 the snow, being frozen, is ono universal oovenng to nature, by whieh 
the hills, vales, nvors, and hkes are all smooth and hard as a stone, and 
ther run upon the surfaca, without any regard to what is underneath 

But I hod no occasion to urge a winter journey of this kmd I was 
bound to Xhigland, not to hloscow, and mj route lay two ways either I 
must go on as the caravan went, till I came to Joroslaw, and then go off west 
fo'*' Xana, and the Gulf of Fi^and, and so on to Dontzio, where I might 
possiUj sdl fflv Chum cargo to good advantaga, ox I must leave the 
caiaxan at a little town on the Dwina, from whence I had but she days by 
water to Arehaugd, and from fhenco might he suzo of shipping either to 
England, Holland, or Hamburgh 

Kow to go any of these journeys in the winter woidd have been pze*< 
posterous , for os to Dantnc, the would bare been frozen up, and I 
could not get passage; and to go bvland m those ccuntnes was frr less 
eafe than among tho Hcgd ^bxtaxe, likewise, to go to Azdhangd in 
October, all the ships would ho gone from thence, and even the mexchants 
who dwell there m summer retire south to Moscow in the winter, when the 
ships are gone , so that I could hare nothmg hut extremity of cold to 
encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie in an empty town all 
the winter so that, npon tho whde, I thought it mndh my better way to let 
the caravan go, and mahe provision to winter whore I was, at Tobolsbi, in 
Sibena, m the latitude of about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three 
things to wear out a cold winter with, via , planty of provisums, such as 
the country afEOzded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and exeellont

If I was surprised hefore, I was qmte dumb now, and stood silent, look- 
ing at him, and, indeed, admiring what I saw The straggle in his soid was 
f 80 great that, though the weather was extremdy cold, it put him into a most 
violent sweat, and I found he wanted to give vent to his mind , so I said a 
word or two, tiiat I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on hua again,

I had nothing to do hut to acquiesoo, and make professions to him of my 
havingno end in it bnt a sincere desire to serve him Ho embraced me 
very passionately, and assured me he was seoudUe of that, and should always

steward , what great man I passed for myself, 1 know not, neither did it 
oonccm me to inquire HV’e had here the worst and the largest desert to 
pass Over that we met with in oar whole journey, I call it the Worst, 
beoanso tho way was veiy deep in some places, and very rmeven in others , 
the best wo had to ray for it was, that we thought we had no troops of 
Tartars or robbers to fear, and that they never came on this side the liter 
Olqr, or at least very seldom , hot we found it otherwise 

bCy young lord had a fiiithfol Sihenan servant, who was perfectly 
acquainted with tho oonnisy, and led us by private roads, so that we 
avoided coming into the ptincipil towns and cities upon the great road, 

' such ns Toincn, Soloy EamsVoi, and seveial others; heeause the Museonte 
garri«ons which ore kepi there are very eonons and stnot la thmr observation 
upon travellers, and semohing lest any of th^ banuhod pers^dis of note should 
make their escape that way into Muscovy , hut, by tliis moans, as we were 
^ kept out of tho cities, so our whole joumo] was a desert, and we were 
obliged to encpmp and lie in our tents, when wo might have had very good 
accommodation in the cities on the way: this the young lord was so sennhle 
0 ^ that he would not allow ns iolio abroad when wo came to sorerol cities on 
the way, hnt lay abroad himself, with his servant, in the woods, and met us 
always at the appointed places 

VsTo had just entered Enrope, having passed the nver E^a, which ih 
these parts is fhehoundax} between Europe and Asia, and the first city on 
tho European side nas called Soloy Eninskoi, which is as much as to say, tiie 
great oitv on iha river Kama, and here we tiiought to see some endent 
dtention in the pecqilo , but we wore mistaken , for as we had a vast desei^ 
to pass, which is near seven hundred miles long in some phoes, hut nht 
above two hundred miles over where we passed it, so iiU we came past that 
homble place, we found very little difioreuee between that country and tho 
Mogol TsrHxy, the people ate mostly pagans, and little better than the 
savages ol Amonoa , their honses and towns full of idols, and their way of 
living whoUy batharoiis, except in the oihes, and tho villages near them, 
where they are Ohnstians, os they call themsdres, of the Greek chhxUi, 
hut have fhoir rcdigion mingled wn& so many relics of suporstition, ihat li is 
scarce to bo known in some places from mtore sorcery and witchcraft 

In passing this forest, X thought, indeed, wo must (after all our dangers 
were, to onr imagination, etcaped) haie been ptwdsred and robbtd, and 
perhaps murdered* by a troop of thieves , of what country they were, I am 
yet at a loss to know, but they were all on horsebadk, earned hows and 
anows, and were at first about forty-five in number, thej camo so near to

after some signs to him not to come near them at hu peril, thefdlow came 
haokno wiser than he went, onlv that hy thmr dross, he said, he hdievod 
them to he some Tkrtan of Ealmnek, or of the CuccassiBn hordes, and that 
there mnst be more of them upon the great desert^ thongh he never heard 
that any of them were seen so far north before 

Abont an hoar after, they agom made a motion to attadc ns, and rode 
xoand oor httle wood to see where they mig^t break in, hnt finding ns 
olways ready to lace them, they went ofi agam* and we resolved not to stir 
forint night- 

Thu was small comfort to ns, however, we had no remedy there was, 
on OUT left hand, atahont a qnaiter of a mile distance,a little grove, and 
very near the xe^ I xmmedutdy zesolved we dionld advance to those trees, 
and fortify oniielres as weD as we could there , for, first, I considered that 
the trees would m a great measnte cover ns fccm fiuir atrowi ; and, in the 
next place they conld not eome to charge ns in a body it was, indeed, my 
old Portngaese pilot who proposed it, and who had tlds exodHen^y attending

could, and gained &at httle wood, &e Tartars, m thieves, for we knew not 
what to call them, keeping thmr stand, and not attemptihg to hinder ns 
When we came t^iher, we foimd, to onr great eatisfaotion, that it was a 
swampy piece of gronnd^ and on tbn one side a veiy great qpnng of wato, 
which, ramdng cut m a littla brook, was a litQe fsifiier joined by tiiitbey of

were temUy suipnsed with onr fire, and retreated immediatdy 
about one hundred rods from us , m whudi time wo loaded our pieces again,

make an ezonrsion snoh an unusual longtlu* 

We slept littls, you may bo sure, but spent ffie most part of tiie night 
in strengihening our situation, and lAxnoaduig the entranoes into the wood, 
and keeping a stnoi watdh We waited for daylight, and when it came, it 
gave ns a very nnweloomo dssoorexy mdoed , for the enemy, who we ihonght 
wore duoonxaged with the reception they met with, wets now greatly 
inoreoaed, find had set np doven or twdve hnts or tents, as if thq^ were 
resdted to besiege ns ; and this^ litflo comp they had pitehed npon the open 
]dain, ahont three-qnartors of a mile from ns We were indeed snzprued 
at thu discorezy , and now, I confess, I gave mysdf over for lost, and all 
tiiat I had, the 1ms of my effects did not lie so near me, thoujjh very eon* 
sideraUe, as the thoughts of fiilling mto the hands of snoh harbanans, at the 
latter end of my journey, after so many difiioulties and hazards as I had 
gone through, and even m sight of our port, where we eiqieoted safety and 
deliverance As to my partner, he was raging, and dedared that to lose his 
goods would ho his min, and t^t ho would rather die than he starved, and 
he was for fightmg to tho last drop 

The young lord, a gallant youth, was for fightmg to tho last also , and 
my dd pilot was of opinion that we were able to resist them all m the 
situation we were then in , and ffius we spent the day in debates of what we 
should do but towards evening we found that the number of our enemies 
sbUmereased, and we did not know but by the mormng th^ m^ht still be 
a greater number , so I began to inquire of those people wo hod brought 
bam Tobolski, if there were no pnvate ways by whidh we might avoid them 
in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town, or get hdp to guard us 
over the desert The Siberian, who was semint io the pung lord, told us, 



a we derigned to imnd them, and not figlit, ho x^onld engige to carry na 
m the mght, to a way that went north, ^towards tho nrer 'Petron, by wh: 
he made no question but we might get away, and the Tartan acror diaOO' 
it, but, he said, his lord had told him he would not retreat, but won 
rather choose to fght I told him he mistook his lord, for tiiat ho was 1 
wise a man to lore fighting for the sake of it , that I knew hu lord i 
hxaro enough, by what ho had ^owed already ; but that his lord knew bet 
than to desm serenteen or eighteen men to fight fire hundred, unless 
unaroidaUe necessity forced tiiem to it , and that, if ho thought possible 
us to escape m the xn^t, wo bad nothing also to do but to attoinpt it 
answered, if bis lordship gore bun such orders, he would lose his life if 
did not pexform it we soon brought bis lord to give that order, thoi 
pnrately, and wo imxnediatdy prepared for putting it in prachee 

And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled n fire in our hi 
camp, whioh we kept burning, and prepared so as to make it bum oil nig 
that tiie Tartars might oondudo we were etOl tboxe, hates soon as iti 
dark, and we oould pee the stars (for our guide would not stir before}, bar 
all out bones and camels ready loaded, we followed our new {^de, wh 
soon found steered himsdi by the north star. 

After we hod traTohed two hours vesyliard, it began to he l^;hter eti 
sot that it was dork ell night, hut filio moon began to ris^ 50 that, mah 
it was rather lighter thou we wished it to be ; but by six o'clock the n 
morning, we had got abore thirty miles, having almost spoiled our hon 
Here we fbnnd a Bussian Tillage, nam^ Keimozinskoy, where we reel 
and heard nothing of the Eahnuok Tartars that day* About two he 
hefora mght, we set out again, and traveQcd till eight the noxt momi 
though not quite so hard as before , and about seven o'olooli^ we passe 
htUe nver, called Kirtsa, and came to a good huge town inhabited 
Bussuins, called Ozomoys , there we heard that several troops of Halmii 
had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were now eompletdly out 
danger of wbudi was to our great satis&chon Here we were obh 
to get some Jresb horses, end having need enoiig^ of rest, we stayed

us thither the ^ua of ten pistoles * *
