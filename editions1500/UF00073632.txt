ROBINSON CRUSOE.

SECTION I.

Robinson's Family, etc--His Elopement from his Parents.

I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a
good family, though not of that country, my father bein
a foreigner of Bremen, named Kreutznaor, who settle
first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and
leaving ofi his trade, lived afterward at York; from whence
he had married my mother, whose relations were named
Robinson, a very good family in that country, and after
whom I was so called, that is to soy, Robinson Kreutznaer;
but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are
now called, nay, we eall ourselves, and write our name,
Crusoe; and so my companions always sailed me.

I had two elder brothers, one of when: was lieutenant-
eolonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, former-
ly commanded by the famous Colonel Loekhart, and was
killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards.
What became of my second brother, I never knew, any
more than my father and mother did know what was be-
come of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any
trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling
thoughts. My father, who was very aged, had given me a
competent share of learning, as far as house education and
a country free school generally go, and designed me for the
law; but 1 would be satisfied with nothing but going to
sea; and my inclination to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all
the entreaties and persuasion of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that
propension of nature, tending directly to the life of misery

,whioh was to befall me. .6 ' ROBINSON causes.

M father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and
exec lent counsel against what he foresaw was my design.
He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was
confined by the goat, and expestulated very warmly with
me upon this subject: he asked me what reasons, more
than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving his
house, and my native country, where I might be well in-
troduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune, by a
plication and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. I e
told me it was men of despe 'ate fortunes, on one hand, or
of superior fortunes, on the other, who went abroad-upon
adventures, aspiring to rise by enterprise, and make them-
selves !amons in undertakings of a nature out of the com-
mon road; that these things were all either too far above
me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle state,
or what-might be called the upper station of low life,
which he had found, by long experience, was the best state
in the world, the most suited to human happiness; not ex-
posed to the miseries and hardships, the labor and stiller-
mgs, of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embar-
rassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the
upper part of nntnkind: he told me, 1 might judge of the
happiness of this state by one thing, viz., that this was the
state of life which all other people envied; that kings have
frequently lamented the miserable consequences of being
born to great things, and wished they had been placed in
the middle of two extremes, between the mean and the
great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this as the
just standard of true [elicit-y, when he prayed to have
" neither poverty nor riches."

He bade me observe it, and I should always find, that
the calamities of life were shared among the upper and.
lower part of mankind; but that the middle station had
the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicis-
situdes as the higher or lower part of mankind: nay, they
were not subjected to so many distempers and uncasinesses,
either of body or mind, as those were, who, by vicious liv-
ing, luxury, and extravagancios, on one hand, or, by hard
labor, want of necessaries, and mean and insufficient diet,
on the other hand, bring distempers upon themselves by
the natural consequences of their ray of living; that the
middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues,
and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty werexoumm 0mm then-es mince mm: m Ember.nosmsox causes. 7

the handmaids of a middle fortune; that tern rance,
moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeab e diver-
sions, and all desirable pleasures were the blessings attend-
ing the middle station of life; that this way men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably
out of it, not embarrassed With the labors of the hands or
of the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread,
or harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the
soul of peace, and the body of rest; not enraged with the
passion of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for
great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently
through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of liv-
ing, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and
learning by every day's experience to know it more
sensibly.

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, net to play the young man, nor to
precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the
station 01 life I was born in, seemed to have provided
against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread;
that he would do well for me, and endeavor to enter me
fairly into the station of life which he had been just recom-
mending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy
in the world. it must be my mere fate, or fault, that must
hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for,
having thus discharged his duty in warning me against
measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word,
that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay
and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so
much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encour-
agement to go away; and, to close all, he told me 1 had
my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the
same earnest persuasions to keep him from oing into the
Low Country wars; but could not prevail, is young de-
sires prom ting him to run into the army, where he was
killed; an though, he said, he would not cease to ray for
me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I id take
this foolish step, God would not bless me; and I would
have leisure, hereafter, to reflect upon having neglected
his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my
recovery. _ a

I observed, in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though, I suppose, my father did not know

.- '-. {rum};
it to be so himself; I say, I observed tho tears run down
his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my
brother who was killed; and that, when he Spoke of my
having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so
moved, that he broke ol'E the discourse, and told me his
heart was so full he could say no more to me.

1 was sincerely allotted with this discourse; as, indecd,
who ooulal he olhrrwisr? and I roSolved not to think of go-
ing uhroztd any more, but to settle at homo, according to
my father's desire. llut alas! a. few days wore it all off:
and, in short, to prevent any of my father's further im-
porrunitios, in a low weeks after 1 resolved to run uite
away from him. llowover, 1 did not not so hastily, neit or,
as my first heat of resolution prompted; but 1 took my
mother, at a time when I thought horn little pleasouter
thuu ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so on-
tirely bout upon seeing the world, lhut I should never settle
to anything with resolution enouglslo go through with it,
and my l'uLhur had better giro mo his onusont Lhnn force
me to go without it; thut l was now cightL-('n years old,
wluoh wus too lulu to go zipnrsuliro to 21 trade. or clerk to
an attorney; that l was sure, il' "l dial, I should never servo

would spook to nor father to let me nnike but one voyage
abroad, ii I count homo uguin, and did not like. it, I would
go no more; and l woulil promise by a double diligence, to.
recomr tho ii!!!" i hurl lost.

This put my mother into a great passion; she told me
she knrw it would he to no purpose to spool; to my father
upon any such a. snhject; that he know too Well what was
my interest to giro his consent to anything so much for my
hurt; and that she wondered howl could think of any
such thing. after such a. discourse asI haul from my father,
and Sixth kind and tender expressions as she knew my
father had used to 1111:; and that, in short, if I would ruin
myself, there was no help for me; but 1 might dependl
shouid uorrr have their consent to it; that for her part,
she would not have so In urh hand in my destruction; and

 

I should novi'r have it to say that my mother was willing

when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet,
asl have heard afterward, she reported all the discourse to
him; and that my father, after showing a great concern at
it, said to her with a sigh, That boy might be happy if he
would stay at home; but it he goes abroarl,;he will be the
most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no
consent to it. 4

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose;
though in the meantime I continued obstinately deal to all
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulat-
ing with my father and mother about their being so posi-
tively determined against what they knew my inclinations
. prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, whither I
went casually, and without any purpose of making an
elopement at that time, and one of my companions then
going to London by sea in his father's ship, and prompting
me to go with them by the common allurement of seafar-
ing men, viz., that it should cost me nothing for my pass-
age, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor
so much as sent them word of it; butJeft them to hear of
it as they might, wilhout asking God's blessing, or my
father's, without any consideration of circums'tances o '
consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows. ~

 

SECTION II.

First Adventures at Sea, and Experience of a Maritime Life--Voy-
age to Guinea. .

ON the 1st of September, list, I went on board a ship
hound for London. Never any yomig'adveuturer's mis-'
fortunes,l believe, began younger, or continued longer,
than mine. The ship had no sooner got out of the Hum-
ber, than the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise,
in a most frightful manner; and as I had never been at sea
before, 'I was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified:
in mind: I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had
. done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of.
Heaven .for wickedly leaving my father's house. All the.
good counsels of my parents, my father's tears, and my
mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and
my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of,
hardness to which it has been since, reproached me with.
tho contempt of advice and the abandonment of my,duty._'j
All this while the storm increased, and the see, which}. . .,_,
10 ROBINSON causes.

had never been upon before, went very high, though noth-
ing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what
1 sawa few days after; but, such as it was, enough to
affect me then, who was but a youn sailor, and had never
known anything of the matter. I expected ever wave
would have swallowed us up, and that every time t e ship
fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow of the sea,
we should never rise more; and in this agony of mind I
made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please
God to spare my life this voyage, if ever I got my foot once
on dry land, I would go directly home to my father, and
,never set it into a ship again while I lived; thatI would
take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as
these any more. New I saw plainly the goodness of his
observations about the middle station of life; how easy,
how comfortable, he had lived all his days, and never had
been exposed to tumpssts at sea or troubles on shore; and
I resolved that I would, like a true repeating prodigal, go
home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued during the
storm, and indeed same time after; but the next day, as
the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, I began to be a
little inured to it... However, I was very grave that day,
being also a little sea-sick still; but toward night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charm-
ing fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly
clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little or
no win-:1, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the
sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that I ever
saw.

1 had slept Well in the night, and was now no more sea-
sick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea
that was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be
so calm and pleasant in a little time after.

And new, hast my good resolutions should continue, my
companion, who had indeed enticed me away, came to me,
and said, Well, liob, clapping me on the shOulder, how do
you do after it? I warrant you you were frightened,
wa'n't you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?
--A captul, do you call it? said I; 'twas a terrible storm.
--A storm, you fool! replies he, do you call that a storm?
Why, it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship, and
lea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as
that: you are but a fresh--water sailor, Bob; come, let us
make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that. D'ye see
what charming weather 'tis now? To make short this sad
part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch '
was made, and I was made drunk with it; and in that one
night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my re-
flections upon my past conduct, and all my resolutions for
the future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its
smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abate-
ment of the storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by
the sea forgotten, and the Current of my former desires re-
turned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises I had made
in my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of reflec-
tion; and serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavor to re-
turn again sometimes; but I shook them off and roused
myself from them, as it were from a distemper, and, ap-
plying myself to drink and com any, soon mastered the
return of those fits--for so I calle them; and 1 had in five
or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any
young sinner, that resolved not to be troubled with it, _
could desire. But 1 was to have another trial for it still;
and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved
to leave me entirely without excuse: for if I would not take
this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the
worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess
both the danger and the mercy of. The sixth day of our
being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the mud hav-
ing been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but
little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come
to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing con-
trary, viz., at south-west, for seven or eight days, during
which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into
the same roads, as the common harbor where the ships
might wait for a wind for the River Thames. We had not,
however, rid here so long, but we should have tided up the
river, but that the wind blew too fresh; and, after we had
lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the roads
being reckoned as good as a harbor, the anchorage good,
and our ground tackle very strong, our men were uncon-
cerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but
spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the
sea. ' But the eighth day, in the morning, the wind in-

' T'" "err-7rw'ym,'afwtfv :7"?sz"creased, and we had all hands at'workto strike our top-
masts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship
might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very
, high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several
seas, and we thought, once or twice, our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet
, anchor; so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the
- cables veered out to' the better end. ,
By this time it blew'a terrible storm indeed; and now I
began to see terror and amazement in the faces of even the
seamen themselves. The master was vigilant in the busi-
'ness of preserving the shi ; but, as he went in and out of -
his cabin by me, I coul hear him' softly say to himself
several times, Lord, be mercifulto us! we shall be all lost;
., we shall be all undone! and the like. During- these first
' hurries I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in
the steerage, and can not describe my term er. I could ill
'reassume the first penitence, which I he so apparently
trampled upon, and hardened myself against; I thought
that the bitterness of death had been past, and that this
would be nothing too, like the first: but when the master
'. ' himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we shorild
' be all lost, I was dreadfully frightened. I at up out of
my cabin, and looked out; but such a disma sight 1 never ,
saw; the sea went mountains high, and broke u on us
everythree or four minutes. When I could look a out, I
could see nothing but distress around us; two ships, that
rid near us, we found had cut their masts by the board,
being deeply laden; and our men cried out that a ship
which rid about a. mile ahead of us was foundered. Two
. more ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out -
- of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a
mast-standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so
much laboring in the sea; but two or three of them drove,
and came close by us, running away, with only their sprit-
sails out, before the wind. Toward evening, the mate and

away the foremost, which he was very loath to do; but the

would founder, he consented; and when they had cut away .
, the foremast, the mainmast stood so loose, and shook the-

ship so much, they were obliged to cut it away also, and .,
. make a clear deck. ' ' '

boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them cut" - '-

boatswain protesting to him,- that it he did not, the shipROBINSON ennson.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all
this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such
alright before at but a little. But it I can express, at this
distance, the thoughts 1 had about me at that time, I was
in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former
convictions, and the having returned from them to the res-
olutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death
itself; and these, added to the terror oi the storm, put me
into such a condition that I can by no words describe it.
But the worst was not Come yet; the storm continued with
such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged they
had never known a worse. We had a, good ship, but she
was deep laden, and so wallowed in the see, that the sea.-
men every new ad then cried out she would founder. It
was my ad 'antage, in one respect that 1 did not know what
they meant by founder, till I iinpiircd. However, the
storm was so riolent that I saw, what is not often seen, the
master, the boatswain, and so no eihers, more sensible than
the rest, . t their prayers, and expecting every moment the
ship would go to the bottom. in the middle of the night,
out under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men,
that had been do 'n on purpose to see, cried out, we had
sprung a hair; another Sltltt there was four feet of. water in
the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At
that very word my heart, as I thought, died within me,
and I fell backward, upon the side of my bed, where I sat
in the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me
that I, who was able to do nothing before, was as well able
to pump as another: at which 1 stirred up and went to the
pump, and worked very heartily. While this was doing,
the master seeing some light coliicrs, who, not able to ride
out the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea,
and would not come near us, ordered us to fire a gun, as a.
signal of distress. I, who know nothing what that meant,
was so surprised, that I thought the ship had broke, or
some dreadful thing,r had happened. In a word, I was so
surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time
when everybody had his own lilo to think of, no one mind--
ed me, or what was become of me: but another man
stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his
foot, let me he, thinking I had been dead; and it was a
great while belore I came to myself.

We worked on;- but the water increasing in the hold, itIt nonmsox meson.

was ap arent that the ship would founder; and though the
storm egan to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she
could swim till we might run into a port, the master
leontinued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had
rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us.
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but
it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to
lie near the ship's side; till at last the men rowing very
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men
cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then
veered it out a great length, which they, after great labor
and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under
our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no pur-
pose for them or us, after we Were in the boat, to think of
reaching their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and
only to pull her in toward shore as much as we could; and
our master promised them, that if the boat was staved
upon shore, he would make it good to their master; so,
partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to
the northward, sloping toward the shore almost as far as
Winterton--Ness.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out
of our ship when we saw her sink; and then I understood,
for the first time, what was meant by a ship foundering in
the sea. 1 must acknowledge, 1 had hardly eyes to look
up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for, from
that moment, they rather put me into the boat, than that
1 might be said to go in. My heart was, as it were, dead
within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind,
and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet laboring at
the ear to bring the boat near the shore, we could see
(when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see
the shore) a great many people running along the strand,
to assist us when we should come near; but we made slow
way toward the shore; nor were we able to reach it, till,
being past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off
to the westward, toward Cromer, and so the land broke oil
a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and,
though not without much difiiculty, got all safe on shore,
and walked afterward on foot to Yarmouth; where, as un-
fortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well
by the magistrates of the town, who assigned us good
quarters, as by the particular merchants and owners of,
ski s: and had money iven us sufficient to carry us either
to JODdOU or back to eull, as we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and
have gone home, 1 had been happy: and my father, an
emblem of our blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed
the fatted calf for me; for, hearing the ship I went in was
cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before
he had any assurance that I was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud
calls from my reason, and my more composed judgment,
to go home, yet I had no power to do it.--1 know not what
to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret, overruling
decree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own
destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some
such decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it
Was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me
forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my
most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instruc-
tions as I had met with in my first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and
who was the master's son, was now less forward than I;
the first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth,
which was not till two or three days, for we were separated
in the town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw
me, it appeared his tone was altered, and, looking very
melancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I did;
telling,' his father who I was, and how I had come this voy-
age only for a trial, in order to go further abroad. His
father, turning to me, with a grave and concerned tone,
Young man, says be, you ought never to go to sea any
more; you ought to take this for a plain and visible token,
that you are not to be a seafaring mam--Why, sir? said I ;
will you go to see no moreP--That is another case, said he;
it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made
this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has
given you of what you are to expect if you persist. Per-
haps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in
the ship of Tarshish.--Pray, continues he, what are you,
and on what account did you go to sea? Upon that I told
him some of my story; at the end of which he burst out

n.
with a strange kind of passion. What had I done, said he,
that such an unhap y wretch should come into my ship?
I would not set my oot in the same ship with thee again
for a thousand pounds. This indeed was, as 1 said, an ex-
cursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense
of his loss, and was further than he could have authority
to go.---However, he afterward talked very gravely to me;
exhorted me to go back to my father, and not tempt Provi-
deuce to my ruin; told me, I might see a visible hand of
Heaven against me; and, young man, said he, depend upon
it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet
with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your
father's words are fulfilled upon you.

We parted soon after, for 1 made him little answer, and
I saw him no more; which way he went, I know not; as
for me, having some money in my pocket, I traveled to
London by land; and there, as well as on the road, had
many struggles with myself what course of life 1 should
take, and whether I should go home or go to sea. As to
going home, shame opposed the best motions that oiIered
to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I
should be laughed at among the neighbors, and should be
ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even
everybody else. From whence I have often Since observed,
how incongruous and irrational the common temper of
mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought
to guide them in such cases, viz., that they are not
ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not
ashamed of the action, for which they ought justly to be
esteemed fools; but are ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them be esteemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, un-
certain what measures to take, and what course of life to.
lead. Au irresistible reluctance continued to going home;
and as I stayed awhile, the remembrance of the distress 1
had been in were off; and as that abated, the little motion
1 had in my desires to a return wore ofl' with it, till at last
I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a
voyage. That evil influence which carried me first away
from my father's house, that hurried me into the wild and
indigested notion of raising my fortune, and that im ressed
those conceits so forcibly upon me as to make me eat to
all good advice, and to the entreatles, and even the com.
lands of my father; I say, the same influence, whatever
it was, presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to
my View, and I went on board a vessel bound to the coast
of Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to
Guinea.

It was my great misfortune, that in all these adventures
1 did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby, though 1 might
indeed have worked a little harder than ordinary, yet, at
the same time, I had learned the duty and office of a forc-
mast--man, and in time might have qualified myself for a
mate or lieutenant, if not a master; but as it was always
my fate to choose for the worse, so I did here, for having
money in my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I
would always go on board in the habit of a gentleman;
and so I neither had any business in the ship, nor learned
to do any. It was my lot, first of all, to fall into pretty
good company in London; which does not always happen
to such loose and misguided young fellows as I then was;
the devil, generally, not omitting to lay some snare for
them very early. But it was not so with me. 1 first fell
acquainted with the master of a ship, who had been on the
coast of Guinea, and who, havin had very good success
there, was resolved to go again. e, taking a fancy to my
conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that
time, and hearing me say I had a mind to see the world,
told me that if I would go the voyage with him, I should
be at no expense; 1 should be his messmate and his com-

anion; and if 1 could carry anything with me, 1 should

are all the advantage of it that the trade would admit,
and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement. I
embraced the ofier, and entering into a strict friendship
with this captain, who was an honest and lain-dealing
man, 1 went the voyage with him and carrie a small ad-
venture with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of
my friend the captain, I increased very considerably; for 1
carried about forty pounds in such toys and trifles as the
captain directed me to buy. This forty pounds I had mus-
tered together by the assistance of. some of my relations
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my fa-
ther, or, at least, my mother, to contribute so much as that
to my first adventure. This was the only voyage which I
may say was successful in all my adventures, and which I
owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain;
under whom also I got a competent knowledge of mathe-
matics and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an
account of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in
_ short, to understand some things that were needful to be
understood by a sailor; for, as he took delight to instruct
me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage
made me bothasailor and a merchant; for I brou ht home
five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my venture,
whic yielded me in London, at my return, almost three
hundred pounds, and this filled me with those aspiring
thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. Yet
even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particular-
ly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent
calenture by the excessive heat of the climate; our princi-
pal trading being upon the coast, from the latitude of fit-
teen degrees north, even to the Line itself.

 

SECTION III.

Robinson's Captivity at Sallee.~--Escape with Xury.-Arrival at
the Brazils.

I was now set up for a Guinea trader, and my friend,
to my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I re-
solved to go the same voyage avaiu, and l embarked in the
same vessel with one who was is mate in the former voy-
age, and had now got the command of the ship. This was
the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I
did not carry quite a. hundred pounds of my new-gamed
wealth, so that I had two hundred pounds left, and which
1 lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to me,
yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the
first was this, viz.--our ship, making her course toward
the Canary Islands, or rather between those islands and
the African shore, was surprised, in the gray of the morn-
ing, by a Turkish rover, of Sallee, who gave chase to us
with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as
much canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts
carry, to et clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we
prepared to fight, our ship having twelve guns and the
rover eighteen. About three in the afternoon he came up
with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart ourRomxson CRUSOE. 19

quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we
brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured
in a. broadside upon him, which made him sheer off again,
after returning our fire, and pouring in also his small shot
from near two hundred men which he had on board. How-
ever, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping
close. He pre ared to attack us again, and we to defen
ourselves; but aying us on board the next time upon our
other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our decks, who
immediately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and rig-
ging. We plied them with small shot, halflpikes, powder-
chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of them twice.
However, to cut short this melancholy part of our story,
our ship being disabled, and three of our men killed and
eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carried
all prisoners into Sullee, a port belonging to the Moors.

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first 1
apprehended; nor was I Curried up the country to the em-
peror's court, as the rest of our men were, but was keipt by
' the ca itain of the rover as his proper prize, and m 9 his
slave, eing young and nimble, and fit for his business. At
this surprising change of my circumstances, from a mer-
chant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed;
and now looked back upon my father's prophetic discourse
to me, that 1 should be miserable, and have none to relieve
me, which I thought was now so effectually brought to

ass that it could not be worse, that now the hand of

eaven had overtaken me, and I was undone, without re-
demption. But, alas! this was but a taste of the miser l
was to go through, as will appear in the sequel of t '3
story.

As my new patron, or muster, had taken me home to his
house, so I was in hopes he would take me with him when
he went to see. again, believing that it would, some time or
other, be his fate to be taken by a. Spanish or Portuguese
man-of-war, and that then I should be set at liberty. But
this hope of mine was soon taken away, for when he went
to see he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and
do the common drudgery of slaves about his house, and when
he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie
in the cabin, to look after the ship. ,

Here I meditatcd nothing but my 6509. e, and what
method 1 might take to effect it, but foun no way that
had the least probability in it. ~Nothing presented to
make the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to
communicate it to that would embark with me, no fellow-
slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Seotchman there but
myself; so that for two years, though I often pleased my-
self with the imagination, yet I never had the least encour-
aging prospect of putting it in practice.

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented
itself, which put the old thought of making some attempt
for my liberty again in my head. My patron lying at
home longer than usual, without fitting out his ship,
which, as I heard, was for want of money, he used con-
stantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the
weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnaee, and go out
into the road a-fishing; and as he always took me and a
young Moresco with him to row the boat, we made him
very merry, and 1 proved very dexterous in catching fish,
insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a Moor,
one of his kinsmen, and the youth, the Moresco, as they
called him, to catch a dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that oing a-fishing in a stark
calm morning, a fog rose so t ick, that though we were
not half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and
rowing, we knew not whither, or which way, we labored
all day and all the next night, and when the morning
came, we found we had pulled off to sea, instead of pull-
ing in for the shore, and that we were at least two leagues
from the shore; however, we get well in again, though
with a great deal of labor, and some danger, for the wind
began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but particular-
ly we were all very hungry.

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take
more care of himself for the future; and having lying by
him the long-boat of our English ship he had taken, he re-
solved he would not go a-fishing any more without a com-
pass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of
the ship, who was an English slave, to build a little state-
room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a
barge, with a place to stand behind it, to steer and haul
home the main sheet, and room before for a hand or two
to stand and work the sails. She sailed with .what we
called a shoulder-of-mutton sail, and the boom jibed
over the t0p of the cabin, which lay very snug and low,
and had in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and
a table to eaten, with some small lockers to at in some
bottles of Such liquor as he thought fit to drin , and par-
ticularly his bread, rice, and coffee. _

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as
I was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went
without me. It happened that he had appointed to go out
in this boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two or
three Moors of some distinction in that place, and for
whom he had provided extraordinarily, and had therefore
sent on board the boat, overnight, 9. larger store of pro-
visions than ordinary, and had ordered me to get ready
three fusees, with powder and shot, which were on board
his ship, for that they designed some sport of fowling as
well as fishing.

I-gnt all things ready as he directed, and waited the next
morning with the beat washed clean,her ensign and pennants
out, and everything to accommodate his guests; when, by
and by, my patron came on board alone, and told me his
guests had put off going, upon some business that fell out,
and ordered me with a man and boy, as usual, to go out
with the boat, and catch them some fish, for that his
friends were to sup at his house, and commanded that as
soon as I had got some fish I should bring it home to his
house; all which 1 prepared to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted
into my thoughts, for nowI found Iwas like to have a
little ship at my command; and my master being gone, 1
frowned to iurnish myself, not for a fishing business, but

or a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as
consider, whither 1 should steer, for anywhere, to get out
of that place, was my way.

My first contrivauce was to make a pretense to speak to
this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board;
for I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's
bread. lie said that was true; so he brought a large
basket of rusk or biscuit, of their kind, and three jars with
fresh water, into the boat. 1 knew where my patron's
case of bottles stood, which, it was evident by the make,
were taken out of some English prize, and 1 conveyed
them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they
had been there before our master. I conveyed also a great
lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed above halt22 nonmson cnoson.

a hundredweight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a
hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use
to us afterward, es ecially the wax, to make candles. An-
other trick I trie upon him, which he innocently came
into also; his name was Ismael, whom they call Muley, or
Moley; so 1 called to him. Moley, said 1, our patron's guns
are on board the host; can you not et a little powder and
shot? it may be we may kill some a camies (fowls like our
curlews) for ourselves, for 1 know he keeps the gunner'r
stores in the ship. Yes, says he, I will bring some; and
accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held
about a pound and a half of powder, or rather more, and
another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with some
bullets, and put all into the boat; at the same time 1 found
some powder of my master's in the great cabin, with which
I filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was
almost empty, pouring what was in it into another; and
thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of
the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of
the port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us;
and we were not above a mile out of the port before we
hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish. The wind
blew from NN.E., which was contrary to my desire; for,
had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have made the
coast of Spain, and at last. reached to the Bay of Cadiz;
but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, 1 would
be gone from the horrid place where I was, and leave the
rest to fate.

After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for
when 1 had fish on my book I would not pull them up,
that he might not see them, I said to the Moor: This Wlil
not do; our master will not be thus served; we must stand
further off. He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being at
the head of the boat, set the sails; and as I had the helm,
1 run the boat near a league further, and then brought to,
as if 1 would fish. Then giving the boy the helm, I
stepped forward to where the Moor was, and I took him
by surprise, with my arm under his waist, and tossed him
clear overboard into the sea. He rose immediately, for he
swam like a cork, and called to me, begged to be taken in,
and told me he would go all the world over with me. He
swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached
me very quickly, there being but little wind; upon which
I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-
pieces, 1 presented it at him, and told him I had done him
no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none.
But, said I, you swim well enough to reach the shore, and
the sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and 1
will do you no harm; but if you come near the boat I will
shoot you through the head; for I am resolved to have my
liberty. So he turned himself about, and swam for the
shore, and 1 make no doubt but he reached it with ease,
for he was an excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with
me and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing
to trust him. When he was gone I turned to the boy,
whom they called Xury, and said to him: Xury, if you
will be faithful to me I will make you a great man; but if
you will not stroke your face to be true to me (that is,
Near by Mahomet and his father's beard), 1 must throw
you into the sea too. The boy smiled in my face,.and
spoke so innocently, that 1 could not mistrust him, and
swore to be faithful to me and go all over the world with
me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I
stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to
windward, that they might think me gone toward the
strait's mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their
wits must have been supposed to do); for who would have
supposed we were sailing on to the southward, to the truly
Barbarian coast, where whole nations of negroes were sure
to surround us with their canoes and destroy us; where we
could never once go on shore but we should be devoured
fly savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human

m .

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my
course a little toward the east, that I might keep in with
the shore; and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, and a
smooth, quiet sea, 1 made such sail that I believe by the
next day, at three o'clock in the afternoon, when 1 made
the land, I could not be less than one hundred and fifty
miles south of Sallee, guite beyond the Emperor of Moroc-
ee's dominions, or in eed of any other lung thereabout;
for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and24 1103121301: causes.

the dreadful apprehensions 1 had of. falling into their hands,
that 1 would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an an-
chor, the wind continuing fair, till I had sailed in that
manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the south-
ward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in
obese of me, they also would now give over; so I ventured
to make to the coast, and'came to an anchor in the mouth
of a little river; I knew not what or where, neither what
latitude, what country, what nation, or what river. I
neither saw, nor desired to see, any people; the principal
thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek
in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was
dark, and discover the country; but as soon as it was quite
dark we heard such dreadful noises of the barking, roar-
ing, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and
begged oE me not to go on shore till day. Well, Xury,
said I, then I will not; but it may be we malv' see men by
day, who will be as bad to us as those lions. ' hen we may
give them the shoot-gun, says Xury, laughing; make
them run away. Such English Xury s oke y conversing
among us slaves. However, 1 was gl to see the boy so
cheer ul, and I gave him a dram out of our patron's case
of bottles to cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was
good, and I took it. We dropped our little anchor, and
lay still all night; 1 say still, for we slept none; for in two
or three hours we saw vast creatures (we knew not what to
call them), of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore, and
run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves, for
the pleasure of cooling themselves, and they made such
hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard
the like.

Xury was dreadfully fri htened, and indeed so was I too;
but we were both more rightened when we heard one of
these mighty creatures swimming toward our boat; we
could not see him, but we might hear him, by his blowing,
to be a monstrous, huge, and furious 'beast. Xury said it
was a lion, and it might be so, for aught I know; but poor
Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and row away. No,
says 1, Xury; we can slip our cable with a buoy to it. and
go off to sea; they can not follow us far. 1 had no sooner
said so, but 1 perceived the creature (whatever it was)
within two oars' length, which something surprised me;ROBINSON cursor. 25

however, 1 immediately stepped to the cabin door, and
taking up my gun, fired at him; upon which he immedi-
ately turned about, and swam to the shore again.

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises and
hideous cries and howlings that were raised, as well upon
the edge of the shore as higher within the country, upon
the noise or report of the gun; a thing, I believe, those
creatures had never heard' before. This convinced me
there was no going on shore for us in the night upon that
coast; and how to venture 0n shore in the day, was another
question too; for to have fallen into the hands of any of
the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the

we of lions and tigers; at least, we were equally appre-
hensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint left in
the boat; when and where to get it was the point. Xury
said if I would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he
would find if there was any water, and bring some to me.
I asked him why he would go, why I should not go, and he
stay in the boat. The boy answered with so much afiee-
tion that he made me love him ever after. Says he, If
wild mans come, they eat me, you go away. Well, Xury,
said I, we Will both go; and if the wild mans come, we
will kill them; they shall eat neither of us. So Igave
Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat and a dram out of our
patron's case of bottles, which I mentioned before; and we

auled in the boat as near the shore as we thought was
proper, and so waded to shore, carrying nothing but our
arms, and two jars for water.

1 did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with savages down the river; but the
boy, seeing a low place about a mile up the country, ram-
bled to it; and by and by 1 saw him come running toward
me. 'I thought he was pursued by some savage, or fright-
ened by some wild beast, and I therefore ran forward to
help him; but when I came nearer to him, I saw some-
thing hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature
that he had shot, like a hare, but difiereut in color, and
longer le 3; however, we were very glad of it, and it was
very go meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came

with was to tell me he had found good water and seen no
Wild mans. '
But we found afterward that we need not take such pains
for water; for a little hi her up the creek where we were,
we found the water fres when the tide was out, which
flowed but a little way up; so we filled our jars, and hav-
ing a fire, feasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared
to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any human
creature in that part of the country.

As 1 had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew
very well that the Islands of the Canaries and the Cape de
Verd Islands also, lay not far from the coast. But as I
had no instruments to take an observation, to find what
latitude we were in, and did not exactly know, or at least
remember, what latitude they were in, I knew not where
to look for them, or when to stand off to sea toward them,
otherwise 1 might now have easily found some of these
islands. But my hope was that if I stood along this coast
till I came to the part where the English traded, 1 should
find some of their vessels upon their usual design of trade,
that would. relieve and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, the place where I now
was, must be that country which, lying between the Em-
peror of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, lies waste
and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the Negroes hav-
ing abandoned it, and gone further south, for fear of the
Moors, and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by
reason of its barrenness; and, indeed both forsaking it be-
cause of the prodigious number of tigers, lions, leopards,
and other furious creatures which harbor there, so that the
Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go like an
army, two or three thousand men at a time; and, indeed,
for near a hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw
nothing but a waste, uninhabited country by day, and
heard nothing but howlings and rearing of wild beasts by
ni ht.

%nce or twice, in the day-time, I thought I saw the Pico
of Tenerifie, being the top of the mountain of Tenerifi'e,
in the Canaries, and had a great mind to venture out, in
hopes of reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was
forced in again by contrary winds; the sea also going too
high for my little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first
design, and keep along the shore.

Several times 1 was 0in ed to land for fresh water, after
we had left this place; an once, in particular, being earlyRobinson Cram Discovers 3 Duncan) 1-10
in the morning, we came to an anchor under a little point
of land which was pretty high; and the tide beginning to
flow, we lay still, to .go further in. Xury, whose eyes were
more about him than, it seems, mine were, calls softly to
me and tells me that we had best go further ed the shore;
for, says he, Look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the
side of that hillock, fast asleep. I looked where he
pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a
terrible great lion, that lay on the side of the shore, under
the shade of a piece of the hill, that hung, as it were, over
him. Xury, says I, you shall go on shore and kill him.
Xury looked frightened, and said, Me kill! he eat me at
one month; one mouthful he meant. However, I said no
more to the boy, but bade him be still; andl took our
biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it
with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid
it down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets; and
a third, for we had three pieces, I loaded with five smaller
bullets. 1 took the best aim I could with the first piece,
to have shot him in the head; but he lay so, with his leg
raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg
about the knee, and broke the bone; he started up, growl-
ing at first, but finding his leg broke, fell down again, and
then at up u on three legs, and gave the most hideous
roar t at ever heard. I was a little surprised that I had
not hit him on the head; however, I took up the second
piece immediately, and though he be an to move oil, fired
again and shot him in the head, an had the pleasure to
see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie struggling
for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me let
him 0 on shore. Well, go, said I; so the boy jumped
into t 6 water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam
to shore with the other hand, and coming close to the creat-
ure, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in
the head again, which dispatched him quite.

This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food; and l
was very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot
upon a creature that was good for nothing to us. How-
ever, Xury said he Would have some of him; so he comes
on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet: For
what, Xury? said I. Me out 03 his head, said he. How-
ever, Xury could not cut off his head; but he out 05 a
foot, and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous
great one. I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the
skin of. him might one way or other, be of some value to
us; and I resolved to take off his skin, if I could. So
Xury and 1 went to work with him: but Xury was much
the better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it.
Indeed, it took us both up the whole day; but at last we
got off the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our
cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days' time, and it
afterward served me to lie upon.

After this stop we made on to the southward continual-
ly, for ten or twelve days, living very s aringly on our
provisions, which began to abate very muc , and going no
oftener into the shore than we were obliged to for fresh
water. My design in this, was to make the River Gambia,
or Senegal: that is to say, anywhere about the Cape do
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European
ship; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to
take, but to seek for the islands or perish among the
Negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, which
sailed either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this Cape, or those islands: and in a
word I put the whole of my fortune upon this single
point}; either that I must meet with some ship, or must

we .
P When 1 had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land was in-
habited; and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we
saw people stand upon the shore to look at us: we could
also perceive they were quite black and stark naked. I was
once inclined to have gone on shore to them; but Xury
was my better counselor, and said to me: No go, no go.
However, I hauled in nearer the shore, that I might talk
to them; and 1 found they ran along the shore by me a
good way. I observed they had no weapons in their hands,
except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said
was a lance, and that they would throw them a reat way
with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talke to them
by signs, as well as I could, and particularly made signs
for something to eat. They beckoned to me to stop my
boat, and they would fetch me some meat: upon this I
lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them
ran up into the country; and in less than half an hour
came back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh

'
and some corn, such as the produce of their country; but
we neither. knew what the one or the other was; however,
we were willing to accept it. But how to come at it was
our next dis ute, for I was not for venturing on shore to
them, and t ey were as much afraid of us: but they took
a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore, and
laid it down, and went and stood a great way ofi till we
fetched it on board, and then came close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing
to make them amends; but an o portunity offered that
very instant to oblige them wonder ully; for while we were
lying by the shore, came two mighty creatures, one pursu-
ing the other (as we took it) with great fury, from the
mountains toward the sea; whether it was the male pursu-
ing the female, or whether they were in sport or in rage, we
could not tell, any more than we could tell whether it was
usual or strange; but I believe it was the latter, because,
in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear
but in the night; and, in the second place we found the
people terribly frightened, especially the women. The
man that had the lance, or dart, did not fly from them,
but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran directly
into the water, they did not seem to offer to fall upon any
of the Negroes, but lunged themselves into the sea, and
swam about, as if 1; 0y had come for their diversion; at
last, one of them be an to come nearer our boat than I at
first expected; but lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load
both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my
reach, I fired, and shot him directly in the head: immedi-
ately he sunk down into the water, but rose instantly, and

so in eed e was: he immediately made to the shore, but
between the wound which was his mortal hurt, and the
strangling of the water, he died just before he reached the
s ore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these 00:
creatures, at the noise and fire of in gun; some oft em
were even ready to die for fear, and ell down as dead with
the very terror; but when they saw the creature dead, and
sunk in the water, and that 1 made signs to them to come
to the shore, they took heart and came to the shore, and
began to search for the creature. I found him by his3O nosxnsotr cacson.

blood staining the water: and by the help of a rope, which
I slung round him, and gave the Negroes to haul, they
dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most curi-
ous leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and
the negroes held up their hands with admiration, to think
what it was I had killed him with.

The other creature, frightened with the flash of fire, and
the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly
to the mountains from whence they came; nor could I, at
that distance, know what it was. I found quickly the
Negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature, so I was
willing to have them take it as a favor from me; which,
when I made signs to them that they might take him, the
were very thankful for. Immediately they fell to wor
with him; and though they had no knife, yet with a sharp-
ened piece of wood, they took off his skin as readily, and
much more readily, than we could have done with a knife.
They offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, mak-
ing as if I would give it them, but made signs for the skin,
which they gave me very freely, and brought me a great
deal more of their pro'visions, which, though I did not un-
derstand, yet I accepted. I then made signs to them for
some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turnin
it bottom upward, to show that it was empty, and that
wanted to have it filled. They called immediately to some
of their friends, and there came two women, and brought
a great vessel made of earth, and burned, as I suppose, in
the sun; this they set down to me, as before, and I sent,
Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three.
The women were as stark naked as the men.

1 was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was,
and water; and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made for~
ward for about eleven days more, without offering to go
near the shore, till I saw the land run out a great length
into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues
before me; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large
offing, to make this point. At length, doubling the point,
at about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on
the other side, to seaward: then I concluded, as it was
most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Vex-d, and
those the islands, called, from thence, Cape de Verd
Islands. However, they were at a great distance, and I
could not well tell what I had best to do; for it 1 should
be taken with a gale of wind, 1 might neither reach one
nor the other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into
the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having the helm; when,
on a sudden, the boy cried out, master, master, a ship with
a sail! and the foolish boy was frightened out of his wits,
thinking it must needs be some of his master's ships sent
to pursue us, when I knew we were got far enough out of
their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately
saw, not only the ship, but what she was, viz., that it was
a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the
coast of Guinea, or Negroes. But, when I observed the
course she steered, I was soon convinced they were bound
some other way, and did not design to come any nearer to
the shore; upon which, I stretched out to sea as much as I
could, resolving to speak with them, if possible.

With all the sail I could make, 1 found I should not be
able to come in their way, but that they would be gone by
before I could make any signal to them; but after 1 had
crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they, it
seems, saw me, by the help of their perspective glasses,
and that it was some European boat, which, they sup-
posed, must belong to some ship that was lost: so thev
shortened sail, to let me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as 1 had my patron's ensign on board, I made a
waft of it to them, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun,
both which they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals,
they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in
about three hours' time I came up with them.

The asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanis , and in French, but I understood none of them;
but, at last, a Scotch sailor who was on board, called to
me, and I answered him. and told him I was an English-
man, that 1 had made my esca 6 out of slave from the
Moors, at Sallee: they then be. 9 me come on oard, and
very kindly took me in, and all my goods.

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will
believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from
such a miserable, and almost hopeless, condition as 1 Was
in; and I immediately offered all 1 had to the, captain of
the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he generous]
told me, he would take nothing from me, but that allW "1-". 2'

had should be delivered safe to me, when 1 came to the
Brazils. For, says he, I have saved your life on no other
terms than 1 would be glad to be saved myself; and it
may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken up in the
same condition. Besides, said he, when I carry you to the
Brazils, so great a way from your own country, if 1 should
take from you what you have, you will be starved there,
and then I only take away that life 1 had iven. No, no,
Senhor lngles (Mr. Englishman), says he, will carry you
thither in charity, and these things will help to buy your
subsistence there, and your passage home again.

He settles in the Brazils as a Plenum--Makes another Voyage, and
is Shipwrecked.

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in
the performance, to a tittle: for he ordered the seamen,
that none should offer to touch anything I had: then he
took everything into his own possession. and gave me back
an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even
so much as my three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw,
and told me he would buy it of me for the shi 's use; and
asked me what 1 would have for it? I told iim, he had
been so generous to me in everything, that 1 could not
offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to
him: upon which, he told me he would give me a note of
hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and
when it came there, if any one offered to give more, he
would make it up. He oflfered me also sixty pieces of
eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loath to take;
not that 1 was not willing to let the ca taiu have him, but
I was very loath to sell the poor boy's iberty, who had as-
sisted me so faithfully in procuring my own. However,
when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just,
and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an
obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christ-
ian; u on this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to
him, left the captain have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived
in the Bay do Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, inseamen cannon. _ 83

about twenty-two days after. And now I was once more
delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of life;
and what to do next with myself, 1 was now to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me, 1 can never
enough remember: he would take nothing of me for my
passage, gave me twenty ducats for the leopar '3 skin, and
forty for the lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and
caused everything 1 had in the ship to be punctually de-
livered to me; and what 1 was willing to sell, he bought of
me; such as the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a
piece of the lump of bees-wax--for I had made candles of
the rest: in a word, 1 made about two hundred and twenty
pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock, I went
on shore in the Brazils.

1 had not been long here, before I was recommended to
the house of a good honest man, like himself, who had an
ingenio as they call it (that is, a plantation and a sugar-
house). I lived with him some time, and acquainted my-
self, by that means, with the manner of planting and of
making sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and.
how they got rich suddenly, I resolved, it I could get a
license to settle there, I would turn planter among them:
endeavoring, in the meantime, to find out some way to get
my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me.
To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalization,
1 purchased as much land that was uncured as my money
would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and
settlement; such a one as might>> be suitable to the stock
which 1 proposed to myself to receive from England.

1 had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of
English parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such
circumstances as I was. I call him my neighbor, because
his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very soci-
ably together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and
we rather planted for food than anything else, for about two
years. However, we began to increase, and our land he-
gan to come into order; so that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground
ready for planting canes in the year to come; but we both
wanted help; and now 1 found more than before, I had.
done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.

But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was

no great wogder. I had no remedy, but to go on: I had
got into an employment quite remote to my genius, and
directly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for which I
forsook my father's house, and broke through all his good
advice: nay, I was coming into the very middle station, or
up er degree of lower life, which my father advised me to
be ore; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as
well have stayed at home, and never have fatigued myself
in the world, as I had done; and I used often to say to my-
self, I could have done this as well in England, among my
friends, as have gone five thousand miles off to do it among
strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a dist-
ance as never to hear from any part of the world that had
the least knowledge of me.

In this manner, I used to look upon my condition with
the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but
now and then this neighbor; no work to be done, but by
the labor of my hands: and 1 used to say, I lived just like
a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had no-
body there but himself. But how just has it been! and
how should all men reflect, that when they compare their
present conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may
oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced of
their former felicity by their experience: I sav, how just
has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an
island of mere desolation, should be mylot, who had so
often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led,
in which, had I continued, I had, in all probability, been
exceeding prosperous and rich!

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carry-
ing on the plantation, before my kind friend, the captain
of the ship that took me up at sea, went back; for the ship
remained there, in providing his lading, and preparing
for his voyage, near three months; when telling im what
little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me
this friendly and sincere advice: Senhor Inglez, says be
(for so he always called me), if you will give me letters,
and a procuration here in form to me, with orders to the
person who has your money in London, to send your efiects
to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such
goods as are proper for this country, 1 will bring you the
produce of them, God willing, at my return: but since hu-
man aflairs are all subject to changes and disasters, I would
have you give orders for but one hundred pounds sterling,Robinson Crusoe Shipwrecked.4"".-

ROBINSON' CRUBOE. 35

which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be
run for the first, so that if it come safe, you may order the
rest the same way; and, if it miscarry, you may have the
other half to have recourse to for your supply. This was
so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could
not but be convinced it was the best course I could take;
so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with
whom I left my money, and a procuration to the Portu-
guese captain, as he desired me.

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of
all my adventures; my slavery, escape, and how I had met
with the Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his be-
havior, and what condition 1 was new in, with all other
necessary directions for my suppl ; and when this honest
captain came to Lisbon, he foun means, by some of the
English merchants there, to send over. not the order only,
but a full account of my story to a merchant at London,
who represented it effectually to her, whereupon she not
only delivered the money, but, out of her own pocket, sent
the Portuguese captain a very handsome present for his
humanity and charity to me.

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds
in English goods, such as the captain had wrote for, sent
them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all
safe to me at the Brazils among which, without my direc-
tion (for I was too young in my business to thinkof them),
he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and
utensils, necessary for my plantation, and which were of
great use to me. When this cargo arrived, I thought my
fortune made, for I was surprised with the joy of it; and
my good steward, the captain, had laid out the five pounds,
which my friend had sent him as a present for himself, to
purchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six
years' service, and would not accept of any consideration,
except a little tobacco, which I would have him accept, be-
ing of my own reduce. Neither was this all: but my
goods being all uglish manufactures, such as cloths,
stulfs, baizo, and things particularly valuable and desirable
in the country, 1 found means to sell them to a very great
advantage; so that I might say, I had more than four
times the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely
beyond my poor neighbor, I mean in the advancement of
my plantation: for the first thing I did, I bought me a
Negro slave, and a European servant also; I mean another
besides that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as- abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very
means of our adversity,,so was it with me. ' I went on the
next year with great success in my plantation; I raised fifty
great rolls of tobacco on my Own ground, more than I had
isposed of for necessaries among my neighbors: and these
fifty rolls, bein each of above one hundred pounds wei ht,
were well our , and laid by against the return of the eet
from Lisbon: and now, increasing in business and in wealth,'
my head began to be full of projects and undertakings be-
ygzni my reach; such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the
theads in business. Had I continued in the station I
was now in, I had room for all the happy things to have
yet befallen me, for which my father so earnestly recom-
mended a uiet, retired life, and which he had so sensibly
described t e middle station of life to be full of: but other
things attended me, and I was still be to be the willful
agent of all my own miseries; and, particularly, to increase
my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which in
my future sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate ad-
hering to my foolis inclination, of wandering about, and
pursum that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest
views 0 .doing myself good in a fair and lain pursuit of
those prospects, and those measures of ii e, which nature .
and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make
my dut .
As I bad once done thus in breaking away from my par-
ents, so I could not be content now, but must 0 and
leave the happy view 1 had of being a rich and t riving
man in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash and im-
moderate desire of rising faster than the nature or the
thin admitted; and thus I cast myself down again- into
the ( eepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into,
or perhaps could be consistent with life, and a state of
health in the'world.
. To came then, by just degrees, to the particulars of this
art of my story--You may su pose, that having now
lived almost four years in l e razils, and beginuin to
thrive and prosper very well n on my plantation, I iad
not only learned'the language, ut had contracted an ac-
quaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters; as
well as among the merchants at St. Salvador, which was
our port: and that, in my discourses among them, 1 had
frequently given them an account of my two voyages to
the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the
Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase on the
coast for trifles--such as beads, toys, knives, scissors,
hatchets, bits of glass, and the like--not only gold dust,
Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, etc., but Negroes, for the
service of the Braziis, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses
on these heads, but especially to that part which related to
the buying of Negroes; which wasa trade, at that time, not
only not far entered into, but, as far as it was, had been
carried on by the aesiciztos, or permission of the kings of
Spain and Portugal, and engrossed from the public; so
that few Negroes were bought, and those excessively dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants
and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those
things very earnestly, three of them came to me the next
morning, and told me they had been musing very much
upon what I had discoursed with them of the last night,
and they came to make a secret proposal to me: and, after
enjoining me to secrecy, they told me that they had a mind
to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all planta-
tions as well as I, and were straitcncd for nothing so much
as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried
on, because they could not publicly sell the Negroes when
they came home, so they desired to make but one voyage
to bring the Negroes on shore prirately, and divide them
among their OWn plantations; and, in a word, the question
was, whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to
manage the trading art upon the coast of Guinea; and
they offered me that 1i should have an equal share of the
Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it
been made to any one that had not a settlement and plan~
tation of his own to look after, which was in a fair way of
coming to be very considerable, and with a good stock
upon it. But for me, that was thus entered and estab-
lished, and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun,
for three or four years more, and to have sent for the other
hundred pounds from England; and who, in that time and
with that little addition, could scarce have failed 0! being
worth three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in-
creasing too; for me to think of such a voyage, was the
most preposterous thing that ever man, in such circum-
stances, oould be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no
more resist the otter, than I could restrain my first ramb~
ling designs, when my father's good counsel was lost upon
me. In a word, I told them I would go with all my heart,
if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my
absence, and would dispose of it to such as 1 should direct,
if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and entered
into writings or covenants to do so: and I made a formal
will, disposing of my plantation and effects, in case of my
death; making the captain of the ship that had saved my
life, as before, my universal heir; but obliging him to dis.
pose of my effects as 1 had directed in my will ; one-half of
the produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England. In short, I took all possible caution to pre-
serve my effects, and to keep up my plantation: had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own inter-
est, and have made a judgment of whatI ought to have
done and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away
from so prostperous an undertaking, leaving all the probe
able views of a thriving circumstance, and gone a voyage
to sea, attended with all its common hazards, to say noth-
ing of the reasons I had to expect particular misfortunes
to myself.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of
my fancy, rather than my reason: and accordingly, the
ship, being fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all
things done as by agreement, by my partners in the voy-
age, I went on board in an evil hour again, the first of
September, 1659, being the same day eight years that I
\. at from my parents at Hull, in order to act the rebel to
their authority, and the fool to my own interest.

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons bur-
den, carried six guns and fourteen men, besides the master,
his boy, and myself; we had on board no large cargo of
goods, except of such toys as were fit for our trade with
the Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd
triiles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors,
hatohets, and the like.

The very same day I went on board we set sail, standingsummon esoson.' 39

away to the northward upon our own coast, with design to
stretch over for the African coast. When they came about
ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems,
was the manner of their course in those days, we had very
good weather, only excessively hot all the way upon our
own coast,.till we came to the height of Cape St. August-
ino; from whence, keeping further off at sea, we lost sight
of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle F er-
nando de Noronha, holding our course N. E. by N. and
leaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed
the Line in about twelve days' time, and were, by our last
observation, in seven degrees twenty-two minutes northern
latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us
quite out of our knowledge: it began from the south-east,
came about to the north-west, and then settled in the
north-east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner,
that for twelve days together we could do nothing but
drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither-
soever fate and the fury of the winds directed; and, during
these twelve days, 1 need not say that I expected every day
to be swallowed up; nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect
to save their lives.

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm,
one of our men dead of the celenture, and one man and a
boy washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the
weather ahating a little, the master made an observation
as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven
degrees north latitude, but that he was twent -two degrees
of longitude difference, west from Cape St. ugustiuo; so
that he found he was got upon the coast of Guiana, or the
north art of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon, toward
that of the river Oronoco, commonly called the Great
River; and began to consult with me what course he
should take, for the ship was leaky and very much dis--
aeflcd, and he was for going directly back to the coast of

razil.

1 was positively against that; and looking over the charts
of the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there

was no inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till
we came within the circle of the Carribee Islands. and
therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes; which by
keeping oi! to sea, to avoid the indraft of the Bay or Gulf
of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about
fifteen days' sail; whereas we could not possibly make our
voyage to the coast of Africa without some assistance. both.
to our ship and ourselves.

With this design we changed our course and steered away
N. W. by W., in order to reach some of our English islands,
where 1 ho ed for relief; but our voyage was otherwise de-
termined; for being in the latitude of twelve degrees eigh-
teen minutes, a second storm came upon us which carried
us away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us
so out of the way of all human commerce, that had
all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in
danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning
to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of
our men early in the morning, cried out, and! and we
had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of
seeing whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship
struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being
so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner that
we expected we should all have perished immediately; and
we were immediately driven into our close quarters, to
shelter us from the foam and spray of the sea.

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like
condition to describe or conceive the consternation of men
in such circumstances; We knew nothing where we were,
or upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island
or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as
the rage of the wind was still great, thou h rather less than
at first, we could not so much as hope to ave the ship held
many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind,
by a kind of miracle, should immediately turn about. In
a word we sat looking upon one another, and expecting
death every moment, and every man acting accordingly, as
preparing for another world; for there was little or noth-
ing more for us to do in this. That which was our present
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to
our expectation, the ship did not break yet, and that the
master said the wind began to abate.

New, though we thought that the wind did a little abate,
yet the ship having thus struck upon the sand, and stick-
ing too fast for us to expect her etting off, we were in a
dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do, but to
think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a
boat at our stern just before the storm, but she was first
staved by dashing against the ship's rudder, and, in the
next place, she broke away, and either sunk, or was driven
oil to sea; so there was no hope from her; we had another
boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a
doubtful thing; however, there was no room to debate, for
we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute,

and some told us she was actually broken already. '

In this distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the
boat, and with the help of the rest of the men they got her
flung over the ship's side; and getting all into her, we let
her go and Committed ourselves, being eleven in number,
to God's mercy, and the wild sea; for though the storm
was abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadfully high
upon the shore, and might be well called den wild zoo, u
the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
plainly, that the sen went so high, that the boat could not
live, and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to
making sail, we had none; nor, if we had, could we have
done anything with it; so we worked at the oar toward the
land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execu-
tion; for we all knew that when the boat came nearer to
the shore, she would be dashed in'a thousand pieces by the
breach 0! the sea. However, we committed our souls to
Goal in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us
toward the shore, we hastened our destruction with our
own hand, pulling as well as we could toward land.

What the shore v. :s---whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal--we knew not; the only hope that could
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, was, it
we might happen into some bay or gull, or the mouth of
some river, where by great chance we might have run our
boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made
smooth water. But nothing of this appeared; and as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more

frightful than the sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league
and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-
like, came rolling astern of us, and plainly bade us expect
the coup do grace. In a word, it took us with such fury,
that it overeat the boat at once; and separating m, as well"' _, ' '~ ""'MIWWW '

from the boat as from one another, gave us no time hardly
to say, " Oh, God!" for we were all swallowed up in a mo-
ment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I
felt, when I sunk into the water; for though [ swam very
well, yet I could not deliver myself from the waves so as
to draw my breath, till that wave having driven me, or
rather carried me, a vast way on toward the shore, and
having spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land
almost dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had
so much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that see-
ing myself nearer the main land than I expected, 1 got
upon my feet and endeavored to make on toward the land
as fast as I could, before another wave should return and
take me up again; but I soon found it was impossible to
avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great
hill, and as furious as an enemy which I had no means or
strength to contend with; my business was to hold my
breath and raise myself upon the water, if I could; and so,
by swimming, to preserve my breathing and pilot myself
toward the shore, If possible; my greatest concern now be-
ing that the wave, a: it would carry me a great way toward
the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again
with it when it gave back toward the sea.

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once
twenty or thirty feet deep in its own bod , and I could feel
myself carried with a mighty force an swiftncss toward
the shore, a very great way; but 1 held my breath, and
assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might.
I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I
felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, 1 found
my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the
water; and though it was not two seconds of time that 1
could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me
breath and new courage. .1 was covered again with water
a good while, but not so long but I held it out; and find-
ing the water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck
forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments, to re-
cover breath, and till the water went from me, and then
took to my heels and ran with what strength I had further
toward the shore. But neither would this deliver me from
the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again;Romnm Crusoe an. um um Baum mum. '4nosmsorr censor. 43

and twice more lwas lifted up by the waves and carried
forward as before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to
me; _for the sea, having hurried me along, as before, landed
me, or rather dashed me, ainst a piece of rock, and
that with such force that it eft me senseless, and indeed
helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow, taking
my side and breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out
of my body; and had it returned again immediately, I must
have been strangled in the water; but I recovered a little
before the return of the waves, and, seeing I should 2: sin
be covered with the water,l resolved to hold fast ya
piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till
the wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high
as the first, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave
abated, and then fetched another run, which brought me
so near the shore that the next wave, though it went over
me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and
the next run I took, I got to the mainland; where, to my
great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore, and
set me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite
out of the reach of the water.

I was new landed, and safe on shore; and began to look
up and thank God that my life was saved, in a case where-
in there were, some minutes before, scarcely any room to
hope. I believe it is impossible to express, to the life,
what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are, when it is
so saved, as I may say, out of the grave; and I did not
wonder now at the custom, viz., that when a mulei'actor,
who has the halter about his neck, 'is tied up, and just go-
ing to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him; 1
any, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to
let him blood that very moment they tell him of it, that
the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the
heart and overwhelm him.

" For sudden joys. like gn'cfs, confound at first."

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and
my whole being, as I may say, wrapped up in the contem-
plation of my deliverance, making a thousand gestures and
motions, which I can not describe; reflecting upon my
comrades that were drowned, and that there should not he
one soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw'4 ROB] N SON CRU 50E.

them afterward, or any sign of them, except three of their
hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel--when the breach
and froth of the sea being so bigl could hardly see it, it lay
so far off--and considered, Lord! how was it possible I
could get on shore?

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part
of my'condition I began to look around me, to see what
kind of a lace l was in, and what was next to be done;
and I soon onnd my comforts abate, and that, in a word,
I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes
to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink, to com-
fort me; neither did I see any prospect before me, but that
of perishing with hunger, or bring devoured by wild beasts;
and that which was particularly afflicting to me was that
I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature for
my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creat-
ure that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I
had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a
little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision; and
this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that for
awhile I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon
me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would
be my lot it there were any ravenous beasts in that coun-
try, seeing at night they always come abroad for their

rey.

p All the remedy that offered to my thou hts, at that
time, was to get up into a thick, bushy tree, ike a fir, but
thorny-which grew near me, and where I resolved to sit
all night--and consider the next day what death I should
die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a
furlong from the shore, to see if I could find an fresh
water to drink, which I did, to my great joy; and aving
drunk, and put a little tobacco into my mouth to prevent
hunger, I went to the tree, and getting u into it, en-
deavored to place myself so as that, if I shou 6. fall asleep,
I might not fall; and having cut me a short stick, like a
truncheon, for my defense, I took up my lodging, and hav-
ing been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep and slept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my con-
dition, and found myself the most refreshed with it that I
think I ever was on such an occasion.

Robinson finds Himself in a Desolate Island.----Procures a Stock of
Articles from the Wreck--Constructs his Habitation.

WHEN I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and
the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as
before; but that which surprised me most was that the
ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where she -
lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost
as far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had
been so bruised by the wave dashing against it. This be-
ing within about a mile from the shore where I was, and
the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on
board, that at least I might save some necessary things for
my use.

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I
looked about me again, and the first thing I found was the
boat, which lay, as the wind and the sea had tossed her up,
upon the land, about two miles on my right hand. I
walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her,
but found a neck or inlet of water between me and the
boat, which was about half a mile broad; so I came back
for the present, being more intent upon getting at the ship,
where I hoped to find something for my present subsist-
ence.

A little after noon, I found the see very calm, and the
tide ebbed so far out that 1 could come within a quarter of
a mile of the ship; and here I found afresh renewing of
my grief, for I saw evidently that if we had kept on board
we had been all safe; that is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entire-
ly destitute of. all comfort and company as 1 now was.
This forced tears from my eyes again; but as there was lit-
tle relief in that, I resolved, it possible, to get to the ship;
so I pulled ot'r my clothes, for the weather was hot to ex-
tremity, and took the water; but when I came to the ship
my difiiculty was still greater to know how to get on boar ,
for as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there
was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round
her twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of
rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hanging down
by the fore-chains so high that with great difficulty I got
hold of it, and by the help of that rope got into the fore-
castle of the' ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged,
and had a great deal of water in her bold; but that she lay
so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that
her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low,
almost to the water. By this means all her quarter was
free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may
be sure my first work was to search and to see what was
spoil-rd and what was free; and, first, I found that all the
ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the water,
and, being very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-
room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as 1
went about other things, for 1 had no time to lose. 1 also
found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large
dram, and which I had Indeed need enough of to spirit me
for what was before me. New I wanted nothing but a
boat to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not'to
be had, and this extremity roused my application; we had
several spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood,
and a spare topmost or two in the ship; I resolved to fall
to work with these, and flung as many overboard as I could
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that
they might not drive away. When this was done I went
down the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four
of them fast together at both ends, as well as I could, in
the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of
plank upon them crossways, 1 found I could walk upon it
very well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight,
the pieces being too light; so 1 went to work, and with the
carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths
and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labor and
pains. But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries
encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able
to have done upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable
weight. My next care was what to load it with, and how
to preserve what I laid u on it from the surf of the sea;
but I was not long consi ering this. I first laid all the
planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having con-

sidered well what most wanted, I got three of the sea-
men's chests, which I had broken open and emptied and
lowered them down upon my raft; these 1 filled with pro-
visions, via, bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five ieees of
dried goat's llesh (which we lived much upon), an a little
remainder of European corn, which had been laid by for
some fowls which we had brought to sea with us, but the
fowls were killed. There had been some barley and wheat
together, but, to my great disappointmnt, I found after-
ward that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for
liquors, 1 found several cases of bottles belonging to our
skipper, in which were some cordial waters; and in all
about five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by them-
selves, there being no need to put them into the chests, nor
any room for them. While I was doing this I found the
tide began to flow, though very calm; and I had the mor-
tification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had
lelt on shore, upon the sand, swim away; as for my
breechcs, which were only linen, and open-kneed, I swam
on board in them, and my stockings. However, this put
me upon rummaging for clothes, of which 1 found enough,
but took no more than I wanted for present use, for 1
had other things which my eye was more upon; as, first,
tools to work with on shore; and it was after long search-
ing that I found the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a
very useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a
ship-lading of gold would have been at that time. I got it
down to my ral't, even whole as it was, without losing time
to look into it, for I knew in general what it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the great
cabin, ud two pistols; these I secured first, with some
powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty
swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the
ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed them;
but with much search I found them, two of them dry and
good, the third had taken water. Those two I got to my
raft, with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty
well freightcd, and began to think how I should get to
shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and
the least capful of wind would have overset all my naviga-
tion.

I had three encouragements: let. A smooth, calm sea;
ldly. The tide rising, and setting in to the shore; 3dly.
What little wind there was blew me toward the land. And
thus, having found two or three broken oars belonging to
the boat, and besides the tools which were in the chest, I
found two saws, an ax, and a hammer; and with this cargo
1 put to sea. For a mile or thereabouts my raft went very
well, only that 1 found it drive a little distant from the
place where I had landed before; by which I perceived that
there was some indraft of the water, and consequently I
hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might
make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.

As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before me a lit-
tle opening of the land, and 1 found a strong current of
the tide set into it; so 1 guided my raft as well as I could,
to get into the middle of the stream. But here I had like
to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I
think it verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it
upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it
wanted but a little that all m cargo had slipped ofi toward
that end that was afloat, an so fallen into the water. I
did my utmost, by setting my back a ainst the chests, to
keep them in their places, but coul not thrust off the
raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir from the
posture I was in, but holding up the chests with all m
might, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in whic
time the rising of the water brought me a little more upon
a level; and a little after, the water still rising, my raft
floated again, and 1 thrust her 013' with the oar I had into
the channel, and then driving up higher, I at length found
myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides,
and a strong current or tide running up. I looked on both
sides for a )roper place to get to shore, for I was not will-
ing to be driven too high up the river, hoping in time to
see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place my-
self as near the coast as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the
creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided
my raft, and at last got so near as that, reaching ground
with my oar, I could thrust her directly in; but here I had
like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again, for
that shore lying pretty stee , that is to say, sloping, there
was no place to land but w ere one end of my float, if it
ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower,
as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All
that 1 could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest,
keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the
side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground,
which 1 expected the water would flow over; and so it did.
As soon as I found water enough, for my raft drew about
a foot of water, 1 thrust her upon that flat piece of ground,
and there fastened or moored her by sticking my two
broken cars into the ground, one on one side near one end,
and one on the other side near the other end; and thus I
lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my
cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to
secure them from whatever might happen. Where I was 1
yet knew not; whether on the continent or on an island;
whether inhabited or not inhabited; whether in danger of
wild beasts or not. There was a hill, not above u mile
from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which
seemed to overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge
from it, northward. I took out one of. the fowling- ieccs,
and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder, an thu,
armed I traveled for discovery up to the top of that hills
where, after I had, with great labor and difficulty, got up
to the top, I. saw my fate, to my great affliction, viz., that
I was in an island, enrironed every way with the sea, no
land to be seen, except some rocks which lay a great way
off, and two small islands, less than this, which lay about
three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as
I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild
beasts, of whom, however, I saw none; yet 1 saw ahund--
ance cf Iowls, but knew not their kinds; neither, when I
killed them, could I tell what was fit for feed and what
not. At my coming back I shot at a great bird, whirl: I
saw sitting upon a tree, on the side of a great wood. I be--
lieve it was the first gun that had been fired there since
the creation of the world; I had no sooner fired, but from
all the parts of the wood there arose an innumerable num-
ber of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming,
and crying, and every one according to his usual note; but
not one of them of any kind that I knew. As for the
creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its color
and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or claws more
than common. Its flesh was carrion and fit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft,
and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took
me up the rest of that day; what to do with myself at
night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I was
afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some
wild beast might devour me; though, as] afterward found,
there was really no need for those fears. However, as well
as I could, I barricaded myself round with the chests and
boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of
hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not
. which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or
three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where 1
shot the fowl.

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great
many things out of the ship, which would be useful to me,
and particularly some of the riggin and sails, and such
other things as might come to Ian ; and I resolved to
make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible. And
as I knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily
break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things
a art, till I got everything out of the ship that I could get.

hen I called a council. that is to say, in my thou hts,
whether 1 should take back the raft; but this appeared im-
practicable; so I resolved to go as before, when the tide was
( own; and I did so, only that I stripped before I went
from my hut; having nothing on but a checked shirt, 9.
pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and pre ared a second
raft; and having had experience of the first, neither made
this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought
away several things very useful to me; as, first, in the car-
penter's stores, I found two or three bags of nails and
spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatehets, and,
above all, that most useful thing called a grind-stone. All
these I secured together, with several things belonging to
the gunner; particularly two or three iron crows, and two
barrels of musket-bullets, seven muskets, and another
fowling-pieee, with some small quantity of powder more; a
large bagful of small shot, and a great roll of sheet-lead;
but this last was so heavy I could not hoist it up to get it
over the ship's side. Besides these things, I took all the
men's clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-topsoil, a
hammock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded my
second raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my
very great comfort.

1 was under some apprehensions lest, during my absence
from the land, my provisions might be devoured on shore:
but when 1 came back, 1 found no sign of any visitor; only
there sat a creature like a wild cat, upon one of the chests,
which, when 1 came toward it, ran away a little distance,
and then stood still. She sat very composed and uncon-
cerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a. mind
to be acquainted with me. I presented my gun to her,
but, as she did not understand it, she was perfectly uncon-
cerned at it, nor did she ofi'er to stir away; upon which I
tossed her a. bit of. biscuit, though, by the way, I was not
very free of it, for my store was not great; however, 1
spared her a. bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it,
and eat it, and looked (as pleased) for more; but I thank'
ed her, and could spare no more; so she marched elf.

Having got my second cargo on shore--though I was i'uin
to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels,
for they were too heavy, being large easks--I went- to work
to make me a little tent with the sail and some poles which
I cut for that purpose; and into this tent 1 brought every-
thing that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun, and
1 piled all the emptychests and easks up in a circle round
the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt either from
man or beast.

When I had done this I blocked up the door of the tent
with some boards within, and on empty chest set up on
end without, and spreading one of the beds upon the
ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and my
gun at length by me, 1 went to bed for the first time, and
slept very quietly all night, for 1 was very weary and heavy;
for the night before 1 had slept little, and had labored very
hard all day, as well to fetch all those things from the ship
as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever
was laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was not satiSiird
still, for while the ship sat upright in that posi or.>> I
thought I ought to get everything out of her that l coci-i;
so every day at low water I went on board and brought
any something or other; but particularly the third time I
went 1 brought away as much of the rigging as 1 could, as
also all the small ropes and ropetwine could get, with a
piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the sails n on
occasion, and the barrel of wet gun owder. In a wor , I
brought away all the sails first an last; only that] was
iain to cut them in pieces and bring as much at a time as
1 could; for they were no more useful to be sails, but as
mere canvas onl .

But that whic comforted me still more was that, last of
all, after I had made five or six such voyages as these, and
thought I had nothing more to expect from the ship that
was worth my meddling with; I say, after all this, I found
a great hogshead of bread, and three large runlets of rum or
spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this
was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting
any more provisions, except what was spoiled by the water.
I soon emptied the hogshead of that read, and wrapped
it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails which 1 out
out; and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore also.

The next day I made another voyage, and now havin
plundered the ship of what was ortable and fit to ban
out, I began with the cables, an cutting the great cable
into pieces such as 1 could move, I got two cables and a
hawser on shore, with all the iron work I could get; and
having cut down the spritsail~yard, and the mizzen. ard,
and everything I could, to make a large raft, 1 10a ed it
with all those heavy goods, and came away; but my good
luck begun now to leave me, for this raft was so unwreldy
and so overladen that after I was entered the little cove,
where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to
guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw
me and all my cargo into the water; as for myself, it was
no great harm, for 1 was near the shore, but as to my
cargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron,
which I expected would have been of great use to me; how-
ever, when the tide was out I got most of the pieces of cable
ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labor;
for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work which
fatigued me very much. After this I went every day on
board, and brought away what 1 could get.

1 had now been thirteen days ashore, and had been
eleven times on board the shi , in which time I had
brought away all that one pair 0 hands could well be sup-
posed capable to bring; though I believe verily, had- the
calm weather held, 1 should have brought away the whole
shi piece by piece, but preparing, the twelfth time, to go
on oard, 1 found the wind egan to rise; however, at low
water, I went on board, and though I thought 1 had rum-
maged the cabin so effectually as that nothing could be
found, at I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one
of whie I found two or three razors, and one pair of large
scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks;
in another I found about thirty-six pounds in money, some
European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some
gold, and some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. 0h, drug!
I exclaimed, what art thou good for? Thou art not worth
to me, no, not the taking off the ground; one of those
knives is worth all this heap. l have no manner of use for
thee; e'eu remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as
a creature whose life is not worth saving. However, upon
second thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another raft;

ut while 1 was preparing this I found the sky overcast,
and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it
blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred to
me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the
wind off shore; and that it was my business to be gone be--
fore the tide of flood began, or otherwise 1 might not be
able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly I let myself
down into the water, and swam across the channel which
lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with
difliculty enough, partly with the weight of the things
I had about me, and partly the roughness of the water; for
the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high
water it blew a storm.

But I was get home to my little tent, where I lay, with
all my wealth about rue very secure. It blew very hard all
that night, and in the morning when I looked out, behold,
no more ship was to be seen! 1 was a little surprised, but
recovered myself with the satisfactory reflection, viz., that
I had lost no time nor abated no diligence to get everything
out of her that could be useful to me, and that indeed
there was little left in her that 1 was able to bring away, if
I had had more time.

1 now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of

 

'I.'
anything out of her, except what might drive on shore,
from her wreck; as, indee , divers pieces of her afterward
did; but those things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing
myself against either savages, if any should appear, or
wild beasts, if any were in the island; and I had many
thoughts of the method how to do this, and what kind of
dwelling to make, whether I should make me a cave in the
earth or a tent upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved
upon both; the manner and description of which it may
not be improper to give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settle-
ment, particularly because it was upon a low, moorish
ground, near the sea, and I believed it would not be whole-
some; and more particularly because there was no fresh
Water near it. So I resolved to find a more healthy and
more convenient spot of ground.

1 consulted several things in my situation, which I found
would be proper for me: First, air and fresh water, I just
now mentioned; secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun;
thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether men or
beasts; fourthly, a View to the sea, that it God sent any
ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my de~
liveranee, of which I was not willing to banish all my ex-
pectation yet.

In search for a place proper for this, 1 found alittle
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front toward this
littie plain was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could
come down upon me from the top. On the side of this
rock, there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like
the entrance or door of a care; but there was not really
any care or way into tl e rock at all.

On the flat of the green, just below: this hollow place, I
resolved to pitch my tent. 'This plain was not above a.
hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like
a green before my door; and, at the end of it, descended
irregularly every way down into the low ground by the'sea-
side. It was on the NEW. side of the hill; so that it was
sheltered from the litttt every day, till it came to a W. and
by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those countries, is
near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the
hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its aemie
diameter from the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter,
from its be inning and ending.

In this elf-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes,
driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like

iles, the biggest end being out of the ground, about five
eat and a half, and sharpened on the top. The two rows
did not stand above six inches from each other.

Then 1 took the pieces of cable which I out in the ship,
and laid them in rows, one upon another, within the circle,
between these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing
other stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about two
feet and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence
was so strong that neither man nor beast could get into it
or- over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labor,
especially to out the piles in the woods, bring them to the
place, and drive thorn into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door,
but by a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder,
when l was in, I lifted over after me; and so 1 was com-
pletely fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all the
world, and consequently slept secure in the night, which
otherwise 1 could not have done; though, as it appeared
afterward, there was no need of all this caution against the
enemies that l apprehended danger from.

 

SECTION VI.

Carries all his Riohcs,Provisions, etc, into his Habitation--Dreami-
ness of Solitude--Consolatory Reflections.

INTO this fence, or fortress, with in finite labor, 1 carried
all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores,
of which you have the account above; and I made a large
tent, which, to preserve me from the rains that in one part
of the year are very violent there, I made double, viz., one
smaller tent within and one larger tent above it, and cov-
ered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin, which I had
saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed which I
had brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed
a very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my revisions, and every-
thing that would spoil by the wet ; an having thus inclosed

5
all my goods, I made 11 the entrance, which till now I had
left open, and so passe and repassed, as I said, by a shert
ladder.

When I had done this I began to work my way into the
rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug
down out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence
in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground
within about a foot and a half; and thus 1 made me a cave,
just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my
house. It cost me much labor and many days, before all
these things were brought to perfection; and therefore 1
must go back to some other things which took up some of
my thoughts. At the same time it happened, after I had
laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making
the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick, dark
cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that
3 gm clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I
was 8( much surprised with the lightning, as 1 was with a
thought which darted into my mind as swift as the light-
ning itself: Oh, my powder! My very heart sunk within
me when I thought, that at one blast, all my powder might
be destroyed; on which, not my defense only, but the pro-
viding me food, as I thought, entirely depended. I was
nothing near so anxious about my own (anger, though,
had the powder taken fire, I. should never have known who
had hurt me.

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the
storm was over I laid aside all my works, my building and
fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes to
separate the powder, and to keep it a little and a little in a
parcel, in hope that whatever might come, it might not all
take fire at once; and to keep it so apart that it should not
be possible to make one part fire another. I finished this
work in about a fortnight, and 1 think my powder, which
in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight,
was divided into not less than a hundred parcels. As to
the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any dan~
ger from that; so I placed it in my new care which, in my
fancy, I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down
in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it,
marking very carefully where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out
at least once every day with my gun, as well to divert my~
self as to see if I could kill anything fit for food; and, as
near as I could, to acquaint myself with what the island
produced. The first time I went out I presently discov~
ered that there were goats upon the island, which was a
great satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with this
misfortune to me, viz., that they were so shy, so subtle,
and so swift of foot, that it was the most difficult thing in
the world to come at them; but I was not discouraged at
this, not doubting but 1 might now and then shoot one,
as it soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a
little, I laid wait in this manner for them; I observed, if
they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the
roe 3, they would run away as in a terrible fright; but if
they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks,
they took no notice of me, from whence I concluded that
by the position of their optics, their eight was so directed
downward that they did not readily see objects that were
above them; so afterward, I took this method--I always
climbed' the rocks first, to get above them, and then had
frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made among
these creatures I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid
by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily;
but when the old one fell the kid stood stock-still by her
till I came and took her up; and not only so, but when I
carried the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid
followed me quite to my inclosure; upon which 1 laid down
the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and carried it
over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it
would not eat, so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself.
These two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I eat
sparingly and preserved my provisions (my bread espe-
cially) as much as possibly I could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely
necessary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to
burn; and what I did for that, as also how I enlar ed my
cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a ull ac-
count of it in its proper place; but I must first give some
little account of myself, and of my thoughts about living,
which, it may well be supposed, were not a few:

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was
not castaway upon that island without being driven, as is
said, by a violent storm quite out of the course of our in-
tended voyage, and a great way, via, SOme hundreds of
leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of man.
kind, 1 had great reason to consider it as a determination
of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this desolate
manner, I should end my life. The tears would run
plentifully down my face when I made these reflections;
and sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Provi-
dence should thus completely ruin its creatures, and render
them so absolutely miserable; so abandoned without he] ,
so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to
thankful for such a life.

But something always returned swift upon me to check
these thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly, one
day walking with my gun in my hand, by the sea-side, l
was very pensive upon the subjct of my present condition,
when reason, as it were, expostulated with me the other
way, thus: Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true;
but, pray remember, where are the rest of you? Did not
you come eleven of you into the boat? Where are the
ten? Why were not they saved, and you lost? Why were
you singled out? Is it better to be here or there? And
then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be considered
vtilith the good that is in them, and with what worse attends
t em.

Then it occurred to me again, how well 1 was furnished
for m subsistence, and what would have been my case if
it h not happened (which was a hundred thousand to
one) that the ship floated from the place where she first
struck, and was driven so near to the shore, that I had
time to get all these things out of her; what would have
been my case if I had been to have lived in the condition
in which I at first came on shore, without necessaries of
life, or necessaries to supply and procure them? Particu-
larly, said 1 aloud (though to myself), what should I have
done without a gun, without ammunition, without any tools
to make anything, or to work with, without clothes, bed~
ding, a tent, or any manner of coverin ? and that nowl
had all these to a sufficient quantity an was in a fair way
to provide myself in such a manner as to live without my
gun, when' my ammunition was spent; so that 1 had a
tolerable view of subsisting, without any want, as long as I
lived; for 1 considered, from the beginning, how I would
provide for the accidents that might happen, and for the
time that was to come, not only after my ammunition
should be spent, but even after my health or strength
should decay.

I confess, I had not entertained any notion of my am-
munition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder
being blown up by lightning; and this made the thoughts

of it so surprising to me when it lightened and thundered,
as I observed just now.

And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation
of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of
in the world before, 1 shall take it from its beginning and
continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th
of September, when, in the manner as above said, I first
set foot upon this horrid island, when the sun being to us
in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my heard;
for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the latitude
of nine degrees twenty-two minutes north of the Line.

 

SECTION VII.

Robinson's Mode of reckoning Time--Difficulties arising from
Want of Tools--He arranges his Habitation.

AFTER 1 had been there about ten or twelve days, it
came into my thoughts that 1 should lose my reckoning of
time for want of books and pen and ink, and should even
forget the Sabbath days from the working days; but, to
prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a lar e post, in
capital letters; and making it into a great cross, set it up
on the shore where 1 first landed, viz., " 1 came on shore here
on the 30th of September, 1659." Upon the sides of this
square post 1 out every day a notch with my knife, and
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and
every first day of the month as long again as that long one;
and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of time. '

But it happened that among the many things which I
brought out of the ship, in the several vo a s which, as
above mentioned, 1 made to it, I got severa t ings of less
value, but not at all less useful to me, which 1 found some-
time after in rummaging the chests; as, in particular,

which I did, more or less, every day.

1 now began to consider seriously my condition, and the
circumstance I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of
my affairs in writing, not so much to leave them to any
that were to come after me (for I was like to have but few
heirs), as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon
them, and afflicting my mind; and as my reason began
now to master my despondency, I began to comfort my-
self as well as 1 could, and to set the good against the evrl,
that I might have something to distin uish my case from
worse; and 1 stated very impartially, H e debtor and credi-

from the experience of the most miserable of all conditions
in this World, that we may always find in it something to
comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the description of
good and evil on the credit side of the account.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condi-
tion, and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could
spy a ship; I say, given over these things, I began to apply
myself to accommodate my way of living, and to make
things as easy to me as 1 could.

I have already described my habitation, which was a
tent under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong
pale of posts and cables; but 1 might now rather call it a
wall, for I raised a kind of wall against it of turfs, about
two feet'thick on the outside: and after some time (1 think
it was a year and a half) 1 raised rafters from it, leaning to
the rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees,
and such things as 1 could get, to keep out the rain; which
I found, at some times of the year, very violent.

I have already observed how 1 brought all my goods into
this ale, and into the cave which 1 had made behind me.
But i) must observe, too, that at first this was a confused
heap of goods which, as they lay in no order, so they took
up all my place; I had no room to turn myself: so 1 set
myself to enlarge my cave, and work further into the
' earth; for it was a loose sandy rock, whch yielded easily to
the labor I bestowed on it: and when I found 1 was pretty
safe as to the beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the
right hand, into the rock, and then turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out
in the outside of my pale or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a
back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me
room to stow my goods. '

And now 1 be an to apply myself to make such neces-
sary things as I ound I most wanted, particularly a chair
and a table; for without these I was not able to enjoy the
few comforts I had in the world; I could not write, or eat,
or do several things with so much pleasure, without a
table: so I went to work. . And here I must needs observe,
that as reason is the substance and original of the mathe-
matics, so by stating and squaring everything by reason,

had never handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by
labor, application, and contrivance I found at last, that I
wanted nothing but I could have made, especially it I had
had tools. However, I made abundance of things, even
without tools; and some with no more tools that an adze
and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way
before, and that with infinite labor. For exam le, if I
wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a
tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either
side with my ax, till I had brought it to be as thin as a

lank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true,

y this method, I could make but one board of a whole
tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more
than I had for a prodigious deal of time and labor which
it took mecup to make a plank or board: but my time or
labor was little worth, and so it was as well employed one
way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed
above, in the first place; and this I did out of the short
gases of; boards that 1 brought on my raft from the ship.

at when I wrought out some boards, as above, I made
large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over
another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools,
nails, and iron work on ; and, in a word, to separate every-
thing at large in their places, that I might easily come at
them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock, to hang
my guns, and all things that would hang up: so that had
my cave been seen, it looked like a general magazine of all
necessary things; and 1 had everything so ready at my
hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods
in such order, and especially to find my stock of all neces-
saries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every
day's employment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much
hurry, and not only as to labor, but in much discomposure
of mind; and my journal would, too, have been full of
many dnll things: for example, I must have said thus--
" Sept. 30th. After I had got to shore, and had escaped
drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliver-
ance, having first vomited, with the great quantity of salt
water which had got into my stomach, and recovering my-
oelt a little, I ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and
beating my head and face, exolaimin at nfy misery, and
crying cut 1 was undone, undone! til, tired and faint, I
was forced to lie down on the ground to repose; but durst
not sleep, for fear of being devoured."

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the
ship and got all that 1 could out of her, I could not iorbear
getting up to the top of a-little mountain, and looking out
to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship: then fancy that, at a vast
distance, I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it,
and, after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it
quite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thus in-
crease my misery by my folly.

But, having got over these things in some measure, and
having settled my household stuif and habitation, made
me a table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I
could, 1 began to keep my journal: of which 1 shall here
give you the copy (though in it will be told all these partic-
ulars over again) as long as it lasted; for, having no more
ink, l was forced to leave it off.

 

SECTION VIII.
Robinson's Journal--Details of his Domestic Economy and Con-
trivnnccs.--b'hock of an Earthquake.
THE J OURN AL.

SEPTEMBER 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson
Crusoe, being shipmecked, during a dreadful storm, in
the oiling, came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island,
which I called the ISLAND or Dssriim; all the rest or the
ship's company being drowned, and in 'self almost dead.

All the rest of: that day I spent in afliicting myself at the
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz., 1 had neither
food, house, clothes, weapon, nor place to H to: and, in
despair of any relief, saw nothing but deat before me;
that I should either be devoured by wild beasts, murdered
by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the
approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creat-
ures; but slept soundly, though it rained all night.

October 1. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise,
the ship had floated with the high tide, and was driven on
shore again much nearer the island; which, as it was some
comfort on one hand (for seeing her sit upright, and notRecluse-1r causes. I 65

broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind ababd, I might get
on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for
my relief,) so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at
the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all
stayed on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least,
that they would not have been all drowned, as they were:
and that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have
built us a boat, out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried
us to some other art of the world. I spent great part of
this day in perp exing myself on these things; but, at
length, seeing the ship almost dry, 1 went upon the sand
as near as I could, and then swam on board. This day
also it continued raining, though with no wind at all.

From the lst of October to the 24th. All these days
entirely spent in many several voyages to get all I could
out of the shi ; which I brought on shore, every tide of
flood, upon ra ts. Much rain also in these days, though
with some intervals of fair weather: but, it seems, this was
the rainy season.

Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got
upon it; but being in shoal water, and the things being
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was
out. '

Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts
of wind; during which time the ship broke in pieces (the
wind blowing a little harder than before) and was no more
to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at low
water. I spent this day in covering and securing the goods .
which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them.

Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find
out a place to fix my habitation; greatly concerned to
secure myself from any attack in the night, either from
wild beasts or men. Toward night 1 fixed upon a proper
place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my
encampment; which I resolved to strengthen with a work,
wall, or fortification, made of double piles lined within with
cables, and without with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carry-
ing all my goods to my new habitation, though some part
of the time it rained exceedingly hard.

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island
with my gun, to see for some food, and discover the coun-
try; when I akilled a she-goat, and her kid followed me
home, which I afterward killed also, because it would not
feed.

November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the first night; making it as large as I could,
with stakes driven in to swing my hammock upon.

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces
of timber which made my rafts; and with them formed a
fence round me, a. little within the place I had marked out
for my fortification.

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls
like ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon
I went to work to make me a table. '

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times of
work, of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time
of diversion; vim, every morning I walked out with my gun
for two or three hours. it it did not rain; then employed
myself to work till about eleven o'clock; then eat what I
had to live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep,
the weather being excessive hot; and then, in the evening,
to work again. The working part of this day and the next
was wholly employed in making my table, for I was yet
but a very sorry workman: though time and necessity
made me a. complete natural mechanic soon after, as I be-
lieve they would any one else.

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and dog,
and killed a wild cut; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh
good for nothing: of every creature that I killed I took off
the skins, and preserved them. Comin back by the sea-
shore, I saw many sorts of seafowl whie I did not under-
stand: but was surprised, and almost frightened, with two
or three seals; which while I was gazing at them (not well
knowing what they were) got into the sea, and escaped me
for that time.

Nov. 6. After my morning walk, I went to work with
my table again, and finished it, though not to my liking:
nor was it long before I learned to mend it.

Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The
7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was
Sunday, according to my reckoning), I took wholly up to
make me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a toler-
able shape, but never to please me; and, even in the mak-
ing, I pulled it in pieces several times.

Note. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omit--
ting hmy mark for them on my post, I forgot which was
whic .

Nov. 13. This day it rained; which refreshed me exceed-
ingly, and cooled the earth: but it was accom anied with
terrible thunder and lightning, which frightens me dread-
fully, for fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, 1 re-
solved to separate my stock of powder into as many little
parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making
little square chests or boxes, which might hold about a
pound, or two pounds at most, of powder: and so, putting
the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure and as re-
mote irom one another as ossible. On one of these three
days 1 killed a large bird t at was good to eat; but I knew
not what to call it.

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent, into
the rock, to make room for my further convenience.

Note. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work,
viz., a pickax, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so
I desisted from my work, and began to consider how to
supply those wants,"and make me some tools. As for a
pickax, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper
enough, though heavy: but the next thing was a shovel or
spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I
could do nothing eflectually without it: but what kind of
one to make I knew not.

Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, 1 found
a tree of that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they
call the iron-tree, from its exceeding hardness: of this,
with great labor, and almost spoiling my ax, I cut a piece;
and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough, for it was
exceeding heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood,
and my having no other way, made me a long while upon
this machine: for I worked it effectually, by little and
little, into the form of a shovel or s ade; the handle exact-
ly shaped like ours in England, 0 y that the broad part
having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last
me so long: however, it served well enough for the uses
which 1 had occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel,
I believe, made after that fashion, or so long in making.

1 was still deficient; for l wanted a basket, or a wheel-
barrow. A basket I could not make by any means, hav>>
ing no such things as twigs that would bend to make

6
wicker ware; at least, none yet found out: and as to the
wheelbarrow, 1 fancied 1 could make all but the wheel. but
thatl had no notion of; neither did I know how to go
about it: besides, I had no possible way to make iron god-
gcons for the spindle or axle of the wheel to run in: so I
gave it over: and, for carrying away the earth which I dug
out of the cave, I made me a thing like a had, which the
laborers carry mortar in for the bricklayers. ri'his was not
so difficult to me as the making the shovel: and yet this
and the shovel, and the attempt which 1 made in vain to
make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less than tour days; I
mean, always excepting my morning walk with my gun,
which I seldom omitted, and very seldom failed also bring-
ino- home something fit to eat.

"Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still, because
of my making these tools, when they were finished I went
on; and working every day, as my strength and time
allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in widening and
deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods commodi-
ouslv.

Note. During all this time, I worked to make this room
or care, spacious enough to accommodate me as a ware-
house, or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar.
As for a lodging, 1 kept to the tent: except that some-
times, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard that
1 could not keep myself dry; winch caused me afterward
to cover all my place within my pale with long poles, and
in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load
them with flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch.

December 10. I began now to think my care or vault
finished; when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too
large) a great quantity of earth fell down from the top and
one side; so much, that, in short, it frightened me, and
not without reason too; for if I had been under it, I should
never have wanted a gravedigger. Upon this disaster, I
had a great deal of work to do over again, for 1 had the
loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more import-
ance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure
no more would come down.

Dec. 11. This day 1 went to work with it accordingly;
and got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top,
with two iecss of board across over each post: this I
finished the next day; and setting more posts up with
boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured; and
the posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to
part off my house.

Dec. 17. From this day to the 30th, I placed shelves, and
knocked up nails on the posts, to hang everything up that
could be hung up: and now I began to be in some order
within doors.

Dec. 20. I carried everything into the cave, and began to
furnish my house, and set up some ieces of boards, like a
dresser, to order my victuals upon; ut boards began to be
very scarce with me: also I made me another table.

Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day: no stirring
out.

Dec. 25. Rain all day.

Dec. 26'. No rain; and the earth much cooler than be-
fore, and pleasanter.

Dec. 27. Killed 21 young goat; and lamed another, so
that l catched it, and led it home in a string: when I had
int home, 1 bound and splintered up its leg, which was

roke.

N. B. 1 took such care of it that it lived; and the leg
grow well, and as strong as ever: but, by nursing it so
long, it grew tame, and fed ufion the little green at my
door, and would not go away. his was the first time that
I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creat-
ures, that I might have food when my powder and shot was
all Spent.

Dec. 28, 29, 30, 31. Great heats, and no breeze; so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening, for
food; this time I spent in putting all my things in order
within doors.

January 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad early and
late with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day.
This evening, going further into the valleys which lay
toward the center of the island, I found there was plenty
of goats, though exceedino shy, and hard to come at; how-
ever, I resolved to try if foould not bring my dog to hunt
them down. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats: but I was mistaken,
for they all faced about u on the dog: and he knew his
danger too well, for he won 6. not come near them.

Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being still

jealous of my bein attacked by somebody, I resolved to
make very thick am strong.

N. B. This wall being described before, 1 purposely
omit what was said in the journal; it is sufficient to ob-
serve, that I was no less time than from the 3d of January
to the 14th of April, working, finishing, and perfecting
this wall; though it was no more than about twenty-five
yards in length, being a hall circle, from one place in the
rock to another place, about twelve yards irom it, the door
of the cave being in the center, behind it.

. All this time I worked very hard; the rains hindering
me man days, nay, sometimes weeks to ether: but
thought should never be perfectly secure tili this wall was
finished; and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labor
everything was done with, especially the bringing piles out
of the woods, and driving them into the ground; for I
made them much bigger than I needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double
fenced, with a turf wall raised up close to it, 1 persuaded
myself that if any people were to come on shore there they
would not perceive anything like a habitation: and it was
very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a
very remarkable occasion.

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for
ame every day, when the rain ermitted me, and made
requent discoveries, in these we] , of somethin or other

to my advantage; particularly, I found a kin of wild
pigeons, who build, not as wood- igeons, in a tree, but
rather as house-pigeons, in the ho es of the rocks: and,
taking some youn ones, I endeavored to breed them u

tame, and did so; iimt when they grew older. the flow 85
away; which, perhaps, was, at first, for want 0 feeding
them, for 1 had nothing to give them; however, I fre-
quently found their nests, and got their young ones, which
were very good meat. And now, in the managing my
household atfairs, I found myself wanting in many things,
which I thought at first it was impossible for me to make-
as indeed, as to some of them, it was: for instance, 1 could
never make a cask to be hooped. 1 had a small runlet or
two, as 1 observed before ; but I could never arrive at the
capacity of making one by them, though 1 3 ant many
Weeks about it: I could neither put in the he s, nor join
the staves so true to one another as to make them hold-':-- ;i-'.C\"5"SS<'v'C/:1=?:'= ~

water; so I gave that also over. In the next place, I was
at a great loss for candle; so that as soon as it was dark,
which was generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go
to bed. I remember the lam of bees-wax with which I
made candles in my African a venture; but I had none of
that now: the only remedy I had was, that when I had
killed a goat, 1 saved the tallow; and with a little dish
made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which 1 added
a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave
me light, though not a clear steady light like a candle. In
the middle of all my labors it happened, that in rummag-
ing my things, I found a little bag; which, as I hinted be-
fore, had been filled with corn, for the feeding of poultry;
not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship
came from Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had
been in the be was all devoured by the rats, and I saw
nothing in the ag but husks and dust; and being willing
to have the bag for some other use (1 think it was to put
powder in, when 1 divided it for fear of the lightning, or
some such use), I shook the husks of corn out of it, on one
side of my fortification, under the rock.

It was a little before the great rain just now mentioned,
that I threw this stnfi away; taking no notice of anything,
and not so much as remembering that I had thrown any-
thing there, when, about a month after, 1 saw some few
blades of something1 green, shooting out of the ground,
which I fancied mig t be some plant 1 had not seen; but 1
was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little
longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out,
which were perfect green barle , of the same kind as our
European, nay, as our English arley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confu-
sion of my thoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted
upon no religious foundation at all: indeed, I had ve few
notions of religion in my head, nor had entertain any
sense of any things that had befallen me, otherwise than as
chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God; without so
much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these
things, or his order in governing events in the world. But
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I knew
was not proper for corn, and especially as I knew not how
it came there, it startled me strangely; and I began to sug-
gest, that God had miraculously caused this grain to grow72 ' 'nosmsorv onusos.

without any help of seed sown, and that it was so directed
purely for my sustenance, on that wild miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of
my eyes; and I began to bless myself that such a rodigy
of nature should happen upon my account: and t is was
the more strange to me, because 1 saw near it still, all
alon by the side of the rock, some other strag ling stalks,
whic roved to be stalks of rice, and which knew, be-
cause Iphad seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashore
there.

1 not only thought these the pure roductions of Provi-
dence for my support, but, not dou ting that there was
more in the place, 1 went over all that part of the island
where I had been before, searching in every corner, and
under every rock, for more of it; but 1 could not find any.
At last it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shook out a
bag of chicken's-meat in that place, and then the wonder
began to cease; and 1 must confess, my religious thankful-
ness to God's providence began to abate too, upon the dis-
covering that all this was nothing but what was common;
though ought to have been as thankful for so strange and
unforeseen a providence, as if it had been miraculous: for
it was really the work of Providence, as to me, that should
order or appoint that ten or twelve rains of corn should
remain unspoiled, when the rats had estroyed all the rest,
as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I
should throw it out in that particular place, where, it be-
ing in the shade of a high rock, it sprung up immediately;
whereas, if 1 had thrown it anywhere else, at that time, it
would have been burned up and destroyed.

1 carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure,
in their season, which was about the end of June; and,
laying up every corn, I resolved to sow them all again;
hoping, in time, to have some quantity sufiicient to suppl
me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year that
could allow myself the least rain of this corn to eat. and
even then but sparingly, as shall show afterward in its
order; for I lost all that 1 sowed the first season, by no ob-
serving the proper time; as l sowed just before the dry
season, so that it never came up at all, at least not as it
would have done; of which in its place. .

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or
thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care;
and whose use was of the same kind, or to the same pur-
pose, viz., to make me bread, or rather food; for I found
ways to cook it up without baking, though I did that also
after some time. But to return to my journal.

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to
get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up;
contriving to get into it, not by a door, but over the wall,
by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of
my habitation.

April 16. Ifinished the ladder; so I 'went up with the
ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let
it down in the inside: this was a complete enclosure to me;
for within I had room enough, and. nothing could come at
me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, 1 had
almost all my labor overthrown at once, and myself killed;
the case was thusz--As I was busy in the inside of it, be-
hind my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, 1 was ter-
ribly frightened with a most dreadful surprising thing in-
deed; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come crumb-
ling down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of
the hill over my head, and two of the posts 1 had set up in
the cave cracked in a frightful manner. I was heartily
scared; but thought nothing of what really was the cause,
only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, as
some of it had done before: and for fear I should be buried
in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself
safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces
of the hill which I expected might roll down upon me. I
had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, than I
plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake: for the ground I
stood on shook three times at about eight minutes' dis-
tance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the
strongest building that could be supposed "to have stood on
the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which
stood about half a mile from me, next the sea, fell down
with such a terrible noise as 1 never heard in all my life.
1 perceived also that the very sea was put into a violent
motion by it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under
the water than on the island.

I was so much amazed with the thing itself (havin
never felt the like, nor discoursed with any one that had
that 1 was like one dead or stupefied; and the motion of'74 nonmsox CRUSOE.

the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was tossed
at sea: but the noise of the falling of the rock awaked me,
as it were; and rousing me from the stupefied condition I
was in, filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing but
the hill falling upon my tent and my household goods, and
burying all at once; this sunk my very soul within me a
second time.

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for
some time, I began to take courage; yet I had not heart
enough to go over my wall again, or fear of being buried
alive; but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down, and
disconsolote, not knowing what to do. All this while I
had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but
the common " Lord, have mercy upon me!" and when it
was over that went away too.

's'hile I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow
cloud y, as if it would rain; and soon after the wind rose by
little and little, so that in less than half an hour it blew a
most dreadful hurricane: the son was, all on a sudden,
covered with foam and froth; the shore was covered with a.
breach of the water; the trees were torn up by the roots;
and a terrible storm it was. This held about three hours,
and then began to abate; and in two hours more it was
quite calm, and began to rain very hard. All this while 1
5st upon the ground, very much terrified and dejected;
when, on a sudden, it came into my thoughts that these
winds and rain being the consequence of the earthquake,
the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might vent-
ure into my care again. With this thought my spirits be-
gun to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade me, 1
went in, and sat down in my tent; ut the rain was so vio-
lent, that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it;
and l was forced to get into my care, though very much
afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a
hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the
water go out, which would else have drowned my cave.
Attcr I had been in my cave for some time, and found no
more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more
composed. And now, to support my spirits, which indeed
wanted it very much, I went to my little store, and took a
small cup of rum; which, however, I did then, and always,
very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that
Was gone. It continued raining all that night and great
part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad: but
my mind being more composed, I began to think of what .I
had best do; concluding, that if the island was subject to
these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a
cave, but I must consider of building me some little but in
an open place, which I might surround with a wall, as 1 '
had one here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts
or men: for if I stayed where I was, I should certainly,
one time or other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from
the place where it now stood, being just under the hanging
precrpice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken
again, would certainly fall upon my tent. I spent the next
two days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving
where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of be-
ing swallowed alive affected me so that I never slept in
quiet; and yet the apprehension of lying abroad, without
any fence, was almost equal to it: but still, when I looked
'about, and saw how everything was put in order, how
pleasantly 1 was concealed, and how safe from danger, it
made me very loath to remove. In the meantime, it
occurred to me that it would require a vast deal of time
for me to do this; and that I must be contented to run the
risk where I was, till I had formed a convenient camp,
and secured it so as to remove to it. With this conclusion
I composed myself for a time; and resolved that 1 would
go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and
cables, etc, in a circle as before, and set up my tent in it
when it was finished; but that I would venture to stay
where 1 was till it was ready. and fit to remove to. This
was the 2lst.

April 22. The next morning I began to consider of
means to put this measure into execution; but 1 was at a
great less about the tools. I had three Iar e axes, and
abundance of hatchets (for we carried the atchets for
trafiic with the Indians); but with much cho ping and
cutting knotty hard wood, they were all fullo notches,
and dull: and though I had a grindstone, I could not turn
it and grind my tools too. This caused me as much
thought as a statesman would have bestowed u u a grand
point of politics, or a judge upon the life an death of a
man. At length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn7 6 nonmsozv eat-son.

it with my foot, that I might have both my hands at lib-
ertv.

i't'ote. I had never seen any such thing in England, or
at least not to take notice how it was done, though since 1
have observed it is very common there: besides that, my
grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost
me a. full week's work to bring it to perfection.

April 28, 29. These two whole days 1 took up in grind-
ing my tools, my machine for turning my grindstone per-
forming very well.

April 30. Having perceived that my bread had been low
a great while, I now took a survey of it, and reduced my<<
self to one biscuit-cake a day, which made my heart very
heavv.

 

SECTION IX.
Robinson obtains more Articles from the Wreck--His Illness and
Ailliction.

MAY 1. In the morning, looking toward the sea-side,
the tide being low, 1 saw something lie on the shore bigger
than ordinary, and it looked like a cask; when I came to
it 1 found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the
wreck of the ship, which Were driven on shore by the late
hurricane; and looking toward the wreck itself, I thought
it seemed to lie higher out of the water than it used to do.
I examined the barrel that was driven on shore, and soon
found it was a barrel of. gunpowder; but it had taken
water, and the powder was asked as hard as a stone; how-
ever, I rolled it further on the shore for the present, and
went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of
the ship, to look for more.

When 1 came down to the ship I found it strangely re-
moved. The forecastle, which lay before buried in the
sand, was heaved up at least six feet; and the stern (which
was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest, by the force
of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging of her) was
tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side; and the sand
was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out; whereas
there was a great piece of water before, so that I could not
come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swim-
ming. I was surprised with this at first, but soon con- '
eluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this
violence the ship was more broken open than formerly, so
many things came daily on shore, which the sea had
loosened, and which the. winds and water rolled by degrees
to the land. '

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of re- .
moving my habitation; and I busied myself mightily, that
day es cially, in searching whether 1 could make any way
into t e ship; but I found nothing was to be expected of
that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked u with
sand. However, as I had learned not to despair 0 any-
thing, I resolved to all everything to pieces that I could
of the chi , conclu ing that everything I could get from
her would e of some use or other to me.

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a
beam through, which I thought held some of the upper
part or carter-deck together; and when I had cut it
through, cleared away the sand as well asl could from
the side which lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was
obliged to give over for that time.

May 4. 1 went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that
I durst eat of, till 1 was weary of my sport; when, just go-
ing to leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had made
me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks; yet
I fre uently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat;
all which I dried in the sun and eat them dry.

May 5. Worked on the wreck; out another beam
asunder, and brought three great fir planks off from the
decks, which I tied together, and made swim on shore
when the tide of flood came on.

May 6. Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts
out of her, and other pieces of iron work; worked very
hard, and came home very much tired, and had thoughts
of giving it over. _

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but not with an in-
tent to work; but found the weight of the wreck had broke
itself down, the beams being cut; that several pieces of the
ship seemed to lie loose; and the inside of the' hold lay so
open that I could see into it; but almost full of water and
sand.

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow
to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the.
water and sand. I wrenched up two planks, and brought
them on shore also with the tide. I left the iron crow in
the wreck for next day.

May'9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made
way into the body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and
loosened them with the crow, but could not break them
up. I felt also a roll of English lead, and could stir it;
but it was too heavy to remove. .

May 10 to 14. Went every day to the wreck, and got
a great many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and
two or three hundredweight of iron.

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if 1 could not
cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one
hatchet, and driving it with the other; but as it .lay about
a foot and a half in the water, I could not make any blow
to drive the hatchet.

May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the force of the water;
but I stayed so long in the woods, to get pigeons for food,
that the tide prevented my going to the wreck that day.

May 17. saw some pieces of the wreck blown on
shore, at a rest distance, two miles ofi me, but resolved
to see what tiey were, and found it was a piece of the head,
but too heavy for me to bring away.

May 24. Every day, to this day, I worked on the
wreck; and with hard labor I loosened some things so
much, with the crow, that the first blowing tide several
casks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests; but the
wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that
day but pieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had some
Brazil pork in it; but the salt-water and the sand had
spoiled it. I continued this work every day to the 15th of
June, except the time necessary to get food ; which 1 always
appointed, during this part of my employment, to be
when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was
ebbed out; and by this time I had got timber, and plank,
and iron-work enough to have built a good boat, it 1 had
known how; and I also ot, at several times, and in several
" pieces, near one hundre -weight of the sheet-lead.

June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a lar e
tortoise, or turtle. This was the first I had seen, whic ,
it seems, was only my misfortune, not any defect of the
place, or scarcity; fnr had I happened to be on the other side
of the island, I might have had hundreds 0! them everyte-

day, as I found afterward; but perhaps have paid dear
enough for them.

June 1'7. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in
her three-score eggs, and her flesh was to me, at that time,
the most-savory and pleasant that I ever tasted in my lilo,
having had no flesh but of goats and fowls since I landed
in this horrid place.

J nos 18. Rained all that day, and I stayed within. I
thought, at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was sonieo
what chilly, which I knew was not usual in that latitude.

June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as iI the weather
had been cold.

June 20. No rest all night; violent pains in my head,
and feverish.

June 21. Very ill; frightened almost to death with
apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick and no help;
prayed to God for the first time since the storm oi? Hull;

ut scarce knew what I said, or why, my thoughts being
all confused.

June 22. A little better, but under dreadful appre--
hensions of sickness. '

June 23. Very had again; cold and shivering, and.
then a violent headache.

June 24. Much better.

June 25. An agne very violent; the fit held me seven
hours; cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it.

June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took
my .gun, but found myself very weak; however, 1 killed a
she goat, and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled
some of it, and cat. I would fain have stewed it, and
made some broth, but had no pot.

J une 27. The ague again so violent that I lay abcd all
day and neither eat nor drank. l was ready to perish for
thirst; but so weak 1 had not strength to stand up or to
get myself any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but
was light-headed; and when I was not, 1 was so ignorant
that I knew not what to say, only lay and cried, Lord,
look upon me! Lord, pitv' me! Lord, have mercy upon

, me! I suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours,

till the fit wearing off, I fell aslee , and did not wake till
far in the night. When I awoke, found In self much re-
freshed, but weak and exceeding thirsty; owever, as I

had no water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie

  

<<f
till morning, and went to sleep again. In this second sleep
I had this terrible dream: I thought that 1 was sitting on
the ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when
the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man
descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire,
and light 11 on the ground; he was all over as bright as a
flame, so t at 1 could but just hear to look toward him;
his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossi-
ble for words to describe; when he stepped upon the
ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as
It had done before in the earthquake; and all the air
looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled with
flashes of fire. He had no sooner landed upon the earth,
but he moved forward toward me with a long spear or
weapon in his hand, to kill. me; and when he came to a
rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me, or I heard
a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express the ter-
ror of it; all that 1 can say I understood was this: Seeing
all these things have not brought thee to repentance, now
thou shalt die; at which words I thought he lifted up the
spear that was in his hand to kill me.

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that
I should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this
terrible vision; 1 mean, that even while it was a dream, I
even dreamed of those horrors; nor is it any more possible
to describe the impression that remained upon my mind
when l awaked, and found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had received
by the good instruction of my father was then worn out,
by an uninterrupted series, for eight years, of seafaring
wickedness, and a constant conversation with none but such
as were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last de-
gree. I do not remember that I had, in all that time, one
thought that so much as tended either to looking upward
toward God, or inward toward a reflection upon my own
ways; but a certain stupidity of soul, without desire of
good, or consciousness of evil, had entirely overwhelmed
me, and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,
wicked creature among our common sailors can be sup-
posed to be; not having the least sense, either of the fear
of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to Him, in deliver-
ances.

be the indie easily believed, when I shall add, that through
all the variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me,
I never had so much as one thought of its being the hand
of God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin;
either my rebellious behavior against my father, or my
present sins, which were great; or even as a punishment
for the general course of my wicked life. When 1 was on
the desperate expedition on the desert shores of Africa, I
never had so much as one thought of what would become
of me, or one wish to God to direct me whither 1 should
go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently sur-
rounded me, as well from voracious creatures as cruel sav-
ages; but I was quite thoughtless of a God or a Providence;
acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and
by the dictates of common sense only, and indeed hardly
that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea by the
Portuguese captain, well used, and dealt with justly and
honorably, as well as charitably, 1 had not the least thank-
fulness in my thoughts. When, again, I was shipwrecked,
ruined, and in danger of drowning, on this island, I was as
far from remorse, or lookin on it as a judgment; I only
said to myself often that was an unfortunate dog, and
born to be always miserable.
It is true, when I first got on shore here, and found all
my ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was sur--
prised with a kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul,
which, had the grace of God assisted, might have come up
to true thankfulness; but it ended where it began, in a
more common flight of joy; or, as I may say, being lad I
was alive, without the least reflection upon the istin-
fillSlled goodness of the hand which had preserved me, and
rad singled me out to be preserved when all the rest were
destroyed, or any inquiry why Providence had been thus
merciful to me; just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after they are got safe ashore from
a shipwreck; which they drown all in the next bowl of
punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over; and all the
rest of. my life was like it. Even when 1 was, afterward,
on due consideration, made sensible of my conditionwhow
1 was cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of hu-
man kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemp-
tion--as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and that 1
should not starve and perish ,for hunger, all the sense at
my affliction were off, and I began to be very easy, applied
myself to the works proper for my preservation and supply,
and was far enough from being afflicted at my condition,
as a judgment from Heaven, or as the hand of God against
me; these were thoughts which very seldom entered into
my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal,
had at first some little influence upon me, and began to
street me with seriousness, as long as I thought it had
something miraculous in it; but as soon as that part of the
thought was removed, all the impression which was raised
from it wore oil also, as l have noted already. Even the
earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its
nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible
Power which alone directs such things, yet no sooner was
the fright over, but the impression it had made went off
also. I had no more sense of God or His judgments, much
less of the present afiliction of my circumstances being
from His hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous
condition of life. But now, when I began to be sick, and
a leisure view of the miseries of death came to place itself
before me; when my spirits began to sink under the bur-
den of a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with
the violence of the fever; conscience, that had slept so
long, began to awake, and 1 reproached myself with my
past life, in which 1 had so evident} , by uncommon
wickedness, provoked the justice of G to lay me under
uncommon strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a
manner. These reflections oppressed me for the second
or third day of my distemper; and, in the violence as well
of the fever as of the dreadful reproaehes of my conscience,
extorted from me some words like praying to God; though
I can not say it was a prayer attended either with desires
or with ho me; it was rather the voice of mere fright and
distress. y thoughts were confused; the convictions great
upon my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable
condition, raised vapors in my head with the mere appre-
hension; and, in these hurries of my soul, I knew not what
my tongue might express; but it was rather exclamation,
such as, Lord, what a miserable creature am I! If I should
be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help; and what
will become of me? Then the tears burst out of my eyes,
and I could say no more for a good while. In this interval
the good advice of my father came to my mind, and pres-
ently his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginnin of
this story, viz., that if I did take this foolish step, ed
would not bless me; and 1 should have leisure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there might
be none to assist in my recovery. Now, said I, aloud, my
dear father's words are come to pass. God's justice has
overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me. 1 re.
jected the voice of Providence, which had mercifully put
me in a station of life wherein 1 might have been happy
and easy; but 1 would neither see it myself nor learn from
my parents to know the blessing of. it. I left them to
mourn over my folly; and now 1 am left to mourn under
the conse uences of it. I refused their help and assistance,
who woul have pushed me in the world, and would have
made everything easy to me; and now I have difficulties to
struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support;
and no assistance, no comfort, no advice. Then I cried
out, Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress. This
was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that 1 had made
for many years. But I return to my journal.

 

SECTION X.

His Recovery.-----His Comfort in Reading the Scriptures.---Makes an
Excursion into the Interior of the Island.----Forms his " Bower."

JUNE 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the
sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up;

and though the fright and terror of my dream were very ~

great, yet I considered that the fit of the ag'ue would re-
turn again the next day, and now was my time to get some-
thing to refresh and support myself when I should be ill.
The first thing 1 did was to fill a large square case-bottle
with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed;
and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water,
I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed
them together. Then 1 got me a piece of the goat's flesh,
and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I
walked about, but was very weak, and withal very sad and
heavy-hearted in the sense of my miserable condition,
dreading the return of my'distemper the next day. At
night, I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs,,
which I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the
shell; and this was the first bit of meat 1 had ever asked
God's blessing to, as I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found myself so
weak that I could hardly carry the gun (for 1 never went
out without that); so I went but a little way, and sat down
upon the ground, looking out upon the pea, which was just
before me, and very calm and smoot . As I sat here,
some such thoughts as these occurred to me: What is this
earth and sea, of which 1 have seen so much? Whence is
it roduced? And what am I, and all the other creatures,
wiid and tame, human and brutal? Whenoe are we?
Surely, we are all made by some secret power, who
firmed the earth and sea, the air and sky. And who is
that? Then it followed most naturally, It is God that has
made all. Well, but then, it came on, if God has made all
these things, He guides and governs them all, and all
things that concern them, for the power that could make
all thin s must certainly have power to guide and direct
them; i so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of His
works, either without His knowledge or appointment.

And if nothing happens without His knowledge He
knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition;
and if nothing happens without His appointment, He has
appointed all this to befall me. Nothing occurred to my
t ought to contradict any of these conclusions; and there-
fore it rested upon me with the greatest force that it must
needs be that God had appointed all this to befall me; that
I was brought to this miserable circumstance by His direc--
tion, He having the sole power, not of me ugly, but of
everythin that ha pens in the world. Imm iately it
followed, 'hy has 0d done this to me? What have I
done to be thus used? My conscience resently checked
me in that inquiry, as if 1 had blaspheme ; and methou ht
it spoke to me like a voice! Wretch, dost thou ask w rat
thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful misspent life,
and ask thyself what thou hast not done. Ask why is it
that thou wert not long 0 destroyed? Why wert than
not drowned in Yarmouth oads; killed in the fight when
the ship was taken by the Sallee man-of-war; devoured by
the wild beasts on the coast of Africa, or drowned haw,
when all the crew perished but th self? Dost thou ask
what thou hast done? 1 was strue dumb with these re-.- v- . .. --.v>> .".'-'!".-.,"-_~|'-' .r-v'

flections, as one astonished, and had not a word to say; no,
not to answer to myself; and, rising up pensive and sad,
walked back to my retreat, and went over my wall, as if 1
had been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly dis-
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in
the chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark.
Now, as the apprehension of the return of my distem er
terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought, hat
the Brazilians take no physio but their tobacco for almost
all distempers; and 1 had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one
of the chests, which was quite cured; and some also that
was green, and not quite cured.

1 went, directed b Heaven, no doubt; for in this chest
1 found a cure both or soul and body. 1 opened the chest,
and found what I looked for, viz., the tobacco; and as the
few books I had saved lay there too, 1 took out one of: the
Bibles which I mentioned before, and which, to this time,
I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look
into. I say I took it out, and brought both that and the
tobacco with me to the table. What use to make of the
tobacco I knew not, as to my distemper, nor whether it
was good for it or not; but I tried several experiments
with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way or other.
I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in m mouth,
which indeed at first almost stupefied my brain, t e tobac~
co being green and strong, and such as I had not been
much used to. Then I took some and steeped it an hour
or two in some rum and resolved to take a dose of it when
I lay down; and lastly, I burned some upon a pan of coals,
and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as 1
could bear it, as well for the heat as almost for suffocation.
In the interval of this operation I took up the Bible and
began to read; but my head was too much disturbed by
the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only,
having opened the book casually, the first words that oc-
curred to me were these: " Call on Me in the day of
trouble, and 1 will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify
Me." These words'were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of reading
them, though not so much as they did afterward; for, as
for bein delivered, the word had no sound, as I may say,
to me; t 1e thing was so remote, so impossible in my appre-
hension of things, that, as the children 01 Israel said when
they were promised flesh to eat, " Can God spread a table
in the wilderness?" so I began to say, (Jun even God him-
self deliver me from this place? And as it was not for
many years that any hopes appeared, this prevailed very
often upon my thoughts; but, however, the words made a.
great impression upon me, and l mused u on them very
often. It now grew late, and the tobacco lad, 381 said,
dazed my head so much that I inclined to sleep: so 1 left
my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anythin
in the night, and went to bed. But before I laydownd
did what I never had done in all my life; I knelt down,
and prayed to God to fulfill the promise to me, that if 1
called upon Him in the day of trouble He. would deliver
me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was over I
d rank the rum in which 1 had steeped the tobacco, which
was so strong and rank of the tobaceo that indeed I could
scarce get It down; immediately upon this I went to bed.
I found presently the rum flew up into my head violently,
but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more till, by
the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the
afternoon the next day; nay, to this hour, 1am partly of
opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till
almost three the day after; for otherwise I know not how
I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the
week, as it appeared some years after 1 had done: for if I
had lost it by crossing and recrossmg the Line, I should
have lost more than one day; but certainly 1 lost a day in
my account, and never knew which way. Be that, how-
ever, one way or the other, when l awaked l Iouiid myself
exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful;
when I got up 1 was stronger than lwas the day before,
and my stomach better, for I was hungry; and, in short, I
had no fit the next day. but continued inneh altered for
the better. This was the 29th,

The 30th was my well day, of course; and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed
a sea-fowl or two, something like a brand goose, and
brought them home; but was not very forward to eat them;
so 1 eat some more of the tnrtle's eggs, which were very
good. This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had
supposed did me good the day before, viz., the tobacco
stee ed in rum; onlyI did not take so much as before, nor
did I. chew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke;30321601! CEO"). 8'?

however, I was not so well the next day, which was the 1st
of J uly, as I hoped I should have been, for I had a little
of the cold' fit, but it was not much.

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and
dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the quantity
which I drank.

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did
not recover my full strength for some weeks after. While
I was thus gathering strenlgth, my thoughts ran exceeding-
ly upon this Scripture, " will deliver thee;" and the im-
possibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in

ar of my ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging my-
self with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I
pored so much upon my deliverance from the main amic-
tion, that 1 disregarded the deliverance 1 had received; and
I was, as it were, made to ask myself such .questions as
these, viz.: Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully,
too, from sickness, from the most distressed condition that
could be and that was so frightful to me? and what notice
have 1 taken of it? Have I done my part? God has de-
livered me, but I have not glorified Him; that is to say, I
have not owned and been thankful for that as a deliver-
ance; and how can I expect a greater deliverance? This
touched my heart very much, and immediately I knelt
down and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my
sickness.

July 4. In the mornin I took the Bible; and beginnin
at the New Testament, began seriously to read it; an
imposed upon myself to read awhile every morning and
every night; not binding myself to the number of chapters,
but as long as my thoughts should engage me. It was not
long after set seriously to this work, that I found my
heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wicked-
ness of my set life. The impression of my dream re-
vived; and t 6 words, All these things have not brought
thee to re entance, ran seriously in my thoughts. 1 was
earnestly egging of God to give me re ntance, when it
hap ened providentially, the very same ay, that, reading
the Ecripture, I came to these words, "He is exalted a
Prince and a Saviour; to give repentance and to give remis-
sion." I threw down the book; and with m heart as well
as m hands lifted u to heaven, in a kin of ecstasy of
joy, cried out alou , Jesus, thou son 01 David! Jesus,
thou exalted Prince and Saviour! give me repentance! This
was the first time in all my life I could say, in the true
sense of the words, that I prayed; for now I prayed with a
sense of my condition, and with a true scripture view of
hope, founded on the encouragement of the word of God:
and from this time, I may say, I began to have hope that
God would hear me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above,
" Call on Me, and 1 will deliver thee," in a different sense
from what I had ever done before; for then I had no notion
of anything being called deliverance, but my being deliv-
ered from the captivity I was in: for though I was indeed
at large in the place, yet the island was certainly a prison
to me, and that in the worst sense of the word. But now
I learned to take it in another sense: now I looked back
upon my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared
so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but deliv~
erance from the load of guilt that bore down all my com-
fort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so
much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was
all of no consideration, in comparison with this. And I
add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that
whenever they come to a true sense of things, they will
find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than de-
liverance from affliction.

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable
as to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind: and
my thoughts being directed, by constantly. reading the
Scripture and praying to God, to things of a higher nature,
I had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I
knew nothing of; also, as my health and strength re-
turned, 1 bestirred me to furnish myself with everything
that 11 wanted, and make my way of living as regular as l
C 011 \ .

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefl employed
in walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a
little at a time, as a man that was gathering up his
strength after a fit of sickness: for it is hardly to be im-
agined how low I was, and to what weakness 1 was reduced.
The application whichI made use of was perfectly new,
and perhaps what had never cured an ague before: neither
can I recounnend it to any one to practice, by this experi-
ment: and though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather cou-
tributed to weakening me; for 1 had fre uent convulsions
in my nerves and limbs for some time: learned from it
also this, in particular; that being abroad in the rainy sea-
son was the most pernicious thing to my health that could
be, especially in those rains whit-h came attended. with
storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came
in the dry season was almost always accompanied with such
storms, so 1 found that this rain was much more dangerous
than the rain which fell in September and October.

1 had now been in this unhappy island above ten months:
{all possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to
be entirely taken from me; and 1 firmly believed that no
human shape had ever set foot upon that place. Havinw
secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I
had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the
island, and to see what other productions 1 might find,
'which I yet knew nothing of.

It was on the 15th of July that 1 be an to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. went up the creek

rst, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I
found, after 1 came about two miles up, that the tide did
not flow any higher; and that it was no more than a little
brook of running water, very fresh and good: but this be-
ing the dry season, there was hardly any water in some

arts of it; at least, not any stream. On the banks of this

rook 1 found many pleasant savannas or 'meadows, plain,
smooth; and covered with grass; and on the rising parts of
them, next to the higher grounds (where the water, as it
might be supposed, never overflowed), 1 found a great deal
of tobacco, green, and rowing to a very great and strong
stalk: and there were ivers other plants, which I had no
knowledge of, or understanding about, and that might,
perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find
out. I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians,
in all that climate, make their bread of; but 1 could find
none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not understand
them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild; and, for want
of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with these
discoveries for this time; and came back, musing with my-
self what course I might take to know the virtue and good-
ness of any of the fruits or plants which I should dicover;
but could brin it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had

made so little 0 nation while I was in the Brazils, that 1
knew little of the plants in the field; at least, very little
that might serve me to any purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the llllh, I went up the same way again;
and after going something further than I had gone the day
before, I found the brook and the savannas begin to
cease, and the country become more woody than before.
In this part I found dilIeront fruits; and particularly I
found melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
grapes upon the trees: the vines, indeed, had spread over
the trees, and the clusters of rapes were now just in their
prime, very ripe and rich. 'his was a surprising discov-
ery. and I was exceedingly glad of them, but I was warned
by my experience to eat spariucrly of them: remembering
that when I was ashore in Bar ary, the outing of grapes
killed several of our Englislunon. who were slaves there,
by throwing them into lluxes and fevers. I found, how-
ever, an excellent use for these grapes; and that was to
cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes
or raisins are kept; which I thought would be (as indeed
they were) as wholesome and as agreeable to eat, when no
grapes were to be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my
habitation; which, by the way, was the first night, as I
might say, Iliad laiu from home. At night, I took my
first eontrivancc, and got up into a tree, where I slept well;
and the next morning proceeded on my discovery, travel-
ing near four miles, as I might judge by the length of the
valley. keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the
south and north sides of me. At the end of this march I
came to an opening, where the country seemed to descend
to the west: and a little spring of fresh water, which issued
out at the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that
is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green,
so flourishing, ever thing being in a constant verdure, or
flourish of spring, t at it looked like a planted garden. I
descended a little on the side of that delicious valc, survey-
lug;r it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed with
other aillicting thoughts), to think that this was all my
own; that l was king and lord of all this country indefens-
ibly, and had a right of possession; and, if I could convey
it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord
of a manor in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-
trees, and orange, lemon, and Citron-trees, but all wild,
and very few bearing any fruit; at least not then. How-
ever, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleas-
ant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice
afterward with water, which made it very wholesome, and
very cool and refreshing. 1 found new 1 had business
enough, to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay
up a store, as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to fur-
nish myself for the wet season, which I knew was up reach-
ing. In order to do this, I gathered a great heap o grapes
in one place, a lesser heap in another place; and a great
parcel of limes and lemons in another place; and taking a
few of each with me, I traveled homeward; and resolved
to come again, and bring a bug or suck, or what I could
make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent
three days in this journey, I came home (so I must now
call my tent and my cave): but before 1 got thither, the
grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruits, and the
weight of the juice, having broken and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they were
good, but I could bring only a few.

The next day being the 19th, I went back, having made
me two small bags to bring home my harvest; but I was
surprised when coming to my heap of grapes, which were
so rich and line when I gathered them, 1 found them all
spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some
here, some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By
this I concluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts
which had done this, but what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them up in heaps
and no carrying thorn away in a sack; but that one way
they would be destroyed, and the other way they would be
crushed with their own weight; 1 took another course: 1
then gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung
them upon the out-branches ot the trees, that they might
cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and lemons,
I carried as many back as 1 could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated
with great pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the
pleasantness of the situation; the security from storms on
that side; the water and the wood; and concluded thatI
had itched upon a place to fix my abode in, which was by
far t e worst part 0 the countr . Upon the whole, I be
gan to consider of removing my abitation, and to look out92 Bonuses cuuson.

for a place equally safe as where I was now situated; it pos-
sible, in the pleasant fruitful part of the island.

This thought run long in my head; and l was exceeding
fond of it for some time, the pleasantuess of the place tempt-
ing me: but when I came to a neurer view of it, 1 consid-
ered that l was now by the sea-side, where it was at least
1.)ossibiethnt something might happen to my advantage,
and, by the some ill-farce that brought me hither, might
bring some other unhappy wretches to the some place; and
though it was scarce probable that any such thing should
ever happen, yet to inolose myself among the hills and
woods in the center oi the island, was to anticipate my
bondage, and to render such an afl'eir not only improbable,
but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any
means to remove. Rowers-.31 was so enamored of this
place, that I spent much of my time there for the whole
remaining part of the month of July; and though, upon
second thoughts, I resolved, as above stated, not to re-
move, yetl built me a. little kind of a bower, and sur-
rounded it at 1:. distance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as 1 could reach, well-staked, and filled be-
tWeen with brushwood. Here I lay very secure sometimes
two or three nights together; always going over it with a
ludder, as before: so that l fancied now I had my country
and my sea-coast house. This work took me up till the
beginning of August.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy
my labor, when the ruins came on, and made me stick
close teeny first habitation: for though 1 had made a tent
like, the other, with a piece of soil, and spread it very well,
yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms,
nm- u sure behind me to retreat into when the rains were
extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, 1 had finished
my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The 3d of August,
I found the grupesl had hung up were perfectly dried, and
indeed were excellent good raisins of the sun; so I began to
take them down from the trees; and it was very happy
that 1 did so, as the rains which followed would have
spoiled them, and I should have lost the best part of my
winter food; for I had above two hundred large bunches of
them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried
most of. them home to my cave, but it began to rain: and
from hence, which was the 14th of Au ust, it rained, more
or less, every day till the middle of ctober; and some-
times so violently, that.I could not stir out of my cave for
several days.

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of
my family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of
my cats, who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had
been dead; and I heard no more of her, till, to my aston-
ishment, she came home with three kittens. This was the
more strange to me, because, about the end of August,
though I had killed a wild cat, as 1 called it, with my gun,
yet I thought it was quite a different kind from our Euro-
pean cats: yet the young cats were the same kind of house-

reed as the old one; and both of my cats being females, I
thought it very strange. But from these three, 1 afterward
came to be so pestered with cats that l was forced to kill
them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from
my house as much as possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain; so
that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be
much wet. In this confinement, I began to be straitened
for food; but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat,
and the last day, which was the 24th, found a very large
tortoise, which was a treat to me. My food was now regu-
lated thus; I eat a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a
piece of the goat's flesh, or of the turtle, broiled, for my
dinner (for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil
or stew anything;) and two or three of the turtle's eggs for
my supper.

During this confinement in my cover from the rain, I
worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave; and
by degrees worked it on toward one side, till 1 came to the
outside of the hill; and made a door, or way out, which
came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out
this way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open: for
as I had managed myself before, 1 was in a perfect enclos-
ure; whereas now, I thought I lay exposed; and yet I
could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear,
the biggest creature that I had as yet seen upon the island
being a goat. .

sary of my landing: I cast up the notches on m post, and

days. lkept this day as a solemn fast! setting it apart
for religious exercise, plrostrating myself on the ground
with the most serious umiliation, confessing my sins to
God, acknowledging His righteous judgments u on me, and .
praying to Him to have mercy on me through esus Christ,
and having not tasted the least refreshment for twelve
hours, even till the going down of the sun. I then eat a
biscuit and a bunch of gra es, and went to bed, finishing
the day asI began it. 1 ad all this time observed no
Sabbath-day; for as at first I had no sense of religion upon.
my mind, 1 had, after some time, omitted to distinguish
the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the
Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what any of the
days were: but now having cast up the days, as above. I
found I had been there a year; so divided it into weeks,
and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though 1
found, at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two
in my reckoning. A little after this, my ink beginning to
fail me, 1 contented myself to use it more sparingly; and
to write down only the most remarkable events of my life,
without continuing a daily memorandum of other things.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to ap-
pear regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to
provide for them accordingly; but I bought all my experi-
ence before Ihad it; and what I am going to relate was
one of the most discouraging experiments that I had made
at all.

1 have mentioned that I had saved a few ears of barley
and rice, which 1 had so surprisin 1y found sprung u ), as
I thought, of themselves. I be ieve there were a out
thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now
I thought it a proper time to sow it after the rains; the sun
being in its southern position, going from me. Accord-
ingly I dug a piece of ground, as well as 1 could, with my
wooden spade; and divrding it into two parts, I sowed my
grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my
thou hts that I would not sow it all at first, because I did
not now when was the proper time for it; so 1 sowed
about two thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of
' each: and it was a great comfort to me afterward that 1
did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time came to
anything; for the dry month following, and the earth har-
ing thus had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no
moisture to assist its growth, and never came up at all till
the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if. it
had been but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not
grow, which I easily imagined was from the drought, I
sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial
in; and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower,
and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before
the vernal equinox. This having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly,
and yielded a very good crop; but having only art of the
seed left, and not daring to sow all that I had, got but a
small quantity at last, my whole cro not amounting to
above half a peck of each kind. But y this experiment I
was made master of my business, and knew exactly when
was the proper time to sow; and that I might expect two
seed-times, and two harvests, every year.

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery,
which was of use to me afterward. As soon as the rains
were over, and the weather began to settle, which was
about the month of November, 1 made a visit up the coun-
try to my bower; where, though I had not been for some
months, yet I found all things just as I had left them.
The circle or double hedge that 1 had made was not only
firm and entire, but the stakes which 1 had cut out of
some trees that rew thereabouts, were all shot out and
grown with long branches, as much as a willow-tree unal-
ly shoots the first year after lopping its head; but I could
not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from.
I was surprised, and yet veryl well pleased, to see the young
trees grow; and 1 pruned t em, and led them to grow as
much alike as I could: and it is scarce credible how beau-
tiful a figure theygrew into in three years: so that, though
the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diam-
eter, yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon
covered it, and it was a com lete shade, sufiicient to lodge
under all the dry season. his made me resolve tocut
some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a
semicircle round my wall $1 mean that of my first dwell-
ing), which 1 did: and pacing the trees or stakes in a
double row, at about ei t yards distance from my first
fence, they grew present y; and were at first a fine cover
to my habitation, and afterward served for a defense also,
as I shall observe in its order.

SECTION XI.

Robinson Makes a Tour to Explore his Island-Employed in
Basket-making.

I FOUND now that the seasons of the year might general-
ly be divided, not into summer and winter as in Enron>>,
but into the rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were
generally thus; From the middle of February to the mid-
dle of April, rainy; the sun being then on or near the
equinox. From the middle of April till the middle of
August, dry; the sun being then north of the Line. From
the middle of August till the middle of October, rainy; the
sun being then come back to the Line. From the middle
of October till the mild e of February, dry; the sun being
then to the south of the Line.

The ruiny seasons held sometimes longer and sometimes
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but this was the
general observation I made. After I had found, by experi-
ence, the ill oonsequem-es of being abroad in the rain, I
took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand,
that I might not be obliged to go out; and I sat within
doors as much as possible during the wet months. This
time I found murh employment, and very suitable also to
the time; for I found great occasion for many things which
I had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labor and
constant appliration: particularly, I tried many ways to
make myself a basket: but all the twigs I could get for the
purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was
a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at. a basket-
muher's in the town where my father lived, to see them
make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are,
very oilieious to help, and a great observer of the manner
how they worked these things, and sometimes landings
hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the methods
oi it, so that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it
came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from
whence I out my stakes that grew might possibly be as
tough as the sullows, willows, and osiers, in England; and
I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day, I went to
my country-house, as I called it; and cutting some of the. . "we-$25?" EH;:'F:@E;W~JWSS1H?T:: -:,--u'-q 'm':wp\fiwrzlw}C/*mmfiw

smaller twigs, 1 found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire: whereupon 1 came the next time prepared
with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found,
for there was great plenty of them. These 1 set up to dry
within my circle or hedge: and when they were fit for use,
I carried them to my cave: and here, during the next sea-
son, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, sev-
eral baskets; both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any-
thing as I had occasion for. Though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet 1 made them sufficiently serviceable
for my purpose: and thus, afterward, I took care never to
be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made
more; especially strong deep baskets, to place my corn in,
iiestead o sacks, when I should come to have any quantity
0 it.

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world
of time about it, 1 bestirred myself to see, it possible, how
to supply two other wants. I had no vessel to hold any-
thing that was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost
full of rum; and some glass bottles, some of the common
size, and others (which were case bottles) square, for the
holding of waters, spirits, etc. I had not so much as a pot
to boil anythin ; except a great kettle, which I saved out
of the ship, an which was too big for such use as I desired
it, viz., to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself.
The second thing I would fain have had, was a tobacco-
pi s; but it was impossible for me to make one; however,

guild a contrivance for that too at last. 1 employed
myself in planting my second row of stakes or piles, and
also in this wicker-workin all the summer or dry season;
when another business too me up more time than it could
be imagined I could spare.

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the
whole island; and that I had traveled up the brook, and so
on to where 1 had built my bower, and where I had an
opening guite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I
now reso ved to travel quite across to the seashore, on that
side: so taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a
larger quantity of powder and shot than usual; with two
biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch,
for my store; I began my journey. When I had passed the
vale where my bower stood, as above, I came Within view
of the sea,'-to the west; and it being a very clear day, I
fairly descried land, whether an island or continent 1 could
not tell; but it lay very high, extending from W. to W.S.-
W. at a very great distance; by my guess, it could not be
less than fifteen or twenty leagues elf.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be;
otherwise than that I knew it must be part of America;
and, as I concluded, by all my observations, must be near
the Spanish dominions; and perhaps was all inhabited by
savages, where, if 1 should have landed, 1 had been in a
worse condition than I was now. I therefore acquiesced in
the dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own
and to believe ordered everything for the best; I say,l
quieted my mind with this, and left off afflicting myself
with fruitless wishes of being there. Besides, after some
pause upon this atfair, I considered that if this land was
the Spanish coast, 1 should certainly, one time or other,
see some vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not,
then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country
and the Brazils, whose inhabitants are indeed the worst of
savages; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not
to murder and devour all human beings that fall into their
hands. ,

With these considerations, walking very leisurely for-
ward, I found this side of the island, where 1 now was,
much pleasanter than mine; the open or savanna fields
sweetly adorned with flowers and grass, and full of very
fine woods. 1 saw abundance of parrots, and fain would
have caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame,
and taught it to speak to me. I did, after taking some
pains, catch a. young parrot; for I knocked it down with a
stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home, but
it was some years before 1 could make him speak; how-
ever, at last I taught him to call me by my name verv fa-
miliarly. But the accident that followed, though it be a
trifle, will be very diverting in its place.

1 was exceedin 1y amused with this journey. I found in
the low grounds ares, as I thought them to be, and foxes;
but they difiered greatly from all the other kinds 1 had
met with; nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, then b
I killed several. But I had no need to be venturous; or
I had no want of food, and of that which was very good
too; especially these three sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and
turtle, or tortoise. With these, added to my grapes,Robinson ancf'indu an abundance of Tun-ms.Leadenhall Market could not have furnished a table better

than I, in proportion to the com any; and though my case-

was deplorable enough, yet I ha great cause for thankful-
ness; as I was not driven to any extremities for food, but
had rather plenty, even to dainties.

I never traveled on this journey above two miles outright
in a day, or thereabout; but I took so many turns and re-
turns to see what discoveries 1 could make, that I came
,weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit down for
the night; and then I either reposed myself in a tree, or
surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in the
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild
creature could come at me without waking me.

. As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to
Isee that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the
iisland; for here indeed the shore was covered with innum-
erable turtles; whereas, on the other side, 1 had found but
three in a ear and a half. Here was also an infinite num~
ber of fowl}; of many kinds; some of which I had seen, and
some of which I had not seen before, and many of them
very good meat; but such as I knew not the names of, ex-
cept those called penguins.

; could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very
sparing or my powder and shot; and therefore had more
mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, which 1 could better
feed on. But, though there were many goats here, more
than on my side the island, yet it was with much more
difficulty that I could come near them; the country being
flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than when
was upon a hill.

.1 confess this side of the country was much pleasanter
than mine; yet 1 had not the least inclination to remove,
for as I was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to
me, and I seemed all the while I was here to be, as it were,
upon a journey and from home. However, I traveled along
the seashore toward the east, I suppose about twelve miles;
and then setting upagreat pole upon the shore for a mark,
I concluded I would go home again, and that the next
journey .I took should be on the other side of the island,
east from my dwelling, and so round till I came to my
post again; of which in its place.

I took another way to come back than that I went,
thinking I could easily keep so much 0'! the island in my

. 7!.
view, that I could not miss my first dwelling by viewing
the country; but I found myself mistaken; for being come
about two or three miles, I found myself descended into a
very large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those
hills covered with wood, that I could not see which was my
way by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then,
unless I knew very well the position of the sun at that time
of the day. And it happened to my further misfortune
that the weather proved hazy for three or four days while
I was in this valley; and not being able to see the sun, I
wandered about very uncomfortable, and at last was obliged
to find out the sea-side, look for my post, and come back
the same way I went; and then by easy journeys I turned
homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and my gun,
ammunition, hatchet, and other things very heavy.

 

SECTION XII.
He Returns to his Care--His Agricultural Labors and Success.

h: this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and
seized upon it; and running to take hold of it, I caught it
and saved it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to
bring it homo if I could: for I had often been musing
whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and
so raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me
when my powder and shot should be all spent. I made a
collar for this little creature, and with a string which I had
made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me,
I led him along, though with some difliculty, till 1 came to
my bower, and- there 1 inulosed him and left him; for I was
very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been 31)-
sent abore a month.

I can not ex ress what a satisfaction it was to me to
come into my oiil hutch, and lie down in my hammock-
bed. This little wandering journey, without a settled place
of abode, had been so unpleasant to me that my own
house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to
me, compared to that; and it rendered everything about
me so comfortable that I resolved I would never go a great
way from it again while it should be my lot to stay on the
island.

I reprised myself here .n week, to rest and regale myself
after my long journey; during which, .most of the time
was taken up in the weighty affair of making a cage for
my Poll, who began now to be more domestic, and to be
mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to think
of the poor kid which I had penned within my little circle,
and resolved to fetch it home, or give it some food; accord-
ingly 1 went, and found it where I left it (for indeed it
could not get out), but was almost starved for want of
food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of
such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and having
fed it, I tied it as 1 did before, to lead it away; but it was
so tame with being hungry that I had no need to have tied
it, for it followed me like a dog; and as I continually fed
it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond,
that it was from that time one of my domestics also, and
would never leave me afterward.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come,
and I kept the 30th of Septemberin the same solemn man-
ner as before, being the anniversary of my landing on the
island, having now been there two years, and no more
prospect of being delivered than the first day I came there.

spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowl-
edgments for the many wonderful mercies which my soli-
tary condition was attended with, and without which it
might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave hum-
ble and hearty thanks to God for having been pleased to
discover to me that it was possible I might be more happy
even in this solitary condition. than I should have been in
the enjo ment of society, and in all the pleasures of the
world; that He could fully make up to me the deficiencies
of my solitary state, and the want of. human society, by
His presence, and the communications of His grace to my
soul, supporting. comforting, and encouraging me to de-
pend upon- His Providence here, and to hope for His eter-
nal presence hereafter.

It was now that I be an sensibly to feel how much more
happy the life I now is was, with all its miserable circum-
stances, than the wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all
the past part of my days; and now! changed both my
sorrows and my joys; my very desires altered, my aflec-
tions changed their gusts, and, my delights were perfectly
new from what they were at my first coming, or indeed for
the two years past. Before, as I walked about, either on
my hunting, or for viewing the country, the anguish of
my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think
of the woods, the mountains, the deserts lwas in; and
how 1 was a prisoner, looked n with the eternal bars and
bolts of the ocean, in an unin iabited wilderness, without
redemption. 1n the midst of the greatest composures of
my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and
make me wring my hands and woe like a child; some-
times it would take me in the mid le of my work, and I
would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together: this was still worse to
me; but if I could burst into tears or give vent to my tool-
ings by words, it would go 011', and my grief being ox-
hnustcd, would abate.

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts;
I daily road the word of God, and applied all the comforts
of it to my present state. One morning, being very sad,
I opened the Bible upon these words, "I will never leave
thou. nor forsake them" immediate! it occurred that these
words were to me, why else should they be directed in such
a manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over
my condition, as one forsaken of God and man? Well,
then, said I, if God does not forsake mo, of what ill conse-

uence can it be, or what matters it, thou h the world
s iould forsake me; seeing, on the other han , if 1 had all
the world, and should lose the favor and blessing of God,
there would be no comparison in the loss?

From this moment I brgan to conclude in my mind that
it was possible for me to be more hoppIy in this forsaken,
solitary condition than it was probable should ever have
been in any other particular state of the world; and with
this thought 1 was going to give thanks to God for bring-
ing me to this place. I know not what it was, but some-
thing shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not
speak the words. How must then be such a hypocrite,
said I, even audibly, to retend to be thankinl'for a con-
dition, which, however t on mayest endeavor to be con-
tented with, than wouldst rather pray heartily to be do;
liverod from? Here I stopped; but though I could not
sayl thanked God for being here, yet I sincerely gave
thanks to God for opening my eyes. by whatever afllioting
providences, to see the former condition of my Me, and to
mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never opened
the Bible, or shut it,-but my very soul within me blessed
God for directing my friend in England, without any order
of mine, to 1pac ' it up among my goods; and for assisting
me after-wart to save it out of the wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third
year; and though 1 have not given the reader the tremble
of so particular an account of my works this year as the
first, yet in eneral it may be observed, that Iwas very
seldom idle; gut haying regularly divided my time, accord-
ing to the several daily em loyments that were before me;
such as, first, My duty to 0d, and the reading the Script-
ures, which I constantly set apart some time for, thrice
every day; secondly, Going abroad with my gun for food,
which generally took me up three hours every morning,
when it did not rain; thirdly, Ordering, curing, preserv-
ing. and cooking what I had killed or catched for my sup-
ply; these took up great part of the day; also it is to be
considered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun
was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to
stir out; so that about four hours in the evening was all
the time 1 could be supposed to work in; with this excep-
tion, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and

working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad
with in gun in the afternoon.

To his short time allowed for labor, I desire may be
added the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many
hours which, for want of tools, want of help, and want of
skill, everything I did took up out of my time; for (TX-
ample, l was full two-and~forty days making me a board
for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas, two
sawyers, with their tools and a sawpit, would have out six
of them out of the same tree in half a day.

My case was this: it was a large tree that was to be cut
down, because my board was to be a broad one. This tree
I was three days cutting down, and two more in cutting ed
the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber.
With inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the
sides of it into chips till it was light enough to move; then
I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a
board, from end to end; then turning that side downward,
cut the other side, till I brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one
may judge the labor of my hands in such a piece of work;
but labor and patience carried me through that, and many
other things; 1 only observe this in particular, to show the
reason why so much of my time went away with so little
work. viz., that what might be a little to be done with help
and tools, was a vast labor, and required a rodigious time
to do alone, and b hand. Notwithstan ing this, with
patience and labor went through many things; and, in-
deed, everything that my circumstances made necessary for
me to do, as will appear by what follows.

Iwas new in the months of November and December,
expecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had
manurod or du up for them was not great; for, as 1 ob-
served, my see of each was not above the quantity of half
a peck, having lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry
season; but now my crop promised very well; when, on a
sudden, I found I was in danger of losing it all again by
enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce possible to .
keep from it as, first, the goats, and wild creatures which
I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay
in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so
close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.

I saw no remedy for this, but by making an inelosure
about it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil
and the more because it required speed. However, as my
arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it tol-
erably well fenced in about three weeks' time; and shoot-
ing some of the creatures in the day-time, I set myl dog to
guard it in the night, tyin him up to a stake at t e gate,
where he would stand and ark all night long; so in a lit-
tlc time the enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew
very strong and well, and began to ripen space.

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was
in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now,
when it was in the ear; for going along by the place to see
how it throve, 1 saw my little crop surrounded with fowls,
I know not of how many sorts, who stood, as it were,
watching till I should be gone. 1 immediately let fly
among them (for I always had my gun with me); I had no
sooner shot but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which
I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself. _

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in afew
days they would devour all my hopes; that I should be
starved, and never be able to raise a crop at all; and what
to do I could not tell; however, I resolved not to lose my '
corn, if possible, though I should watch it night and day.
In the first place, 1 went among it. to see what dame c was
already done, and found they had spoiled a good den of it;
but that as it was yet too green for them the loss was not
so great, but that the remainder was likely to be a good
crop, if it could be saved.

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away I
could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about
me, as if they only waited till 1 was gone away; and the
event proved it to be so; for as I walked oil, as if gone, I
was no sooner out of their sight than they drop ed down,
one by one, into the corn again. 1 was so prove ed that I
could not have patience to stay till more came on, know-
ing that every grain they eat now was, as it might be said,
a peck leaf to me in the consequence; so coming 1'sz to the
hedge I fired again and killed three of them. his was
what I wished for; so 1 took them up and served them as
we serve notorious thieves in England, viz., hanged them
in chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to im'
agine that this should have such an effect as it had, for the
fowls not only never came to the corn, but, in short, they
for-sock all that part of the island, and I could never see a
bird near the place as long as my scare-crows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of
the year, 1 reaped my corn.

I was sadly at to for a so 'the or sickle to cut it down;
and all I couldpdo was to ma e one as well as I could, out
of one of the broad swords or outlasses, which I saved
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my first
era was but small, I had no great difficulty to out it down;
in siort, I reaped it my way, for 1 cut nothing of! but the
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which 1 had
made, and so rubbed it out with my hands; and at the end
of all my harvestin I found that out of my half eck of
seed 1 had near two ushels of rice, and above two ushels
and a half of barley; that is to say, by my guess, for I had
no measure. '

However, this was great encouragement to me, and I
foresaw that, in time, it would please God to supply me
with bread; and yet here 1 was perplexed again, for l
neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn, or
indeed how to clean it and part it; nor if made into meal,
how to make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it; these things being added to my
desire of having a good quantity for store, and to secure a
constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop,
but to preserve it all for seed against the next season; an ,
in the meantime, to em ploy all my study and hours of
working to accomplish this great work of providing myself
with com and bread.

It might be truly said that now I worked for my bread.
It is a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have
thought much upon, viz., the strange multitude of little
things necessary in the providing, producing, curin ,
dressing, making, and finishing this one article of bre .
], that was reduced to a more state of nature, found this
to my daily discouragement, and was made more sensible
of it every hour, even after I had got the first handful of
seed-corn which, as l have said, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a surprise.

First, I had no plow to turn up the earth; no spade or
shovel to dig it; well, this I conquered by making a wooden
spade, as I observed before; but this did my work in but a
wooden manner; and though it cost me a great many days
to make it, yet, for want. of iron, it not only were out the
sooner, but made my work the harder, and performed it
much worse. However, this 1 bore with, and was content
to work it out with atience, and bear with the badness of
the performance. Vhen the corn was sown I had no har-
row, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great
heavy bou h of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be
called, rat ier than rake or barrow it. When it was row-
ing and grown, l have observed already how many t ings
I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or rea it, cure and
carry it home, thresh, part it from the ch , and save it;
then 1 wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it; and
yet all these things I did without, as will be observed; and
the corn was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me;
all this, as I said, made ever thing laborious and tedious to
me, but that there was no help for; neither was my time
so much less to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain
part of it was every day appointed to these works; and as Iamen enuson. 107

resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a
greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply
myself wholly, by labor and invention, to furnish myself
with utensils proper for performing all the operations neo-
essnry for making eorn fit for my use.

 

SECTION XIII.
His Manufacture of Pottery, and Contrivance for Baking Bread.

BL'T now I was to prepare more land, for I had seed
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this
I had a week's work at least to make me a spade, which,
when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and very
heavy, and re uired double labor to work with it; however,
I went throng I that, and sowed my seed in two large flat
pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find them to
my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge; the
stakes of which were all cut elf that wood which I hold set
before, and knew it would grow; so that in one year's "uno
I knew I should have a nick or living hedge, that would.
want but little repair. T is work took me up full three
months, because a great part of the time was in the wt
season, when I could not go abroad. Withindoors, that

ployment on the following occasions, always observing that.
while. I was at work I diverted myself with talking to my

arrot and teaching him to speak; and I quickly taught
iiini to know his own name, and~at last to speak it out
pretty loud, Poll, which was the first word 1 ever heard
spoken in the island by any month but my own. This,
therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my work;
for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my
hands, as follows: I had long studied, by some means or
other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which indeed
I wanted much, but knew not where to come at them;
however, considering the heat of the climate, I did not
doubt but if 1 could find out any clay, I might botch up
some such pot as might, being dried in the sun, be hard
and strong enough to ear handling, and to hold anything
that was dry, and required to be kept so; and as this was
necessary in the pre aring corn, meal, etc, which was the.
thing I was upon, resolved to make some as largeas I

could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what should
be ut into them.

twould make the reader ity me, or rather laugh at
me, to tell how many awkwar ways 1 took to raise this
pastil; what odd, misshapen, ugly things I made; how
many of them fell in, and how many fell out, the clay not
being stifl enough to bear its own Weight; how many
cracked by the overviolent heat of the sun, being set out
too hastil , and how many fell in pieces with only remov-
ing, as we 1 before as after they were dried; and, in a word,
how, after havin labored hard to find the cla , to dig it,
to temper it, to iring it home, and work it, could not
make above two large earthen ugl things (I can not call
them jars) in about two months' la or.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard,
I lifted them ver gently up, and set them down again in
two great wicker askets, w ich I had made on purpose for
them, that they might not break; and as between the pot
and the basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it
full of the rice and barley straw, and these two pots being
to stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn,
and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large
pots, yet I made several smaller things thh better success;
such as little pound pots, flat dishes, gitchers, and pi kins,
and anything my hand turned to, an the heat of t e sun
baked them very hard.

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get
an earthen pot to hold 1i uids, and bear the fire, which
none of these could do. t happened some time after,

_ making a pretty large fire for cooking m meat, when I
went to put it out after I had done wit it, 1 found a
broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire,
burned as hard as a stone and red as a tile. I was agreea-
bly surprised to see it, and said to myself that certainly
the might be made to burn whole if they would burn

ro en.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make
it burn some pets. 1 had no notion of a kiln, such as the
potters burn in, or of glazin them with lead, though 1
had some lead to do it with; at I placed three large pip-
kins and two or three "Hots in a pile, one upon another, and
placed my fire-weed round it, with a great heap of em-Robinson Crusoe Teaching his Parrot to Talk.
here under them. I plied the fire withfresh fuel round .
the outside, and upon the top, till I saw' the pots in the in-
side red-hot quite through, and observed that they did not
crack at all; when I saw them clear red, I let them stand
in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one of
them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the
sand which was mixed with the clay meltedby the violence
of the heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone
on; so 1 slacked my fire gradually, till the ots began to
abate of the red color; and watching them a 1 night, that
1 might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I
had three very good, I will not say handsome. pipkins, and
two other earthen pots, as hard burned as could be de-
sired; and one of them perfectly glazed with the running
of the sand.

After this experiment I need not say that I wanted no
sort of earthenware for my use; but I must needs say, as
to the shapes of them, they were very inditferent, as any
one may suppose, as I had no way of making them but as
the children make dirt-pies, or as a woman would make
pies that never learned to raise paste. N 0 joy at a thin
of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when 1 fonn
I had made an earthen pet that would hear the fire, and I
had hardly patience to stay till they were cold, before 1 set
one on the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me
some meat, which it did admirably well; and with a piece
of a kid I made some very good broth, though I wanted oat-
meal and several other ingredients requisite to make it so
good as 1 would have had it been.

My next concern was to get a stone mortar to stamp or
beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought
of arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands.
To supply this want I was at a great loss; for, of all trades
in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone~cut-
ter as for any whatever; neither had 1 any tools to go about
it with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar; but coul
find none at all, except what was in the solid rock, and
which 1 had no way to dig or cut out; nor, indeed, were
the rocks in the island of sufficient hardness, as they were
all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would neither bear
the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn
without filling it with sand: so, after a great deal of time110 common cursor.

lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved
to look out a great block of hard wood, which I found in- ~
deed much easier; and getting one as big as I had strength
'to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my
ax and hatchet; and then, with the help of the fire, and
infinite labor, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in

razil make their canoes. After this, I made a great
heavy pestle, or heater, of the wood called iron-wood: and
this I prepared and laid by against I had my next crop of
corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound,
imy corn into meal, to make my bread.

My next dillieulty was to make a sieve, or search, to
dress my meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk,
without which I did not see it possible leould have an
bread. This was a most dillicult thing, even but to thin '
son; for 1 had nothing like the necessary thing to make it;
I mean fine thin canvas or stuff, to search the meal
through. Here I was at a full stop for many months; nor
did I really know what to do: linen I had none left, but
what was more rags; I had goatl' hair, but neither knew
how to weave it nor spin it; and had I known how, here
were no tools to work it with: all the remedy I found for
this was. at last' recollecting I had, among the seamen's
clothes which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths
of calico or muslin; with some pieces of these I made three
small sieves, proper enough for the work; and thus I made
shirt for some years: how I did afterward, I shall show in
its place.

' ho baking part was the next thing to be considered,
and how I should make bread when I came to have corn:
for, first. I had no yeast: as to that part, there was no sup~
plying the want, so I did not concern in self much about
it; but for an oven I was indeed puzz ed. At lengthl
found out an expedient for that also, which was this: I
made some earthen vessels, very broad, but not deep, that
is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine
inches doe : these I burned in the fire, as I had done the
others, ant laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I
made a great tire upon my hearth, which I had paved with
some uare tiles, of my own making and burning also;
but 1 snould not call them square. When the firewood
was burned into embers, or live coals, I drew them forward
upon the hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there let
them lie till the hearth was very hot; then was ing away
all the embers, I set down my loaf, or leaves, an covering
them with the earthen )ot, drew the embers all round the
outside of the pot, to "cap in and add to the heat; and
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my
barley leaves, and became, in a little time, a good'pastry-
cook into the bargain; for I made myself several cakes and
puddings oi the rice; but made no pies, as 1 had nothing
to put into them except the flesh of fowls or goats. _

It need not be wondered at, it all these things took me
up most part of the third year of my abode here; for, it is
to be observed, in the intervals of these things, I had my
new harvest and husbandry to manage: I rea ed my corn
in its season, and carried it home as well as could, and
laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till 1 had time
to rub it out; for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instru-
ment to thrash it with.

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, 1 really
wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted a see to lay
it up in; for the increase of the corn now yie ded me so
much, that 1 had of the barley about twenty bushels, and
of rice as much, or more, insomuch that now I resolved to
begin to use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a
great while: I resolved also to see what quantity would be
sufficient for me a whole year, and to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, 1 found that the forty bushels of barley
and rice were much more than 1 could consume in a year;
so I resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that
I sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully
provide me with bread, etc.

ALL the while these things were doing, you may be sure
my thou hts ran many times upon the prospect of land
which I ad seen from the other side of the island; and'l
was not without some secret wishes that I was on shore
there; fanoying, that seeing the main-land, and an inhab-
ited country, 1 might find some way or other to convey

myself further, and perhaps at last find some means of
esca e.

Biit all this while I made no allowance for the dangers
of such a condition, and that I might fall into the hands of
savages, and perhaps such as I might have reason to think
far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa, that if 1 once
came in their power, 1 should run a hazard of more than a
thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of being
eaten; for 1 had heard that the people of the Carribean
coast were cannibals, or man-eaters; and I knew, by the
latitude, that I could not be far oil from that shore.
Then supposing they were not cannibals, yet that they
might kill me, as they had many Europeans who had fallen
into their hands, even when they were ten or twenty
together; much more I, who was but one, and could make
little or no defense; all these things, I say, which I ought
to have considered well of, and did cast up in my thoughts
afterward, took up none of my apprehensions at tirst; yet
my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to
the shore.

New I wished for my boy Xury, and the long--boat with
the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a
thousand miles on the coast of Africa: but this was in
vain: then Ithought I would go and look at our ship's
boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a

rent way, in the storm, when we were first cast away.
SShe lay nearly where she did at first, but not quite; having
turned, by the force of the waves and the winds, almost
bottom upward, against a high ridge of beachy rough sand;
but no water about her, as before. If I had had hands to
have refitted her, and to have launched her into the water,
the boat would have done very well, and I might have gone
back into the Brazils with her easily enough; but I might
have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her
upright upon her bottom, than I could remove the island:
however, went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers,
and brought them to the boat, resolving to try what 1 could
do; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her
down, and repair the damage she had received, she would
be a very good boat, and 1 might venture to sea in her.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil,
and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it: at last,
finding it impossible to heave her up with my little
strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to undermine
her, and so as to make her fall down, setting pieces of
wood to thrust and guide her right in the fall. But when
1 had done this, I was unable to stir her up again, or to
get under her, much less to move her forward toward the
water; sol was forced to give it over: and yet, t'heugh I
gave over the hopes of the bout, my desire to venture over
the main increased, rather than diminished, as the means
for it seemed impossible.

At length, I began to think whether it was not possible
to make myself a canoe, or pcriugua, such as the natives of
those climates make, even without tools, or, as I might
say, without hands, of the trunk of a great tree. This I
not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself ex-
tremely with the idea of making it, and with my having
much more com-'cnience for it than any of the Negroes or
Indians; but not at all considering the particular incon-
Venienccs whichl lay under more than the Indians did,
Viz., the want of hands to move it into the water when it
was made, adilliculty much harder for me to surmount
than all the consequences of want of tools could be to
them: for what could it avail me, if, after I had chosen
my tree, and with much trouble cut it down, and might be
able with my tools to how and dub the outside into the
proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to
make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it--if, after all
this, I must leave it just where I found it, and was not able
to launch it into the water?

One would imagine, if 1 had had the least reflection
upon my mind of my circumstances while I was making
this brat, I should have immediately thought how 1 was
to get it into the sea: but my thoaghts were so intent upon
my voyage in it, that I never once considered how 1 should
get it off the land; and it was really, in its own nature,
more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea,
than the forty-live fathems of land, where it lay, to set it
afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a feel that
ever man did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased
myself with the design, without determining whether I was
able to undertake it; not but that the difficulty 0! launch-
ing my boat cams often into my head; but I put a stop to
my own inquiries into it, by this foolish answer: Let us
first make it; I warrant I will find some way or other to
get it along when it is done.

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness
of my fancy prevailed, and to work 1 went. I felled a
cedar-tree, and I question much whether Salomon ever had
such a one for the building of the Temple at Jerusalem; it
was live feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next the
stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of
twenty-two feet, where it lessened and then arted into
branches. It was not without infinite labor that felled this
tree; 1 was twenty days hacking and hewiug at the bottom,
and fourteen more getting the branches and limbs, and the
vast spreading head of it, cut off: after this, it cost me a
mouth to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to some-
thing like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright
as it ought to do. It cost me near three months more to
clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact
boat of it: this I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet
and chisel, and by the dint of hard labor, till I had brought
it to be a very handsome peringua, and big enough to have
carried six-and'twenty men, and consequenty big enough
to have carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely
delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than
ever 1 saw a canoe or n periagua that was made 01 one tree,
in my life. Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may be
sure; and there remained nothiu but to get it into the
water: which, had 1 aeoomplishe , 1 make no question but
1 should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most un-
likely to be performed, that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me;
though they cost me inex ressible labor too. It lay about
one hundred yards from the water, and not more; but the
first inconvenience was, it was up hill toward the creek.
Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig
into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity; this
I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains; (but
who grudge pains that have their deliverance in view?)
when this was worked through, and this difficulty man-
aged, it was still much the same, for 1 could no more stir
the canoe than I could the other host. Then I measured
the distance of ground, and resolved to out a dock, or
canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could'EUR,&SSMPSEURfltfii;EURSSrWSSifimv_;mxiii,>> w n. r. x ,2,>> ,_

 

nosmsox censor. 115

not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this
work; and when I began to enter upon it, and calculate
how deep it was to be (lugs how broad, how the stuff was
to be thrown out, I found y the number of hands 1 had,
having none but my own, that it must have been ten or
twelve years before I could have gone through with it; for
the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have
been at least twenty feet deep; this attempt, though with
great reluctancy, I was at length obliged to give over also.

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too
late, the folly of beginning a work before we count the
cost, and before we Judge rightly of our own strength to
go through with it.

In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth year in
this place, and kept my anniversary with the same devo-
tion, and with as much comfort as before; for, lg a con
stant study and serious application to the word of 0d, and
by the assistance of His grace, I gained a different knowl-
edge trom what I had before; 1 entertained difierent no-
tions of things; I looked now upon the world as a thing re-
mote, which I had nothing to do with, no expectation
from, and, indeed, no desires about: in a word, I had noth-
ing to do with it, nor was ever likely to have; I thought it
looked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz., as
a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and well
might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, " Between me
an thee is a great gulf fixed."

In the first place, I was here removed from all the wick-
edness oi the world; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the
lust of the e 9, nor the ride of life. I had nothing to
covet, for 1 ad all that was now capable of enjoying: 1
was lord of the whole manor, or, if I pleased, I might call
myself king or am eror over the whole country which I
had possession of; t ere were no rivals; I had no competi-
tor, none to dispute sovereignty or command with me: 1
might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use
for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my
occasion. I had tortoise or turtle enough, but now and
then one was as much as I could put to any use; I had
timber enough to have built a fleet of ships; and I had
gra senough to have made wine, or to have cared into
raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been built.

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I116 . memos censor.

had enough to eat and supply in wants, and what was the
rest to me? If I killed more fies than I could eat, the do'
must eat it, or vermin; if 1 sowed more com than I could
eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying
to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them than
for fuel, and that 1 had no other occasion for but to dress
my food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated '
to me, upon just reflection, that all the good things of this
world are of no further good to us than for our use; and
that whatever we may heap up to give others, we enjoy
only as much as we can use, and' no more. The most cov-
etous gripiug miser in the world would have been cured of
. the vice of covetousness, if he had been in my case; for I
possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do with.- I
had no room for desire, except it was for things which 1
had not, and they were comparatively but trifles, though
indeed of great use to me. 1 had, as I hinted before, a
parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six

ounds sterling. Alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless stud
ay: I had no manner of business for it; and I often
thought within myself, that I would have given a handful
of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to
grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for sixpenny-
worth of turnip and carrot seed from England, or for a
handful of pease and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was,
I had not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it; but
there it lay in a drawer, and grew moldy with the damp of
the cave in the wet seasons; and if I had had the drawer
full of diamonds, it had been the same case--they would
have been of no manner of value to me, because of no use.

I had now brought my state of life to be much more
comfortable in itself than it was at first, and much easier
to my mind, as well as to my bodv. I frequently sat down
to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of God's
providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilder-
ness: I learned to look more upon the bright side of my
condition, and less upon the ark side, and to consider
what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted: and this gave
me sometimes such secret comforts, that 1 can not express
them; and which 1 take notice of here, to put those "dis-
contented pee le in mind of it, who can not enjoy comforta
ably what G has given them, because they see and cant,
something that he has not given them. All our discon-
tents about what we want appeared to me to spring from
the want of thankfulness for what we have.

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless
would be so to any one that should fall into such distress
as mine was; and this was, to compare my present con-
dition with what 1 at first expected it would be: nay, with
what it would certain] y have been, if the good providence
of God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up
near to the shore, where 1 not only could come at her, but
could bring what I got out of her to the shore, for my re~
lief and comfort: without which, I had wanted 1' or tools to
work, weapons for defense, and gunpowder and shot for
getting my food.

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in represent-
ing to myself, in the most lively colors, how 1 must have
noted if 1 had got nothing out of the ship. I could not
have so much us got any food, except fish and turtles; and
that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must
have perished; that I should have lived, if I had not per-
ished, like a more savage; that if 1 had killed a. goat or a
fowl, by any contrivunce, I had no way to flay or open it,
or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it
up, but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my
claws, like u beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of -the goodness
of Providence to me, and very thankful for my present
condition, with all its hardships and misfortunes; and [his
part also I can not but recommend to the reflection of
those who are apt, in their misery, to say, Is any nfilietion
like mine? Let them consider how much worse the cases
of some people are, and their case might have been, if
Providence had thought lit.

1 had another reflection, which assisted me also to com-
fort my mind with hopes; and this was. comparing my

resent condition with what I had deserved, and had there-

ore reason to expect from the hand of Providence. I had
lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge
and fear of God. I had been well instructed by my finlier
and mother; neither had they been wanting to me, in their
endeavors to infuse an early religious awe of God into my
mind, a. sense of my duty, and what the nature and end of
my being required of me. But, alas! felling early into the' 7"" W 'WFW-'Nfihl'f'flfl

seafaring life, which, of all lives, is the most destitute of
the fear of God, though his terrors are always before them;
I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into seafar-
ing company, all that little sense of religion which 1 had
entertained was laughed out of me by my messmates; by a
hardened despising of dangers, and the views of death,
which grew habitual to me; by my long absence from all
manner of opportunities to converse with anything but
what was like myself, or to hear anything that was good,
or tending toward it.

80 void was I of everything that was good, or of the
least sense of what 1 was, or was to be, that in the greatest
deliveranees I enjoyed (such as my escape from Sallee, my
being taken up by the Portuguese master of a ship, my be--
ing planted so well in the Brazils, my receiving the car 0
1' rorn England, and the like) I never had once the wor a,
Thank God, so much as on my mind or in my mouth; nor
in the greatest distress had 1 so much as a thought to pray
to him, or so much as to say, Lord, have mercy upon me!
no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear
by, and blasplicnie it.

1 had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on account of my
wicked and hardened life past: and when l looked about
me, and considered what particular providcnces had attend-
ed me since my coming into this place, and how (led had
dealt beautifully with rue--had not only punished me less
than my iniquity had deserved, but had so plcutiiully pro-
vided for inc--this gave me great hopes that my repent-
:fmce was accepted, and that (10d had yet mercies in store

or me.

With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to
a resignation to the will of God in the present disposition
of my circumstances, but even toa sincere thankfulncss
for my condition; and that I, who was yet a living man,
ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due punish-
ment of my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies which 1
had no reason to have expected in that place, that I ought
never more to repine at my condition, at to rejoice, and
to give daily thanks for that daily bread, which nothing
but a crowd of wonders could have brought; that I ought
to consider 1 had been fed by a miracle, even as great as
that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long series of-.

nosmson censor. 119

miracles: and that 1 could hardly have named a place in
the uninhabitable part of the world where I could have
been cast more to my advantage; a place where; as I had
no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so I found
no ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten
my life; no venomous or poisonous creatures, which I
might feed on to my hurt; no savages, to murder and de-
vour me. In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one
way, so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted noth-
ing to make it a life of comfort, but to make myself sensi-
ble of God's goodness to me, and care over me in this con-
dition; and after I did make a g'ust improvement of these
things, I went awa , and was no more sad.

I ad now been ere so long, that many things which I
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or
very much wasted, and near spent.

My ink, as 1 observed, had been gone for some time, all
but a very little, which I eked out with water, a little and
a little, till it was so pale, it scarce left any appearance of
black upon the paper. As long as it lasted, I made use of
it to minute down the days of the month on which any re-
markable thing happened to me: and, first, by casting up
times past, I remember that there was a strange concur-
rence of days in the various providences which befall me,
and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to observe
days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason to have
looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke
away from my father and my friends, and ran away to
Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day afterward I was
taken by the Sallee man-of--war, and made a slave; the
same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of
the ship in Yarmouth ROads, that same da , years after-
ward, I made my escape from Sallee in the oat: and the
same day of the year I was born on. viz., the 30th of Sep
tember, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved
twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this
island: so that my wicked life and my solitary life began
both on one day.

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my
bread, 1 mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship:
this I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself
but one cake of bread a day for above a year; and yet I
was quite without bread for near a year before 1 got an
corn of my own; and great reason I had to be thankf
that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has been al-
ready observed, next to miraculous. '

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily: as to linen, I
had none for a great while, except some checked shirts
which I found in the chests of the other seamen, and which
I carefully preserved, because many times 1 could bear no
clothes on but a shirt, and it was a very great help to me
that I had, among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost
three dozen of shirts. There were also, indeed, several
thick watchcoats of the seamcn's which were left, but they
were too hot to wear: and though it is true that the
weather was so violently hot that there was no need of
clothes, yet 1 could not go quite naked, no. though I had
been inclined to it, which ] was not, nor could I abide the
thought of it, though I was all alone. The reason why I
could not go quite naked was, 1 could not bear the heat of
the sun so well when quite naked as with 'some clothes on;
nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin: whereas,
with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whist-
ling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it. No
more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the
sun without a cap or hat; the heat of the sun beating with
such violence as it does in that place, would give me the
headache presently, by darting so directly upon my head,
without a cap or hat on, so that 1 could not bear it,
whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go away.

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the
few rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order. 1
had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and my business
was now to try if I could not make jackets out of the great
watch-coats that 1 had by me, and with such other materials
'as I had; so 1 set to work a-lailoring, or rather, indeed, a
botching, for I made most piteous work of it. However,
1 made shift to make two or three new waistcoats, which I
hoped would serve me a great while. As for breeches, or
dragers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed, till after-
war .
~ I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creat-
ures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and 1 had
hung them up, stretched out with sticks in the sun, by
which means some of them were so dry and hard, that theyCRUSOE IN HIS PORT.twwewrwwwnwwawwwr -" ~~~w~wwm

were fit for little, but others 1 found very useful. The
first thing 1 made of these was a great cap for my head,
with the hair on the outside, to shoot off the rain; and this
I performed so well, that after this I made me a suit of
clothes wholly of the skins, that is to say, a waistcoat, and
breeches open at the knees, and both loose; for they were
rather wanting to has me cool than warm. 1 must not
omit to acknowledge t at they were wretchedly made, for
if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. However,
they were such as I made very good shift with, and when I
was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of my waist-
coat aud cap being uppermost, l was kept very dry.

After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make
me an umbrella; I was indeed in great want of one, and
had a great mind to make one; 1 had seen them made in
the Brazils, where they were very useful in the great heats
which are there, and I felt the heats every Jot as great
here, and reater too, being nearer the equator; besides,
as l was ob iged to be much abroad, it was a'most useful
thin to me, as well for the rains as the heats. 1 took a
worl of pains at it, and was a great while before I could
make anything likely to hold; nay, after I thought 1 had
hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to
my mind; but at last I made one that answered indiffer-
eutl well; the main diflicultyl found was to make it to
let own; 1 could make it spread, but if it did not let down
too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any way but
just over my head, which would not do. However, at last,
as I said, 1 made one to answer, and covered it with skins,
the hair u ward, so that it cast ofi the rain like a pent-
house, au kept oi! the sun so effectually that 1 could walk
out in the hottest of the weather with reater advantage
than I could before in the coolest; and w en I had no need
of it, could close it and carry it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, in mind bein entire-
ly composed by resigning to the will 0 God, and t rowing
myself wholly upon the disposal of His rovidenee. This
made my life better than sociable, for w an I began to re-
gret the want of conversation, I would ask myself whether
thus conversing mutually with an own thoughts, and, as
I hope I may say, with even God imself, by ejaculations,
was not better than the utmost enjoyment of human so-
ciety in the world?133 nonmsoa cacao:

1 CAN not say that after this, for five years, any ex-
traordinary thing happened to me, but I lived on in the
same course, in the same posture and place, just as before;
the chief things I was employed in, besides my yearly labo'r
of lanting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of
both which I always kept up just enough to have sutlicient
stock of one year's provision beforehand; I say, besides
this yearly labor, and my daily pursuit of going out with
my um, I had one labor, to make me a canoe, which at
last finished; so that by digging a canal to it of six feet
wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek almost
half a mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, as
1 made it without considering beforehand, as I ought to
do, how I should be able to launch it, so, never being able
to bring it into the water, or bring the water to it, I was
obliged to lot it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach
me to be wiser the next time; indeed, the next time,
though 1 could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a
place where I could not get the water to it at any less dis-
tance than, as I have said, near half a mile, yet as 1 saw it
was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and then 11 l
was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my lu or,
in hopes of having a boat to go oil to sea at last.

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the
size of it was not at all answerable to the design which 1
had in view when I made the first; I mean, of venturing
over to the farm firma, where it was above forty miles
broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to '
put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of
it. As I had a beat, my next design was to make a cruise
round the island; for as 1 had been on the other side in
one place, crossing, as I have already described it, over the
land, so the discoveries I made in that little journe made
me ver eager to see other parts of the coast; an now 1
ihsl'd a: oat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the

an .

For this purpose, that 1 might do everything with dis-p
oration and consideration, I fitted up a little most in my
boat, and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the
ship's sails which lay in store, and of which I had a. great
stock by me. .llaving titted my mast and sail, and tried
the boat, I found she would sail very well; then I made lit-
tle lockers, or boxes, at each end of my boat, to put pro-
visions, necessaries, ammunition, ete., into, to be kept dry,
either from rain or the spray of the son; and a little long
hollow plheo I out in the inside of the boat, where I could
lay my gun, making a llep to hang down over it, to keep
it dry.

I lixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a
must, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun
oll' me, like an owning: and thus every now and then took
a little. voyage upon the son, but never went far out, nor
for from the little creek. At last, being eager to View the
circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my
cruise; and accordingly, lvictnaled my shi for the voy-
age, putting in two dozen of leaves (cakes should rather
call them) 01' barley bread, an earthen not full of parched
rice (a food I eat a great deal of), a. little bottle of rum,
hall" a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two
large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I
had saved out of the seamen's chests; those I took, one to
lie upon, and the other to cover mo in the night.

1t was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my
reign, or my captivity, which you please, that 1 set out on
this voyage, and I found it mueh longer than I expected;
for though the island itself was not very large, yet when I
came to the east side of it, I found a. great ledge of rocks
lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above water,
some under it, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry
half a league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way
out to sea to double the point.

When first I discovered them, I was going to give over
my enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how for
it might oblige me to go out to sea, and, above all, doubt-
ing how I should get back again; so 1 came to an anchor;
for I had made me a kind of anchor with a piece of a
broken grappling which I got out of the ship.

Having secured my boat, 1 took my on and. went on
ehore, climbing up on a hill, which seem to overlook that1'24 nomusou consort

point, where 1 saw the full extent of it, and resolved to
venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, l
perceived a strong. and indeed a most furious current,
which ran to the east, and even came close to the point;
and 1 took the more notice of it, beeause I saw there might
be some danger tlmt. when I came into it. I might be car-
ried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to
make the island again; and indeed, had I not tot first
upon this hill, I believe it would have been so; or there
was tho same eurrent on the other side the island, only
that it set ed at a further distance, and I saw there was a
strong eddy under the shore: so I had nothing to do but
to get out of the first current, and l shouhl presently be in
an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing
pretty fresh at Its. It. and that being just contrary to the
said rurrent. made a great breueh of the sea upon the
point: so that it was not sale I or me to keeyi too close to the
shore, for the br 'aeh, nor to go too far ol , because of: the
stream.

The third day. in the morning, the wind having abated
overnight, the sea was (-alm. and lventured; but I am a
warning-pimae again to all rush and ignorant pilots; for no
sooner was I come to the point, when I was not even my
boat's length from the shore, but I found myself in a great
depth of. water, and a current like the sluice of a mill: it
carried my boat alongr with it with such violence that all I
could do eonld not keep her so much as on the edge of it;
but I found it hurried me further and further out from
the eddy. which was on my left hand. There was no wind
stirring to help me. and all I could do with my paddles
signified nothing; and now l began to give myself over for
lost; for as the onrrent was on both sides of the island, I
knew in a few leagues' distance they must join again, and
then I was irreeoverably gone; nor did I see any possibility
of avoiding it: so that I had no prospect before me but of.
perishing, not by the sea. for that was calm enough, but of
starving for hunger. 1 had indeed found a tortoxse on the
shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had tossed it into
the boat; and 1 had a great jar of fresh water, that is to
say, one of my earthen pets: but what was all this to being
driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was nomarines causes.

There), no mainland or island, for a thousand leagues at
east:

And now I saw how easy it was for the Providence of
God to make even the most miserable condition of man-
kind worse. Now I looked baek upon my desolate, solitary
island as the most pleasant place in the world; and all the
happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there
again. 1 stretched out m hands to it, with eager wishes:
Oh, happy desert! said 1, shall never see thee more. Oh,
miserable creature! whither am I oing? Then 1 re-
proached myseli with my unthanktu temper, and how I

18d repined at my solitary condition; and now what would
1 give to be on shore there again! Thus we never see the
true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its
contraries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by
the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the con-
sternation I was new in, being driven from my beloved
island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide
been, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of
ever recovering it again. However, I worked hard, till in>>
deed my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my boat
as much to the northward, that is, toward the side of the
current which the eddy lay on, as possibl 1 could; when
about noon, as the sun eased the meri ian, I thought I
felt a little breeze of win in my face, springing up from
S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little, and especrally when,
in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale.
B this time I was get at a frightful distance from the
is and, and had the least cloudy or hazy weather inter-
vened, I had been undone another way too; for 1 had no.
compass on board, and should never have known how to
have steered toward the island, if I had but once lost sight
of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself
to get u my mast again, and spread my sail, standing
away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the
current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began
to stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water
some alteration of the current was near; for where the cur-
rent was so strong the water was foul; but perceiving the
water clear, 1 found the current abate, and presently I
found to the east, at about half a mile. a breach of the sea
upon some rocks; these rocks 1 found caused the current
to part again, and as the main stress of it ran away more
southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other
returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very
sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to
them upon the ladder. or to be resound from thieves just
going to murder them, or who have been in suvh-liko ex-
tremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was,
and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy;
and the wind also [i-osliening, how gladly I spread my sail
to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong
tide or eddy under foot.

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back
again. directly toward the island, but about two leagues
more to the northward than the current which carried me
away at first: so that when I came near the island, I found
myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out
from.

When I had made something more than a league of way
by the help of this current or eddy, 1 found it was spent,
and served me no further. However, .I found that being
between two great currents, viz., that on the south side,
which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which
lay about a league on the other side; I say, between these
two, in the wake of the island, I found the water at least
still, and running no way; and having still a breeze of wind
fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the island,
though not making such fresh way as 1 did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which
occasioned this disaster stretching out, as is described be-
fore, to the southward. and casting oil the current more
southerly, had, of course. made another eddy to the north;
and this 1 found very strong, but not directly setting the
way my course lay. which was due west, but almost full
north. However, having a fresh gale I stretched across
this eddy, slanting north-west: and in about an hour came
within about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth
water, I soon get to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all
thoughts of deliverance by my boat; and refreshing
myself with such things as I had, I brought my boat close
to the shore, in a little cove that 1 had spied under some
trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with
the labor and fatigue of the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with
my boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew too much
of the case, to think of attempting it by the way 1 went
out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the west
side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more
ventures; so 1 only resolved in the morning to make my
way westward along the shore, and see if there was no creek
where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have
her again, if I wanted her. In about three miles, orothere-
about, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or
buy, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a
very little rivulot or brook, where 1 found a very conveni-
ent harbor for my boat, and where she lay as if she had
been in a little dock made on purpose for her. Here I put
in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore,
to look about me, and see where I was.

I soon found 1 had but a little passed by the place where
I had been before, when I traveled on foot to that shore;
so taking nothing out of my boat but my gun and um-
brella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my march. The
way was comfortable enough after such a voyage us I had
been uiion, and I reached my old bower in the evening.
where found everything standing as 1 had left it; for I

always kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my
country-house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to
rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep; but
judge you, if you can, that read my story, what a surpriee
I must he in, when Iwas awaked out of my sleep by a
voice, calling me by my name several times. Robin, Robin,
Robin Crusoe; poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin
Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you been?

I was so dead asleep at first, being'fatigued with rowing,
or addling, as it is called, the first part of the day, and
wit walking the latter part, that 1 did not wake thor-
oughly; but dozing between sleeping and waking, thought
Idreamed that somebody spoke to me; but as the voice
continued to repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I
began to wake more perfectly, and was at lirst dreadfully
frightened, and started up in the utmost consternation;
but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my l'oll sit-
ting on the top of the hedge; and imnmliately knew it was
he that. spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning language
I had used to talk to_ him and teaeh him. and he had
learned it so perfectly that he would sit upon my linger,
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, l'oor Robin
Crusoe! Where are you? \\'here have you been? How
came you here? and much things as I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and
that indeed it could be. n(.d:-ody else, it was a gOod while be-
fore 1 could compose myself. First, Iwas amazed how
the creature got thither: and then how he should just keep
about the place, and nowhere else; but us I was Well satis-
tied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and
holding out my hand, and railing him by his name, Poll,
the sociable creature. eame to me and sat upon my thumb,
as he. used to do, and continued talking to me, l'oor llobin
Crusoe! and how did 1 come here? and where. had I been?
j ust us if he had been o\'erji.iyed to see me. again; and so I
carried him home along with me.

I now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and
had enough to do for many days to sit still. and to reflect
upon the danger I had been in. I would have. been very
glad to have had my boat again on my side of the island;
but I knew not how it was praeti 'able to get it about. As
to the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I
know well enough there was no venturing that way; my
very heart would shrink. and my very blood run chill, but
to think of it; and as to the other side of the island, 1 did
not know how it might be there, but supposing the current
ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it
passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of be.-
ing driven down the stream, and carried by the. island. as
I had been before of being,r carried away from it; so, with
these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat,
though it had been the product of so many months' labor
to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near a
year, lived a very sedate, retired life, as you may well sup-
pose; and my thoughts being very much composed, as to
my condition, and fully comforted in resignin myself to
the dispositions of Providence, I thought 1 live really very
happily in all things, except that of society.

improved myself in this time in all the mechanic ex-
ercises which my necessities put me upon applying myself
to; and I believe I could, upon occasion, have made a very
good carpenter, especially considering how few tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in m
earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them wit 1
a wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better; because
I made things round and shapable, which before were
filthy things indeed to look upon. But 1 think I was
never more vain of my own performance, or more joyful
for anything I found out, than for my being able to make
a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a very ugly, clumsy
thing when it was done, and only burned red, like other
earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw
the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had
been always used to smoke; and there were pipes in the
ship, but I forget them at first, not thinking that there
was tobacco in the island; and afterward, when I searched
the ship again, I could not come at any pipes at all.

In my wickcrware also 1 improved much, and made
abundance of neceseary baskets, as well as my invention
showed me; though not very handsome, yet they were such
as were very handy and convenient for my laying things up
in, or fetching things home. For example, if I killed a
goat abroad, 1 could hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it,
and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and
the like by a turtle; I could cut it up, take out the eggs,
and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enou h for me,
and bring them home in a basket, and leave I 9 rest be-
hind me. Also large deep baskets were the receivers of
my cum, which I always rubbed out as soon as it was dry,
and cured, and kept it in great baskets.

I began now to perceive my powder abs.t .d considerably;
this was a want which it was impossible for me to so ply,
and'I began seriously to consider what 1 must do w on I
should have no more powder, that is to say. how I should
do to kill any goats. 1 had, as is observed, in the third

ear of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her u

died at lust of mere age.

BM rm now in the eleventh y or of my residence, and as
I have suirl, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to
stnly some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether
I could not catch some of them alive; and particularly, 1
wztutml n she-gout great with young. For this purposel
mode snztres to hamper them; and I do believe they were
more than once taken in them; but my tackle was. not
good, for I had no wire, and 1 always found them broken,
and my huit tltli'lflli't'll. At length I resolved to try a pit-
fall; so i ring several large pits in the earth, in places where
l lnnl olssvrri-al the gents used to feed, and over those pits I
plat-cal hurdles, of my own making too, with :1 great Weight
upon them; ninl several times I put ears of barley and dry
rice, without setting the trap; and 1 eoulrl easily perceive
that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn, forl
could see the ninrks ol': their feet. At length I set three
traps in one night, and going the next morning, 1 found
l-lli'lll :ill standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This
was very disvoumging: however, I altered my traps, and,
not to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to
sre my traps, 1 found in one of them a large old he-goat,
and in one of the others three kids, a mule and two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he
was so lieree, I durst not go into the pit to him; that is to
say, to go about to bring him away alive, which was what
1 wnntul; 1 could have killed him, but that was not my
business, nor would it answer my end; so 1 even let him
out, and he ran away. as if he had been frightened out of
his wits. But 1 had forgot then what I learned after-
ward, that hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay
there three or four days without food. and then have car-
ried him some water to drink, and then a. little corn, he
would have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are
mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well
used. However, for the present I let him go, knowing no

better at that time: then lwent to the three kids, and: . new 2 a. 4W3-r-2'f". "Si-"3e TE". WW ._.- >>

taking them one by one, 1 tied them with strings together,
and with some diificuit brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed; but throw-
ing them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they be-
gan to be tame. And now I found that it I expected to
supply myself with goat's flesh when I had no powder or
shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way; when,
perhaps, I might have them about my house like a flock
of sheep. But then it occurred to me that 1 must kee
the tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild,
when they grew up; and the only wa for this was, to have
some inclosed piece of ground, wel fenced, either with
hedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually, that those
within might not break out, or those without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet
as I saw there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my
first work was to find out a prOper piece of ground, where
there was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for
them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such inclosures will think 1 had
very little coutrivanee, when I pitched upon a place very

ro er for all these (being a plain open piece 0 meadow
{he , or savanna, as our eople call it in the western col--
onies) which had two or t ree little drills of fresh water in
it, and at one end was very woody; 1 say, they will smile
at my forecast, when I shal tell them, I began my inclus-
ing this piece of ground in such a manner that my hedge
or pale must have been at least two miles about. Nor was
the madness of it so great as to the compass, for if it was
ten miles about, I was like to have time enough to do it in;
but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in
so much compass as if they had had the whole island, and
1 should have so much room to chase them in, that I
should never catch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about fifty
yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I presently
stopped short, and, for the first beginning, I resolved to in-
close a piece of about one hundred and fi ty yards in length,
and one hundred yards in breadth; which. as it would main-
tain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so,
as my stock increased, I could add more ground to my in-
closure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work' WWWMMWWWW

with courage. I was about three months hedging in the
first piece; and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids
in the best part of it, and used them to feed as near me as
possible, to make them familiar; and very often 1 would
go and carry them some cars of barley, or a handful of
rice, and feed them out of my hand, so that after my in-
closure was finished, and I let them loose, they would fol-
low me up and down, bloating after me for a handful of
CO").

This answered my end; and in about a year and a half I
had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two
years more, I had three and forty, beside several that 1
took and killed for my food. After that I inclosed five
several pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to
drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out
of one piece of ground into another.

But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's flesh

to feed on when 1 pleased, but milk too; a thing which, in-
deed, in the beginning, I did not so much as think of, and
which, when it came into my thoughts, was really an agree-
able surprise; for now I set up my dairy, and had some-
times a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature,
who gives supplies of food to every creature, dictates even
naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had never
milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese
made, only when I was a boy, after a great many essays
and misoarria es, made me both butter and cheese at last,
and also salt Ethoughl found it partly made to my hand

and never wanted it afterward. EIow mercifully can our

tended by my servants: Poll, as if he had been my favorite,
was the only person permitted to talk to me. My dog,
who was now grown very old and crazy, and had found no
species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right
hand; and two cats, one on one side of the table, and one
on the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand,
as a mark of special favor.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on
shore at first, for they were both of them dead, and had
been interred near my habitation by my own hand; but
one of them having multiplied by 1 know not what kind of
creature, these were two which I had reserved tame;
whereas the rest ran wild in the woods, an became indeed
troublesome to me at last; for they would often come into
my house, and Iplunder me too, till at last I was obliged to
shoot them, an did kill a great many; at length they left
rue--With this attendance, and in this plentiful manner,
I lived: neither could I be said to want anything but soci-
ety; and of that, some time after this, 1 was like to have
too much.

I was something imp'atient, as I have observed, to have
the use of my boat, t ough very loath to run any more
hazards; and therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to

et her about the island, and at other times I sat myself
( own contented enough without her. But I had a strange
uneasiness in my mind to go down to the oint of the
island, where, as I have said, in my last ramb e, I went up
the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current set,
that 1 might see what I had to do: this inclination in-
creased upon me every day, and at length 1 resolved to
travel thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I
did so; but had any one in England been to meet such a
man as l was, it must either have frightened him, or raised
a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood still to
look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my
traveling through Yorkshire, with such an equipege, and
in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure,
as follows.

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin,
with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun
from me as to shoot the rain off from running into my
neck; nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the rain
upon the flesh, under the clothes.

h...134 aoanrsox onusoa.

1 had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle 9 the thi he, and a pair of o n-
kneed breaches of the same; the reaches were m e of
the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a
length on either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to
the middle of my legs: stockings and shoes I had none,
but had made me a pair of somethings, I scarce know what
to call them, like buskins, to tie over my legs, and lace
on either side like spatterdashcs, hat of a most barbarous
shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew
together with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles;
and in a kind of a frog on either side of this, instead of a
sword and dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet; one on
one side, and one on the other. I had another belt, not so
broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over
my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left arm,
hung two pouches, both made of goat's skin too: in one of
which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my
back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun;
and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's-skin um-
brella, but which, after all, was the most necessary thin I
had about me, next to my gun. As for my face, the co or
of it was really not so mulatto-like as one might expect
from a man not at all careful of it, and living within nine
or ten degrees of the equator. My beard 1 had once
snil'ered to row till it was about a quarter of a yard long;
but as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, I had cut it
iretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, whichl
had trimmed into a large pair of Mohammedan whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee; for the
Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did: of these
mustachios or whiskers, 1 will not say they were long
enou h to hang my but upon them, but they were of, a
lengt and shape monstrous enough, and such as, in Eng-
land, would have passed for frightful.

But all this is by the by; for, as to my figure, I had so
few to observe me that it was of no manner of conse-
quence; sol say no more to that part. In this kind of
figure I went my new journey, and was out five or six
days. Itraveled first along the seashore, directly to the
place where 1 first brought my boat to an anchor, to et
upon the rocks; and having no boat now to take care 0 . 1,l.'.aSSC/~;:p"_:w:-;'via-795.97 J," M, ._.. , ---z x" .. .-..,

went over the land, a nearer way, to the same height that
I was upon before; when looking forward to the point of
the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double
with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to see the
sea all smooth and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no cur-
rent, any more than in any other places. I was at a
strange loss to understand this, and resolved to s nd some
time in observing it, to see if nothing from t 8 sets of
the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced
how it was, viz., that the tide of ebb, setting from the
west, and joining with the current of waters from some
great river on the shore: must be the occasion of this cur-
rent; and that according as the wind blew more forcibly
from the west, or from the north, this current came nearer,
or went further from the shore: for waiting thereabouts
till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the
tide of ebb being made, 1 plainly saw the current again as
before, only that it ran further off, being near half a league
from the shore; whereas, in my case, it set close upon the
shore, and hurried me and my canoe along with it, which,
at another time, it would not have done.

This observation convinced me, that 1 had nothing to do
but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and
I might very easily bring my boat about the island again:
but when I began to think of putting it in practice, I had
such a terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the
danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again
with any patience; but, on the contrary, I took up another
resolution, which was more safe, though more laborious;
and this was, that I would build, or rather make me
another periagua or canoe; and so have one for one side of
the island, and one for the other.

You are to understand, that new I had, as I may call it,
two plantations in the island; one, my little fortification or
tent with the wall about it, under the rock, with the cave
behind me, which, by this time, I had enlarged into sev-
eral apartments or caves, one within another. One of
these, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out
beyond my wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond
where my wall joined to the rock, was all filled up with the
large earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and
with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold
five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of; pro-

11
vision, especially m corn, some in the ear, out off short
from the straw, an the other rubbed out with my hand.

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or
piles, those piles grow all like trees, and were by this time
grown so big, an spread so very much, that there was not
the least appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation
behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little further within
the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of
corn land, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and
which duly yielded me their harvest in its season; and
whenever I had occasion for more corn, 1 had more land
adjoining as lit as that. '

Besides this, 1 had my countr seat; and I had now a
tolerable plantation there also: or, first, 1 had my little
bower, as I called it, which 1 ke t in repair; that is to say,
I kept the hedge which encireed it constantly fitted up
to its usual height, the ladder standing always in the in-
side: I kept the trees, which at first were no more than my
stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall, always cut
so. that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and
make the more agreeable shade, which they did effectually
to m mind. In the middle of this 1 had my tent always
stain ing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles. set up
for that pur mac, and which never wanted any repair or re-
newing: an under this 1 had made me a squab or coach,
with the skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other
soft things; and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged
to our sea bedding. which I had saved, and a great watch-
coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had occasion to be
absent from my chief seat, 1 took up my country habita-
tion.

Adjoining to this I had my inclosures for my cattle, that
is to say, my goats: and as I had taken an inconceivable
deal of pains to fence and inclose this ground, I was so
anxious to see it kept entire, lest the goats should break
through, that I never left 03, till, with infinite labor, I
had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes,
and so near to one another, that it was rather a ale than
a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a ban through
between them; which afterward, when those stakes grew,
as they all did in the next rainy season, made the inelosure
strong like a wall--indeed, stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I
spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared neces-
sary for my comfortable support; for 1 considered the
keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand
would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and
cheese for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to
be forty ears; and that keeping them in my reach depend-
ed entire y upon my perfecting my inclosures to such a de-
gree, that 1 might be sure of keepin r them together;
which, by this method, indecd,I so e actually secured,
that when these little stakes began to grow, I had planted
them so very thick, that I was forced to pull some of them
up again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I
principally depended on for my Winter store of raisins, and
which I never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best
and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and, indeed.
they were not only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome,
nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half-war between my other habi-
tation and the place where I had aid u my boat, I gener-
ally stayed and lay here in my way thit 101': for 1 used fre-
quently to visit my boat; and I he t all things about or
belonging to her, in very rood or er: sometimes I went
out in her to divert myself, at no more hazardous voyages
would 1 go, nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two
from the shore, l was so apprehensive of being hurried out
of my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any
other accident. But new 1 come toa new scene of my
life.

 

SECTION XVII.

Unexpected Alarm and Cause Afpxr'dApprehension.--He Fortifles his
e.

11' happened one day, about noon, going toward my
boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's
naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen
in the sand. I stood like one thunderstrnck, or as if I had
seen an apparition: I listened, I looked round me, but 1
could hear nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a ris.
ing ground, to look further; 1 went up the shore and down
the shore, but it was all one; 1 could see no other impm
sion but that one. 1 went to it a ain to see if there were
any more, and to observe it it mig it not be my fancy; but
there was no room for that, for there was exactly the print
of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it came
thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine; but,
after innumerable ilutterin thoughts, like a man perfectly
confused and out of mysel , I came home to my fortifica-
tion, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but ter-
rified to the last degree; lookin behind me at every two
or three steps, mistaking every ash and tree. and fancy-
ing every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it s-
siblo to describe how many various shapes my afirigited
imagination represented things to me in, how many wild
ideas were found every moment in my fancy, and what
strange unaccountable whimsics came into my thoughts by
the we .

Wheyii I came to my castle (for so 1 think 1 called it ever
after this), I fled into it like one pursued; whether I went
over by the ladder, as first contrived, or went in at the
hole in the rock, which I had called a door, I can not re-
member; no, nor could I remember the next morning; for
never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth with
more terror of mind than 1 to this retreat.

I sle t none that night: the further I was from the ocea-'
sion 0 my fright, the greater my apprehensions were;
which is somethin contrary to the nature or such things,'.
and especially to t e usual practice of all creatures in fear;
but 1 was so embarrassed with my own fri htful ideas of
the thing, that 1 formed nothing but disma imaginations
to myself, even though I was now a reat wa off it.'
Sometimes I fancied it must be the A evil, an reason
joined in with me upon this supposition; for how should
any other thing in human shape come into the place?
Where was the vessel that brought them? What marks
were there of any other footsteps? And how was it possi-
ble a man should come there? But then to think that
Satan should take human shape upon him in such a place,
where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to
leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even for
no purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it--
this was an amusement the other we . I considered that
the devil might have round out abun es of other ways tognvson mm>> at game A vacuum-~ annex: '-

have terrified me than this of the sin ls print of a foot;
thatasl lived quite on the other side of the island, he
would never have been so simple as to leave a mark in a
place where it was ten thousand to one whether I should
ever see it or not, and in the sand too, which the first
surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced
entirely: all this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself,
and with all the notions we usually entertain of the sub-
tlety of the devil.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me
out of all apprehensions of its being the devil; and I pres-
ently concluded, then, that it must be some more danger-
ous creature, viz., that it must be some of the savages of
the main land over against me, who had wandered out to
sea in their canoes, and, either driven by the currents or
by contrary winds, had made the island, and had been on
shore, but were gone away again to sea; being as loath, per-
haps, to have stayed on this desolate island as 1 would have
been to have had them.

While these reflections were rollin upon my mind, I was
very thankful in my thoughts that was so happy as not
to be thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my
boat, by which they would have concluded that some in-
habitants had been in the ulace, and perhaps have searched
further for me: then terri le thoughts racked my imagina-
tion about their having found my boat, and that there were
peoyile here; and that if so, I should certainly have them
come again in greater numbers, and devour me: that if it
should happen so that they should not find me, yet they
would find my inclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry
away all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at
last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that
former confidence in God, which was founded upon such
wonderful experience as I had had of His goodness, as if He
that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve, by
His power, the provision which he had made for me by His
goodness. I reproached myself with my laziness, that
would not sow any more com one year than would just
serve me till the next season, as it no accident would inter-
vene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the
ground; and this I thought so just a reproot, that 1 r9-
solved for the future to have two or three years' corn be-
forehand, so that, whatever might come, I might not per-
ish for want of bread.

How strange a checker-work of Providence is the life of
manl' and b what secret different springs are the affec-
tions hurri about, as different circumstances present!
To--day we love what te-morrow we hate; to~day we seek
what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow
we fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of; this
was exemplified in me, at this time, in the most lively
manner imaginable; for I, whose only afiliction was that l
seemed banished from human society, that Iwas alone,
circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut elf from man--
kind, and condemned to whatl called silent life; that I
was as one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
bered amen the living, or to appear among the rest of His
creatures; t rat to have seen one of my own species would
have seemed to me a raising me from death to life, and
the greatest blessing that Heaven itself, next to the
supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow; I say, that I
should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a
man, and was ready to sink into the ground at but the
shadow or silent appearance of a man's having set his foot
on the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded
me a great many curious speculations afterward, when 1
had a little recovered my first surprise. I considered that
this was the station of life the infinitely wise and good
providence of God had determined for me; that as I could
not foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all
this, so I was not to dispute His sovereignty, who, as I was
live creature, had an undoubted right, by creation, to gov-
em and dispose of me absolutely as He thought fit; and
who, as I was a creature that had ofiended Him, had like-
wise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment
He thought fit; and that it was my part to submit to bear
His indignation, because I had sinned against Him. I
then reflected, that as God, who was not only righteous,
but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and afliict
me, so He was able to deliver me; that it He did not think
fit to do so, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself
absolutely and entirely to His will; and, on the other

hand, it was my duty also to hope in Him, pray to Him,
and quietly to attend the dictates and directions of His
daily providence.

'l'hese thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay,I
may say, weeks and months; and one particular etl'eet of
my eogitations on this occasion I can not omit. One
morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts
about my danger from the appearance of savages, 1 found
it diseornposed me very much; upon which these words of
the Scripture came into my thoughts: " Gall upon me in
the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed,
my heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and
encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance: when
1 had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to
read, the first words presented to me were, " Wait on
the Lord, and be of good cheer, and He shall strengthen
thy heart; wait, lsay, on the Lord." It is impossible to
express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully
laid down the book, and was no more sad, at least on that
occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and
reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this
might be a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot
might be the print of my own foot, when 1 came on shore
from my boat: this cheered me up a little too, and I began
to persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was noth--
ing else but my own foot: and why might I not come that
way from the boat, as well as I was going that way to the
boat? Again, I considered also, that I could by no means
tell, for certain, where 1 had trod, and where I had not;
and that if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot,
I had played the part of those fools who try to make
stories of specters and apparitions, and then are fright--
ened at them more than anybody.

Now I began to take courage, and to ep abroad again,
for 1 had not stirred out of my castle or three days and
nights, so that I began to starve for provisions; for I had
little or nothing Within doors but some barley cakes and
water: then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked
too, which usually was my evening diversion; and the poor
creatures were in great pain and inconvenience for want of
it: and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost

dried up their mills. Encouraging myself, theretom, with
the belief that this was nothing but the print of one of my
own feet, and that 1 mi ht be truly said to start at my own
shadow, I began to go a road again, and went to my coun-
try house to milk my flock: but to see with what fear I
went forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was
ready, every now and then, to lay down my basket, and
run for my life, it would have made an one think 1 was
haunted with an evil conscience, or that had been lately
most terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had. How-
ever, as I went down thus two or three days, and havin
seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to thin
there was really nothing in it but my own imagination; but
I could not persuade myself fully of this till I should go
down to the shore again, and see this print of afoot, and
measure it by my own, and see if there was any similitude
or fitness, that I might be assured it was my own feet: but
when 1 came to the place, first, it appeared evidently to
me, that when I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be
on shore anywhere thereabout: secondly, when I came to
measure the mark with my own foot, 1 found my foot not _
so large by a great deal. But these things filled my head
with new imaginations, and gave me the vapors again to
the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one in an
ague; and I went home again, filled with the belief that
some man or men had been on shore there; or, in short,
that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised be-
fore 1 was aware; and what course to take for my security
I knew not. '

Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed
with fear! 1t deprives them of the use of those means
which reason oli'ers for their relief. The first thing 1 pro-
posed to myself was, to throw down my inelosnres, and
turn all Ill tame cattle wild into the woods, lest the enemy
should fin them, and then frequent the island in prospect
of the same or the like booty: then to the simple thing of
digginv up my two corn fields, lest they' should find such a
grain time, and still be prompted to frequent the island:
then to demolish my bower and tent, that they might not
see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted, to look
further, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.

These were the subject of the first night's co itations
after I was come home again, while the appre ensions
which had so overrun my mind were fresh upon me, and
my head was full of vapors, as above. Thus fear of dan-
ger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself
when apparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of anx-
iety greater, b ' much, than the evil which we are anxious
about: and, w ieh was worse than all this, 1 had not that
relief in this trouble from the resignation I used to me-
ties, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like i an],
who complained not only that the Philistiues were upon
him, but that God had forsaken him; for 1 did not now
take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in
my distress, and resting upon his providence, as I had done
before, for my defense and deliverance; which, if 1 had
done, I had at least been more cheerfull supported under
this new surprise, and perhaps carri through it with
more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night;
but in the morning I fell asleep; and having, by the
amusement of my mind, been as it were tired, and my
spirits exhausted, I slept very soundl and waked much
better composed than I had ever been efore. And now I
began to think sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with
myself, 1 concluded that this island, which was so exceed-
ing pleasant, fruitful, and no further from the main land
than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned as I
might imagine; that although there were no stated inhabit~
ants who lived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes
come boats olT from the shore, who, either with design, or
perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds,
might come to this place; that I had lived here fifteen
years now, and had not met with the least shadow or figure
of any people yet; and that if at any time they should be
driven here, it was probable they went away again as soon
as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix
here upon any occasion; that the most 1 could suggest any
danger from, was from any casual accidental landing of
straggling )eople from the main, who, as it was likely, if
they were riven hither, were here against their wills, so
they made no stay here, but went 01f again with all possi-
ble speed; seldom staying one night on shore, lest the
should not have the help of the tides and daylight bac
again; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to con-
sider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages

land upon the spot.
Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so
large as to bring a door through again, which door, as I
said, came out beyond where my fortification joined to the
rock: upon maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved
to draw me a second fortification, in the same manner of a
semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had
planted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of
which I made mention: these trees having been lanted so
thick before, they wanted but few files to be rivon be-
tween them, that they might be thic er and stronger, and
my wall would be soon finished: so that I had now a double
wall; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of tim<<
her, old cables, and everything I could think of, to make
it strong, having in it seven little holes about as big as I
might. put my arm out at. In the inside of this, 1 thick-
0!)?" my wall to about ten feet thick, with continually
bringing earth out of. my cave, and laying it at the foot of
ill-n. wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes
I contrived to plant. the muskets, of which I took notice
that I had got seven on shore out of the ship: theseI
planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that
lu-l l them like a carriage, so that I could tire all the seven
guns in two ininutes' time: this wall I was many a weary
month in finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till
it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my
wall. for a great length every way, as full with stakes, or
sticks, of the osier-liko wood, which I found so apt to
grow, as they could well stand; insomueh, that I believe I
might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a
pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might
have room to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter
from the young trees, if. they attempted to approach my
outer wall.

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove; and in
five or six. years' time i had a wood before my dwelling,
growing so monstrous thick and stron , that it was indeed
perfectly impassable; and no men, 0 what kind soever,
would ever imagine that there was anythin beyond it,
much less a habitation. As for the way whic I 'proposed
to myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue,) it was by
setting two ladders. one to a part 01 the rock which was

low, and than broke in, and lett the town to place another
ladder upon that: so when the two ladders were taken
down, no man living could come down to me without do-
ing himself mischief; and if they had come down, they
were still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could
suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen, at
length, that they were not altogether without just reason,
though I foresaw nothing at that time more than my mere
fear suggested to me.

While this was doing, 1 was not altogether careless of
my other affairs: forl had a great concern upon me for
my little herd of goats; they were not only a ready supply
to me on every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me,
without the ex ense of powder and shot, but also without
the fatigue of uniting after the wild ones; and I was loath
to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to
nurse u over again.

For t is purpose, after long consideration, I could think
of but two ways to preserve them: one was, to find another
convenient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive
them into it every night; and the other was, to inclose two
or three little bits of land, remote from each other, and as
much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half
a dozen young goats in each place: so that if any disaster
happened to the flock in general, I might be able to raise
them again with little trouble and time; and this, though
it would require a great deal of time and labor, I thought
was the most rational design.

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most re-
tired parts of the island; and l pitched upon one, which
was as private, indeed, as my heart could wish for: it was
a little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the hollow
and thick woods, where, as is observed, 1 almost lost my-
self once brfore, endeavoring to come back that way from '
the eastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece
of land, near three acres, so surrounded with woods that
it was almost an inclosure by nature; at least, it did not
want near so much labor to make it so as the other pieces
of ground 1 had worked so hard at. -

SECTION XVIII.

Precautions against Surprise--Robinson discovers that his Island
has been visited by Cannibals.

1 IMMEDIATELY went to work with this piece of ground,
and in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round,
that my flock, or herd, call it which you please, who were
not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to be,
were well enough secured in it: so, without any further de-
lay, I removed ten young she-goats and two lie--goats to
this piece; and when they were there, I continued to wer-
feet the fence, till lhad made it as secure as the otter,
which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up
more time by a great deal. All this labor I was at the ex-
pense of purely from my apprehensions on account of the
print of a man's feet which had seen; for, as yet, I never
saw any human creature come near the island; and 1 had
now lived two years under this uneasiness, which, indeed,
made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as
may be well imagined by an who knows what it is to live
in the constant snare of the ear of man. And this I must
observe, with grief too, that the diseomposure of my mind
had too great impressions also upon the religious part of
my thoughts: for the dread and terror of falling into the
hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that
I seldom found myself in a due temper for application to
my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness and resig-
nation of soul which 1 was wont to do: I rather prayed to
God as under great affliction and pressure of mind, sur-
rounded with danger, and in expectation every night of
being murdered and devoured before morning; and 1 must
testify from my experience, that a tom per of peace, thank-
fulness, love and alIection, is much the more proper frame '
for prayer than that of terror and discomposure; and that
under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more
fit for a comforting performance or the duty of praying to
God, than he is for a repentance on a sick-bed; for these
discomposures afl'ect the mind, as the others do the body;
and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be as
great a disability as that of the body, and much greater:Robins!!! ('mssoa Diwovms 3mm; nl mun-u. nnniu m
praying to God being properly an act of the mind, not
of the body.

But to go on: after I had thus secured one art of my
little living stock, I went about the whole islan , searching
for another private place to make such another deposit;
when, wandering more to the west point of the island than
I hill]. ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I
saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found
a perspective glass or two in one of the seamen's chests,
which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me;
and this was so remote, that I could not tell what to make
of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to
hold to look any longer: whether it was a boat or not, I do
not know, but as l descended from the hill 1 could see no
more of it; so I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more
out without a perspective glass in my pocket. When 1
was come down the hill to the end of the island, where, in-
deed, 1 had never been before, I was presently convinced
that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a
strange thing in the island as I imagined: and, but that it
was a special providence that I was cast 11 on the side of
the island where the savages never came, should easily
have known that nothing was more frequent than for the
canoes from the main, when they happened to be a little
too far out at sea, to shoot-over to that side of the island
for harbor: likewise, as they often met and fought in their
canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, would
bring them over to this shore, where, according to their
dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and
eat them; of which hereafter.

When I was some down the hill to the shore, as I said
above, being the south-west point of the island, 1 was per-
fectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible for me to
express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread
with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies;
and, particularly, 1 observed a place where there had been
a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit,
where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to
their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-
creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things that I
entertained no notions of any danger to myself from it for
a long while: all my apprehensions were buried in the

12

~.': new we
thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and
the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which,
though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a
view of before: in short, I turned away my face from the
horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I was just at
the point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder
from my stomach: and having vomited with uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay
in the place a moment: so 1 got me up the hill again with
all the speed 1 could, and walked on toward my own habi~
tation.

When 1 came a little out of that part of the island, I
stood still awhile, as amazed, and then recovering myself,
I looked up with the utmost affection of my soul, and,
with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had
cast my first let in a part of the world where I 'as distin-
guished from such d rvadlul creatures as these; and that,
thonghI had esteemed my present condition very miscr-
ablc, had yet given me so many comforts in it, that 1 had
still more to give thanks for than to complain of: and this,
above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition,
been comforted with the knowledge of .lihnsclf. and the
hope. of His blessing, which was a felicity more than sufli-
ciently equivalent to all the misery which 1 had snli'ered or
could sull'er.

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle,
and began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my
circumstances, than ever I was before: for I observed that
these wretehes never came. to this island in search of what
they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not
expecting, anything here, and having often, no doubt, been
up in the covered woody part of it, without finding any-
thin;r to their purpose. 1 know 1 had been here now
almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of
human creature there before; and I might be eighteen
years more as entirely concealed as 1 was now, if 1 did not
discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occa-
sion to do; it being mv only business to keep mySclf cu-
tirely concealed where l was, unless I found a better sort
of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. Yet
lentertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches
that I have been spiaking of, and of the wretched inhu-
man custom of their devouring and eating each other up,
that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my .
own circle, for almost two years after this; when I say my
own eircle,l mean by it my three plantations, viz.. my
castle, my country seat, which 1 called my bower. and my
inelosure in the woods: nor did I look after this for any
other use than as an inclosure for my goats; for the aver-
sion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was
such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the
devil himself. I did not so much as go to look after my
beat all this time, but began rather to think of making me
another; for] could not think of ever making any more
attempts to bring the othe' boat round the island to me,
lest 1 should meet with some of these creatures at sea, in
which if I happened to have fallen into their hands,I
know what would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in
no danger of being discovered by these people, began to
wear 011' my uneasiness about them; and I egan to live
just in the same composed manner as before, only with
this diil'erence, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes
more about me, than I did before, lest I should happen to
be seen by any of them; and particularly, I was more can-
tious of firing my gun, lest any of them being on the
island should happen to hear it. It was therefore a very
good n-ovidenee to me that I had furnished myself with a
tame reed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any
more about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch
any of them after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had
done before: so that for two years after this, I believe I
never fired my gun once 00', though 1 never went out with-
out it; and, which was more, as I had saved three pistols
out of the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at
least two of them, sticking them in my goat's-skin belt. 1
also t'urbished up one of the great outlasscs that I had out
of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; so that
I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of myself, the
particular of two pistols, and a great broadsword hanging
at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard.

Things going on thus, as 1 have said, for some time, I
seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my
former calm sedate we of living. All these things tended
to show me, more an more, how far my condition was
from being miserable, com ared to some others; nay, to
many other particulars of li e, which it might have pleased
(led to have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting how
little re ining there would be among mankind at any con-
dition oi1 life, if people would rather compare their condi-
tion with those that were worse, in order to be thankful,
than be always comparing them with those which are bet--
ter, to assist their murmuriugs and complainings.

As in my present condition there were not really many
things which I wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the
frights I had been in about these savage wretches, and the
concern I had been in for my own preservation, had taken
oi? the edge of my invention for my own conveniences; and
1 had dropped a gem] design, which I had once bent my
thoughts too much upon, and that was, to try if 1 could
not make some at my barley into malt; and then try to
brew myself some beer. This was really a whimsical
thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of
it; for l presently saw there would be the want of several
things necessary to the nmking my beer, that it would be
impossible-for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it
in, which was a thing that, as I had observed already, 1
could never compass; no, though I spent not only many
days, but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no
purpose. In the next place, 1 had no hops to make it
keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to
make it boil; and yet, with all these things wanting. I
verily believe, had not the frights and terrors 1 was in
about the savages intervened,1 had undertaken it, and
perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave anything
over without accomplishing it, when oneel had it in my
head to begin it. But my invention new ran quite another
way; for, night and day, I could think of nothing but how
lmight destroy some of these monsters in their cruel,
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim they
should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a large
volume than this whole work is intended to be. to set down
all the contrivances l hatched, or rather brooded upon, in
my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at least
trrghtening them so as to prevent their cumin hither any
more; but all this was abortive; nothing eoul be possible
to take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself; and
what could one man do among them, when perhaps thereV -. -';'.' "T'.W%SS

might be twenty or thirty of them together, with their .
darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they could
shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?
Sometimes I thought of diggin a hole under the place
where they made t eir fire, an putting in five or six
ounds of gun-powder, which, when they kindled their
re, would consequentlv take fire, and blow up all that was
near it; but, as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to
waste so much powder upon them, my store being now
within the quantity of one barrel, so neither could be sure
of its going oi! at any certain time, when it might surprise
them: and, at best, that it would do little more than just
blow the fire about their ears and fright them, but not
sufficient to make them forsake the lace: so I laid it
aside; and then proposed that 1 would p ace myself in am-
bush in some convenient place, with my three uns all
double-loaded, and, in the middle of their blo y cere-
mony, let fly at them, when 1 should be sure to kill or
wound perha s two or three at every shot: and then fall-
ing in upon t em with my three pistols, and my sword, I
made no doubt but that if there were twenty I should kill
them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks;
and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed of it, and
sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in my
sleep. I went so far with it in my imagination, that 1 em-
ployed myself several days to find out proper places to put
myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them; and I
went frequently to the place itself, which was now grown
more familiar to me: but while my mind was thus filled
with thou hts of revenge, and a bloody uttin twenty or
thirty of t em to the sword, as I may cal it, t e horror I
had at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous
wretches devourin one another, abetted my malice.
Well, at length, I found a lace in the side of the hill,
where I was sastisfied I mig t securely wait till I saw any
of their boats coming; and might then, even before they
would be ready to come on shore, convey myself, unseen,
into some thickets of trees, in one of which there was a
hollow large enough to conceal me entirely; and there 1
mi ht sit and observe all their bloody doings, and take my
ful aim at their heads, when they were so close together
as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss
my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of
them at the first shot. In this place, then, I resolved to
fix my design; and, accordingly, I prepared two muskets
and my ordinnry foai-'ling-piece. The two muskets I loaded
with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets,
about the s: ;:c oi pistol-bullets; and the fowling-pieee I loaded
with near a. handful of swan-shot, of the largest size: 1 also
loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; and. in this
posture, well provided with ammunition for a. second and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.

After 1 had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in
my ixmiginzttion, put is in practice, I continually made my
tour every morning up to the top of the hill, which was
from my castle, as 1 culicd it, about three miles, or more,
to see if lcould~ ohser're any bouts upon the sea. coming
near the isizuul, or standing over toward it: but I began to
tire of this hard duty, after I had, for two or three months,
constantly kept my watch, but came always back without
any discmery: there having not, in all that time, been the
least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on the
whole ocean, so for as my eyes or glasses conid reach every
war.

As long as: I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out,
so long also 1' liar-pt up the rigor of my design, and my
spirits seemed to be all the while in a suitable form for so
outrageous an cx'culion as the killing twenty or thirty
nuke-J savages, for an oli'ense, which I had not at all en-
tered into :1. discussion of in my thoughts, any further than
my pas-signs new at first 'lir'od by the horror 1 conceived at
the unnatural err-atom of the people of that country; who,
it seems, had been endured by Providence, in His wise dis-
position. of the world, to have no other guide than that of
their own abominable and vitiated passions; and, conse-
qucn'tiy, were lcl't, and perhaps had been so for some ages,'
to net such horrid things, and receive such dreadful cus-
trnns, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by
Heaven, and actuated lav some hellish degeneracy, could
have run them into. But now, when, as I have said, I
begztn to be weary of the fruit-less excursion, which 1 had
made so long and so far every morning in Vain, so my
opinion oi the. action itself began to alter; and lhcgan,
with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was
going to engage in: what authority or call 1 had to pretend
to be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals,
whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages, to sulfer,
unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the execution-
ers of His judgments one upon another. How far these
people were offenders against me, and what right I had to
engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed pro-
miscuorrsly one upon another, I debated this very often
with myself, thus: How do I know what God Himself
judges in this particular case? It is certain these people
do not commit this as a crime; it is not against their OWn
consciences reproviug, or their light re reaching them;
they do not know it to be an offense, andp then commit it
in defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins
we commit. They think it no more a crime to kill a cap-
tive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox ; nor to eat hu-
man flesh, than we do to eat mutton.

When 1 censidered this a little, it followed necessarily
that I was certainly in the wrong in it; that these people
were not murderers in the sense that I had before cou-
dcmned them in my thoughts, any more than those Chris-
tians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners
taken inbuttle; or more frequently, upon many occasions,
put whole troops of men to the sword, without giving
quarter, though they threw down their arms and submit-
ted. In the next place, it occurred to me, that although
the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and in-
human, yet it was really nothing to me; these peo 16 had
done me no injury: that if they attempted me, or saw it
necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon
them, something might be said for it; but that I was yet
cut of their power, and they really had no knowledge of
mas, and consequently no design upon me; and therefore it
could not be just for me to fall upon them: that this
would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all their bar-
barities practiced in America, where they destroyed mil~
lions of these people: who, however they were idolaters and
barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in
their customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to their
idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent people;
and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of
with the utmost abhorrenee and detestation by even the
Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all other Chris-
tian nations in Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and
unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or- ,1"; an";

man, and for which the very name of a Spaniard is reck-
oned to be frightful and terrible to all people of humanity,
or of Christian compassion--as if the kingdom of Spain
were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men
who were without principles of tenderness, or the common
bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a
mark of generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a
kind of a full sto ; and I be an, by little and little, to be
ad my design, an to conclu e I had taken wrong meas-
ures in my resolution to attack the savages; and that it
was not my business to meddle with them, unless they
first attacked me, and that it was my business, if possible,
to prevent; but that if I were discovered and attacked by
them, I knew my duty. On the other hand, I argued with
myself, that this really was the way not to deliver myself,
but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was
sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at
that time, but that should ever come on shore afterward,
it but one of them escaped to tell their country-people
what had happened, they would come over again by thou-
sands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should
only bring ugon myself a certain destruction, which, at
present, I ha no manner of occasion for. Upon the
whole, I concluded, that neither in principle nor in policy
I ought, one way or other, to concern myself in this affair;
that my business was, by all possible means, to conceal
myself from them, and not to leave the least signal to them
to guess by that there were any living creatures upon the
island, I mean of human shape. Religion joined in with
this prudential resolution, and I was convinced now, many
ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was lay-
ing all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent
creatures, I mean innocent as to me. As to the crimes
they were guilty of toward one another, 1 had nothing to
do with them; they were national, and I ought to leave
them to the justice of God, who is the Governor of na-
tions, and knows how, by national. punishments, to make
a just retribution for national offenses, and to bring public
judgments upon those who offend in a public manner, by
such ways as best please Him. This appeared so clear to
me now that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than
that I had not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw
so much reason to believe would have been no less a sin
than that of willful murder, ii I had committed it; and I
gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that had
thus delievered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching Him
to grant me the protection of His Providence, that I might
not fall into the hands of the barbarians, or that 1 might
not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more clear
call from Heaven to do it, in defense of my owu life.

Robinson discovers 3. Gave, which serves him as a Retreat against
the Savages.

1N this disposition I continued for near a year after this;
and so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon
these wretches, that in all that time I never once went up
the hill to see whether there were any of them in sight, or
to know whether any of them had been on shore there or
not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my con-
trivances against them, or be provoked, by any advantage
which might present itself, to fall upon them; only this I
did, I went and removed my boat, which 1 had on the
other side of the island, and carried it down 'to the east end
of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove, which
1 found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by rea-
son of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would
not, come with their boats upon any account whatever.
With my boat I carried away everything that I had left
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare
going thither, viz., a mast and sail which I had made for
her, and a thing like an anchor, but which, indeed, could
not be called either anchor or grapnel; however, it was the
best I could make of its kind; all these I removed, that a
there might not be the least shadow of anydiscovery, or
any appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation,
upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said,
more retired than ever, and seldom went from my cell,
other than upon my constant employment, viz., to milk
my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood,
which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was
quite out 01 danger; for certain it is, that these savage pee-v
ple, who sometimes haunted this island, never came with
any thoughts of finding anything here, and consequently
never wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not but
they might have been several times on shore attenmy ap-
prehensions of them had made me cautious, as well as be-
fore. Indeed, I looked back with some horror u n the
thoughts of what my condition would have been i I had
popde 11 :1 them and been discovered before that, when,
naked an unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded
often only with small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping
and peering about the island to see what 1 could get; what
a surprise should I have been in, if, when I discovered the
print of a man's foot, I had, instead of that, seen fifteen
or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and by
the swiftness of their running, no possibility of my escap-
ing them? The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much that I
could not soon recover it, to think what I should have
done, and how 1 should not only have been unable to resist
them, but even should not have had presence of mind
enough to do what 1 might have done, much less what
now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might
be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking on these
things, I would be very melancholy, and sometimes it would
last a great while; but I resolved it all at last, into thank-
fulncss to that Providence which had delivered ine from so
many unseen dan ers, and had kept from me those mis-
chiefs which 1 con (1 have no way been the agent in deliver-
ing myself from, be( ause 1 had not the least notion of any
such thing depending, or the least supposition of its bein

possible. This renewed a contemplation which often ha

come to my thoughts in former time. when first I began to
see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we
run through in this life; how wonderfully we are delivered
when we know nothing of it; how, when we are in a quan-
dary, as we call it, a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this
way, or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way,
when we intended to go that way; na , when sense, our
own inclination, and perhaps business, as called to go the
other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind, from
we know not what springs, and by we know not what
power, shall overrule us to go this way; and it shall after-
ward appear that had we gone that way which we should
have gone, and even to our imagination on ht to have
gene, we should have been ruined and lost. %pon these,
and many like reflections,I afterward made it a certain
rule with me, that whenever I found those secret hints or
pressings of mind, to doing or not doin anythin that
presented, or going this way or that way, never fai ed to
obey the secret dictate; though 1 know no other reason for
it than that such a. pressure, or such a hint, hung upon
my mind. I could give many examples of the success of
this conduct in the course of my life, but more especially
in the latter part of myinhabiting this unhappy island, be-
sides many occasions which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of it, if. 1 had seen with the same eyes then
that I see with now. But it is never too late to be wise;
and I can not but advise all considering men, whose lives
are attended with such extraordinary incidents as mine, or
even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret
inlimutions of Providence, let them come from what invisi-
ble intelligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and
perhaps can not account for; but certainly they are a proof
of the converse of spirits, and a secret communication be-
tween these embodied and those unembodied, and such a
proof as can never be withstood; of which 1 shall have oc-
casion to give some very remarkable instances in the re-
mainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think it stran e if I
confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers lived
in, and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to
all invention, and 'to all the contrivanees that I had laid
for my future accommodations and conveniences. lhad
the care of my safety more now upon my hands than that
of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of
wood now, for fear the noise I might make should be heard;
much less would I fire a gun, for the same reason; and,
above all, 1 was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest
the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day,
should betray me. For this reason I removed that part of
my business which required fire, such as burning of pots
and pipes, etc., into my new apartment in the woods,
where, after I had been some time, I found, to my un-
speakable consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth,
which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say, no sav-
age, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as-\-"'.'4- .1'"' .--:.~-',.'- ; =

to venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one
who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great
rock, where by mere accident (I would say, if 1 did not see
abundant reason to ascribe all such things now to Provi-
deuce), I was cutting down some thick branches of trees to
make charcoal; and, before I go on, I must observe the
reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus: 1 was
afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said
before; and yet I could not live there without baking my
bread, cooking my meat, etc.; so I contrived to burn some
wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till
it became chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire
out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the
other services for which fire was wanting, without danger
of smoke. But this is by the by. While I was cutting
down some wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick
branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there was a kind
of hollow place; I was curious to look in it, and getting
with difliculty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty
large; that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upri ht in
it, and perhaps another with me; but I must con ass to
you that I made more haste out than 1 did in, when, look-
ing further into the place, and which was perfectly dark, I
saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil
or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim
light from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and mak-
ing the reflection. However, after some pause, I recovered
myself, and began to call myself a thousand fools, and to
think that he that was afraid to see the devil was not fit to
live twenty years in an island all alone; and that I might
well think there was nothing in this cave that was more
frightful than myself. Upon this, plucking up my cour-
age, I took up a fire-brand, and in I rushed again, with the
stick flaming in my hand; I had not gone three steps in
but I was almost as much frightened as I was before; for I
heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain,
and it was followed by a broken noise, as of words half. ex-
pressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and
was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put me into
a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not
answer for it, that my hair might not have lifted it off.
But still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and en-V.

com-aging myself a little with considering that the power
and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to pro-
tect me, upon this I stepped forward again, and by the
light of the fire-brand, holding it up a little over my head,
I saw lying on the ground a. most monstrous, frightful, old
lie--goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for
life, and dying, indeed, of more old age. I stirred him a
little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get
up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with
myself he might even lie there; for if he had frightened
me, so he would certainly frighten any of the savages, if
any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while
he had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when 1 found the cave was but very small, that
is to say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no man-
ner of shape, neither round nor square, no hands having
ever been employed in making it but those of more Nature.
I observed also that there was a place at the further side of
it that went in further, but was so low that it required me
to creep upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither
it went I knew not; so having no candle, I gave it over for
that time, but resolved to come again the next day, pro-
vided with candles and a. tinder-box, which I had made of
the lock of one of the muskets, with some wild-fire in the

an.
p Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles
now of goat's fallow, but was hard set for candle-wick,
using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes the
dried rind of a wood like nettles); and going into this low
place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I have said,
almost ten yards; which, by the way, I thought was a
venture bold enough, considering that I knew not how far
it might go, nor what was beyond it. When I had ot
through the strait, 1 found the roof rose higher up, I e-
lieve near twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight
seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look roundthe
sides and roof of this vault or cave; the wall reflected a
hundred thousand lights to me from no two candles.
What it was in the rock, whether diamon s, or any other

reeious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be,

knew not. The place I was in was a. most delightful
cavity or rotto of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly ark; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort
of small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous
or venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any
damp or wet on the sides or roof; the only difficulty in it
was the entrance; which, however, as it was a place of
security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that
was a convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the dis-
covery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring] some of
those things which I was most anxious about to t is place;
particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of

owdcr. and all my spare arms, viz., two fowling-pieces,
or I had three in all, and three muskets, for of them I
had eight in all; so I kept at my castle only five, which
stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon, on my outmost
fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, l hap-
pened to open the barrel of powder which 1 took u out of
the sea, and which had been wet; and I found t at the
water had penetrated about three or four inches into the
powder on every side, which caking and growing hard, had
preserved the inside like a kernel in the shell; so that 1 had
near sixty pounds of very good powder in the center of the
cask; this was avery agreeable discovery to me at that
time; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above
two or three pounds of owder with me in my castle, for
fear of a surprise of any ind; I also carried thither all the
lead I had left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants,

. which were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks,
where none could come at them; for l persuaded myself,
while I was here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt
me, they could never find me out; or. if they did, they
would not venture to attack me here. The old goat, whom
I found expiring, died in the mouth of the cave the next
day afterI made this discover ; and I found it much easier
to dig a great hole there, an throw him in and cover him
With earth than to drag him out; so I interred him
there, to prevent offense to m nose.

this island; and was so naturalized, to the place, and the
manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed the oer-

me, 1 could have been content to have capitulated for
spending the rest of my time there, even to the last mo-
ment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old goat
in the cave. 1 had also arrived to some little diversions
and amusements, which made the time pass a great deal
more pleasantly with me than it did before; as, first, I had
taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it
so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it
was very pleasant to me; for I believe no bird ever spoke
plainer, and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty
years; how long he might have lived afterward I know not,
though I know they have a notion in the Brazils that they
live a hundred years. My dog was a very pleasant and
loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of
my time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats,
they multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree, that I
was oblige to shoot several of them at first, to keep them
from devouring me and all 1 had; but, at length, when
the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and after
some time continually driving them from me, and letting
them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into the
woods, except two or three favorites, which I kept tame,
and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned;
and these were part of my family. Besides these, I always
kept two or three household kids about me, whom I taught
to feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which
talked pretty well, and would all call Robin Crusoe, but
none 1i e my first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with
any of them that I had done with him. I had also several
tame sea-lowls, whose names I knew not, that I caught
upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the little stakes
which 1 had planted before my castle well being now grown
up to a good thick grove, these foals all lived among these
low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable to me;
so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented
with the life I led, if I could have been secured from the
dread of the savages. But it was otherwise directed; and
it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my
story to make this just observation from it, viz., How fre-
quentl , in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself
we see most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into,
is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very means or

door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised
0 .
again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could give
many examples of this in the course of my unaccounta3 -.
life, but in' nothing was it more particularly remarkn' I
than in the circumstances of my last years of solitary Keep
deuce in this island.

SECTION XX.

Another Visit of the gamers--Robinson sees them Dancing--Per.

IT was now the month of December, as I said above, in
my twenty--third year; and this being the southern solstice
(for winter 1 can not (-all it), was the particular time of my
harvest, and required my being pretty much abroad in the
fields; when going out pretty early in the morning, even
before it was thorough daylight, l was surprised with aeo-
ing a light of some lire upon the shore, at a distance from
me of about two miles, toward the end of the island where
I had observed some. savages had been. as before; and not
on the other side, but, to my great. alliiotion, it was on my
side 0! the island.

I was indeed to 'rihly surprised at the sight, and stopped
short within my grove, not daring to go out, lest 1 might
be surprised; and yet I had no more peace within, from
the apprehensions 1 had that if these savages, in rambling
over the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or
any of; my works and improvements, they would immedi-
ately emu-lode that there were people in the place, and
would then never give over till the}; had found me out.
In this extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled
up the ladder after me, and made all things without look
as wild and natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting mysrlf in a
posture of defense; I loaded all my cannon, as 1 called
them, that is to say, my muskets, which were mounted
upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved
to defend mvself to the last gasp; not forgetting seriously
to commend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly
to pray to God to deliver me out of the hands of the bar-
barians. I continued in this posture about two hours, and
began to be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for
1 had no spies to send out. After sitting awhile longer,
and musing what I should do in this, I was not able to bear
sitting in ignorance any longer; so settin up my ladder to
the ante of the hill, where there was a tat place, as I ob-
sers <<l before, and then pulling the ladder up after me, I
set it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill; and
pulling out; my perspective glues, which I had taken on
purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground,
and began to look for the place. Ipreseutly found there
were no less than nine naket savages, sitting round a small
fire they had made, not to warm them. for they haul no
need of that, the weather being extremely hot, but, as I
supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet: of human
flesh, which they had brought with them, whether alive or
(loud I could not tell.

They llflll two canoes with them, \ :irh they had hauled
up upon the shore; and as it. was then tide of ebb, they
seemed to me to wait. for the return of the flood to go
away again. It is not. easy to imagine what confusion this
sight; put me into, Csperinlly seeing thriu come on my side
of the island, and so near me too; but when 1 considered
their coming must be always with the current of the ebb,
I began, afterward, to be more sedate in my mind, being
satis'iul that I might go abroad with safety all Ihe time of
til-.3 tide of flood, it they were not on shore before; and
liming made this observation, Iwent abroad about my
harvest work with the more composure.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made
to the westwurd, I saw them all take bout. and row (or
puddle, as we cull it), away. I should have ooserved, that
for an hour or more before they went off, they went
a-duneing; and I could easily discern their postures and
gestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest
observation, but that. they were stark naked, and lint] not
the least covering upon them; but whether titty were men
or women, I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took twu
guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and
my great sword by my side, without :1 seahbard, and with
all the speed l was able to make, went away to the hill
where 1 had discovered the first appearance of. all; and as
soon as I got thither, which was not; in less than two hours
(for I could not go apace, being so loaden with arms as 1
was), 1 perceived there had been three canoes more of sav-
eges at that place; and looking out further, I saw they
were all at sea together, making over for the main. This
was adreadful sight to me, especially as, going down to
the shore, 1 could see the marks of horror, which the dis-
mal work they had been about had left behind it, viz., the
blood, the bones, and part of the flesh, of human bodies,
eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight that I now
began to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
there, let them be wlism or how many soever. It seemed
evident to me that the visits which they made thus to this
island were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen
months before any more of them came on shore there again;
that is to say, I neither saw them, nor any footsteps or
signals of them, in all that time; for, as to the rainy sea-
sons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so
for; yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of
the constant apprehensions of their coming upon me by
surprise; from whence I observe, that the expectation of
evil is more bitter than the suffering, especially if there is
no room to shake 011' that expectation, or those apprehen-
sions.

During all this time I was in the murdering humor, and
took up most of my hours, which should have been better
employed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon
them, the very next time I should see them; especially if
they should be divided, as they were the last time, into two
parties; nor did I consider at all that if 1 killed one party,
suppose ten or a dozen, 1 was still the next day, or wee ,
or month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infini-
tum, till 1 should be at length no less a murderer than they
were in being man-eaters, and perhaps much more so. I
spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiet of mind,
expecting that I should, one day or other, fal into the
bands of these merciless creatures; and if I did at any
time venture abroad, it was not without looking round me
. with the greatest care and caution imaginable. And now
1 found, to my great comfort, how happy it was that I
provided for a tame flock or herd of goats; for l durst not,
upon any account, fire my gun, especially near that side of
the island, where they usually came, lest I should alarm
the savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure
to have them come again, with perhaps two or three hun-

dred canoes with them, in a few days, and then I knew "the Songs (Soaking Lhclr Prlmm
what to expect. However, I wore out a year and three
months more before I ever saw any more of the savages, and
then I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is true,
they might have been there once or twice, but either they
made no stay, or at least I did not see them; but in the
month of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my
four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange encounter
with them, of which in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or six-
teen months' interval, was very great; I slept unquiet,
dreamed always frightful dreams, and often started out of
my sleep in the night; in the day great troubles over~
whelmed my mind, and in the night I dreamed often of
killing the savages and of the reasons why I might justify
the doing of. it. But to waive all this for awhile. It was
in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, 1 think, as
well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for 1
marked all upon the post still; Isay, it was on the six~
teenth of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all
day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very
foul night it was after it. I knew not what was the par-
ticular occasion of it, but as I was reading in the Bible,
and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a. gun, as I
thought, fired at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise
quite of a different nature from any I had met with before;
for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite of an-
other kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable,
and, in a triee, clapped my ladder to the middle place of
the rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the
second time, got to the top of the hill the very moment
that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun, which
accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard, and, by the
sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where I
was driven down the current in my boat. I immediately
considered that this must be some ship in distress, and
that they had some comrade, or some other ship in com-
pany, and fired these guns for signals of distress, and to
obtain help. 1 had the presence of mind at that minute
to think that though I could not help them, it might be
they might help me; so I brought together all the dry
wood I could get at hand, and making a good handsome
pile, 1 set it on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and
blazed freely; and though the wind blew ver hard, yet it
burned fairly out; so that I was certain, it t ere was any
such thing as a ship, they must needs see it; and no doubt
they did, for as soon as ever my fire blazed up I heard an-
other gun, and after that several others, all from the same
quarter. I plied my fire all night long till day-break; and
when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw some'
thing at a great distance at sea, full east of the island,
whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not
with my glass; the distance was so great, and the weather
still something hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived
that it did not move; so 1 presently concluded that it was
a ship at anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be
satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran toward the
south side of the island, to the rocks where 1 had formerly
been carried away with the current; and getting up there,
the weather by this time being perfectly clear, 1 could
plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast
away in the night upon those concealed rocks which I
found when I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as
they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind
of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion ot my re-
covering from the most desperate, hopeless condition that
ever 1 had been in in all my life. Thus, what is one man's
safety is another man's destruction; for it seems these
men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge,
and the rocks being wholly under water, had been driven
u on them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E.N.E.

ad they seen the island, as I must necessarily suppose
they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavored to
have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat;
but their firing oil guns for help, especially when they saw,
as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts:
First, I imagined that upon seeing my light, they might
have put themselves into their boat, and endeavored to
make the shore; but that the sea going very high, they
might have been cast away; other times I imagined that
they might have lost their boat before, as might be the case
many ways; as particularly, by the breaking of the sea
upon their ship, which many times obliges men to stave,
or take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it
overboard With their own hands; other times I imaginedmemoir canon. 16?

they had some other ship or ships in company, who, upon
the signals of distress they had made had taken them 11
and carried them olf; other times I fancied they were a
gone off to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by
the current that I had been formerly in, were carried out
into the reat ocean, where there was nothing but misery
and peris ing; and that perhaps, they might by this time
behstarving, and in a condition to think of eating one an-
ot er.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the con-
dition I was in, I could do no more than look on upon the
misery of the poor men, and pity them; which had still
this good effect on my side, that it gave me more and more
cause to give than ks to God, who had so happily and com-
fortably provided for me in my desolate condition; and
that of two ship's companies who were now cast away 11 on
this part of the world, not one life should be spared at
mine. I learned here a sin to observe, that it is very rare
that the Providence of (god casts us into any condition of
life so low, or any misery so great, but we may see some-
thing or other to be thankful for, and may see others in
worse circumstances than our own. Such certainly was
the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as see
room to suppose any of them were saved; nothing could
make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did
not all perish there, except the possibility only of their be-
ing taken up by another ship in company; and this was
but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or
appearance of any such thing. I can not explain, by any
possible energy of words, what a strange longing or han-

ering of desires I felt in my soul upon this sight, break-
ing out sometimes thus--0h, that there had been but one
or two, nay, or but one soul saved out of this ship, to have
escaped to me, that I might but have had one companion,
one fellow-creature to have spoken to me, and to--have con-
versed with! In all the time of my solitary life I never
felt so earnest, so strong a desire'after the society of my
fellow-creatures, or so deep 3 regret at the want of it.o

He Visits the Wreck and Obtains many Stores from lit--Again
thinks of Quitting the Island--Has a. Remarkable Dream.

THERE are some secret moving sgrings in the affections,
which, when they are set a--goin y some object in view,
or, though not in view, yet ren ered present to the mind
by the power of imagination, that motion carries out the
soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager embracings
of the object that the absence of it is insupportable. Such
were these earnest wishings that but one man had been
saved. I believe 1 repeated the words, " Oh, that it had
been but one!" a thousand times; and my desires were so
moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands would
clinch together. and my fingers would press the palms of
my hands so, that if 1 had had any soft thing in my hand
it would have crushed it involuntarily; and the teeth in
my head would strike together, and set against one an-
other so strong that for some time I could not part them
again. Let the naturalists explain these things, and the
reason and manner of them; all I can say to them is to
describe the fact, which was even surprising to me, when
I found it, though I knew not from whence it proceeded;
it was doubtless the efiect 0t ardent wishes, and of strong
ideas formed in my mind, realizing the comfort which the
conversation of one of my fellow~Christians would have
been to me. But it was not to be; either their fate or
mine, or both, forbade it; for till the last year of my being
on this island, I never knew whether any were saved out of
that ship or no; and had only the affliction, some days
after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at
the end of the island which was next the shipwreck. He
had no clothes on but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to
direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of; he
Enid nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of-eight and a
tobacco-pipe--the last was to me of ten times more value
than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out
in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I mi ht find
something on board that might be useful to ms; t that
did not altogether press me so much as the possibility that
there might be yet some living creature on board, whose
life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life,
comfort my own to the last degree. And this thought
clung so to my heart that I could not be quiet night or day,
but I must venture out in my boat on board this wreck;
and committing the rest to God's Providence, I thought
the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could'
not be resisted, that it must come from some invisible
direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if 1 did
not go.

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to
my castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a
quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to
steer by, a bottle 0 rum (for 1 had still a great deal of
that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus loading myself
with everything necessar , I went down to my boat, got
the water out of her, put ier afloat, loaded all my cargo in
her, and then went home again for more. My second cargo
was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up over my
head for a shade, another large pot of fresh water, and
about two dozen of my small leaves, or barley-cakes, more
than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese; all
which, with great labor and sweat, I carried to my boat,
and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out; and
rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, came at last
to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side.
And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to
venture or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents
which ran constantly on both sides of the island at a dis-
tance, and which were very terrible to me, from the re-
membrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my
heart began to fail me; for I foresaw that if 1 was driven
into either of these currents 1 should be carried a great
way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of
the island again; an that, then, as my boat was but
small, if any little gale of wind should rise, 1 should be
inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to
give over my enterprise; and having hauled my boat into
a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down
upon a rising bit of ground, verv pensive and anxious, be-
tween tear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was
musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the
flood came on; upon which my going was impracticable
for so many hours. Upon this, presently, it occurred to
me that I should go up to the highest piece of ground 1
could find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the
tide, or currents, lay when the flood came in, that 1 might
judge whether, if 1 was driven one way out, I might not
expect to be driven another way home, Willi the same
rapidness of the currents. This thought was no sooner in
my head than I cast my eyes upon a little hill, which suffi-
ciently overlooked the sea both ways, tnd from whence I
had a clear View of the currents, or sets of the tide, and
which way I was to guide myself in my return. HereI
found, that as the current of the ebb was set out close by
the south point of the island, so the current of the flood
set in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had
nothing to do but to keep to the norlh side of the island in
my return, and I should do well enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next
morning to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing my-
self l' or the night in my canoe, under the great watch-coat I
mentioned,l launeht'd out. I first made a little out to
see, full north, till i began to feel the benefit of the cur--
rent, whieh set eastward, and which carried me at a great
rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the current on the
south side had done before, so as to take from me all gov-
ernment of the boat; but having a strong steer-age with my
paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and
in less than two hours I came up to it. It was a dismal
sight to look at; the ship, which, by its building, was
Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks; all the
stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces with the sea;
and as her forecastie, which stuck in the rocks, had run
on with great violence, her nminrnast and foremost were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short elf; but
her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared
firm. When I came close to her, adog appeared upon her,
who, seeing me coming, yelped, and cried; and as soon as
I called him jumped into the sea to come to me. I took
him into the boat, but found him almost dead with hunger
and thirst. I gave him acake of my bread, and he de-
voured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving afort-
night in the snow. 1 then gave the poor creature some' ,. 'WW ,W'"WdegVWW ,3 .. . '33: , w , ,

fresh water, with which, if I would have let him. he would
have burst himself. After this, I went on board; but the
first sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook-
room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about
each other. 1 concluded, as is indeed robable, than
when the ship struck, it being in a storm, 1. e sea broke so
high, and so continually over her, that the men were not
able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant rush-
ing in of the water, as much as if they had been under
water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship
that had life; nor any goods, that I could see, but what
were spoiled by the water. There were some casks of
liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay
lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out,
1 could see; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw
several chests, which I believed belonged to some of the
seamen; and I got two of them into the boat, without ex-
amining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship been
fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might
have made a good voyage; for, by what I found in these
two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great
deal of wealth on board; and, if I may guess from the
course she steered, she must have been bound from
Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of
America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havanna, in the Gulf
of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt,
a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to any-
body; and what became of her crew, I then knew not.

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor,
of about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with
much difficulty. There were several muskets in the cabin,
and a great powder-horn, with about four pounds of pow-
der in it; as for the muskets, 1 had no occasion for them,
so 1 left them, but took the powder-horn. 1 tooka fire-
shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two
little brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a
gridiron; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came away,
the tide beginning to make home again; and the same .
evening, about an hour within night, 1 reached the island
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed
that night in the boat; and in the morning I resolved to
harbor what I had got in my new cave, and not carry it
home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all my
cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars.
'l'he cask of liquor 1 found to be a kind of rum, but not
sin-h as we had at the llrazils, and, in a word, not at all
good; but when I come to open the chests, 1 found several
things of great use to me; for example, 1 found in one a
(in.- case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled
with cordial waters, line and very good; the bottles held
about three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I
found two pots of very good sneeudes or sweet-meats, so
fastened also on the top, that the salt-water hnd not hurt
them; and two more of the some, which the Water had
spoiied. I found some very good shirts, which wore very
Welcome to me; and about at dozen and a half of white
linen handkerchicfs and colored neck-cloths; the former
were also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe
my face in a hot day. Besides this, when 1 come to the
till in the chest, 1 found there three great bags of pieces-
of-cight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all;
and in one of them, wrapped up in a. piper, six doubloons
of gold and some small burs or wedges of gold; 1 suppose
they might all weigh neur a pound. In the other chests
were some clothes, but of little value; but, by the circum-
stances, it must have belonged to the gunner's mate;
though there was no powder in it, except two pounds of
line glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose,
. for charging their fowling--pieces on Occasion. Upon the
whole, 1 got very little by this voyage that was of any use
to me; for, as to the money, 1 had no manner of occasion
for it; it was to me us the dirt under my feet; and I would
have given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but lind
none on my feet for many years. I hnd indeed get two
pair of shoes now, which I took off the feet of the two
drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two
pair more in one of the chests, which were very welcome
to me: but they were not like our English shoes, either for
case or service, being rather what we call pumps than
shoes. I found in this seanmn'schestebout fifty pieces-
of-eight in rials, but no gold; I suppose this belonged to a
poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to
some ollicer. Well, however, I lngged this money home
to my cave, and laid it up, as 1 had done that before which
I brought from our own ship; but it was a. great pity, as I
said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my
share; for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe
several times over with money; and, thought I, if 1 ever
escape to England, it may lie here safe enough till I come
again and fetch it.

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured
them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her
along the shore, to her old harbor, where I laid her up,
and made the best of my way to my old habitation, where
I found everything safe and quiet. I began now to repose
myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my
family aliairs; and, for awhile, I lived easy enough, only '
that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked out
oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if at any time
I did stir with any freedom, it was always to the east part
of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages
never came, and where I could go without so many pre-
cautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I
always carried with me if I went the other way. I lived in
this condition near two years more; but my unlucky head,
that was always to let me know it was born to make my
body miserable, was all these two years filled with projects
and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get away
from this island; for sometimes I was for makin another
voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me t at there
was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage;
sometimes Ior a ramble one way, sometimes another; and
- I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went from

Sallee in, 1 should have ventured to sea, bound anywhere,
I knew not whither. I have been, in all my circumstances,
a memento to those who are touched with the general
plague of mankind, whence, for aught 1 know, one half
of their miseries flow; I mean that of not being satisfied
with the station wherein God and nature hath placed them;
for, not to look back u on my nrimitive condition, and the
excellent advice of my ether, the opposition to which was,
as I may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes
of the same kind had been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence which so
happily seated me at the Brazils aea planter blessed me
with confined desires, and 1 could have been contented to
have gone on gradually, I might have been, by this time,
I mean in the time of my being in this island, one of the .

most considerable planters in the Brazils; nay, I am per-
suaded that by the improvements 1 had made in that little
time I lived there, and the increase 1 should probably have
made il' I remained, 1 might have been worth a hundred
thousand nioidores. And what business had I to leave a
settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation, improving and
invreasing, to turn super-cargo to (luinea to fetch negroes,
when patience and time would have so increased our stock
at home that we could have bought them at our own door
from those whose businessit was tofetch then ; and though
l! had cost us something more, yet the dilference of that
price was by no means worth saving at so great a hazard!
lint as this is usually the fate of young heads, so reflection
upon the folly of it is as commonly the exercise of more
years, or of the dear-bought experience of time; so it was
with me now, and yet so deep had the mistake taken root
in my temper, that 1 could not satisfy myself in my sta-
tion, but was continually poring upon the means and pos-
sibility of my escape from this place. And that I may,
with the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the re-
maining part of my story, it may not be improper to give
Sumo account of my first conceptions on the subject of this
foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what
foundation I acted.

1 am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my
late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured
under water, as usual, and my condition restored to what
it was before; 1 had more wealth, indeed, than I had lm'
lore, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards
came there.

it was one of the nights in the rainy season in March,
the four-zi.ml-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this
island of solitude, I was lying in my bed or hammock,
awake; very well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no
~measiness of body, nor any uneasiness of mind, more than
ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so
:tS to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than
as follows: It is impossible to set down the innumerable
crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thor-
oughfare of the brain, the memory, in this night's time; 1
ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by
sbridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island,
and also of that part of my life since I came to this island.
In my reflections upon the state of my case since I came on
shore on this island, I was comparing the happy posture of
my affairs in the first years of my habitation: here, com-
pared to the life of anxiety, fear, and care which I had
lived in, ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the
sand; not that I did not believe the savages had frequented
the island even all the while, and might have been several
hundreds of them at times on shore there; but I had never
known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about
it; my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the
same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if
1 had never really been exposed to it. This furnished my
thoughts with many very profitable reflections, and par-
ticularly this one: How infinitely good that Providence is,
which has provided, in its government of mankind, such
narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and
though he walks in the midst of so many thousand dan-
gers, the sight of which, it discovered to him. would dis-
tract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and
calm, by having the events of things hid from his eyes,
and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him.

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me,
I came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been
in for so many years in this very island, and howl had
walked about in the greatest security, and with all possible
tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of a
hill, 9. great tree, or the casual approach of night, had
been between me and the worst kind of destruction, viz.,
that of falling into the hands of cannibals and savages,
who would have seized on me with the same view as I
would on a goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more
a crime to kill and devour me than I did 8 pi eon or cur-
lew. Iwould unjustly slander myself, if I s ould say I
was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose
singular protection I acknowledged, with great humility,
all these unknown dcliverances were due, and without
ghigh I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless

an a.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some
time taken up in considering the nature of these wretched
creatures, I mean the savages, and how it came to ass in
the world, that the wise Governor of all things should give
up any of His creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to someJ
thing so much below even brutality itself, as to devour its
own kind; but. as this ended in some (at; that. time) fruit~
less sperulations, it occurred to me to inquire what. part. of
the world these wretchcs lived in; how far 011' the coast, was
from whence they came; what; they Vt'lltlll'C-ti over so far
from homo for; what. kind of boats they had: and why I
might not. order myself and my business so, that. 1 might;
be as able to go over thither as they were to Wine l...) mu.
Inever so much as troubled myself to eoinaider what, I
should do with myself when I went. thither. what would
beeotne of me, il' l l'ell into the hands of the savages: or
how I should esuapu from them. it" they attacked me: no,-
nor so much as how it; was possible for me to reurh the,
coast, and not. be attacked by some or other of them, will -
out. any possibility of delivering mysrll': and if I should not.
fall into their hands, what I should do for provision, or
whither I should bend my course: none of these thoughts,
lsay, so mueh as came in my way; but my mind was
wholly bent; upon the notion of my passing over in my boat;
to tho main land. I looked upon my prt-sent. condition as
the most: miserable that; eould possibly be; that I Was not.
ablo to throw myself into anything, but, death, that. mold
be called worse: and it' I reached the shore of the main, I
might: perhaps moot with relief, 0r 1 might coast along, as
I did on the African shore, till I came to some inhabited
country, and Where. I might find some relief; and after :d',
perhaps,I might. [all in with some Christian ship that;
might; take me in: and if the worst value to the worst, i
could but die, whit-h would put. an end to all these miseries
at. once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed
mind, an impatient temper, made desperate. as it were, by
the 1011;: coutinuanue of my troubles, and the disappoint-
ments I had met in the. wreck I had been on board of. and
whore I had been so near obtaining what. 1 So earnestly
long-ed l'nr, \'iz._. somebody to speak to, and to l'aru some
l- i aimlge from them of the place where I was, and of the
prxdu'ule means of my deliverance. I was agitated wholly
by these thoughts: all my calm of mind, in my resignation
to Providence, and waiting the issue of tho dispositions of
Heaven, seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it were. no
power to turn my thoughts to anything but: to the project
of a voyage to the main, which came upon me with such' "' 'TgfaS'hflfqfi'fi - .293 ;'; . ,;-~:,,,--

 

nosmsox causos'. , 177

force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that it was not to
be resisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or
more, with such violence that it set my very blood into a
ferment, and my pulse beats as if I had been in a fever,
merely with the extraordinary fervor of my mind about
it, nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with
the very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One
would have thought I should have dreamed of it, but I did
not, nor of anything relating to it: but I dreamed that as
1 was going out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I
saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming
to land, and that they brought with them another savage,
whom they were going to kill, in order to eat him; when,
on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill
jumped away, and ran for his life; and I thought, in my
sleep, that he came running into my little thick grove be-
fore my fortification, to hide himself; and that I, seeing
him alone, and not perceiving that the others sought him
that way, showed myself to him, and smiling upon him,
encouraged him: that he knelt down to me, seeming to

ray me to assist him; upon which 1 showed him my lad-

er, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and
he became my servant: and. that as soon as I had got this
man, I said to myself, New I may certainly venture to the
main land; for this follow will serve me as a pilot, and will
tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and
whither not to go for fear of being devoured; whut places
to venture into, and what to shun. I waked with this
thought; and was under such inexpressible impressions of
joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that the dis-
appointments which 1 felt upon coming to myself, and
finding that it was no more than a dream, were equally ex-
travagant the other way, and threw me into a very great
dejection of spirits.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion: that my
only way to go about to attempt an escape was, if possible,
to get a savage into my possession; and, if possible, it
should be one of their prisoners whom they had condemned
to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But these
thoughts still were attended with this difficulty, that it was
impossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan
of them, and killing them all: and this was not only a very
desperate attempt, and might miscarry: but, on the other
hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to myself,
and my heart trembled at the thought of shedding so much
blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need not re-

eat the arguments which occurred to me against th.s, they

sing the same mentioned before: but though I had other
reasons to offer now, viz., that those men were enemies to
my life, and would devour me if they could; that it was
self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself
from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defense
as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the
like; I say, though these things argued for it, yet the
thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliverance were
very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means re-
concile myself to for a great while. However, at last,
after many secret disputes with myself, and after great
perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one way and
another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager pre--
vailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest;
and I resolved, if possible, to get one of those savages into
my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to con-
trivo how to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to re-
solve on: but us I could pitch upon no probable means for
it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them
when they came on share, and leave the rest to the event,
taking such measures as the opportunity should present,
let what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon
the scout as often as possible, and indeed so often that l
was heartily tired of it; for it was above a year and a half
that I waited; and for great part of that time went out to
the west end, and to the south-west corner, of the island,
almost every day. to look for canoes, but none up cared.
This was very discouraging, and began to trou le me
much, though I can not say that it did in this case (as it
had done some time before) wear oil the edge of my desire
to the thing: but the. longer it seemed to be delayed, the
mare eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first so
careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being
seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon them. Be-
sides,I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or
three savages, if 1 had them, so as to make them entirely
slaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to. nwywmyflmmwmjggfi

prevent their being able at any time to do me any hurt. It
was a great while that I pleased myself with this affair; but
nothing still presented; all my fancies and schemes came
to nothing, for no savages came near me for a great while.

 

SECTION XXII.

Robinson Rescues one of Their Captives from the Savages, Whom he
names Friday, and makes his Servant.

ABOUT a year and a half after 1 entertained these notions
(and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execu-
tion), I was surprised, one morning early, with seeing no
less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the
island, and the people who belong to them all landed,
and out of my sight. The number of them broke all my
measures; for seeing so many, and knowing that the
always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a boat,
could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my meas-
ures, to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay
still in my castle, perplexed and discom orted: however,
put myself into all the same postures for an attack that I
laid formerly provided, and was just ready for action, if
anything had presented. Having waited a good while, list-
ening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being ver
impatient. I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, an
elmnbered up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, as
usual; standing so, however, that my head did not appear
above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any
means. Here 1 observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that
they had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed.
How they had cooked it I;knew not, or what it was; but
they were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous
gestures and figures, their own way, round the fire. .

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my
perspective, two miserable wretches dragged from the
boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now
brought out for the slaughter. l perceived one of them
immediately fall, being knocked down, I suppose, with a'
club or wooden sword, for that was their way, and two or
three others were at work immediately, cutting him open
for their cookery, while the other victim was left standing
by himself, till they should be ready for him. In that very
moment, this poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty,
and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and
he started away from them, and ran with incredible swift-
ness along the sands, directly toward me, I mean toward
that part of the coast where my habitation was. I was
dreadfully frightened, I must acknowledge, when I per-
ceived him run my way, and especially when, as I thought,
I saw him pursued by the whole body: and now I expected
that art of my dream was coming to pass, and that he
would certainly take shelter in my grove; but 1 could not
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it,
viz., that the other savages would not pursue him thither,
and find him there. However, I kept m station, and my
s irits began to recover, when I found t at there was not
shove three men that followed him; and still more Was 1
encouraged when I found that he outstripped them exceed-
ingly in running, and gained ground of them, so that if he
could but hold it for half an hour, 1 saw easily he would
fairly get away from them all.

There was between them and my castle the creek, which
I mentioned often in the first part of my story, where I
landed my cargoes out of the Ship; and this I saw plainly
he must necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would
be taken there: but when the savage escaping came
thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was then
up; but plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes,
or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength
and swiftness. When the three persons came to the creek,
I found that two of them could swim, but the third could
not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the
others, but went no further, and soon after went softly
back again; which, as it happened, was very well for him
in the end. I observed, that the two who swam were yet
more than twice as long swimmin over the creek as the
fellow was that fled from them. t came now very warmly
upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was
the time to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or
assistant, and that I was called plainly by Providence to
save this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the
ladders With all possible expedition, fetched my two guns,
to: \hey were both at the foot of the ladders, as I observed:'M Kwanzaa? autumn-ma I-Ival-c 91 leuo;
above, and .getting up again, with the same haste, to the
top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and having a very
short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the way be- ,
tween the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to
him that fled, who, looking back, was at first, perhaps, as
much frightened at me as at them; but 1 beckoned with
my hand to him to come back; and, in the meantime, I
slowly advanced toward the two that followed: then rush-
ing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with
the stock of my piece. 1 was loath to fire, because I would
not have the rest hear; though, at that distance, it would
not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of the
smoke too, they would not have easily known what to
make of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other
who lpursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened,
and advanced apace toward him: but as I came nearer, I
perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fit-
ting it to shoot at me: so I was then necessitated to shoot
at him first, which 1 did. and killed him at the first shot.
The poor savage who fled but had stopped, though he saw
both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet was
so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece that he
stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went back-
ward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to
come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to
come forward, which he easily understood, and came a
little way; then stopped again, and then a little further,
and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he stood
trembling, as if he had. been taken prisoner, and had just
been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to
him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of en-
couragement that 1 could think of; and he came nearer
and nearer, kneeling dowu every ten or twelve ste s, in
token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smi ed at
him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come
still nearer: at length he came close to me; and then he
knelt down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head
upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot
upon his head: this, it seems, was in token of swearing to
be my slave forever. 1 took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was more
work to do yet; for I perceived the savage whom I knocked
down was not killed but stunned with the blow, and began
to come to himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him
the savage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke some
words to me, and though I could not understand them, yet
I thought they were pleasant to hear; for they were the
first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my own ex-
cepted, for above twenty-five ears. But there was no
time for such reflections now; t e savage who was knocked
down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the
ground, and 1 perceived that my savage began to be afraid;
but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the
man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage, for so
I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my
sword which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did.
He no sooner had it, but he ran to his enemy, and, at one
blow, cut off his head so cleverly, no executioner in Ger-
many could have done it sooner or better; which I thought
very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, never
saw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden
swords: however, it seems, as I learned afterward, they
made their wooden swords so Shari, so heavy, and the wood
was so hard, that they will cut ofi eads even with them, ay
and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had done
this, he came laughing to me, in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and with abundance of gest-
ures, which I did not understand, laid it down, with the
head of the savage that he had killed, just before me. But
that which astonished him most was to know how I killed
the other Indian so far off: so pointing to him, he made
signs to me to let him go to him; so 1 bade him go, as well
as I could. When he came to him, he stood like one
amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one side,
then on the other, looked at the wound the bullet had
made, which, it seems, was just in his breast where it had
made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed,
but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took
up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I turned to go
away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to
him that more might come after them. Upon this, he
made signs to me that he should bury them with sand,
that they mi ht not be seen by the rest, it they followed;
and so I ma 9 signs to him again to do so. He fell to
work; and, in an instant, he had scraped a hole in the
sand with his hands, big enough to bury the first in, and' '::-'47Wm'""ww' WWW'E?"'"5"""'5":"deg"""""' W-WVAfimmi~v+mica'tamcwagevm

then dragged him into it, and covered him; and did so by
the other also: I believe he had buried them both in a
quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I carried
him, not to my castle, but quite away, to my cave, on the
further part of the land: so I did not let my dream come
to pass in that part, viz., that he came into my grove for
shelter. Here 1 gave him bread and a bunch of raisins
to eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was in-
deed in great distress for, by his running; and having re-
freshed him, I made signs for him to o and lie down to
sleep, showing him a place where I ad laid some rice
straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon
myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay down, and went
to sleep.

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectl well made,
with straight, strong limbs, not too large, ta 1, and well-
shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years of age.
He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly
aspect; but seemed to have something very manly in his
face; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a .
European in his countenance too, especially when he
smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like
wool; his forehead very high and large; and a great vivac-
ity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The color of his
skin was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an
ugly yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virgin-
taus, and other natives of America are, but of a bright kind
of a dun olive color, that had in it somethin very agree-
able, though not very easy to describe. is face was
round and plump; his nose small, not flat like the Ne-
groes; a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth
well set, and as white as ivory.

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an
hour he awoke again, and came out of the cave to me, for
I had been milking my goats, which 1 had in the inclosure
just by: when he espied me, he came runnin to me, lay-
ing himself down again upon the ground, wi all the pos-
sible signs of an humble, thankful dis osition, makings.

me its long as he lived. I understood him in many things,
and let him know I was V01" well pleased with him. In a
little time i began to speak to him and teach him to speak
to mr; and, first, I let him know his name should be

night; butas soon as it was day, I beckoned to him to
some with me, and let him know 1 would give him some
i-lothos: at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark
naked. As we went by the place where he had buried the
two men. hi- pointod exartly to the place, and showed me
the marks that he had made to find them again, making
signs tome that We should dig them up again, and eat

he did ininmliatoly, with great submission. I then led him
up to the top of the hill, to see it" his enemies were gone;
and pulling out myglasal looked, and saw plainly the
plane. whore they had been, but no appearance of them or
their ('ZLHOCSI so that it was plain that they were gone, and
had left their two comrades behind them, without any
search after them.

lint I was not content with this discovery; but having
now more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took
my man Friday with mo, giving him the sword in his
hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I found
he could use wry dexmrously, making him carry one gun
for me, and I two for myself; and away we marched to the
place \\ here these creatures had been, forl had a mind new
to get some fuller intelligence of them. When I came to
the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my
lit-art sunk within me, at the horror of the spectacle: in-
deed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me,
though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered
with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, and
great pieces of flesh left here and there, half-eaten,
mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of
the triumphant feast they had been making there, after a
victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands
and the bones of three or four legs and feet, and abun-
dance of other parts of the bodies; and Friday, by his signs,
made me understand that they brought over four prisoners
to feast upon; that three of them Were eaten up, and that
he, pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had
been a great battle between them and their next king,
whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of, and that they
had taken a great number of prisoners; all which Were enr--
ried to several places by those who had taken them in the
fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done here by
these wretehes upon those they brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather up all the skulls, bones, flM'i,
and whatever remained, and lay them together in a heap,
and make a great lire upon it, and burned them all to ashes.
I found Friday had still a hankering stomach after some of
the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature; but 1 dis>>
covered so mueh abhorrence, at the very thoughts of it,
and at the least appearance of: it, that he durst not disenver
it: for 1 had, by some means, let him know that I would
kill him if he oll'ered it.

When he had done this, we came back to our castle; and
there i fi'll to work for my man Friday: and, first of all, 1
gave him a pair of linen drawers, Which I had out of the
poor gunnrr's chest. I mentioned which I found in the
wreck: and whinh, with a little alteiation, fitted him very
well, and then ] made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well
as my shill would allow (for 1 was now grown a tolerable
good tailor); and 1 gave him a cap, which 1 made of. here's
skin, very convenient and fashionable enough; and thus he
was clothed for the present, tolerably well, and was mighty
well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his
master. It is true, he went awkwardly in those clothes at ,
first: wearing the drawers was very awkward to him, and '
the sleeves of the waistcoat gelled his shoulders, and the in-
side of his arms; but after a little easing them where he
complained they hurt him, and using himself. to them, he
took to them at length very well.

The next day after 1 came home to my hutch with him,
I began to consider where I should lodge him; and that 1

15
might do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I
made a little tent for him in the vacant place between my
two fortili :ations, in the inside of the last and in the out-
side of. the first. As there was a door or entrance there
into my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a
door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, a little
within the entrance; and causing the door to open in the
inside, 1 barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders
too; so that Friday could no way come at me in the inside
of my innermost \'all, without making so muelrnoise in
getting over that it must needs wakcn me: for my first
wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles, cover-
ing all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill;
which was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead of
laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the
rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds; and at the hole or
place which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had
placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but would
have fallen down, and made a great noise: as to weapons,
I took them all into my side every night. But I needed
none of all this precaution; for never man had a more
faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me;
without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged
and engaged--his very affections were tied to me, like those
of a child to a lathe ; and I dare say, he would have sacri-
ficed his life for the saving mine upon any occasion whatso-
ever: the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out
of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no
precautions, as to my safety on his account.

This frequently gave me oc'asion to observe, and that
with wonder, that however it had pleased God, in His
providence, and in the government of the Works of His
hands, to take from so great a part of the world of His
creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the
powers of their souls are adapted, yet that He has be-
stowed upon them the same powers, the same reason, the
same allections, the same sentiments of kindness and obli-
gation, the same passions and rcsentments of wrongs, the
same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the ca-
pacities of doing good, and receiving good, that He has
given to us; and that when He pleases to offer them occa-
sions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready,Crusoe and Friday on an Expedition.
to apply them to the right uses for which they were be-
stowed, than we are. This made me very melancholy
sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented,
how mean a use we make of all these, even though we have
these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction,
the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of His word added
to our understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide
the like saving knowledge from so many millions of souls,
who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a
much better use of it than we did. lr'rom hence, I some-
times was led too far, to invade the sovereignty of Provi-
dence, and as it were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a
disposition of things, that should hide that light from
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like d uly
from both; but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts
with this conclusion: first, That we did not know by what
light and law these should be condemned: but that as God
was necessarily, and, by the nature of His being, infinitely
holy and just, so it could not be, but if these creatures
were all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on ac-
count of einning against that light, which, as the Scripture
says, was a law to themselves, and by such rules as their
consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the
foundation was not discovered to us; and, secondly, That
still, as we all are the clay in the hand of the potter, no
vessel could say to him, Why has thou formed me thus?
But to return to my new companion: I was greatly de-
lighted with him, and made it my business to teach him
everything that was proper to make him useful, handy, and
helpful; but especially to make him speak, and understand
me when I spoke: and he was the aptest scholar that ever
was; and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent,
and so pleased when he could but understand me, or make
me understand him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk
to him. Now my life began to be so easy, that I began to
say to m self, that could I but have been safe from more

savages, cared not if I was never to remove from the
place where I lived.
SECTION XXIII.

Robinson Instructs and Civilizes his Man Friday--Endeavors to
give Him an Idea of Christianity.

AFTER I had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday off from
his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of a canni--
bal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh; so I
took him out with me one morning to the woods. 1 went,
indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my own flock, and
bring it home and dress it; but as I was going, I saw a she-
goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting
by her. 1 catched hold of Friday: Hold, said I; stand
still; and made signs to him not to stir: immediately I
presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The
poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill
the savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor could imag-
ine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled and
shook, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have
sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive
I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether
he was not wounded, and, as I found presently, thought I
was resolved to kill him: for he came and knelt down
to me, and embracing my knees, said a great many things
I did not understand; but 1 could easily see the meaning
was, to pray me not to kill him. '-

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him
no harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him,
and pointing to the kid which 1 had killed, beckoned to him
to run and fetch it, which he did; and while he was won-
dering and looking to see how the creature was killed, I
loaded my gun again. By and by, I saw a great fowl, like
a hawk, sitting upon a tree, within shot; so, to let Friday
understand a little what 1 would do, I called him to me
again, pointed at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot,
though I thought it had been a hawk; I say, fointing to
the parrot, and to my gun, and to the groun under the
parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made him
understand that I would shoot and kill that bird: accord-
ingly, I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw
the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again, not-
withstanding all I had said to him; and I found he was the
more amazed, because he did not see me put anything into
the gun, but thought that there must be some wonderful
fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill
man, beast or bird, or anything near or far 03; and the
astonishment this created in him was such, as could not
wear elf for along time; and I believe, if 1 would have let
him. he would have worshiped me and my gun. As for
the gun itsell', he would not so much as touch it for several
days after; but he would speak to it, and talk to it, as if
it had answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I
afterward learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.
Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, 1
finiutud to him to run and fetch the bird 1 had shot, which

0 dial, but stayed some time; for the parrot, not being
quite dead, had fluttered away a good distance from the
place where she fell: however, he found her, took her up,
and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his igno-
rance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge
the gun again, and not to let him see .me do it, that I
might be ready for any other murk that might present;
but nothing more offered at that time: so I brought home
the kid, and the same evening 1 took the skin OE, and cut
it out as well as I could; and having a pot fit for that pur-
pose, 1 boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some
very good broth. After I had begun to eat some, 1 gave
some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it
very well: but that which was strangest to him; was to see
me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt
was nut good to eat; and putting a little into his mouth,
he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it,
washincr his mouth with fresh water after it: on the other
hand, f took some meat into my month without salt, and
I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as
he had done at the salt: but it would not do; he would never
care for salt with his meat or in his broth; at least, not for
a great while, and then but very little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was
resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of
the kid: this 1 did, by hanging it before the fire on a string,
as I had seen many people do in Reg and, setting two poles
up, one on each side of the fire. anal me news: on the top,
and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat
turn continually. This Friday admired very much: but
when he come to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to
tell me how Well he liked it, that I could not. but under-
stand him; and ot Inst he told me, as well as he could, he
Would nevur out man's flesh any more, which I was very
gin-l to hear.

The next duy 1 set him to work to beating some corn
out, and sitting it in the manner I used to do, as {observed
belore; and he soon understood how to do it as well as I,
especially other he had seen what the meaning of it was,
:ml tlutt it was to make bread of it: for after thutl let
him see me make my bread, and bake it too; and in a lit-
th.' iinm Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well
as .I could do it myself.

I began now to consider, that having two months to feed
instead of one. 1 must provide more ground for my harvest,
and plant a larger quantity of corn than I used to do: so 1
marked out a. lnrger piece of loud, and began the fence in
the some nmuuer as before, in which Friday worked not
only very willingly and very hard, but did it very cheer-
fully: and 1 told' him what it was for; that it was for corn
to make more brand, because he was now with me. and
that 1 might have enough for him and myself too. He op-
pz-umi very sensible of that part, and let me know that he
thought I had much more labor upon me on his account
thuu I had for myself; and that he would work the harder
for me, if 1 would tell him what to do.

This was the ploosimtost year of all the life I led in ll '3
plans. Friday begun to talk pretty well, and understand
the. names ot' almost everything I had occasion to call for,
and of every plane I had to send him to, and talked a great
deal to me; so that, in short, I began now to have some
use for my tongue again, which, indeed, 1 had very little
oooasiou [or before, that is to say, about speech. Besides
the pl 'usuro of talking to him, 1 had a singular satisfaction
in the fellow himself: his simple, unfelgned honesty ap-
peured to me more and more every day, and I began really
to love the creature; and, on his side, I believe he loved
me more than it was possible for him ever to love anything
before.

I had a mind once to try it he had any hankering inclin-
ation for his own country again; and having taught him
English so well that he could answer me almost any ques-

. . ._ "flf'flfi'jvg'i'M'P-'mqtjf'ew'f!
tion, I asked him whether the nation that he belonged to
never conquered in battle? At which he smiled. and said,
Yes, yes, we always light the better: that is, he meant, al-
ways get the better in fight; and so we began the following
discourse:

Master: You always fight the better? how came you to
be taken prisoner then, Friday?

Friday: My nation beat much, for all that.

Master: How heat? If your nation beat them, how
came you to be taken?

Friday: They more many than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me; my na-
tion overheat them in the yonder place, where me no was;
there my nation take one, two, great thousand.

Master: But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies, then? '

Friday: They run one, two, three. and me, and make go
in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that time.

Master: Well, Friday, and what does your nation do
with the men they take? Do they carry them away and
eat them, as these did?

Friday: Yes, my nation eat mans too; eat all up.

Master: Where do they carry them?

Friday: Go to other place, where they think.

Master: Do they come hither?

lFriday: Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else
ace.
p Master: Have you been here with them?

Friday: Yes, I have been here; (points to the north-west
side of the island, which, it seems, was their aid?

By this I understood that my man Friday ha formerly
been among the savages who used to come on shore on the
further part of the island, on the same man-eating occa-
sions he was now brought for: and some time after, when
I took the courage to carry him to that side, being the same
I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and
told me he was there once when they eat up twenty men,
two women, and one child: he could not tell twenty in
English, but be numbered them, by laying so many stones
in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what fol-
lows, that after I had this discourse with him, I asked him
how far it was from our island to the shore, and whether

Lfiflileafifima' .
the canoes were not often lost. He told me there was no
danger, no canoes ever lost; but that, after a little way out
to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way in
the morning, the other in the afternoon. This I under-
stood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out
or coming in; but I afterward understood it was occa-
sioned by the great draft and reflux of the mighty river
Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of which river, as I found
afterward, our island lay; and that this land which I per-
ceived to the west and north-west was the great island Trin-
idad, on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked
Friday a thousand questions about the country, the inhab-
itants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he
told me all he knew, with the greatest openness imagin~
able. I asked him the names of the several nations of his
sort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs:
from whence l easily understood, that these were the Car-
ibbees, which our maps place on the part of America which
reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoko to Guinea,
and onward to St. Martha. He told me that up a great
way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the
moon, which must be west from their country, there dwelt
white bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great whis-
kers, which I mentioned before; and that they had killed
much mans, that was his word: by all which I understood,
he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had
been spread over the whole country, and were remembered
by all the nations, from father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this
island and get among these white men: he told me, Yes,
yes, you may go in two canoe. I could not understand
what he meant, or make him describe to me what he meant
by two canoe; till, at last, with great difficulty, I found he
in- Jill; it must be in a large boat, as big as two canoes.
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with me very
Well; and from this time 1 entertained some hopes that,
one time or other, I might find an opportunity to make
my escape from this place, and that this poor savage might
be a means to help me.

During the long time that Friday had now been with me,
and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I
was not wanting to lay a foundation of religions knowledge
in his mind: particularly I asked him, one time, who madeFriday Terrified at. the Noise of Crusoo's Gun.
him? The poor creature did not understand me at all, but '

thought I had'nsked him who was his father; but I took it
up by another handles, and asked him who made the sea,
the ground we walked on, and the hills and woods? He
told me, it was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all;
he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he
was very old, much older, he said, than the sea or the land,
than the moon or the stars. I asked him then, if this old

arson had made all things, why did not all things worship
him? He looked very grave, and with a perfect look of

innocence said, All things say oh to him. I asked him it . '
the people who die in his'country went away anywhere? _

He said, Yes; they all went to Beuamuckee: then I asked
$111 whether these they eat up went thither too? He said,
es.

From these things I began to instruct him in the knowl-
edge of the true God: I told him that the great Maker of
all things lived up there, pointing up toward heaven; that
He governed the world by the same power and providence
by which He made it; that He was omnipotcnt, and could
do everything for us, give everything to us, take every-
thing from us; and thus, by degrees, 1 opened his eyes.
He listened with great attention, and received with pleasure
the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of

the manner of making our prayers to God, and His being '

able to hear us, even lll heaven. He told me one day, that

if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, He must needs '

be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a
little way OE, and yet could not hear till they went up to
the great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. I
asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him? He
said, No; they never went that were young men: none
went thither but the old man, whom he called their
Oowokakee; that is, as 1 made him explain it to me, their
religious, or clergy; and that they went to say oh (so he
called saying prayers), and then came back, and told them

what Benamuckee said. By this I observed that there is -

priestcratt even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans

m the world; and the policy of making a secret of religion, '

in order to preserve the veneration of the people to the
clergy, is not only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps
amen all reli ions in the world, even among the most
bruti and 1;" arous savages.
1 endeavored to clear up this fraud to my man Friday;
and told him, that the pretense of their old men going up
to the mountains to say oh to their god Benamuckee was a
cheat; and their bringing word from thence what he said
was much more so; that if they met with any answer, or
spoke with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit;
and then Ientered into a long discourse with him about
the devil, the original of him, his rebellion against God,
his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up
in the dark parts of. the world to be worshiped instead of
God, and as God, and the many strntagems he made use of
to delude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret ac-
cess to our passions and to our atl'eetions, and to adapt his
snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be our
own tempters, and run upon our destruction by our own
choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his
mind about the devil, as it was about the being of a God:
nature assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even
the necessity of a great i'irst Cause and overruling, gov-
erning Power, a secret, directing Providence, and of the
equity and justice of paying homage to Him that made us,
and the like; but there appeared nothing of this kind in
the notion of an evil spirit; of his origin, his being, his
nature, and, above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to
draw us in to do so too: and the poor creature puzzled me
once in such a manner, by a question merely natural and
. innocent, thatI scarce knew what to say to him. I had
been talking a great deal to him of the power of God, His
omnipotence, His aversion to sin, His being a consuming
fire to the workers of iniquity; how, as He had made us all,
He could destroy us and all the world in a moment; and
he listened with great seriousness to me all the while. After
this, I had been telling him how the devil was God's enemy
in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to
defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin the
kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like. Well, says
Friday, but you say God is so strong, so great; is He not
much strong, much might as the deviIP--Yes, yes, says 1.
Friday, God is stronger than the devil: God is above the
devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him down
under our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations, and
quench his fiery darts. But, says he again, if God much
stronger, much might as the devil, why God no kill the
devil, so make him no more do wicked? I was strangely
surprised at this question; and, after all, though I was
now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill
qualified for a casuist, or a solver of difficulties; and, at
first, I could not tell what to say; so 1 pretended not to
hear him, and asked him what he said; but he was too
earnest for an answar to forget his question, so that he re-
peated it in the very same broken words as above. By this.
time I had recovered myself a little, and 1 said, God wiil
at last punish him severely; he is reserved for the judg-
ment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell
with everlasting fire. This did not satisfy Friday; but he.
returns upon me, repeating my words, Reserve, at last; me
no understand; but why not kill the devil now; not kill
great ago?--You may as well ask me, said 1, why God
does not kill you and me, when we do wicked things here
that offend Him? We are preserved to repent and be par-
doned. He mused some time on this. Well, well, says
he, mighty affectionately, that well: so you, i, devil, all _
Wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all. Here I was
run down again by him to the last degree; and it was a
. testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature, though
they will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a
G Di], and of a worship or homage due to the supreme being
of God, as the consequence of our nature, yet nothing but
divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ,
and of redemption purchased for us, of 3. Mediator of the
new covenant, and of an lutercessor at the footstool of
God's throne: I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven
can form these in the soul; and that, therefore, the gospel
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of
God, and the Spirit of God, promised for the guide and
sanctifier of His people, are the absolutely necessary in-
structore of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of
God and the means of salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me
and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occa-
sron of going out: then sending him for something a good
way ofi, I seriously prayed to God that He would enable
me to instruct savingly this poor savage; assisting, by His
Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive
the light of the knowledge of God in Christ, reconciling
him to himself, and would guide me to speak so to him
from the word of God, as his conscience might be convinced,
his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came again
to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon the
subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the
world, and of the doctrine of the gospel preached from
heaven, viz., of repentance toward God, and faith in our
blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as well as 1
could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the
nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham; and how, for
that reason, the fallen angels had no share in the redemp-
tion; that He come only to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel, and the like.

1 had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all
the methods I tool: for this poor creature's instruction, and
must acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the
same principle will find, that in laying things open to him,
I really informed and instructed myself in many things
that either I did not know, or had not fully considered be-
fore, but which ocourred naturally to my mind upon search.
ing into them, for the information of this poor savage; and
1 had more alfection in my inquiry alter things upon this
occasion than ever I felt before: so that, whether this poor
wild wretch was the better for me or no, 1 had great reason
to be thankful that ever he came to me; my grief sat lighter
upon me; my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond
measure; and when I reflected, that in this solitary his
which I had been confined to, I had not only been moved
to look up to Heaven myself, and to seek the hand that had
brought me here, but was now to be made an instrument,
under Providence, to save the life, and, for ought l knew,
the soul, of a poor savage, and bring him to the true knowl-
edge of religion, and. of the Christian doctrine, that he
might know Christ Jesus, in whom is life eternal; 1 say,
when I reflected upon all these things, a secret joy ran
through every part of my soul, and l frequently rejoiced
that ever I was brought to this place, which i had so often
thought the most dreadful of all alflictions that could pos-
sibly have befallen me.

I continued in this thankful frame all the remainder of
my time; and the conversation which employed the hours
between Friday and me was such as made the three years
which we lived there together perfectly and completely
happy, it any such thing as complete happiness can be
formed in a snblunary state. This sava e was now a good
Christian, a much better than I; thong I have reason to
hope, and bless God for it, that we were ually penitent,
and comforted, restored pcnitcnts. We be here the word
of God to read, and no further off from His Spirit to in-
struct. than if we had been in England. 1 always applied
myself, in reading the Scriptures, to let him know, as well
as! could, the meaning of what 1 read; and he again, by
his serious inquiries and questionings, made me, as I said
before, a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge
than I should ever have been by my own more private read-
ing. Another thing I can not refrain from observing here
also, from experience in this retired part of my life, viz.,
how infinite and inexpressible a blelsing it is that the
knowledge of God, and of the doctrine oi salvation by
Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of God,
so easy to be received and understood, that, as the bare
reading the Scripture made me capable of understanding
enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great
work of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying hold oi!
a Saviour for life and salvation, to a stated reformation in
practice, and obedience to all God's commands, and this
without any teacher or instructor, 1 mean human; so, the
same plain instruction sufficiently served to the enlighten-
ing this savage creature, and bringing him to be such a
Christian, as l have known few equal to him in my life.

As to all the disputes, wranglin , strife, and contention,
which have happened in the worl about religion, whether
nicetics in doctrines, or schemes of church government,
they were all perfectly useless to us, and for anght 1 can
yet see, they have been so to the rest of the world. We
had the sure guide to heaven, viz., the Word of God; and
we had, blessed be God, comfortable views of the S irit of
God teaching and instructing us by His Word, lea ing us
into all truth, and making us both willing and obedient to
the'instrnctions of His Word. And 1 can not see the least
use that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points of
religion, which have made such confusions in the world,
would have been to us, if we could have obtained it. But
I must go on with the historical part 0! things, and take
every part in its order.

SECTION XXIV.

and Friday Build a Canoe to Carry Them to Friday's
-' ~Their Scheme Prevented by the Arrival of a Party of

 
 

AFTER Friday and I became more intimately acquainted,
and that he could understand almost all I said to him, and
speak pretty fluently, though in broken English, to me, I
acquainted him with my own history, or at least so much
of it as related to my coming to this place; how I had lived
here, and how long; I let him into the mystery, for such
it was to him, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him
how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was wonder-
fully delighted with, and I made him a belt with a frog
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in; and
in the frog, instead of a hanger, 1 gave him a hatchet,
which was not only as good a weapon, in some cases, but
much more useful upon other occasions.

I described to him the country of Europe, particularly
England, which I came from; how we lived, how we wor-
shiped God, how we behaved to one another, and how we
traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an
account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and
showed him, as near as I could, the place where she lay;
but she was all beaten in pieces before, and gone. 1
showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when I
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength
then: but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon sco-
ing this boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said
nothing. I asked him what it was he studied upon? At
last, says he, Me see such boat like come to place at my
nation. 1 did not understand him a good while; but at
last when I had examined further into it, I understood by
him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore
upon the country where he lived; that is, as he explained
it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I resently
imagined that some European ship must have een cast
away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose, and
drive ashore; but was so dull that I never once thought of
men making their escape from a wreck thither, much less
whence they might come; so I only inquired after a de-
scri tion of the boat.

riday described the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him when he added, with
some warmth, We save the white mans from drown. Then
1 presently asked him if there were any white mans, as he '
called them, in the boat. Yes, he said; the boat full of
white mans. I asked him how many. He told me upon
his fingers seventeen. I asked him then what became of
them. He told me, They live, they dwell at my nation.

This put new thoughts into my head, for I presently im-
agined that these might be the men belonging to the ship
that was cast away in the sight of my island, as I now called
it; and who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and
they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their
boat, and were landed upon that wild shore among the sav-
ages. Upon this, 1 inquired of him more critically what
was become of them; he assured me they lived still there;
that they had been there about four years; that the sav~
ages let them alone, and gave them victuals to live on. I
asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them, and
eat them? He said, No, they make brother with them;
that is, as I understood him, a truce; and then he added, '
They no eat mans but when make the war fight; that is to
say, they never eat any men but such as come to fight
with them, and are taken in battle. '

It was after this some considerable time that, being
upon the to of the hill, at the east side of the island, from
whence, as have said, I had, in a clear day, discovered
the main or continent of America, Friday, the weather be-
ing very serene, looks very earnestly toward the main land,
and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jam ing and dancing,
and calls out to me, for l was at some istance from him.
I asked him what was the matter. Oh, joy, sa 3 he! oh,
glad! there see my country, there my nation! observed
an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and
his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a strange
aagemess, as if he had a mind to be in his own country
again. This observation of mine put a great many thoughts
into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new
man Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt but that
it Friday could get back to his own nation sin, he would
not only forget all his religion, but all his ob 'gation to me,
and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an
account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or
two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he
might be as merry as he used to be with those of his
enemies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged
the poor honest creature very much, for which I was very
sorry afterward. However, as my jealousy increased, and
held me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and
not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was
certainly in the wrong too; the honest, grateful creature
having no thought about it, but what consisted with the
best principles, both as a religious Christian, and as a
grate nl friend, as appeared afterward to my full satisfac-
tiou.

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pnm ing him, to see if he would discover any of
the new thong its which I suspected were in him; but 1
found everything he said was so honest and so innocent,
that I could [ind nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in
spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entire! y his
own again; nor did he, in the least, perceive thatl was
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather be-
ing hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I
called to him and said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in
your own country, your own nation? Yes, he said, I be
much oh, glady, to be at my own nation. What would
you do there? said 1; would you turn wild again, eat men's
flesh again, and be a savage, as you were before? He
looked lull of concern, and shaking his head, said, No, no;
Friday tell them to live good, tell thorn to pray God, tell
them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk; no eat man
again. Why, then, said I to him, the will kill you. He
looked grave at that, and then said, '0, no; they no kill
me, they willing love learn. lie meant by this they would
be willing to learn. He added, they learned much of the
bearded mans that came in the boat. Then I asked him it
he would go back to them. He smiled at that, and told
me that he could not swim so far. I told him I would
make a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I
would go with him. 1 go! says I; why, they .will eat me,
if I come there. No, no, says he; me make they no eat
you; me make they much love you. He meant he would6811803 m rm".
tell them how I had killed his enemies and saved his lite,
and so he would make them love me. Then he told me,
as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen white
men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came on
shore there in distress. '

From this time I confess I had a mind to venture over,
and see if I could possibly join with those bearded men,
who, 1 made no doubt, were Spaniards and Portuguese;
not doubting but if 1 could, we might find some method
to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a
good company tooether, better than I could from an island
forty miles oil the shore, and alone, without help. So,
after some days, I took Friday to work again, by way of
discourse, and told him 1 would give him a boat to go back
to his own nation; and accordingly I carried him to my
frigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and hav-
ing cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in water)
I brought it out, showed it him, and we both went into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it,
and would make it go almost as swift again as I could.
So when he was in I said to him, Well, now, Friday, shall
we go to your nation? He looked very dull at my saying
so; which, it seems, was because he thought the boat too
small to go so far; I then told him 1 had a bigger; so the
next day I went to the place where the first boat lay which
I Ira-i made, but which I. could not get into the water. He
snizi that was birr enough; but then, as I had taken no care
01' it, and it her lain two or three-and-twenty years there,
the sun had split and dried it, that it was in a manner rot-
ten. Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and
would carry much enough vittle, drink, bread; that was
his way of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my de-
sign of going over with him to the continent, that I told
him we would go and make one as big as that, and he
should go home in it. He answered not one word, but
looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the
matter with him. He asked me again, Why you angry
mad with Friday? What me done? I asked him what he
meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all. No
angry? says he, repeating the words several times. Why
send Friday home away to my nation? Why, says 1, Fri-
day, did not you say you wished you were there? Yes, yes,-
says he, wish be both there; no wish Friday there, no mas-
ter there. In a word, he would not think of going there
without me. I go there, Friday! says I; what shall I do
there? Ito returned very quick upon me at this: You do
great deal much good, says he, you teach wild mans be
00d, sober, tame mans; you tell them know God, pray
god, and live new life. Alas! Friday, says I, thou knowcst
not what then sayest; I am but an ignorant man myself.
Yes, yes, says he, you teachee me good, you teaehoo them
good. No, no, Friday, says I, you shall go without me;
leave me here to live by myself, as I did before. lie
looked confused again at that word; and running to one of
the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily,
and gives it to me. What must I do with this? says I to
him. You take kill Friday, says he. What mustI kill
you for? said 1 again. He returns very quick: What you
send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday
away. This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand
in his eyes; in a word, 1 so plainly discovered the utmost
afiection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that
I told him then, and often after, that I would never send
him away from me, if he was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a set-
tled afioction to me, and that nothing should part him
from me, so 1 found all the foundation of his desire to go
to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the
people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a thing
which, as I had no notion of myself, so 1 had not the
least thought, or intention, or desire of undertaking it.
But still 1 found a strong inclination to my attempting an
escape, as above, founded on the supposition gathered from
the discourse, \'i7.., that there were seventeen bearded men
there; and therefore, without any more delay, 1 went to
work with Friday, to lind out a great tree proper to fell,
and make a large periagua, or canoe, to undertake the voy-
age. There were trees enough in the island to have built a
little fleet, not of periaguas, or canoes, but even of good
largo vessels: but the main thing I looked at was, to get
one so near the water that we might launch it when it was
made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last,
Friday )itehed upon a tree, for I found he know much
better than 1 what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can
I tell, to this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down,marxsow sensor. 208

except that it was very like the tree we call fustic, or be-
tween that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the
same color and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow
or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a boat, but 1
showed him how to cut it with tools, which, after I had
showed him how to use, he did very handily; and in about
a month's hard labor we finished it and made it very hand-
some; especially when, with our axes, which I showed him
how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true
shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost as near a
fortnight's time to get her along, as it were, inch by inch,
upon great rollers, into the water; but when she was in
she would have carried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water, and though she was so big,
it amazed me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my
man Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her
along. So I asked him if he would, and if we might vent-
me over in her. Yes, he said; we venture over in her
very well, though great blow wind. However, I had a
further design, that he knew nothing of, and that was to
make a mast and. a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and
cable. As to a must, that was easy enough to get; sol
pitrlu-<<l upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found
neztr the place, and which there were great plenty of in the
island; and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it. But as to the
sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had old sails,
or rather pieces of old sails, enough; but as I had had them
now six-and-twenty years by me, and had not been very
careful to preserve them, not imaorining that I should ever
have this kind of use for them, f did not doubt but they
Were all rotten, and, indeed, most of them were so. How-
ever, I iouud two pieces, which a}: cared pretty good, and
with these I went to work; and wit a great deal of pains,
and awkward stitching, you may be sure, for want of
needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like
what we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top,
such as usually our ship's long-boats sail with, and such as
1 best knew-how to manage, as it was such a one I had to
the boat in which 1 made my escape from Barbary, as re-
lated in the first part of my story.

I was near two months performing this last work, via,
rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for I finished them
very complete, making a small stay, and a sail, or foresail
to it, to assist, if'we should turn to windward; and, which
was more than all, 1 fixed a rudder to the stern of her to
steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I
knew the usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I
applied myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I
brought it to pass; though, considering the many dull eon-
trivauces I had for it that failed, I think it cost me almost
as much labor as making the boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach
as to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for,
though he knew very well how to paddle a canoe, he knew
nothing what belonged to a sail and a rudder, and was the
most amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again
in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibcd, and filled
this way, or that way, as the course we sailed changed; 1
say, when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and
amazed. However, with a little use, I made all these
things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, ex-
cept that, as to the compass 1 could make him understand
very little of that. On the other hand, as there was very
little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in
those parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, see-
ing the stars were always to be seen by night, and the
shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody
cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my
captivity in this place; though the three last years thatl
had this creature with me ought rather to be left out of
the account, my habitation beiuor quite of another kind
than in all the rest of the time. i kept the anniversary of
my landing here with the same thankfulness to God for
His mercies as at first; and if I had such cause of acknowl-
edgment at first, 1 had much more so now, having such
additional testimonies of the care of Providence over me,
and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for I had an invincible impression upon my
thoughts that my deliverance was at hand and that I should
not be another year in this place. I went on, however,
with my husbandry; digging, planting, and fencing, as
usual. 1 gathered and cured my grapes, and did every
necessary thing as before.
The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when
I kept more within doors than at other times. We had
stowed our own vessel as secure as we could, bringing her
up into the creek, where, as 1 said in the beginning, I
landed my rafts from the ship; and hauling her up to the
shore, at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a
little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep
enough to give her water enough to float in; and then,
when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the
end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as to
the tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain old, we laid a
great many boughs of trees, so thick, that she was as well
thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the months of
November and December, in which I designed to make my
adventrue.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought
of my design returned with the fair weather, I was prepar-
ing daily for the voyage, and the first thing 1 did was to
lay by a certain quantity of provisions, being the stores for
our voyage; and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time,
to open the dock, and launch out our boat. was busy
one morning upon something of this kind, when I called
on Friday, and bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he
could find a turtle, or tortoise, a thing which we enerally
got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as wel as the

esh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came run-
ning back, and flew over my outer wall, or fence, like one
that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on;
and before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me,
Oh, master! oh, master! oh, sorrow! oh, bad! What's
the matter, Friday? says I. Oh, onder, there, says he,
one, two, three canoe; one, two, three! By this way of
speaking, I concluded there were six; but, on inquiry, I
found it was but three. Well, Friday, says I, do not be
frightened! So I heartened him up as well as I could;
however, 1 saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared;
for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look
for him and would cut him in pieces and eat him; and the
poor fellow trembled so that l scarce knew what to do with
him. I comforted him as well as 1 could, and told him I
was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me
as well as him. But, says 1, Friday, we must resolve to
tight them. Can you fight, Friday? Me shoot, says he;
but there come many great number. No matter for that,
said I, again; our guns will fright them that we do not kill.
So I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him he
would defend me, and stand by me; and do just as I bid
him. He said, Me die when you bid die, master. So I
went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I
had been so good a husband of my rum, that I had a great
deal left. When he drank it, 1 made him take the two
fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and loaded them
with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets; then I
took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and
five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a
brace of bullets each; I hung my great sword, as usual,
naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet. When I
had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective glass, and
vent up to the side of the hill, to sce what 1 could dis-
cover; and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were
one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes;
and that their whole business seemed to he the triumphant
banquet upon these three human bodies; a barbarous hast
indeed! but nothing more than, as I had observed, was
usual with them. I observed also that they were landed,
not where they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek; where the shore was low. and where a
thick wood came almost close down to the sea. This, with
the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came
about, filled me with such indignation, that I came down
again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down to
them and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand
by me. He had now got over his fright, and his spirits be-
ing a little raised with the drum I had given him, he was
bedy cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when I
i die.

In this fit of fury, 1 took and divided the arms which I
had charged, as before, between us; I gave Friday one pis-
tol to stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder;
and I took one pistol, and tin other three guns m self;
and in this posture we marched out. I took a small ottle
of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with
more powder and bullets; and, as to orders, I charged him
to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do
anything, till 1 bid him; and in the meantime not to speak
a word. In this posture, 1 fetched a compass to my right
wmuvawusflpumemwcm.
hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get
into the wood, so that I might come within shot of them
before 1 should be discovered, which 1 had seen by my
glass it was easy to do.

While I was making this march, my former thoughts re-
turning, I began to abate my resolution; Ido not mean
that l entertained any fear of their number; for, as they
wure naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior
to them; ay, though 1 had been alone. But it occurred
to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what
necessity I was in, to go and dip my hands in blood, to
attack people who had neither done nor intended me any
wrong? Who, as to me, were innocent, and whose bar~
barons customs were their own disaster; being, in them, a
token indeed of God's having left them, with the other
nations of that part of the World, to such stupidity, and to
such inhuman courses; but did not call me to take upon
me to be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner
of "is justice; that, whenever He thought fit, He would
take the cause into His own hands, and, by national venge-
mice, punish them, as a people, for national crimes; but
that, in the meantime, it was none of my business; that, it
was true, Friday might j ustii'y it, because he was a declared
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I
could not say the same with respect to myself. These
things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the
way as 1 went, that I resolved I would only go and place
myself near them, that I might observe their barbarous
feast, and that 1 would act then as God should direct; but
that, unless something offered that was more a call to me
than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood; and, with all
possible wuriness and silence, Friday following close at my
reels, I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on
the side which was next to them, only that one corner of
the wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly
to Friday, and showing him a. great tree, which was just at
the corner of the wood, 1 bade him go to the tree, and
bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were
doing. He did so; and came immediately back to me, and
told me they might be plainly viewed there; that they were
all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of their pris-'...

oners, and that another lay bound upon the sand, a little
from them, which, he said, they would kill next, and which
fired all the very soul within me. He told me it was not
one of their nation, but one of the bearded men he had
told me of, that came to their country in the boat. I was
filled with horror at the very naming the white-bearded
man; and, going to the tree, I saw filainly, by my glass, 3.
when man, who lay upon the beac of the sea, with his
hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and
that he was a European, and had clothes on.

There was another tree and a little thicket beyond it,
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I
was, which, by going a little way about, I saw I mi ht
come at undiscovered, and that then I should be wit in
half a shot of them; so I withheld my passion, thou h I
was indeed enraged to the highest degree; and goin ack
about twenty aces, 1 got behind some bushes, whic held
all the way til I came to the other tree; and then came to
a little rising ground, which gave me a full view of them,
at the distance of about eighty yards.

I HAD now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the
dreadful wretches set upon the ground, all close-huddled
together, and had just sent the other two to butcher the
poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps, limb by limb, to
their fire; and they were stoo ing down to untie the bands
at his feet. I turned to Fri ay--Now, Friday, said 1, do
as 1 bid thee. Friday said he would. Then, Friday, says
1, do exactly as you see me do, fail in nothing. So I set
down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with the other
musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do
the like: men asking him if he was ready, he said, Yes.
Then fire at them, said I; and the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the
side that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three

more; and on my side I killed one, and wounded two.
They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation;
and all of them who were not hurt jumped upon their feet,
but did not immediately know which way to run, or which
way to look, for they knew not from whence their destruc-

tion came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me that, as I had
bid him, he might observe what I did; so, as soon as the
first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took a
the fowling-piece, and Friday did the like: he saw me coc
and present; he did the same again. Are you ready, Fri-
day? said I. Yes, says he. Let fly, then, says I, in the name
of God! And with that, I fired again among the amazed
wretches, and so did Friday; and as our ieces were now
loaded with what I called swan-shot, or sma l pistol-bullets,
we found only two drop, but so many were wounded that
they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures,
all bloody, and most of them miserably wounded, whereof
three more fell quickly after, though not quite dead.

Now, Friday, says I, laying down the discharged pieces,
and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, follow me;
which he did,with a great deal of courage; u on which I
rushed out of the wood, and showed mysel , and Frida
close at my foot. As soon as 1 perceived they saw me,
shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and
running as fast as I could, which by the way, was not very
fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly to-
ward the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the
beach, or shore, between the place where they sat and the
sea. ' The two butchers, who were just going to work with
him, had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled
in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had jumped into a
canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way. I
turned to Friday. and bade him step forward, and fire at
them; he understood me immediately, and running about
forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them, and I
thought he had killed them all, for 1 saw them all fall of a
heap into the boat, though 1 saw two of them up again
quickly: however, he killed two of them, and wounded the
third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as it
he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my
knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and
loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him
in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He answered in
Latin, Christianns; but was so weak and faint that he could
searce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket,
and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which
he did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat.
Then I asked him what countryman he was: and he said,
Espagnol; and bein a little recovered, let me know, by
all the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in
my debt for his deliverance. Signor, said I, with as mush
Spanish as 1 could make up, we will talk afterward, but
we must fight now: if you have any strength left, take this
pistol and sword, and lay about you. He took them very
thankfully; and no sooner had. he the arms in his hands,
but, as if they had put new vigor into him, he flew upon
his murderers like a fury, and had out two of them in
pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole was a
surprise to him, so the poor creatures were so much fright-
ened with the. noise of our pieces, that they fell down for
mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to at-
t-.-znpt their own escape than their flesh had to resist our
:'irt; and that was the ease of those fire that Friday shot
at in the boat; for as three of them fell with the hurts they
received, so the other two fell with the fright.

I kept my piece in my hand still without tiring, lasing
rz'iiling to keep my charge ready, because i had given the
Spaniard my pistol and sword: so 1 walled to Friday, and
' mic him rem up to the tree from whence we first tired "mi
fetch 1hr " which lay there that had been riiseha-ged,
which he (inl with great swiftness; and then gwing him my
musket. I sat down myself to load all the rest again, and
bade them come to me when they wanted. Whilel was
leading these pieces, there happened a fiet're engagement
between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at
him with one of their great wooden swords, the same-like
weapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not
prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and brave
as could be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian
3 good while, and had cut him two great wounds on his
head; but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing
in with him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was
wringing my sword out of his hand; when the Spaniard,
thou h undermost, wisely quitting the sword, drew the
piste from his girdle, shot the savage through the body,nosmsqx cat-son

and killed him on the spot, before I, who was running to
help him, could come near him.

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying
wretches, with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and
with that he dispatched those three, who, as I said before,
were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could
come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun,
I gave him one of the fowling~pieces, with which he pursued
two of the savages, and wounded them both; but, as he was
not able to run, they both got from him into the wood,
where Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but
the other was too nimble for him; and though he was
wounded, yet had plun ed himself into the sea, and swam,
with all his might, o to those two who were left in the
canoe, which three in the canoe, with one wounded, that'
we knew not whether he died or no, were all that escaped
our hands of one-and~twenty. The account of the whole
is as follows: three killed at our first shot from the tree;
two killed at the next shot; two killed by Friday in the
boat; two killed by Friday of those at first wounded; one
killed by Friday in the wood; three killed by the Spaniard;
four killed, being found dropped here and there of their
wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them; four es-
caped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead.--
Twenty-one in all.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of
gun-shot, and though Friday made two or three shots at
them, I did not find that he hit any of them. Friday
would fain have had me take one of their canoes and pursue
them; and indeed, I was very anxious about their escape,
lest carrying the news home to their people, they should
come back perhaps with two or three hundred of their
canoes, and devour us by mere multitude; so I consented
to pursue them by sea, and running to one of their canoes,
I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me; but when I was
in the canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature lie
there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the
slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what
was the matter; for he had not been able to look up over
the side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck and heels,
and had been tied so long, that he had really but little life
left in him.

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they
had bound him with, and would have hel him up; but
he could not stand or s k, but groans most iteously,
believing, it seems, etil , that he was only no ound in
order to be killed. When Friday came to him, 1 bade him
to speak to him, and tell him of his deliverance; and,

ulling out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a

ram; which, with the news of his bein delivered, revived
him, and he sat up in the boat. But w en Friday came to
hear him speak, and look in his face, it would have moved
any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, em-
braced hiui, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung; then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head; and then sun and jumped
about again, like a distracted creature. t was a good
while before I could make him speak to me, or tell me
what was the matter; but when he came a little to him-
self, he told me that it was his father.

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see
what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor
savage at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered
1mm death; nor, indeed, can ldescribe half the extrava-
gancies of his affection after this; for he went into the boat,
and out of the boat, a great many times: when he went in
to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold
his father's head close to his bosom for many minutes to-
gether, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles,
which were numbed and still with the binding, and chafed
and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving what
the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub
them with, which did them a great deal of good.

This afiair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with
the other savages, who were got now almost out of sight-
and it was happy for us that we did not, for it blew so be
within two hours after, and before they could be gota
quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all
night, and that from the north-west, which was against
them, that I, could not suppose their boat could live, or,
that they ever reached their own coast. -

But, to return to Friday; he was so busy about his
father, that I could not find it in my heart to take him of!
for some time: but atter I thought he could leave him a
little, I called him to me, and he came jumping and laugh-_

ins. and pleased to the highest egtremei then 1 asked himFriday Meets his Father.
if he had given his father any bread. He shook his heal,
and said, None; ugly dog eat all up self. I then gave him
a cake of bread, out of a little pouch whieh I carried on
purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but he would
not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my
pocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave him a
handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given
his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the
boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitehed, he ran at
such a rate; for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet that
ever I saw: I say, he ran at such a rate, that he was out
of sight, as it were, in an instant; and though I called,
and hallooed out too, after him, it was all one, away he
went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back
again, though .not so fast as he went; and as he came
nearer, 1 found his pace slacker, because he had some
thing in his hand. When he came up to me, I found that
he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pet, to bring
his father some fresh water, and that he had two more
cakes or leaves of bread; the bread he gave me, but the
water he carried to his father; however, as I was very
thirsty too, I took a little sup of it. The water revived
his father more than all the rum or spiritsl had given him,
for he was just fainting with thirst.

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know it
there was any water left: he said, Yes; and I bade him
give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of
it as his father: and I sent one of the cakes that Friday
brought to the Spaniard, too, who was indeed very weak,
and was reposing himself upon a green place under the
shade of a tree; and whose limbs were also very stitf, and
very much swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied
with. When I saw that, upon Friday's coming to him
with the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread,
and began to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of
raisins; he looked up in my face with all the tokens of
gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any
countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so
exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stand upon
his feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but was really
not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him;
so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles,

and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's.
1 observed the poor afieetionate creature, every two
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turn his
head about to see if his father was in the same place and
posture as he left him sitting: and at last he found he was
not to be seen: at which he started up, and, without speak-
ing a word, flew with that swil'tness to him, that one could
scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went: but
when he come, he only found he had lain himself down to
ease his limbs, so Friday came back to me presently; and
then 1 spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if
he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he should
carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of
him: but Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard
quite up upon his buek, and carried him away to the boat,
and set him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the
canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then, lifting
him quite in, he set himself close to his lathe ~; and pros-
ently stepping out again, he launched the boat olf
and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk,
though the wind blew pretty hard too: so he brought them
both safe into our creek, and leaving them in the boat,
'an away to fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I
spoke to him, and asked him whither he went. He told
me, Go fetch more boat: so away he. Went like the wind,
for sure never man or horse ran like him; and he had the
other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by
land: so he waited me over, and then went to help our
new guests out of the boat, which he did; but they were
neither of them able to walk, so that poor Friday knew not
what to do.

To remedy this, 1 went to work in my thought, and call-
ing to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he
came to me, I soon made a kind of. a hand-bm'row to lay
them on, and Friday and I carried them both up together
upon it between us. But when we got them to the out-
side of our wall, or fortification, we were at a worse loss
than before, for it was impossible to get them over, and 1
W18 resolved not to break it down: so I set to work again;
and Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made a very
handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above that with
boughs of trees, being in the space without our outward
fence, at id between that and the grove of young wood which
lhad planted; and here we grade them two beds of such
things as 1 had, viz. of good rice straw, with blankets laid
upon it, to lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself rich in
subjects: and it' was a merry reflection, which I fre-
quently made, how like a king I looked. First of all, the
whole country was my own mere property, so that I had an
undoubted right of dominion. Secondly, my eople were
perfectly subjected; I was absolutely lord and) law-giver;
they all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay
down their lives, it there had been occasion for it, for me.
it was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they
were of three dilIerent religions: my man Friday was a
Protestant, his father was a Pagan and a cannibal, and
the Spaniard was a Papist: however, I allowed liberty of
conscience throughout my dominiens. But this is by the
we v.

is soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners,
and given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I
began to think of making some provision for them; and
the first thing 1 did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling
goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock,
to be killed; when 1 cut elf the hinder quarter, and chop-
ping it into small pieces, 1 set Friday to work to boiling
and stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure
you, of flesh and broth, having put some barley and rice
also into the broth: and as 1 cooked it without doors, for
I made no fire within my inner wall, so I carried it all into

the new tent, and having set a table there {or them, I sat _

down, and eat my dinner also with them, and, as well as I
could, cheered them, and eneouru ed them. Friday was
my interpreter, especially to his ather, and, indeed, to
the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of
the savages pretty well.

After we had dined, or rather snpped, I ordered Friday
to lake one oi the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets
and other fire-arms, which, for the want of time, we had
left upon the place of battle: and, the next day, 1 ordered
him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which
lay open to the sun, and would presently be ofiensive. I
also ordered him to bury the horrid remains of their bar-
barous feast, which I knew were pretty much. and which 1
could not think of doing myself ; nay, I could not bear to
no there, it 1 went that way; all which he punctually per-
formed, and efiaced the very appearance of the savages
being there; so that when I went again, I could scarce
know Where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the
wood pointing to the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with
my two new subjects: and, first, I set Friday to inquire of
his father what he thought of the escape of. the savages in
that canoe, and whether we might expect a return of
them, with a power too great for us to resist. His first
opinion was, that the savages in the boat could never live
out the storm which blew that night they went elf, but
must of necessity be drowned, or driven south to those
other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured
as they were to be drowned, if they were cast away;
but. as to what they would do, if they came safe
on shore, he said he knew not; but it Was his opinion,
that they were so dreadful] frightened with the man'-
ner of their being attache , the noise, and the fire,
that he believed they would tell the Beople they were an
killed by thunder and lightning. not y the hand of man;
and that the two which appeared, viz. Friday and I, were
two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them,
and not men with weapons. This, he said, he knew: be'
cause he heard them all cry out so, in their language to one
another; for it was ixn )ossible for them to conceive that a
man could dart lire, an speak thunder, and kill at a dis-
tance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now: and
this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood since
by other hands, the savages never attempted to 0 over to
the island afterward, they were so terrified wit the ac-
counts given by those three men (for, it seems, they did es-
cape the sun), that they believed whoever went to that
enchanted island would be destroyed by fire IrOm the gods.
This, however, I knew not; and therefore was under con-
tinual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always
upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there were now
foul-of us, I would have ventured upona hundred of them,
fairly in the open field, at any time.

In a little time, however, no canoes appearing, the fear
of their coming wore oil; and I began to take my former
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration; bein
likewise assured, by Friday's father, that 1 might depend
upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if lI
would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when
I had ascrious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I
understood that there were sixteen more of his countrymen
and Portuguese, who, having been cast away, and made
their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with
the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries,
and indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars of their
voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from
the Rio de la Plata, to the Havanna, being directed to
leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides and sil-
ver. and to bring back what European goods they could
meet with there; that they had five Portuguese senman on
board, whom they took out of another wreck; that live of
their awn men were drowned, when first the ship was lost,
and that these escaped through infinite dangers and hun-
ards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast,
where they expected to have been devoured every moment.
He told me they had some arms with them, but they were
perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder nor ball,
the washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder, but a
little, which they used at their first landing, to provide
themselves some food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them
there, and it they had formed no design of making any
escape. He said they had many consultations about it;
but that having neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor
provisions 0E any kind, their councils always ended in
tears anal despair. I asked him how he thought they
Would receive a proposal from me, which might tend to-
ward an escape; and whether if they were all here, it
might not be done. I told him with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if 1 put my
life in their hands, for that gratitude was no inherent virt~
ue in the nature of man, nor did men always SQuare their
dealings by the obligations they had received, so much as
they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it
would be very hard that". I should be the instrument of
their deliverance, and that they should afterward make
me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman
was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity or what
accident soever brought him thither;_ and that I had rather
be delivered up to the savages, to be devoured alive, than
to fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be car-
ried into the Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was

remanded, if they were all here, we might, with so many
hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away,
either to the Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or the
Spanish coast, northward; but that if, in requittal, tuey
should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry
me by force among their own people, I might be ill used
for my kindness to them, and make my case worse that it
was before.

He answered with a great deal of candor and ingenuous.
ness, that their condition was so miserable, and they were
so sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the
thought of using any man unkindly that should contribute
to their deliverance; and that, if 1 pleased, he would go to
them with the old man, and discourse with them about it,
and return again, and bring me their answer; that he would
make conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that
they should be absolutely under my leading, as their com-
mander and captain; and that they should swear, upon the
holy saeraments and gospel, to be true to me, and go to
sneh Christian country as that I should agree to, and no
other, and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders,
till they were landed safely in such country as I intend-
ed; and that he would bring a coutraet from them, under
their hands, for that purpose. Then he told me that he
would first swear to me. himself, that he would never stir
from me as long as he lived, till I gave him orders; and
that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood,
if there should happen the least breach of faith among his
countrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil,
honest men, and they were under the greatest distress im-
aginable. having,r neither weapons, nor clothes, nor any food,
but at the mercy and discretion of the savages; out of all
hopes of ever returning to their own eountr '; and that he
was sure, if 1 would undertake their relief, they would live
and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve
them, if possible, and to send the old savage and this Span-
iard over to them to treat. But when we had got all things
in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started an objec-
tion, whieh had so much prudence in it, on one hand, and
so much sincerity, on the other hand, that I could not but
be very well satisfied in it, and, by his advice, put 03 the
deliverance of his comrades for at least half a year. The
case was thus: He had been with us now about a month,
during which time I had let him see in what manner I had
provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my sup ort;
and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice 1p had
laid up; which, though it was more than sufficient for my--
self, yet it was not sufficient, without good husbandry, for
my family, now it was increased to four; but much less
would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he
said, sixteen, still alive, should come over; and least of all
would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should
build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of
America; so he told me he thought it would be more ad-
visable to let him and the other two dig and cultivate some
more land, as much as 1 could spare seed to sow, and that
we should wait another harvest, that we might have a sup-
ply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come;
for want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or
not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of
one difficulty into another. You know, says he, the chil-
dren of Israel, though they rejoiced at first for their being
delivered out of Egy . t, yet rebelled even against God
himself, that delivered) them, when they came to want
bread in the wilderness.

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good
that I could not but be very well pleased with his proposal,
as well as 1 was satisfied with his fidelity; so we fell to dig
ging all four of us, as well as the wooden tools we were
furnished with permitted; and in about a month's time, by
the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much land
cured and trimmed up as we sowed two-and-twcnty bushels
of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice; which was, in short,
all the seed we had to spare; nor, indeed, did we leave our'
selves barley sufficient for our own food, for the six months
that we had to expect our crop; that is to say, reckoning
from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is
not to be supposed it is six months in the ground in that
country.

Having now society enough, and our number being suffi-
cient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come,
unless their number had been very great, we went freely
all over the island, whenever we found occasion; and as
here we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts,' up ~-;- .;~ u N'flyfljyygpwf

it was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it
out of mine. For this purpose 1 marked out several trees
which I thought fit for our work, and 1 set Friday and his
father to cutting them down; and then I caused the Span-
iard, to whom I imported my thought on that affair, to
oversee and direct their work, 1 showed them with what
indefatigable pains I had bowed a large tree into single
planks, and 1 caused them to do the like, till they had
nunlu about adozen large planks of good oak, near two
feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to
four inches think; what prodigious labor it took up, any
one may imagine.

At the same tune, I contrived to increase my little flock
of inmo- goats as much as 1 could; and, for this purpose, I
unric Friday and the. Spaniard go out one day, and myself
with Friday the next day (for we took our turns), and by
this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up
with the rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the
kids, and added them to our flock. But, above all, the
eve-zen for curing the grapes coming on, 1 caused such a
prwligious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I be-
i-.~ru, hurl We been at Alicant, where the raisnis of the sun
:ch mired, we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and
those. with our bread, was a great part of our food, and
mu Very good living, too, I assure you, for it is exceeding-
l)" nourishing.

It was now inn-rest, and our crop in good order; it was
nm. the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island,
hut, however, it \vns enough to answer our end; for from
tn~onty~two bushels of barley we brought in and threshed
out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like
in proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our
food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards
had been on shore with me; or if we had been ready for a
voynge, it would very plentifully have vietusled our ship

0 have carried us to any part of the world, that is to say,
any part of America. When we had thus housed and
secured our magazine of corn, we tell to work to make
more wicker-ware, viz.., great baskets in which we kept it;
and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this
part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things
for defense of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.

I expected, 1 gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the
main, to see what he could do with those he had left behind
him there. I gave him astrict charge not to bring any
man with him who would not first swear, in the presence
of himself and the old savage, that he Would no way in-
jure, fight with, or attack the person he should find in the
island, who was so kind as to send for them to effect
their deliverance; but that they would stand by him, and
defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they
went, would be entirely under and subjected to his com-
mand; and that this should be put in writing, and signed
with their hands. How they were to have done this, when
I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question which
we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard
and the old savage, the father of Friday, went away in one
of the canoes which they might be said to come in, or
rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be
devoured by the savages. I gave each of them a musket,
with a flrelock on it, and about eight charges of powder
and ball, chargin them to be very good husbands of both,
and not to use eit er of them but upon urgent occasions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used
by me, in view of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven
years and some days. 1 gave them provisions of bread,
and of dried grapes, sufficlent for themselves for many
days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight
days' time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them
go; agreeing with them about a signal they should hang
out at their return, by which I should know them again,
when they came back, at a distance, before they came on
shore. They went away with a fair gale, on the day that
the moon was at full, by my account in the mouth of Octo-
ber; but as for an exact reckoning of days, after I had
once lost it, I could never recover it again, nor had I kept
even the number of years so punctually as to be sure I was
right; though, as it roved, when I afterward examined
my account, I found had kept a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I had waited for them",
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened, of
which the like has not perhaps been heard of in history. I
was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man
Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, Master,
master, they are come, they are comet I jumped up,

18
and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as I could
get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the
way, was by this time grown to be a ver y thick wood; I
say, regardless of danger, I went without my arms, which
it was not my custom to do; but I was surprised when,
turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a bout about a
league and a half distant, standing in for the shore, with a
shoulder-ol-mutton soil, as they call it, and the wind blow-
ing pretty fair to bring them in; also I observed presently
that they did not come from that side whieh the shore lay
on, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon
this, I called Friday in, and bado him lie close, for these
were not the people we looked for, and that we might not
know yet whether they were friends or enemies. in the
next place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass, to see
what 1 could make of them; and having taken the adder
out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do
when 1 was apprehensive of anything, and to take my View
the pluiner without being discovered. I had scarce set my
foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly discovered a ship
lying at anchor. at about two leagues and a half dis-
tant from me, S.S.E., but not above alcague and a. half
from the shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly to
he an English ship, and the boat appeared to be en fin-
glish long-bout.

I can not express the confusion I was in; though the joy
of seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was
manned by my own countrymen, and, consequently, friends,
was such as I can not describe; but yet .1 had some secret
doubts hang about me--I can not tell from whence they
came. biliiling me keep upon mygnard. In the first place.
it occurred to me to consider what business an English ship
could have in that part of the world, since it was not the
way to or 1' rom any part of the world where the English
had any trailie; and I knew there had been no storms to
drive them in lhere, as in distress; and that it' they were
really English, it was most probable that they were here
upon no good design; and that I had better continue as I
was, than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise. the secret hints and notices of dan--
ger which sometimes are given him when he may think
there is no possibility of its being real. That such hints
and notices are given us. I believe few that have made any
observations of things can deny; that they are certain dis-
coveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we
can not doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to
warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they are
from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or interior
and subordinate, is not the question), and that they are
given for our gpod?
The present question abundantly confirms me in the
'ustice of this reasoning; for bad I not been made cautious
y this secret admonition, come it from whence it will, I
had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse condition
than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept my-
self long in this posture, but I saw the boat draw near the
shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the
convenience of landing; however, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I
formerly landed my rai ts, but run their boat on shore upon
the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very
happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just
at my door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me
out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they were
Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought
were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all
eleven men, whereof three of them I found were unarmed,
and, as I thought, bound; and when the first four or fire
of them were jumped on shore, they took those three out
of the boat, as prisoners; one of the three I could erceive
using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, a' iction,
and despair, even to a kind of extravagance; the other
two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, and
appeared concerned, indeed, but not to such a degree as
the first. I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and
knew not what the meaning of it shoald be. Friday called
out to me in English, as well as he could, 0h, master! you
see En lish mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans.
Why, 'riduy, says I, do you think they are going to eat
them then? Yes, says Friday, they will eat them. No,
no, as s ,1, Friday; I am afraid they will murder them, in-
deed, at you may be sure they will not eat them.
All this while I had no thought of what the matter really
was, but stood tremblin with the horror of the sight, ex-
pecting every moment w on the three prisoners should be
killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm
with a great. outlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to
strike one of the poor men: and I expected to see him fall
every moment; at which all the blood in my body seemed
to run chill in my veins. I wished heartily now for my
Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him, or that
I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of
them, that I might have rescued the three men, for 1 saw
no lire-arms they had union them: but it fell out to my
mind another way. After I had observed the outrageous
usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed
the fellows run scattering about the island, as if they
wanted to see the country. I observed that the three other
men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat
down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked
like nn-n in despair. This put- me in mind of the first time
when I came on shore, and began to look about me: how
1 gave iiiyselt orer for lost; how wildly I looked around me;
what dreadful apprehension" had, and how 1 lodged in the
true all night, for learoi' beingdevoured by wild beasts. AsI
knew nothing that night. of the. supply I was to receive by
the. provident-int d airing of the ship nearer the land by the
storms and tide, by which 1 have since been so long nour-
ished ant. supported; so these three poor, desolate men
know nothing how uncertain of deliverance and supiily
they were, how near it was to them, and how efl'ectua ly
and really they were in a. condition of safety, at the same
time that they thought themselves lost, and their case des-
perate. So little do we see before us in the world, and so
much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great
Maker of the. world, that He does not leave His creatures
so absolutely destitute, but that, in the worst circum-
stances, they have always something to be thankful for,
and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they im-
agine, nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the
means by which they seem to be brought to destruction.

 

SECTION XXVI.

Robinson Discovers Himself to the English Captain--Assists him
in Reducing his Mutinous Crew--Who Submit to Him.

IT was just at the top of high water when these people
came on shore; and partly while they rambled about to see
what kind of a slace they were in, they had carelessly
stayed till the ti e was spent, and the water was ebbed
considerably away, leaving their boat aground. They had
left two men in the boat, who, as I found afterward, hav-
ing drunk a little too much brandy, fell asleep; however,
one of them waking a. littie sooner than the other, and
finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hal-
looed out for the rest, who were straggling about; upon
which they all soon came to the boat; but it was past all
their strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft, oozy sand, almost
like a quicksand. In this condition, like true seamen, who
are perhaps the least of all mankind given to forethought,
they gave it over, and away they strolled about the country
again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, call-
ing them Oh from the boat, Why, let her alone, Jack,
can't you? she'll float next tide; by which I was fully con~
firmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were.
All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to
stir out of my castle, any further than to my place of ob-
servation, near the top of the hill; and very glad I was to
think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than
ten hours before the boat could float again, and by that
time it would be dark, and 1 might be at more liberty to
see their motions, and to hear their discourse, if they had
an . In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as-
be ore, though with more caution, knowing I had to do
with another kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered
Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman
with his gun, to load himself with arms. I took myself
two fowling- ieces, and 1 gave him three muskets. My
figure, indee , was very fierce; 1 had my formidable goat-
skin coat on, with the great cap 1 have mentioned, a naked
sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon
each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the
heat of the day, Ifound that, in short, they were all gone
stragglin into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to
sleep. he three poor distressed men, too anxious for
their condition to get any sleep, were, however, sat down
under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a

mile from 11818, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of
the rest. Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition; immediately 1
marched in the figure as above, my man Friday at a good
distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I, but
not; making quite so staring a specter-like figure as I did.
1 came as near them undiscovered as 1 could, and then, be-
fOi-e any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish,
What are ye, gentlemen? They started up at the noise;
but were ten times more confounded when they saw me,
and the uncouth figure that I made. They made no an-
swer at all, but I thought 1 perceived them just going to
fly from me, when 1 spoke to them in English. Gentle-
men, said I, do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may
have a friend near, when you did not expect it. He must
be sent directly from Heaven, then, said one of them very
gravely to me, and pulling off his but at the some time to
me, for our condition is past the help of man. All help is
from Heaven, sir, said I. But can you put a stranger in
the way how to help you? for you seem to be in some
great distress. I saw you when you landed, and when you
seemed to make snpplieation to the brutes that came with
you. I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you.

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and
trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, Am I
talking to God or man? Is it a real man or an angel? Be
in no fear about that, sir, said I; it God had sent an angel
to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and
armed after another manner than you see me; pray lay
aside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and dis-
posed to assist you; you see I have one servant only; we
have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we serve
you? What is your case? Our case, said he, sir, is too
long to tell you while our murderers are so near us; but,
in short, sir, I was commander of that ship, my men have
mutinied against me; the have been hardly prevailed on
not to murder me, and at set have set me on shore in this
desolate place, with these two men with me, one my mate,
the other :1 passenger, where we ex ected to perish, believ-
ing the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to
think of it. Where are these brutes, your enemies? said
I. Do you know where they are gone? There they lie,
sir, said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; my heart trem-
bles for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak; it
they have, they will certainly murder us all. Have they
any firevarms? said I. He answered they had only two
pieces, one of which they left in the boat. Well, then,
said 1, leave the rest to me; I see they are all asleep, it is
an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take
them prisonersfi He told me there were two desperate vil-
lains among them that it was scarce safe to show any
mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest
would return to their duty. I asked him which they were.
He told me he could not at that distance distinguish them,
but he would obey my orders in anything 1 would direct.
Well, says I, let us retreat out of their view or hearing,
lest they awake, and we will resolve further. So they
willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us
from them.

Look you, sir, said I, if I venture upon your deliver--
unce, are you willing to make two conditions with me? He
anticipated my proposals, by telling me, that both he and
the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and com-
manded by me in everything; and, if the ship was not re-
covered, he would live and die with me in what part of the
world secret I would send him; and the two other men
said the some. Well, says 1, my conditions are but two;
first, that while you stay in this island with me you will
not pretend to any authority here, and if I put arms in
your lmnds, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to
me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island;
and, in the meantime, be governed by my orders; second-
ly, that if the ship is, or may be recovered, you will carry
me and my man to England passage free.

He gave me all thc assurances that the invention or faith
of man could devise, that he would comply with these
most reasonable demands; and, besides, would owe his life
to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions, as long as he
lived. Well, then, said I, here are three muskcts for you,
with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is

roper to be done. He showed me all the testimonies of

is gratitude that he was able, but ottered to be wholly
guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing
anything; but the best method 1 could think of was to fire
upon them at once, as they lay, and if any was not killed
at the first volley, and cheered to submit, we might save
them, and so put it wholly upon God's Providence to direct
the shot. He said very modestly that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those two were incor-
rigible villains and had been the authors of all the mutiny
in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still;
for they would go on board and bring the whole ship's
jcompany, and destroy us all. Well, then, says I, necessity
'legitiniates my advice, for it is the only way to save our
lives. llmvevor, seeing him still cautious of shedding
blood, 1 told him they should go themselves and manage
as they found convenient.

1n the middle of this discourse we heard some of them
awake, and soon at tor we saw two of them on their feet. I
asked him if either of them were the heads of the mutiny?
He. said no. Well, then, said I, you may let them escape;
and Providence seems to have awakened them on purpose
to save themselves. Now, says I, if the rest escape you,
it is your fault. Animated with this, he took the musket
I had given him in his hand, a pistol in his belt, and his
two cmni'alles with him, with each a piece in his hand; the
two men who were with him going first, made some noise,
at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about,
and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was
too late then, for the moment he cried out they fired; 1
mean the. two men, the captain wisely reserving his own
piece. They had so well aimed their shot at the men they
knew. that one of them was killed on the spot, and the
other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started
up on his feet, and called eagerly for help to the others;
but the captain stepping to him, told him it was too late to
cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his vil-
lainy; and with that word knocked him down with the
sleek of his musket. so that he never spoke more; there
Were three more in the company, and one of them was also
slightly wounded. liy this time I was come; and when
they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist,
they begged for mercy. The captain told them he would
spare their lives, it they would give him any assurance of
their abhorrenee of the treachery they had been guilty of,
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the
ship, and afterward in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came. They gave him all the protestations
of their sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing
to believe them. and Spare their lives, which 1 was not
against, only that 1 obliged him to keep them bound hand
and foot while they were on the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring
away the ears and sails, which they did; and by and b
three straggling men, that Were, happily for them, arted
from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fire , and
seeing the captain, who before was their prisoner, now their
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also; and so our
victory was complete.

It now remained that the ca tain and I should inquire
into each other's circumstances. I began first, and told him
my whole history, which he heard with an attention even
to amazement; and particularly at the wonderful manner
of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition;
and, indeed, as my story is a whole collecti'n of wonders,
it affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence
upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved
there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his
face, and he could not speak a word more. After this
communication was at an end I carried him and his two
men into my apartment, leading them in just where I
came out, via, at the top of the house, where I refreshed
them with such provisions as 1 had, and showed them all
the eontrivances I had made during my long, long in-
habiiing that place.

All 1 showud them, all I said to them, was perfectly
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my fortifica-
tion, and how perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a
grove of trees, which, having been new planted near twenty
years, and the trees growing much faster than in England,
was become a little wood, and so thick, that it was im~
passable in any part of it, but at that one side where 1 had.'
reserved my little winding passage into it. I told him this
was my castle and my resrdence, but that I had a seat in
the country, as most princes have, whither 1 could retreat
upon occasion, and I would show him that too another
time; but at present Our business was to consider how to
recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that; but told
me he was perfectly at a less what measures to take, for
that there were still six-and-twenty hands on board, who
having entered into a cursed conspiracy, b which they had
all torteited their lives to the law, would 8 hardened in it
.now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that,
if they were subdued, they would be brought to the gel-
lows, as soon as they came to England, or to any of the
English colonies; and that, therefore, there would be no
attacking them with so small a. number as we were.

I mused for some time upon. what hehud said, and found
at was every 'ationul conclusion, and that, therefore, some-
thing was to be resolved on speedily, as well to draw the
men on board into some snure fo. their surprise, as to pre-
vent their landing upon us, and d astroymg us. Upon this
it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship's
crew, wondering what was become of their comrades, and
of the bout, would certainly come on shore in their other
boat, to look for them; and that th 11, perhaps, they might
come armed, and he too strong for us; this he allowed to
be rational. [pen this I told him the first thing we had
to do was to store the heat, which lay upon the beach, so
that they might not carry her 011'; and taking everything
out (f her, leave her so for useless as not to be fit to swim;
aneordingly we went on board, took the arms which were
left on board out of her, and whatever else we found there,
which was a bottle ot' brandy, and another of rum, a few
biscuit-calms, a horn of powder, and a. great lump of sugar
in a piece of canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds); all
which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and
sugar, of which I had none left for many years.

When we haul curried all these things on shore (the ears,
must, sail and rudder of the boat were carried away be-
fore, as above), we knocked it great hole in her bottom,
that if they had come strong enough to . raster us, yet they
could not carry oil the bout. Indeed, it was not much in
my thoughts that we could be able to recover th* ship; but
my View was, that if they went away without the boat, I
did not much question to make her lit again to carry us to
the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the Span-
iards in my way; for 1 had them still in my thoughts.

\\ hile we were thus preparing our designs, and had first,
by main strength, heaved the bout upon the beach so high
that the tide would not (lost her oti' at high-water mark,
and besides, had broke a. hole in her bottom too big to be
quickly stopped, and were set down musing what we should
do, we heard the ship fire a. gun, and saw her make a waft
with her ensign as a. signal for the boat to come on board;
but no boat stirred; and they fired several times, making
other signals for the boat. At last, when all their signals
and firing proved fruitless. and they found the boat did
not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glass, hoist an-
other boat out, and row toward the shore; and we found,
as they approached, that there were no less than ten men
in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we
had a full view of them as they came, and a plain sight
even of their faces; because the tide having set them a lit-
tle to the east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore,
to come to the same place where the other had landed, and
where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full view
of them, and the captain knew the persons and characters
of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there were
three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into
this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and fright-
ened; but that as for the boatswain, who, it seems, was the
chief ofiicer among them, and all the rest, they were as
outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were no doubt
made desperate in their new enterprise; and terribly ap-
prehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us.

smiled at him, and told him that men in our circum-
stances were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost
every condition that could be was better than that which
we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the
consequence, whether death or life, would be sure to be a
deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the circum-
stances 01 my life, and whether a deliverance were not
worth venturing for? And where, sir, said I, is your be- '
lief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life,
'which elevated you a little while ago; for my part, said I,
there seems to me but one thing amiss in all the prospect
of it. What is that? says he. Why, says I, it is, that as
you say there are three or four honest fellows among them,
which should be spared, had they been all of the wicked

art of the crew, I should have thought God's providence
Ead singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for,
depend open it, every man that comes ashore is our own,
and shall die or live as they behave to us. As I s oke this
with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, found it
greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our busi-
11688-
We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's comin
from the ship, considered of separating our risoners; an
we had, indeed, secured them etlectually. l'wo of them,
of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent
with Friday, and one of the three delivered men, to my
cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger
of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of
the woods if they could have delivered themselves: here
they left them bound, but gave them provisions; and prom-
ised them it they continued there quietly, to give them their
liberty in a day or two: but that if they attempted their
escape, they should be put to death without mercy. They
promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience,
and were very thankful that they had such good usage as
to have provisions and light left them; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their comllort; and
they did not know but that he stood sentinel over'them at
the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage: two of them were
kept pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not free to
trust them; but the other two were taken into my service,
upon the captain's recommendation, and upon their
solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them
and the three honest men we were seven men well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough
with the ten that were coming, considering that the cap-
tain had said that there were three or four honest men
among them also. As soon as they got to the place where
their other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and
came on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which 1
was glad to see; for I was afraid they would rather have
left the boat at anchor, some distance from the shore,
with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should not
be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing
they did, they an all to their other heat; and it was easy
to see they were under a great surprise to find her strip.

ed, as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in
net bottom. After they had mused awhile upon this, they
set up two or three great shouts, hallooiug with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions bear;
but all was to no purpose: then they came all close in a
ring. and fired a volley of their small arms, which. indeed,
we heard, and the echoes made the wood: ring; but it was' aosmson mm} 238

all one: these in the cave we were sure could not hear; and
those in our keeping, though they heard it well enough,
et duret ive no answer to them. They were so aston-
ished at t e surprise of this, that, as they told us after-
ward, they resolved to go all on board again to their ship,
and let them know that the men were all murdered, and
the long-boat staved; accordingly, they immediately
launched their boat again, and got all of ther m board.

The captain was terribly amazed and evr . confounded
at this, believing they would go on board the ship again,
and set sail, giving their comrades over for lost, and so he
should still lose the ship, which he was in heroes we should
have recovered; but he was quickly as much frightened the
other way.

They had not been long put off with the boat, but we
perceived them all coming on shore again; but with this
new measure in. their conduct, which it seems they con-
sulted together upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat,
and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to
look for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to
us, for now we were at a less what to do; as our seizin
these seven men on shore would be no advantage to us, '
we let the boat escape; because they would then row away
to the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to
weigh and set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be
lost. However, we 113.31 no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue at things might present. The seven men
came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put
her off to a good distance from the shore, and came to an
anchor to wait ior them; so that it was impossible for us
to come at them in the boat. Those that came on shore
kept close together, marching toward the top of. the little
hill under which my habitation lay; and we could see them
plainly, though they could not perceive us. We could have

eon very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that
we might have fired at them, or that they would have gone
further off, that we might have come abroad. But when
they were come to the brow of the hill, where they could
see a great way into the valleys and woods, which lay toward
the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest, they
shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring,
it seems, to venture far from the Shore, nor far from each
other, they sat down together under a tree, to consider 0!
it. Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as
the other part of them had done, they had done the job for
us; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger to
venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what the
danger was they had to fear neither.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this
consultation of theirs, viz., that perhaps they would all
fire a volley "gain, to endeavor to make their fellows hear,
and that we -.' ould all sally upon them, just at the juncture
when their pieces were all discharged, and they would cer-
tninly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.
I liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were
near enough to come u to them before they could lead
their pieces again. But t iis even did not happen; and we
lay still a long time, very irresolute what course to take.
At length I told them there would be nothing done, in my
opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the
bout, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and
the shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in
the boat to get them on shore. We waited a great while,
though very impatient for their removing; and were very
uneasy, when, after long consultations, we saw them all
start up, and march down toward the sea: it seems they
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger
of the place, that they resolved to go on board' the ship
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on
with their intended voyage with the shi .

As soon asI perceived them go towar the shore, I imag-
ined it to be, as it really was, that they had given over their
search, and were for goin back again; and the captain, as
soon as I told him my t ioughts, was ready to sink at the
apprehensions of it: but I presently thought of a strata em
to fetch them back again, and which answered my on to
a tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to 0
over the little creek westward, toward the place where t e
savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and as
soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about half a
mile distance, 1 bade them halloo out, as loud as they could,
and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as
soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they
should return it again; and then keeping out of si ht, take
a round, always answering when t e others ooed, to
draw them as far into the island, and among the woods. AI
possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such ways
as I directed them.

The! were just going into the boat when Friday and the
mate hallooed: and they presently heard them, and answer-
ing, ran along the shore westward, toward the voiee they
heard, when they were presently sto ped by the creek,
where the water being up,--they coul not get over, and
called for the boat to come up and set them over; as, in--
deed, I expected. When they had set themselves over, I
observed that the bout being gone a good way into the
creek, and, as it were, in a harbor within the land, they
took one of the three men out of her, to go along with
them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her
to the stump of a little tree on the shore. 'his was what
I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday and the cap-
tain's mate to their business, 1 took the rest with me, and
crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two
men before they were aware; one of them lying on the
shore, and the other being in the boat. The fellow on
shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to start
up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and
knocked him down; and then called out to him in the boat
to yield, or he was a dead man. There needed very few
arguments to persuade a. single man to yield, when he saw
five men upon him, and his comrade knocked down; he-
sides, this was, it seems, one of the three who were not so
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore
Was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterward to .
join very sincerely with us. In the meantime, Friday and
the captain's mate so well managed their business with the
rest, that they drew them, by hullooing and answering, from
one hill to another, and from one wood to another, till they
not only heartily tired them, but left them where they were
very sure they could not reach back to the boat before it
was dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves
also. by the time they came back to us. -

We had nothing new to do but to watch for them in the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them. It was several hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could hear the
foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling
to those behind to come along; and could also hear them
answer. and complain how lame and tired they were, and
not able to come any faster, which was_very welcome new:
to us. At length they came up to the boat: but it is im-

ossible to express their confusion when they found'the boat
ast aground in the creek, the tide ebbcd out, and their two
men gone. We could hear them call to one another in a
most lamentable manner, telling one another they were got
into an enchanted island: that either there were inhabitants
in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there were
devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away
and devoured. They hallooed again, and called their two
comrades by their names a great many times; but no an-
swer. After some time, we could see them, by the little
light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men
in despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down
in the boat, to rest themselves; then come ashore again, and
walk about again, and do the same thin over again. My
men would lain have had me give them, cave to fall upon
them at once in the dark; but I was Willing to take them
at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of
them as I could; and especrally I was unwilling to hazard
the killing of any of our men, knowing the others were
very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see it they did not
separate; and, therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my
ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to
creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground as
they could, that they might not be discovered, and get as
near them as they could possibly, before they otfered to
fire.

They had not been long in that posture, when the boat-
swaiu, who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and
had now shown himself the most dejected and dispirited of
all the rest, came walking toward them, with two more of
the crew: the captain was so eager at having this principal
rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have
patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for
they only heard his tongue before: but when they came
nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet,
let fly at them. The boatswaiu was killed upon the spot;
the next man was shot in the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after; and the
third ran for it. At the noise of the fire, 1 immediately
advanced with my whole army, which was now eight men,
"2., myself, generahssimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general;
the ca tain and his two men, and the three prisoners of
war, W cm we had trusted with arms. We came upon
them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our
number; and 1 made the man they had left in the boat,
who was now one of us, to call them by name, to try it I
could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce
them to terms; which fell out just as we desired: for, in-
deed, it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they
would be willing to oapitulate. So he calls out, as loud as
he could, to one of them, Tom Smith! Tom Smith! Tom
Smith answered immediately, Is that Robinson? For it
seems he knew the voice. The other answered, Ay, ay;
for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and
yield, or you are all dead men this moment. Who must
we yield to? Where are they? says Smith again. Here
they are, says he; here's our captain and fifty men with
him, have been hunting you these two hours: the boat-
swain is killed, Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner;
and if you do not yield, you are all lost. Will they give
us quarter then? says Tom Smith, and we will yield. I
will go ask, il': you promise to yield, says Robinson: so he
asked the captain; and the captain himself then calls out,
You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down your
arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives,
all but Will Atkins.

SECTION XXVII.

Atkins Entreats the Captain to Spare his Life--The Latter Recovers
his Vessel from the Mutineexs.--And Robinson Leaves the Island.

UPON this Will Atkins cried out, For God's sake, cap-
tain, give me quarter; what have I done? They have all
been as bad as I: which, by the way, was not true neither:
for, it seems, this Will Atkins was the first man that laid
hold of the captain when they first mutinied, and used him
barbariously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious
language. However, the captain told him he must Ia
down his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor s
mercy: by which he meant me, for they all called me gov-
ernor. In a word, the all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and sent the man that had parleyed
with them, and two more, who bound them all; and then

19
my great army of fifty men, which particularly with those
three were in all but eight, came up( and seized u n them,
and upon their boat; only that kept myse .and one .
more out of sight for reasons of . state. '-

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seiz-
ing the shi : and as for the captain, now he had leisure to
parloy wit them, he expostulated with them upon the
Villainy of their practices with him, and at'length upon the
further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it _
must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and .
perhaps to the gallows. They all up red very penitent,
and begged bar for their lives. As or that, he told them
they were none of his prisoners, but the commander's of
the island; that they thought they had set him on shore on
a barren, uninhabited island; but it had leased God so to
direct them, that it was inhabited, and t at thegoveruor
was an Englishman; that he might hang them all there,
if he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he '
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as justice required, exec t Atkins, whom he was com-
manded by the governor to vise to prepare for death, for
that he would be hanged in the morning.

Though all this was but a fiction of his own,' yet it had '
its desired eflect: Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the
captain to intercede with the governor for his life; and all
the rest begged of him, for God's sake, that they might
not be sent to En land.

It now occur to me, that the time of our deliverance
was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring
these fellows in to be hearty in getting possessron of the
ship; so I retired in the dark 'from them, that they might
not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the
captain to me: when 1 called, as at a good distance, one o!
the men was ordered to speak a ain, and say to the ca -
tain, Captain, the commander ls for you; and present y
the captain replied, Tell his excellency I am just a-coming.
This more perfectly amused them, and they all believed.
that the commander was just by with his fifty men. Upon
the captain's comin to me, I told him my roject for seiz-
ing the ship, which e liked wonderfully we I, and resolved
to put it in execution the next morning. But, in order to
execute it with more heart. and to be secure of success, I
told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should
go and take Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and
send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay. This
was committed to Friday and the two men who came on
shore with the captain. They conveyed them to the cave
as to a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especi-
ally to men in their condition. The others I ordered to
my bower, as I called it, of which I have given a full de-
scription: and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the
lace was secure enough, considering they were upon their
ehavior.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to
enter into a arley with them; in a word, to try them, and
tell me whet ier he thought they might be trusted or no to
go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to them of
the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to,
and that though the governor had given them quarter for
their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were
sent to England they would all be hanged in chains, to
be sure; but that if they would join in so just an attempt
as to recover the ship, he would have the governor's engage-
ment for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be
accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their
knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest im pre-
cations, that they would be faithful to him to the last drop,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go
with him all over the world; that they would own him as
a father as long as they lived. Well, says the captain, I
must go and tell the governor what you say, and see what
I can do to bring him to consent to it. So he brought me
an account of the temper he found them in, and that he
verily believed they would be faithful. However, that we
might be very secure, I told him he should go back again
an choose out those five, and tell them, that they might
see he did not want men, that he would take out those two
to be his assistants, and that the governor would keep the
other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the
castle (my cave) as hostages for the fidelity of those five;
and that if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five
hostages should be hanged in chains alive on the shore.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor
was in earnest: however, they had no we left them but to
accept it; and it was now the business 0 the prisoners, as.m'krzfi": a

240 nonmsou causes;

much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do
their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition:
first, the captain, his mate, and passenger; second, the
two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their
character from the captain, 1 had given their liberty, and
trusted them with arms: third, the other two that I had
kept till now in my bower pinioned, but, on the captain's
motion, had now released: fourth, these five released at
last, so that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept
prisoners in the cave for hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with
these hands on board the ship: but as for me and my man
Friday, 1 did not think it was proper for us to stir, having
seven men left behind; and it was employment enough for
us to keep them asunder, and sup ly them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, l resolv to keep them fast, but
Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with
necessaries; and 1 made the other two carry provisions to a
certain distance, where Friday was to take it.

When 1 showed myself to the two hostages, it was with
the captain, who told them 1 was the person the governor
had ordered to look after them; and that it was the gov-
ernor's pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my
direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the
castle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never suflered
them to see me as a governor, I now appeared as another
person, and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the
castle, and the like, upon all occasions.

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to
furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man
them. He made his pmnger captain of one, with four
of the men; and himself, his mate, and five more, went in
the other; and they contrived their business very well, for
they,came up to the ship about midni ht. As soon as they
came within call of the ship, he made binson hail them,
and tell them they had brought off the men and the boat,
but that it was a long time before the had found them, and
the like, holding them in a chat till ey came to the ship's
side; when the captain and mate entering first, with their
arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and
carfinter with the butt end of their muskets, being very
tait ally seconded by their men; they secured all the rest

that were upon the main and quarter-decks, and began to
tusten the hatches, to keep them down that were below;
when the other boat and their men, entering at the fore-
cinzins, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle
whiz-h went down into the cook-room, making three men
they found there prisoners. When this was done, and all safe
upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men,
to break into the round-house, whe're the new rebel captain
lny, who having taken the alarm, had got up, and with two
mm and a boy had got fire-arms in their hands; and when
the mate, with n. crow, split open the door, the new captain
and his men tired boldly among them, and wounded the
mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm, and
wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The
nnne, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-
housc, Wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new
enptuin through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth,
and came out again behind one of his cars, so that he
never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded,
and the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives
lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered
rsven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon
"-3: in me to give me notice of his success, which you may be
sure I was Very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the
t'il'H'L' for it till nru-r two o'clock in the morning. Having
thus ilt'lll'li the signal plainly, I laid 1110 down, and it bavin
lair-n a <<lay of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till?
was something surprised with the noise of a gun; and pres-
ently starting up, i heard a man call me by the name of
(lover-nor, Governor, and presently I knew the captain's
voice; when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he
stood, and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his
arms. My dear friend and deliverer, says he, there's
your ship, for she is all yours, and so are "'0, and all that
belong to her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode Within a little more than halfof a mile of the shore;
for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were
masters of her, and the weather being fair, had brought
ner to anchor just against the mouth of the little creek;
and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace
in near the place where I at first landed my rafts, and so
landed just at my door._ 1 was at first ready to sink down

\
with the surprise; for 1 saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly,
put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first,
for some time, I was not able to answer him one word; but
as ho had taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I
should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the sur-
prise, and immediately )ulled a bottle out of. his pocket, and
gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on pur-
pose for me. After I had drunk it, I had sat down upon
the ground; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was
a good while before 1 could speak a word to him. All this
time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as 1, only
not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand
kind and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to
myself: but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it
put all my spirits into confusion; at last it broke out into
tears; and in a little while after I recovered my speech. I
then tool: my turn, and embraced him as my delivercr, and
we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a
man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole
transaction seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such
things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that
the eye of. an inlinite l'ower could search into the remotest
corner of the world, and send help to the miserable when-
ever He pleased. I forgot not to [if t up my heart in thank-
fnlncss to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless
Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner provided
for me in such a wilderness, and in sneh a desolate condi-
tion, but from whom every deliverance must always be
acknowledged to proceed?

When We had talked awhile, the captain told me he had
brought some little refreshment, such as the ship aflorded,
and such as the. wretehes that had been so long his masters
had not plundered him of. Upon this he called aloud to
the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that
were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as it
it had been one that was not to be carried away with them,
but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still. First,
he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cor-
dial waters, six large bottles of Madame wine (the bottles
held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good to-
bacco, twelve good pieces of ship's beef, and six pieces of
rlr, with a be of pease, and about a hundred-weight of
iseuit: he also rought me. a box of sugar, a box of flour,
a be full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice, and
abun ance of other things. But, besides these, and what
was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me
six new clean shirts, six very good neck-cloths, two pairs of
gloves, one pair or shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings,
with a very good suit of clothes of his own, which had been
worn but very little; in a word, he clothed me from head to
feet. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one
may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was
anything in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward,
and uneas as it was to me to wear such clothes at first.
After tllese ceremoinies were past, and after all these
ood things were brought into my little apartment, we
egau to consult what was to be done with the prisoners we
had; for it was worth considering whether we might
venture to take them awa with us or no, especially two of
them, whom we knew to e incorrigible and refractory to
the last degree; and the captain said he knew they
were such rogues, that there was no obliging them; and it
he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefac-
tors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English col-
ony he could come at; and I found that the captain himself
was very anxious about it. Upon this I told him, that if
he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he
spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave
t rem upon the island. I should be very glad of that, says
the captain, with all my heart. Well, says I, I will send
them up, and talk with them for you. Sol caused Friday
and the two hostages, for they were now discharged, there
comrades having performed their promise; I say. I caused
them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pin<
ioned as they were, to the bower, and eep them there till
1 came. After some time, I came thitherdressed in my new
habit; and now I was called governor again. Being all
met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be
brought before me, and I told them I had got-a full ac-
count of their villainous behavior to the captain, and how
they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to
commit further robberies, but that Providence had in-
snared them in their own Ways, and that they were fallen
into the pit which they had dug for others. I let themknow that by my direction the shi had been seized; and

that she now lay in the road;'an they might see, by and
by, that their new captain had received the reward of his
villainy, and that they would see him hanging at the yard.
arm: that as to them, I wanted to know what they. had to
say why I should not execute them as pirates,.taken in the
fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had
authority to so do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they
had nothing to say but this, that when they were taken,
the captain promised them their lives, and they humbly im~
plorcd my more . But I told them I knew not what mercy
to show them; or as for myself, I had resolved to quit the
island with all mimcn, and had taken passage With the
captain to go for 'ngland; and as for the captain, he could
not carry them to England other than as prisoners, in irons,
to be tried for mutiny, and running away with the shi ;
' the eonse names of which, they must needs know, wou d

be the gaalows; so that 1 could not tell what was best for
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the isl-
and: if they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island,
1 had some inclination to give them their lives, it they
thought they could shift on shore. They seemed very
thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture
to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged: so I
left it on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difiiculty of
it, as if he durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed
a little angry with the ca itaiu, and told him that they were .
my prisoners, not his; and seeing that I had offered them so
much fever, 1 would be as good as in word; and that if
he did not think fit to consent to it, would set them at
liberty, as I found them; and if he did not like it, he
might take them again it he could catch them. Upon this _
they appeared very thankful, and I accordin iyset them at
liberty and bade them retire into the wo s to the place
whence they came, and I would leave them some fire-arms,
some ammunition, and some directions how they should
live very well, it they thought fit. Upon this 1 prepared
to go on board the ship; but told the captain I would stay
that night to prepare my things, and desired him to go on
board, in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship,
and send the boat on shore next day for me; ordering
him, at all events, to cause the new captain, who was killed,
in? be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see
1m.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to
me to my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse
with them on their circumstances. I told them I thought
they had made a right choice; that if the captain had car-
ried them away, they would certainly be hanged. 1 showed
them the new captain hanging at the yard--arm of the ship,
and told them they had nothing less to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I
then told them 1 would let them into the story of my liv-
ing there, and put them into the way of making it easy to
them: accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the
place, and of my coming to it; showed them my fortifica-
tions, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured
my grapes; and, in a word, all that was necesstry to make
them easy. I told them the story also of the seventeen
Spaniards that were to be expected, for whom I lelt a let-
ter, and made them promise to treat them in common with
themselves. Here it may be noted, that the captain, who
had ink on board, was greatly surprised that I never hit
upon.a way of making ink of charcoal and water, or of
something else, as I had done things much more difiicnlt.

1 left them my tire-arms, viz., tive muskets, three fowl-
ing-pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a
half of powder left: for after the first year or two I used
but little. and wasted none. I gave them a description of
the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese: in a
word, I gave them every part of my own story, and told
them I should prevail with the captain to leave them two
barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden seeds, which
I told them I would have been very glad of: also I gave
them the bag of pease which the captain had brought me to
eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase them.

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went
on board the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but
did not weigh that night. The next morning early, two of
the five men came swimming to the ship's side, and mak>>
in a most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged
teas taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they should
be murdered, and begged the captain to take them on
board, though he hanged them immediately. Upon this,
the captain retended to have no power without me; but
after some ifficulty, and after their solemn promises of
amendment, they were taken on board, and were some time
after soundly whipped and pickled: after which they proved
very honest and quiet fellows.

Some time after this the boat was ordered on shore, the
tide being up, with the things promised to the men; to
which the captain, at my intercession, caused their chests
and clothes to be added, which they took, and were very
thankful for. I also encouraged them by telling them
that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them
in, 1 would not forget them.

When 1 took leave of this island, 1 carried on board, for
relics, the great goat-skin cap 1 had made, my umbrella,
and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to take the
money I formerly mentioned, which had laid by me so
long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnised, and could
hardly pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and
handled; as also the money I found in the wreck of the
Spanish single. And thus I left the island, the 19th of De-
cember, as found by the ship's account, in the year 1686,
alter I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two
months, and nineteen days; being delivered from this sec-
ond captivity the same day of the month that 1 first made
my escape in the long-boat from among the Moors of
Sallee. In this vessel, after a long voyage,I arrived in
England the 11th of J une, in the year 1687, having been
thirty~five years absent.
