6 Life and Adventures 

my father, who was very ancient^ had given me a competent 
share of learning, as far as house education^ and a country free- 
school generally goes, and designed me for the law ; but I would 
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my inclination 
to this led me so strongly against the willj nay the commands of 
my fether, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my 
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something 
fatal in that propension of nature tending directly to the life of 
misery which was to befal me, 

My fether, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and ex- 
cellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He 
calicd me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined 
by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this 
subject : he asked me what reasons 'more than a mere wandering 
inclination I had for leaving my father's house and my native 
country, where I might be well introduced, and had a pros- 
pect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with 
a life of case and pleasure. He told mc it was for men of des- 
perate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring superior fortunes on 
the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by cnterprizc, 
and make themselves famous in undertalungs of a nature out of 
the common road ; that these things were all either too far above 
mc, or too far below me ; that mine was the middle state, oi 
what might be called the upper station of low life^ which he hac 
found by long experience was the best state in the world, th< 
most suited to human ha^^incss, not exposed to the miseries anc 
hardships, the labour and suifoings of the mechanic part of man 
kind, and not embarrassed ^th the pride, luxury, ambition, ani 
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might judg 
of the happiness of this state, by this one thing, vix. That thi 
was the state of life which all other people envied ; that King 
j^f^A-^i/ent/xJamcntedthe miserable consequences of bring bor 
to great things^ and wish they bad been ^WitA m ^ \iuddlfi <

It happened that he hul apf>oinr«d to go out in this boaC^ eich 
for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Mscrs of some distint 
tion in that pl^cc^ and for whom he had provided extracrdirurily 
and had thcrcforL* sent on tward tlitr boat over nighr a larger sto 
of provisions than ordinary; and had ordered mc to get read 
tiircc fu3CC3 with powder ajid shot, which were on board hi 
^p; for thit they designed sonic sport of fowling^ ^ well 
fishing. 

I got flll things ready as he had directed, mid waited the n 
morning with the boat washed dean, her ancient and pendant 
outj and everything to accommodate his guests; when hjr a

and commanded thut as soon as I got some fi^ 1 should bnng i

This moment my former notions of dchvcrancc darted irtom 
thoughts, for now J found I wae like to have a linle ship at 
command ; and my master being gone, I prepared to fumis 
myself^ not for n Ashing business, but Tor a voyage; chou^L 
knew not, neither did I so much 08 consider, whither I slii^^| 
mer; for any where to get out of that pkce was my way. 

My firJt contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to thi 
Moor, to get M^mirEhinji; fur our sub^istenrc on liatrd; for I lul 
him we must not presume Co ent of our patron's bread : he sai 
that was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscid 
of their kind, ;ind three iar« wrth fmh water into tlic boat, 
knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was ev 
dent by the make were taken out of some English prise; and 
conveyed them into the boat while the Mtior was on share, as i 
they ha^i been there before for our master; I conveyed also 
^reat Itunp of beeswax into the boat, which weighed above hal

as if I stooped for aomcthiitg behind him, I took him by sui

board into <he sea. He roiic immoliarcly, for he swam [ike

that he would h:tvc reached mt vrry qtiickly, there licing liq 
little wind; upon which I srcpt into the cabin, and fetching on 
of the fowling pieces^ I presented it at him» luid told him, I ha 
done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I ^xmid do hi 
none: hut, s;trd I, you swim well enough to rencli lo (he shcy 
and the *ea is calm, nuke the best of your way to shorc^ aj»d 
will do you no harm, but if you come near the boat I'll shoo 
you through the he^id ; for I am resolved to have my liberty 
so he turned himself about and swam for the shore, and I 
no doubt but he reached it with ea^, for he was an execll 
swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this Af«r with m' 
and have drowiicd the boy, but there was no venturing to tro 
him. When he ww gone J turned to the boy, who they call 
Xitrj, and said to him, Xurv, if you wit] be faithful to me I* 
make you n. yreai man, but if you will not stroke your face 
be true to mCj /Aj/ is, jw^^r ^j Mahomet and hxs faih^r's bt&ri^

spukc so inTUicenlly that I could not tnisfnjM him; and 
swore to be ^ichfitl to me, and go all over the world witfi me. 

While I was in view of the M^r that was swimming, I at 
out dxKcdy to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward 
that ihcy might ihink me gone tuwanU the Straits mouth ( 
indeed nrxy one that had been in dieir wits mu«t have been su

after all Xury's advice was gcxxl, and 1 took it ; wc dropped our 

|little anchor and lay soil all night ; I say still, for wc slept none; 

for in two or three hour^ we saw vast great creatures (we knew 

what to call them) of many sorts* come down to the sc»- 

|shore and run into the w^er, wallowing and washing thcmsclve* 

the pleasure of cooling themselves ; and they made such 

Ihidcous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard die 

llllce. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too ; but 

'c were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty 

:rcaturcs come swimming towards our boat: we could not see 

lim, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous 

huge and furious beast, Xury said it was a lion, and it m.]ght 

|be so for aught I know ; but poor Xury cried to me to weig^i 

^he anchor and row away. No, says I, Xtiry, wc can slip our 

ible with a buoy to ir and go off" to sea, they cannot follow as 

J had no sooner said so, but I oerceived the creature 




ffacse to get to it wa$ the point, Xary ^d, if { would

no instruments to take an observatioTi to know what latitude we 
were irij and did not exactly know, or at least remember, what 
latitude they were in, 1 knew not where to look for them, or 
when to stand off to sea towards them ; otherwise I might now 
easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was, that 
if J stood along this coast till I came to that part where the 
\Engl/j/j traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their 
|usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in- 

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was, 
lust be that country, which lying between the emperor of 
A/ffrofffl'j dominions and the Negrces, lies wastCj and uninhabited, 
except by wild beasts, the Negroes having abandoned ir, and 
gone farther south for fear of the Moors; and the Moors not 
thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its ban-cnncss; and 
indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of 
|rigers, lionsj leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour 
lO that the Moors use it for their hunting oniv, where

best go farther off the shore; for, says fie, look yundcr lies a 
dfcniAil mofmer on the side of that hiJIock Tasc asleep. I looked 
what be pointed, and saw a drculful monster indiccd, fbr it was 
airnSUe great Iaoq that lay on the side of the shore, under Che 
litaietjfm pece of ibc hill that hting as it were a little over him. 
Xmtj, says J, you shall go on shore and kill him : Xury looked 
ftighicd, and aaid, Mf HUf ht tai mt al &nc mmih; one 
nmothliil he mcanr. Mowcvcr, I said no Diorc to the boy, but 
We him lie siill ; aitd cook our biggest gun^ which w-fis almoU 
■iiM^ui'f-bofc, and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and 
mb two slugs, and laid it down ; then 1 loaded another gun with 
DiO bullet.^; and the third, for we hat! three pieces, I loaded 
*ith five Mnaller bullets. T took the Iwitr utm I could with the 
fim pvccct 10 have shot him into the head, but he Uy so widi 
bb leg raised a little above hb nose, that the slugs hit his kg 
ahDor the knee, and hroke the hone- He ntarteii up gmwliag 
M fait, but finding his leg broke fell down again, and thcfi got 
if upon three legs, and gave the moit hidcoua roar that ever I 
kanL f was a Itrtlc hurj)n.vid that I had not hit turn on the 
bead ; however, 1 took up the second piece immediately^ and 
i&tMgh be b^pn to move off, fired again, and shot him into the 
haAf and had the pleasure to »ce him drop, and make but little 
MBCt but bqr struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and 
««uld have me let him go on shore. Well, go, said ]. So the 
hoy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand, 
•vam to shore with the other h^u^d, and coming doac to the 
, put the muxxle of the piece to his ear, and shot him 
the head again, which dispatched him quite. 
This waa game indeed to us, but this was no food : and I wa& 
fay vTTTy tu knc three charges of powder and shot upon a crca- 
loc that was good for nothing to us. However, Xurj said he 
vQold hive nine of htm ; so he comes on board, atid asked me 
10 ^ve him the hatchrt For what^ Xtpy ? said I. M« OU off 



yZ LiPfi AND ADVfit«TURE3 

Ais h^adj said he. However, Xury could not cat off his head, 
but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a 
monstrous great one. 

I bethought myself howererj that perhaps the skin of him 
might one way or other be of some value to us ; and I resolved 
to talce off his skin, if I could. So Xury and I went to work 
widi him ; but Xury was much die better workman at it, for I 
knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole 
day ; but at last we got off the hide of him, and ^reading it on 
the top of our cabin, ^c sun effectually dried it in two days dme* 
and it afterwards served me to Ke upon. 

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for 
ten or twelve days, living very sparing on our pro^ions» which 
began to abate very much, and gomg no oftener into die shore 
dian we were obliged to for fresh water : my design in this was, 
to make the river Gambia or Saicgaly that is to say, any whei« 
about the Cape de Verdy where I was in hopes to meet with some 
Enropean ship ; and if I did i\otj I knew not what course I had 
to take, but to seek for the Islands^ or perish there among tin 
Negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe^ which sailed 
ather to die coast of Guinea or to Brasil^ or to the East Indies^ 
made this Cape, or those Islands ; and, in a word, I put the 
whole of my fortune upon this single point, cidier that I must 
meet with some ship, or must perish. 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, at 
I have said, I began to see that the knd was inhabited ; and in 
two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand npcHi 
the shore to look at us ; we could also perceive they were quite 
black, and stark nakol. I was once inclined to have gone on 
shore to them ; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to 
me. No go, no go : however I hauled in nearer the shore that I 
might talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore by m^ 
a good wzy,. I observed they had no weapons in their hand^

vcfl m I could; and particularly made signs for aoniething to 
tt: they bcAoflcd to me to stop my boa^ and they would fetch 
Mcnme meatj iqxm diis I lowered the top of my sailt and lay 
lf,aad two of dion lan i^ into the country^ and in less than 
hlf an hour came back, and brought with tlwm two pieces of

ht «e ncidicr knew, what the one nor the other was : however, 
willing to accept it, but how to ccnne at it was our next 
for I WIS not lor venturing on shore to them, and they 
much iftaid of us; but they todc a safe way for its aU, 
for diey brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and 
ODod a great way off till we fetched it on board, and then came 
dose to us again. 

We made agns of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make 
Aem amends ; but an opportunity oflfcred that very instant to 
oUigc them wonderfully ; for while wc were lying by the shore, 
came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took 
it) with great fury, from the mountains towards the sea : whe- 
ther it was the male pursuing the female, or whether they were 
in tptxt or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could 
tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the lat- 
ter; because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom 
^pear but in the night ; and in the second place, we found the 
pco[^ terribly frighted, especially the women. The man that 
hd the lance or dart did not &y from them, but the rest did ; 
however, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, they 
did not seem to offer to fall upon any of the Negroes^ but plunged 
themselves into the sea, and swam about as if they had come for 
tfadr dtveruon. At last one of them began to come nearer our 
bolt tiian at first I expected, but I lay ready for him> for I had

loaded my gun with all possible expedition^ and bade Xury load 
both the others. As soon as he came fxivXy within my rcach^ I 
fired, and shot him directly into the head* Immediately he sunk 
down into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and 
down as if he was struggling for life ; and so indeed he was : ho 
immediately made to the shorc^ but between the woundj which 
was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died juat 
before he reached the shore. 

It is impos^ble to express the astonishment of these poor 
creatures at the noise and the fire of my gun ; some of them 
were even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the 
very terror. But when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in 
the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore, 
they took heart and came to the shore, and began to search fi» 
the creature. I found him by his blood staining the water ; and 
by the help of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the 
Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shorcj and found that it 
was a most curious leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable 
degree, and the Negroes held up their hands with admiration to 
think what it was I had killed him with. 

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and dw 
noise of the gun, swam on shore^ and ran up directly to ihe 
mountains from whence they came, nor could I at that distance 
know what it was- I found quickly the Negroes were for eating 
the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it 
as a fevoiir from me, which when I made agns to them diat they 
might take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately they 
fell to work with him, and though they had no knife, yet with a 
sharpened piece of wood they took ofl^ his skin as readily^ and 
much more readily, than we could have done with a kmfc : they 
oflfcrcd me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if 1 
would give it them, but made ^gns for the skin, which they 
gxvt me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of thetf

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able

plantation ; for the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, 
nd an European servant also ; I mean another besides that which 
the certain brought mc &om Ushon, 

But aa abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means 
of oar greatest adveraity, so was it with me, I went on the next 
fcarwicb great success in my plantation ; I raised fifty great rolls 
of tdncco on my own gnnmd, more than I had disposed of for 
neocsBarics among my neighbours \ and these fifty rolls, being 
cKh of above an hundred weight, were well cured and laid by 
igunst the return of the fleet from Lisbon, And now, increasing 
in bunncss and in wealth, my head began to be full of prefects 
ad undertakings beyond my reach ; such as are indeed often 
tfac nnn of die best Heads in bu^css.

all the happy ^ings to have yet befallen mc, for which my 
fither so earnestly recommended a quiet retired life, and of 
vfaich he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to

carriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to 
my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that 
inclination in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself 
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects and those 
measures of lif^, which nature and Providence concurred to pre- 
sent me with, and to make my duty. 

As I had done thus in breaking away from my parents, so I 
could not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy 
view i had of being a rich and thriving man in my new planta- 
tion, only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster 
than the nature of the thing admitted ; and thus I cast myself 
down again into the deepest gulph of human misery that ever 
man fell into^ or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state 
of health in the world- 

To come then by the just degrees to the particulars of this 
part of my story ; you may suppose, that having now lived 
almost four years in the Brasils, and beginning to thrive and 
prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned 
the language, but had contracted acquaintance and friendship 
among my fellow planters, as well as among the merchants at St. 
Salvadore, which was our port ; and that in my discourses among 
them, I had frequently given them an account of my two 
voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the 
Negrois there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast^ 
for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives, scissars, hatchets, bits <^ 
glass, and the like, not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elq)hants 
teeth, ^c. but Negroes for the service of the Brasils^ in great 
numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on 
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the buy- 
ing Negroes J which was a trade at that time not only not far entered 
into, but as far as it was» had been carried on by the AssicntDai 
arpermis^on of the kings of Spain and Portugal^ and engrosMd

the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no 
inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we came within 
the circle of the Caribhe-sslands^ and therefore resolved to stuid 
away for Barbadoes^ which by keeping off at sea, to avoid the 
indraught of the bay or gulph of Mexico, we might ea^y per- 
form, as we hoped, in about fifteen days sail ; whereas we could 
not possibly make our voyage to the coast oi Africa without some 
assistance, both to our ship and to ourselves. 

With this de^gn wc changed our course, and steered away 
N. W. by W* in order to reach some of our English islands, 
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise deter- 
mined; for being in the latitude of 12 deg. 18, min. a second 
storm came upon us, which carried us away with the same im- 
petuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all 
human commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as to the 
sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than 
ever returning to our own country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our 
men early in the morning cried out. Land ! and we had no sooner 
run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts 
in the world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a 
moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in 
such a manner, that wc expected we should all have perished im- 
mediately ; and we were immediately driven into our close quar- 
ters,to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like con- 
dition, to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such 
drciunstances : we knew notlung where we were, or upon what 
land it was we were driven, whether an island or the niajn> 
whether inhabited or not inhabited ; and as the rage of the ^rind 
was still great, though rather less than at first, we could not sa 
much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes without^ 
^^resking in pieces^ unless the winds by a kind of miracle should

least shadow of expectation, was, if we might happen into

rhance we might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of

After we had rowed, or rarher driven about a league and a 

lalf, as we reckoned it, a raging ^v-ave, mountain-like, came 

lUing a-stem of us, and plainly bade us expect the coup-di-grace.

When ] waked it was bi-oad day, the weather clear, and the 
storm abatedj so that the sea did not rage and swell as before ;

off in the night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of 
the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which J fir&t

against it ; this being within about a mile from the shore where I 
was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself 
on board, that, at least, I might save some necessary things for 
my use. 

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked 
about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which

bund the sky over-cast^ and the wind began to rise, and in a

as quite high water tt blew a storm.

I bdicvttl would not be wholesome, snd more particu-

koc any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was not wit-

In iearch of a placer proper for this, I found a linle pl»in on 
ifae aide of a rising hiitt whoetc front towards this little plain was 
Mcp aa a housc-ddc, so xhxt nothing could come down upon me 
tnMXk the top ; on the side of this rock there ww a hdlKiw pl>-(ttr, 
*orn a little way in, like the cnit^ince or door of a cave: but 
&crv was noC really any cave or way into the rock at all. 

On the flit of the green, just before thii hollow place, I 
iBohntd to pitch my tent: this plain w^ not ;Lhove ui hundred 
Tvdi broftd, and about twice as long, and Uy like a green before 
my door, and at the end of it descended irregularly every way 
^own mto the low grotmds by the »ca-»ide. It was un the

piMr, whkh took in about ten yards in its aemi-diameter from 
ibc rock, and rwentjr yards in It^ diameter, from its begmning

of ink was one, as also spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or 
remove the earth ; neodles, jmhs, and thread ; as for linen, I soon 
learned to want that without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily, and 
it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little 
pale or surrounded habitation : the piles or stakes, which were 
as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and 
preparing in the woods, and more by far in bringing home ; so 
that I spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home 
one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the ground ; 
for which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at 
last bethought myself of one of the iron crows, which however, 
though I found it, yet it made driving those posts or piles very 
laborious and tedious work. 

But what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of 
any thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in, nor 
had 1 any other employment if that had been over, at least, that 
I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food, 
which I did more cm- less every day, 

I now began to consider seriously my condition^ and the cir- 
cumstance I was reduced to, and I drew up the state of my affairs 
in writing ; not so much to leave them to any that were to come 
after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my 
thoughts from daily poring^ upon them, and afflicting my mind ; 
andTas my reason began now to master my despondency, I began 
to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the good against 
the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my case 
from worse ; and I stated it very impartially, l ike debtor and 
creditor, the comforts I enjoyed ag<unst the miseries I suffered^ 
thus:

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition,

say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to ac- 

:ommodaic my way of living, and to make things as easy to me 

I could. 

1 have already described my habitation, which was a tent under 
:he side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and 
:ablts, bur I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind 
if wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside, 
tnd after some time, 1 think it was a year and a half, I raised 
^ters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it 
'ith boughs of trees, and such things as 1 could get to keep out

So I went to work ; anJ here I must needs observe, that aa^^

opecially if I had h:id tools howc-vcr I made abimdaitce of 
tlUk^ even without tools, and «ome with no more toob than 
ID adxc and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made rhat way 
MtMTt and (hat with inlinrtc lutxnir; for example, if I wanted a 
bond, I had iw other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an 
edge bdbrc me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I 
hid brought it to be aa thin aa a phrk, and then dub it smooth 
^tb my adze. ![ is true, b y thia method I could make but one 
bovd oitt of a whole tree, but this I had no remedy for but 
patience, any more than t had for the pradigiotu detl of time

^4 Life and Advektvres 

So that had my cave been to be seen» it looked like z general 
magazine of ail necessary things ; and I had every thing so 
ready at my hand, that it was/a great pleasure to me to sec all 
my goods in such order, and ^pedaJly to find my stock of all 
necessaries so great, ". . 

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's 

cmjJoyinent ; for indeed at first I was in too much hurry ; and 

Lot pnly huny as to labour, but in too much discomposure of 

nind, and my journal would hav^ been fuU of many dull things, 

^or example, I must have said thus : Sept. the 30th, after I got 

Eo shore, and had escaped drowning, instead of being thankful 

Ito God for my dehverance, having first vomited with the great 

Iquantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomachy and 

'recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wringing my 

hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, 

and crying out, 1 was undone, undone ; till, tired and faint, I 

was forced to He down on the ground to repose, but durst not 

; sleep fi^r fear of being devoured. 

Some days after this', and after I had been on board the ship, 
and got all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear get- 
ting up to the top of a little mount^n, and looking out to sea 
in hopes of seeing a ship; then fancy at a vast distance I spied 
a sail ; please myself with the hopes of it ; and then, after look- 
ing steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down 
and weep likfc a child, and thus increase my misery by my 
folly. 

But having gotten .oyer these things in some measure, and 
having settled my household-stuff and habitation, made me a 
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I 
began to keep my journal, of which 1 shall here give you the 
copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over again) as 
long as it lasted ; for having no more ink, I was forced to leave 
/toff:

December lo. I began now to think mj cave or vault finished, 
Iwhen en a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great 
quantity of earth fell down from the top and one side, so much 
thai in short it frighted me, and not without reason too ; for if 
I had been under it 1 had never wanted a grave-digger ; upon 
this disaster I had a great deal of work to do over again ; for I 
had the loose earth to carry out, and, which was of more impor- 
tance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no 
Imorc would come down.

pected might roll down upon me : I was no sooner stepped down 
upon the firm ground^ but I plainly saw it was a terrible earth- 
quake, for the ground I stood on shook three times at about 
eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as would have 
overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have 
stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which 
stood about half a mile from me next the sea, fell down with 
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life : I percrivcd 
also the very sea was put into violent motion by it; and I 
believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the 
island, 

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the 
like, or discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one 
dead or stupified ; and the motion of the earth made my stomach 
sick, like one that was tossed at sea ; but the noise of the falling 
of the rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing me from the 
stupified condition I was in, filled me with horror, and I thought 
of nothing then but the hill falling upon my tent, and all my 
household goods, and burying all at once; and this sunk my 
very soul within me a second time. 

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some 
time, I began to take courage, and yet I had not heart enough 
to get over my wall again, for fear of being biu-ied alive, but sat 
still upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not 
knowing what to do:. ^^^ th'" while ^ ^="^ ""t the least ser ious 
' religiousjhought^HQtbing byt the .common, Lordy have rmrcy 
upon me ; and^whcn it was over, that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, 
as if it would rain; soon after that the wind rose by littie and 
little, so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful 
hurricane : the sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam 
and froth, the shore was covered with the breach of the water, 
t^e trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible storm it was ;

This violent rain forcttl me to a new work, viz. to cut a hole 
thn»(;h my new fortilication like a sink to let water go oitt, 
which would dsc have drowned my cave. After 1 had been in 
wef cave fiomc time, and found still rio more shocks of the eirth-

The fear of being swaUowcd up alive, made me that I ncva"

In the mean time it occurred to me that it would require a 

'ast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented 

run the venture where I was, till 1 had formed a camp for 

lyself, and had secured it so as to remove to it ; so with this 

solution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I 

■ould go to work with all speed to build me a waJl with piles

beiag low, I saw itomeching lie on the shore bigger than ordinary ; 
and il looked like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small 
borrd, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which 
«cfcdriven on shore by (he late hurricane; and looking towards 
the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher cut of the 
Water than it used to do : I ei:amined the barrel which was driven 
m sbor^ and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it 
had taken water, and iht: ptjwiler w^s taknl ns hard as a none ; 
however I tolled !c farther on shore for the present, and went on 
«(ioa the sands as near a£ I coukl co the wreck of the ship, to 
bok for more* 

When I earner down to the ship, I found it strangely rtmovcd : 
Ae feffc-casde, wluch lay before buried in sand^ was heaved up

Bingt I coukl now walk iguite up to her when the tide was our.

nm broken f>[ien than formerly, mj many dimgs came daily on

found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for that all the 
Inside of the ship was choked up with sand : however, as I had 
earnt not to despair of any thingj I resolved to pull every thing 
|o pieces that I could of the ship, concluding, that every thing I 
:ould get from her would be of some use or other to me*

Tliis was the-firat time that I could say, in the true sense of] 
the words, thatl prayed in all my life ; far nog^I prayed with'^ 
a sense of my condition^ and with a true scripture vie w ofifope, 
feimd gd on fjie '"nTO"ragf'J"g"fr -o£4h cjftwd of Go D ; anSno m - 
this time> I may say, I began to have hope that God would hear i 
me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned ^ve " Call 
CM »tf, and I will deliver thee^* in a different sense from what 1 
had ever done before ; for then I had no notion of any thing ; 
being called deliverance, but my being delivered from the capti- ; 
vity I was in ; for though I was indeed at lat^e in the place, yet | 
the island was cert^nly a prison to me, and that, in the worst ' 
sense in the world ; but now I learned to take it in another sense. 
Now I looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my 
sms appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God, ; 
but deliverance from the loa d of guilt that bore down all my 
comfort. As lor my solitary life, it was nothings I did not so 
much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it \ it was all 
of no consideration, in comparison of this; and I add this part 
here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come 
to a true sense of things, they^will. find deliverance from sin a <r 
much grater blessing than deliverance from affliction. 

But, leaving this part, I return to my journal. !>- . J- .__-" 

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable a^^ 
to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind \ and my 
thoughts being directed by a constant reading the Scripture, and 
praying to God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal 
of c om for twith jn^ which ti!l now I knew nothing of: also as my 
health and strength returned, J bestirred myself to furnish my- 
self with every thing that I wanted, and make my way of living

I Icamt from it also this in particular, that being abroad in 

tc rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that 

lould be, especially in those rains which came attended with 

jtorms and hurricanes of wind ; for as the rain which came in a

when I was ashore in Bariury^ the eating of grapes killed acveraJ

ifaac I would not sow it all ^r f r^fj hrauv I did not know when 
was the proper time for it ; so I sowed about two thirds of the 
seeds* leaving about a hai\dful of each. It was a grcAt comfort 
to mc afterwards that 1 did so,/or not one grain of that I sowed 
thts time came to smy thing ; tor the dry months following, the 
earth having had no rain afrer the ^eed was sown, it had no mois-

Finding my first seed did not grow» which I easily imagined 
was by the drought, I sought for a nioister piece of ground to 
make another trial in ; and 1 dug up a pieci^of ground near my 
new bower, and »>wcd the rest of my seed in Fetrnary^ a tittle 
bcfon: the vtrna! €ijutn^x ; and this, having the rainy months of 
March and ^frii in water it, itprung up very pleaunriyt aitd

\t only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut off of 

|omc trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown 
'ith long branches, as much as a willow tree usually shoots the 
ir^t year after lopping its head, 1 could not tell what tree to call 
that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very 
^eJI pleased, to sec the young trees grow ; and 1 pruned them,

Lnd sometimes lending a hand, I had by this means so full know-

hxtchet, and mr dogj and a br^r quaarity of powder and ^ot 
Ebm usual, with two biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins 
in ray pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When J had 
the vile wliere my bower Btood, as above, I came within 
of the SC3, to the wetf ; and it being a very clear day^ I 
&irly descried land, whether an i^^land or continent I couM not 
ficU ; but it lay very high, extending from the H^nf to the 
If, S, K^. at a very great distance ; by my gxtcu it txiuld not be 
%am than tifreen or twcrt>" leagues off. 

1 could not tell what part of the world this might be, other- 
viae than that I knew it fnu<<t be pirf of Amtrita ; and, as I con- 
doded by all my obvrvanons, must be near the Spanish domi- 
ranwi and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where if I should

md grass, and full of very fine woods, I saw abundance of 

larrots, and fain would I have caught one, if possible, to have

une pains taken, catch a young parrot; for I knocked it down 

'ith a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it homtj but it 

some years before I could make him speak. However, at

dkoe were many more goats here dian on the odier ^de of the 
island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come 
Dcv diem ; the country bdng^ flat and even, and they saw me 
much sooner than when I was on the hills. 

I ccMifoss this side of die country was much pleasanter than 
mine, but yet I had not the least inclination to remove ; for as I 
was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me i and I 
seemed all the while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a journey, 
and from home. However, I travelled along the shore of the sea 
towards the eastt I suppose, about twelve miles ; and then setting 
up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would 
go home again ; and the next journey I took should be on the 
other side of the island, fast from my dwelling, and so round, 
till I came to my post again : of which in its place. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking 
I could ea^y keep all the island so much in my view, that I 
could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country ; 
but I found myself mistaken ; for being come about two or 
three miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley ; 
but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with woods, 
that I could not see which was my way by any direction but that 
<^dic sun; nor even then, unless I knew very well the position 
of the sun at diattime of t}ie day.

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized

alive from the dog, I had a great mind to bring it home, if J

|]g rhe country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would

'ithin me. to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I 
"■as in ; and how 1 was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal 
>d1c£ and bars of the ocean, in an ujiinhabited wilderness, without

jgcthcr; and this was still worse to me; for if 1 could hurst 
)ut into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go off, and the 
;rief, having exhausted itself, would abate. 

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I 
laily read the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to 

ly present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the

My case was this : I: was to be a large tree which was to be

was three days a cutting dowUj and two more cutting off the 
lOughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With 
inexpressible hacking and hewing, 1 reduced both the sides of it 
into chips, till it began to be light enough to move; then I 
rurncd it, and made one side of it smooth and flat, as a board, 
Tom end to end : then turning f:hat side downward, cut the other 
iide till I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and 
imooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my 
laniis in such a piece of work ; but labour and patience carried 

le through that and many other things ; I only observe this in 

irticular, to shew the reason why so much of my time went

so dxmCy that it could get no time to shoot tip into stalks. 

This I saw no remedy fer^ but by malung an indosure about 
it with a hedge> which I did mth a great deal of toil ; and die' 
morCj because it required a great dad of speed ; the creatures 
daily ^Knling my com. HoweTCr^ as my atable land was but 
smallf suited fo my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about 
three weeks time ; and shooting some of the creatures in the day- 
dme, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a- 
stake at the gat^ where he would stand and bark all night long : 
so in a litde time tlie enemies forsook the place, and the com 
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my com was in ^e 
blade^ so the birds were as like to ruin me now, when it was in 
the ear ; for going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw 
my little crop surrounded with fowls of I know not how many 
sorts, which stood as it were watching till I should be gone. I 
immediately let fly among them, (for I always had my gun with 
me.) I had no sooner shot, but there arose up a little cloud of 
fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the com itself 

This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that in a few days 
they would devour all my hopes : that I should be starved, and 
never be able to raise a crop at all ; and what to do I could not 
tell ; however, I resolved not to lose my com, if possible, though 
I should watch it night and day. In the first place, I went among 
it to see what damage was already done, and found they had 
spoiled a good deal of it ; but that, as it was yet too green for 
them, the loss was not so great, but the remainder was like to be 
a good crop, if it could be saved. 

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could 
easily see die thieves mtting upon all the trees about me, as if 
they only w^ted till I was gone away, and the event proved it 
to be so; for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no soor^r

hem. This was what I wished for; so I took them 



up, 



and 



erved them as we fiei'\'e notorious thieves in England, viz, hanged 
[hern in chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine 

imosl, that this should have such an effect as it had ; for the 
[owls would not only not come at the cam, but in short they 
'orsoofc all that part of the island, and I could never see a bird 
lear the place as long as my scarecrows hung there. 

This I was very glad of, you may be sure ; and about the 
latter end of December^ which was our second harvest of the year, 

reaped my corn, 
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down,

hand-mill to grind my com ; nay, I would have given it all for 
six'pomy worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England^ or for

it had been the same case ; and they h^ been of no manner of 
value to me, because of no use. 

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in ray

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I 
have aaid, my ammunition growing low, I set rnVTicIf to study^

To this purpose I made snirra lo hamper them ; and believe

At length I n-soK-ed to try a pit-(alJ ; so I dug sctTnd large 
pits in the earth, in places where I had obocrved the goats used 
to feed, ai^ over thc»e p:t» 1 placed hurdles of my own making

le had been frightened our of his wits; but I did not then know

lad let him stay there three or four days without food, ajid then 
lave carried him some water to drink, and fhen a little com, he 
^ould have been as tame as one of the kids ; for they are mighty 
jacious, tractable creatures, where they ai-e well used. 
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at 
|hat time ; then I went to the three kids ; and taking them one 
ly one, I tied them with strings together; and with some diffi- 
|u!ty brought them all home. 

It was 1 good while before they would feed; but throiring 

[em some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be 

imc ; and now 1 found that if I expected to supply myself with 

;oatVflcsh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some 

ip tame was my only way, when perhaps I might have them 

ibout my house like a flock of sheep.

ibuut ; nor was ihc nuulncs^ of it so grc^ac as lu the compass ; br 
if it w«s ten miles ibout, I wns like to have lime enough to do it

much oompd», a3 if th<ry had had the whole island ; and 1 should 
)l£ve !*D mutli room to duLtJe ihem iit^ ihat I should never aildi 
them. 

My hedge was began sud eirried on, i believe, about fifty 
jrxnla^ when thbi rhought occurred lo me ; so I jireMrntly slopped 
ihort, and for the first beginninf) I resolved to enclose a piece of 
about 150 y^rds in length, and 100 yards In breadth, which as 
if would nuintain as many as I should have in any i^asotiablv 
tifne. to, 9S my flock iirdvascd^ I could add more ground to my 
cndotfure. 

This was AcHng with wmc prudence, arvd I went to ^"ork with 
Goungc. I was ahoui three months hedging in the first piece; 
aad^ dil I had done it, I tethered the three kick in the best part 
of itt and UMd them to feed as near mc -ts potable, to make 
tbcm famiiiar; and vciy often I would go and carry them some 
ears of hirley, or a handful of rice, and fetti ihcni out of my 
hand; «o that after my enclosure was finished, and 1 let them 
loose, ihcy would foJow me up and down, bkatijig after me for 
a hwulfitl uT com. 

This answered ray end, and in about a year and n half I had 
a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all ; and tn two yeara 
more I had thrce-and-forty, lx:sidcd several that I look and killed 
for m>' food; and after th^t I enclosed five several pieces of 
ground lo feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, to 
tsfcc them as I wanted them ; and gates out of one piece of 
gnKind into anociicr.

to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might 
very cuily bring my boat about the bland again : but when 1 
began to think of purling it tn pnctxe, I h^ ftuch a terror upon 
my Jpirits at the remcmbnu^cc of ihc d^mger I hatl licen in, that 
I could not think of it again with any patienoe ; but on the con-

laborious ; and f)its waji, th^tl I would build, or mtl^r make 
flnotber pfriagua^ or tan^ ; and so have one for one side of 
the Inland, and one for the other. 

You are to understand, that now I had, as 1 may call it, two 
pbuitadom in the island ; one my little forrification or tent, with 
the wall about it under the rock, with the cave behind me, which 
by this tinK I had enUigcd into several apirtmcnts or caves, one

■"ith fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold five or 
ix bushels each, where I laid up my stores of provision^ espc- 
ialJy my corn, some in the ear cut off short from the straw, and 
le other rubbed out with my hands. 

As for my wall, made as btfarey with long stakes or piles, 
lose piles ~grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so 
lig, and spread so very much, that there was not the lease appear- 
ice, to any one's view, of any habitjition behind them.

M they tU did in the next rainy seascwi, made the cndoaurc

no p^na to bring to pais whatever appeared ncccssar)' for my 
cooifbrtable support ; for I considered the keeping up a breed of 
wne ereatnres thus at my hand, would be a living magazine of 
flc»-H, milk, butter, and cheese, for mc» as king as I lived in the

such a degree that 1 might be sure of keeping them together; 
which hy this mctHwJ indeed I $o etTcctually ifccurcd, that whai

thtcfcj I was forced to pull some of them up again. 

In this place also 1 had my grapes growing, which 1 principally 
depended on for my winter ^rore of raisins, and which I never

able, but physical, wholesome, noufbliivig, and refreshing to die

and the place where I had laid up my boar, I generally staid and

It happened one day about noon, going towards my boat, I 
'as exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot

»ther impression bur that one, I went to it again to see if there 
'ere any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy, but 
icrc was no room for that, for there was exactly the very print 
if a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot : how it came thither

and roson joined in withme-upoai this «uppocition. For how 
should any otivcr thing_ in huniau shape come into the place? 
Where was the vessel that brought them ? What marks were 
there of any other footsteps ? Ard how was it possible a man 
should come there? But then to think chat Satdn should take 
human shjipe upon him in such a place, where there could be no 
manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot 
bcMiK] him> and that even for no purpose too (for he could not 
be sure 1 should sec it), this was an amazement the other way, 
I considerrd that the devil might ^ave found oiit abundance of 
other ways to have terrified me, than this of the single print of 
a foot. That as 1 lived quite on the other stdc of the island) he 
would never have liceii so sijnpk to leave a mark in a pUcc 
where it was ten thousand to one whedier 1 should ever see tr or

who had wandered out to sea in their rtfiiwj, and, cither driven

Indtgnadon, because 1 had sinned against him. 

I then reflected that Goo, who was ivoi only r^hteous, but 
omntpotrnl^ as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, 
so he was able to delK-er me ; that if he did not think fit to do

^■description of myself, the purticular of two pistob, and a great

Things going on thiis, as 1 have said* for some time, I seemed, 
excepting ihcsc cautions^ to Ijc rtducnl to my former calmsedatc

more how far my condition was from heing miserable, compared 
to some others ; nay, to many other particulars of life, which ic 
might h;ivc |ilc;iNnl Gou tu have rnadc my loi. It put mc upon 
reflecting, how little repitibig there would be among mankind^ at 
any condition of lifc» if people would rather compare their con- 
dition with those that arc worH:, in order to be thankful, than 
be always cimip;mng them v^ilh ihosr which are l)c(lerj tu xssist

As in my present condition there were not really many thinga 
which 1 wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights i had been 
in about thirst Nav^igt' wrtftchrsj and tht^ concern I had been in 
for my own preservation, had lAvn off the edge of my inveiitMR 
for my own conveniences ; and I had droi>t a good design, which 
I had once bent my thoughts upon ; a:id ihat w<t«, to try if I 
Could not milcc some of my IwHcy into malt, and then try CO 
brew myceJf tome beer: this was rcaUy a whimsical thoi^t, 
and I reproved myteJf often for the simplicity of it ; for I prc- 
Kntly saw there would be the want of several things necessary 
to ihe making my beer, that it would be irrpos&ible for me Co 
supply ; as, first, casks to prcdcrvc it in, which was a thing tbat» 
as 1 have observed already, 1 could never compa&s; no, though 

ClI spent not many days, b*it wccks^ nay muiitlis, in attempting

But my iiivmiBon rwiw r^n qutfc ajiothcr i*ay ; for nighr and j

to be, to set dovm all the contrivances I hatched, or rather 
brooded upon In my thoughts, for the destroying these creaturei, I 
or at least fnghicning them, so as to prevent their coming hither 
any more; but all was :t!x>rtive; nothing could be piMaible (o.

could one man do among them^ when perhaps there might be 
twenty or thirty of them t<^etbcr, wiih their daits, or ihcir bow*

irdj I msdc no doubt but thatj if there were tu-cnty^ I should

and 1 WAS so fuU of it ih&r I often drcarU of it ; and somctiiuc^, 
that I w% just going to let fly u them in my deep.

yvrord, as I may cnlt it ; but ihc hoiror i h^d at the place, and 
at the sigt^ak of the barbarous wretches devouring ore another^ 
abated my malice. 

Well, at length I foui>d a place in the side of the hilJ, where

■close together, as that it would be next to tmpo^ible that 1 
should miss my shoot, or that. 1 could fail wounding three or 
four of them at the first shoot, 

la this place then I rcsoh'cd to fix my design ; and accordingly 
I prepared t^o muskets and ray ordinary fowling-piece. The 
two muskets I Io:^ed with a brace of slugt cvch, and four or five

As long as 1 kept up my daily (our to the hill to lookout, so

an offence which I hail nor nt all entered into a discussion at in

the horror J conceived at the unnatural custom of rhc people of 
that country, who, il seems, h;id l>cen sufibtd by Providence,

hellish degeneracy, could have run them into; but now, when, 
as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless exeur^n 
which I had made so long, and so tar, evcr>' morning in vain ; 
so my opinion of the action itself began lo alter, and I b<^an, 
with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what it was I was 
going to engage in; what authority or call 1 hod to pretend to 
he judge and executioner upon these men as crimiiuls, whom 
Kcsven had thought fit fi?r f*o many ages to sufirr, unpunished,

jblood which ihey shed promiscuously one upon another. I debated 
:his very often with myself thus ; How do I know what God him- 
[self judges in this particular case ? It is certain these people do not 
:on]init this as a erirne ; it is not agiinst their own consciences 
■eproving, or their light reproaching them. They do not know 
it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of divine justjcc, 
we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it ro 
lore a crime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill 
lan ox ; nor to eat human fleshy than we do to eat mutton. 

When I had considered this a little, it followed necessarily, 
:hat I was certainly in the wrong in it; that these people were 
not murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them in 
ly thoughts^ any more than those Christians were murderers, 
who often put to deatfi the prisoners taken in battle, or more 
frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to

peddle with them, unless they first attacked me, and this it wa» 
Uny buMne^H, if jKAMiblr, to prevent; hiil lh;il, if I wcrr dia* 
licoverrd and attacked, then I knew my duty. 

On the other hand, I ai^ued with myself, that this really was 
be way, not to deliver myftcif, but entirely to ruin and destroy 
nyscif ; for unless ! ^-as sinr (o kill every ocie that not only 
ibould be on shore at that time, but that should ever come on

miy bring upon myself a certain destruction, which at pnscnt I 
lid no manner of occa^aon for. 

irpon the whole, I concluded, thnt neither iit {mneipW nor in

hat my business was by all possible means to conceal myself

to all the contrivances diat I had laid for my fulorc accommor

now tipon my hands than that of my food. 1 cared not to dnve 
ft ault or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise 1 should 
make should be heard; much lew would I fire a gioi, for the 
«BD3e ictson ; and above all, I wa» intolerably imcasy at making 
any 6ki lest the amoJce, which is visible at a great distance lA

'anting for at home, without danger of smoke. 

But this is by the bye. While I was cutting do>vn some wood 

lere, I perceived that behind a very thick, branch of low brush- 

'ood» or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place, I was 

:unous to look into it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth

to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me ; but I must 

lonfcss to you, 1 made more haste out than I did in; when 

looking farther into the placCj and which was perfccdy dark, I 

iw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or 

lan I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim light 

'om the cave's mouth shining direcdy in, and making the

I stirred him a little Co sec if I could get htm out, and he 
csanrcd to get up, but was noC abk to r^sc himself; and I 
thought with mywlf, he might even He there; for if he had 
frighted me so, he would certainly fright tuiy of the savages, if 
any of them should be so hardy as to come in there, while he 
hud nny life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and beg;an to look 
roond me, when I found the cave was but very small ; that b to 
aajr^ it might be about twelve foot over, but in no manner of 
AapCf riiher round or ^uart, no hands ever having bceji em- 
ployed in making it but those of mere nature. I observed also, 
that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in farther, 
but was so low, that it required me to cteep upon my hands and 
Ico0ts to go into it, and whither I went, I knew not; so having 

00 candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to come 
again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box, 
which 1 had made of the lock of one of the mu«|iKts, with lome

Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six tai^ 
candles of my own making (for I made vrx^- good candles now 
of goflta tallow) ; and going into thit k>w pUce, I was obliged to 
accp upon all foun, as I havf said^ almost ten yards ; which, by

Then I prepared myself within, putting ra^'self in a posture of

my niind* being satisfied fhit 1 might go abroul with safety 
the rime of the tide of floods if they were not on shore before; 
and having made this observation, I w«nc abroad about mr 
haivcst work with the more composure. 

As I t:xjtA:1cd, 4L) \i proved ; fur us ftoori -jh the tide iiiatle to- 
the ^/sJKvarJ, I saw them all take boat^ and row (or paddle at 
we call it) all away. I should have observed* that for an hov

easily discern their posaires and gestures by my glasses ; I ootti 
not pcTcdvc, by my nicest observ^tioii> but that they were start

they were men or womt-n, that I could not disiinguish. 

As soon as I saw them ^pped and gone, 1 rook rwo guni 
upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my grcar

saw they were all at sea together, making over for the main. 

This WIS a dreadful sight Xo me, esjiccially when goii^ dow

work the)' had been aliout had left behind it, wa:, the blood, 
boned, and port of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devou 
by those wretches with merrimenr and sjwrt. I was so filled with i

It feemed evident to me, that thx: visits which they thiw maVc 
to thb tsJand arc not very frequent; tor tc was above bltccn 
motitha before amy more of them came on shore there again ; 
tint tt to 5Xy, I neither uw them, or xny footsteps or ngnals of 
them, in all that time ; for as to the ntiny seasoiv^i then they are 
sure not to come abroad, at Jcast not so &r : yet all this while I 
lived uncomforuhly, hy re^^on of the constant apprehensions I 
waa in of their coming upon me by surpnsc; from whence I 
observe, that the expectation of evil ts more bitter than the 
auflerirg, especially if there Is no room to shake o#'that expec- 
tation or tha«e apprehensions. 

During all thifi time, I was in the murdering humour; and 
took up trwst of my hours, which should have been better 
employed^ in cofitritrirtg how to circtimvent and full ii[x>n them 
the very t%cxt time I should see them ; especially if they «houkl 
be drvided, as they were the last time, into two parties; nor did 
I consider ai all, that if [ killed one l^arty, suppose ten or a 
dozen, I was »till the next <Uy, nr week, or month, to kil! 
another, and so another, even aJ infinUnm^ till I should be at 
length no less a muidercr than they were m being man-caters, 
and pcrh^ much mure so. 

I spent my da\*s now in great perplexity and anxiety- of mind, 
cxpeciji^ that I should oik day or other fidl into the hands of 
ibeaic merciless creatures. And if I did at any time ventutv 
abroad, it wax not without looking tokwA txk. with the greatest 
eare and caution Imaginable ; and now I found to my gmi 
comfbrtt how ha})py it waa that I provided for a tame flock or 
herd of giiits; fur I durst not^ upon uiy account, fire my gun, 
e^iecially near that side of the island where they usually came, 
lest I i^hould alarm the savages; and if the}- had fled from me 
now, I was sure to have them come back again, with perhaps 
two Of three hundred tan^ti with chem in a few da\'s^ and cbiCA\ \ 
kaew what to rxpecL

However, I tvotc out a year and three months more hcfatt I 
ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again, 
as I shall soon observe. It is true, they might have been there 
once or twice, but either they made no stay, or, at leasts I did 
not hear them ; but in the month of Mayj as near as I could 
calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very strange 
encounter with them, of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen 
months interval, was very great ; I slept unquiet, dreamed atways 
frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night : 
in the day great troubles overwhelmed my mind ; and in the 
night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and the reasons 
why I might justify the doing of it. But to wave all this fi>r a 
while, it was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I 
think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I 
marked all upon the post still ; I say, it was the sixteenth of 
May, that it blew a very great storm of wind ail day, with a 'great 
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after 
it I know not what was the particular occasion of it ; but as I 
was reading in the bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts 
about my present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a 
gun, as I thought, fired at sea. 

This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite diiFerent nature 
from any I had met with before ; for the notions this put into my 
thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the greatest 
haste imaginable ; and in a trice clapped my ladder to the middle' 
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the 
second time, got to the top of the hill ; the very moment that a 
Hash of fire bade me listen for a second gun, which accordingly 
in about half a minute I heard, and by the sound knew that it 
was from that part of the sea where I was driven out with the 
current in my boat.

cbtun help. 1 had this prerscncc of nund at that minute as to 
thinks that though I could not help ihcni, it may be they might 
help me : so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at 
hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upooi 
the hill : the wood was dry, and biased freely, and though the 
wind blew very )i«ird, yet it burnt fairly oud th^i I v^as certain, 
if there was any such thing as a ihip, they must needs ste it, and 
no doubt they did; for as won as ever my fire biased up, J 
beard another gun, and after that Mivefol othcnt, all from the 
aunc i|uaner. I plied my fire all night long, till day" broke ; 
and when it «'as broad day, and the air cleared up, 1 saw some- 
thing at a great distance a: sea, full caJt of the island ; whether 
a sul or a hull I could mil distinguUh, no, not mith my glaitscs, 
the distance was so great, and the weather still something hazy 
abo ; lit least it was so out at sea. 

I looked frcqiKtitly at it all that day, and soon perceived that 
it did no: move ; so I pnrwntly concluEled tkn i: wx* a xhip xt 
an anchor ; anct being eager, you may be sure, to be Kttisficd, 1 
took my gun in my hand, and run toward the JoalA side of the 
olandj to the rock^, where I had licen formerly carried away with 
the currait ; and getting up there, the weather by this rime being 
perfectly clear, I could pimnly see, to my great sorroWi the wreck 
of a ship cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which 
I ibund when I was out in my boat ; and which rocks, as they 
chfcfcfH^ the violence of the stream, and made a kind of coonier- 
sQream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering then from 
die most desperate, hopeless condirioa, that ever I had been iti|

arly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many 
imes obliges men to stave or take in pieces their boat ; and 
ometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands; other

pot from what it should proceed ; it was doubtless the cfFect of 
xdcnt ^vtshe3, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, reaJizing 
le comfort which the conversation of one of my* fdlow-chris- 
Iians would have been to me, 

But it was not to be ; either their fate, or mine, or both, 

forbid it ; for till the last year of my being on this island, I never

nly the affliction some days after to see the corpse of a drowned 

jy come on shore, at the end of the island which was next the 

shipwreck : he had on no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair 

»fopen-kneed lined drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; but nothing 

direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of i he had 

lothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a tobacco- 

Mpc; the last was lo me often times more value than the first.

fitll of ftc^ warcr, and about two dozen of my Miiall loaves, or 
barlej" cakes, more iSan before, wirh a bottle of goat** milk, and 
a cheese; all which, with great labour and S^JL'elt, I brought to 
my boat ; and praying to Goo to direct my voyage, 1 pat out* 
and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, I came at 
list to the utmosr pomt of the island, on that side, viz. N, E> 
And now 1 was to launch out into the occnn, and dtber to ven- 
ture, or not to venture; I looked on the rapid currents whtcli 
rui eonsctntly on bofh urdes of the island, at a distance, and 
which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of the 
iazird 1 had been m before, and my heart began to fail mc ; for 
t (oreNiw, that if I w;n driveri into acher of tho^e mirrcnn, T 
ihoiild be carried a vast way out to sea, and perhaps out of my 
reach or sight of the bland j^atn ; and that then, as my boat 
was but small, if my little gale of wind should rise, 1 should be 
inevitably k»t. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give 
over my enterprise ; and having hakd my boat into a little creek 
on the shore, I stepped out, eihI sal me down upon a liiclr rising 
Iwt of ground, very pensive and anxious, bctvi'ecn fear and desire, 
about myvoyogc; when, as I was musing, I could pcrccivechat 
the tide was turned, and the fiood come on, upon which my 
going waa far so many hours impracticable: upon tlua it pre- 
aeatty occurred to me, that 1 should go up to the highest piece 
of grotuid I could find, and observe, if 1 could, how the acts of 
the tkle or currmts lay, when the flood came in, that 1 niighi 
judge whether, if I wis driven one way out, 1 might not expect 
to be driven another way home, with the same rapidness of the 
currents. This thought was no sooner in my head, but I cast 
my eye upon a h'rrie bill which suffiaently overWiVjti <wt

close by the shore of the north side \ and that 1 had nothing 
:o do but to keep to the north of the island in my return, and I 
should do well enough.

id I was as happy in not knowing my danger^ as If I had never 
[eally been exposed to it ,■ this furnished my thoughts with many 
'Cry profitable reflections, and particularly this one; How infi-

ind dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him, would 
listract bis mind, and sink his spirits, be is kept serene and calm, 
ly having the event of things hid from his eyes, and knowing 
lothing the dangers which surround him* 

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I 
[ame to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for 
many years in this very island; and how I had walked about

upon coming to mystify and finding ic vrxi no more ch^i a drcam^

Upon this, however, 1 made this corclusion, that my only

gee a savage into my poiuession ; arKl, if possible^ It i^hould be

and should bnng ihither to kill ; but these choughs still were 
attendei.] with this difficidt)', that it was impossible to effrct this 
without auaclcing a whole caravan of them^ and killing them all ; 
and this wu not only a very desperate attempt* and might mi»* 
carry ; but* on the other hand, I hac] greatly scrupled the lawful* 
ness of if to me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of 
shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance, I 
need not repeal the arguments which occurred to me against this, 
rfiey bnng the same mentioned before: but rhough I had other 
reasons ro offer now* viz. that those men were enemies to my 
bfc, and would devour mc, if they could; that it was sclf-prc- 
aenratDOnf in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this 
death of a life, and was acting in my own defeice, as much as if 
they were nctxially assaulting me, and the like ; I say, thou^

Hovrever, at last, after many secret dii^Hitcs with my«]f, and 
after great pcqilcnities about it (for all these argumcnLSt one way 
and anoihcr, struggled in my head a long time), the eager pre*

lyself upon the watch to see them when they came on dhore, 
leave rhc rest to the event, taking such measures as the 
ipportunjty should present, let be whar would be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, 1 set myself upon the 

:out as often as possible, and indeed so often, till I was heartily 

:ired of it ; for it was above a year and a half that 1 wajted, and 

For great part of that time went out to the WiSt end, and to the 

tduth-west corner of the island^ almost every day, to see for 

:anocs, but none appeared : this wa^ very discouraging, and began 

:o trouble me much ; though I cannot say that it did in this case, 

it hid done some time before that, ^iz, wear off the edge of 

if desire to the thing ; but the longer it seemed to be dekyedr 

ic more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at firet so 

LrcftiJ to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen 

ly them, as I was now eager to be upon them. 

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or 



or Robinson Crusos. 211 

myself into all the same postures for an attack that I had formerly 
provided^ and was just ready for action, if any thing had pre- 
sented. Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they 
made any noise -, at length being very impatient, I set my guns 
at the &ot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill 
by my two stages, as usuat ; stan<^ng so, however, that my head 
did not appear above the hill, so that they could not perceive me 
by any means : here I observed, by the help of my perspective 
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number ; that they 
had a fire kindled, that they had had meat dressed ; how they 
had cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was ; but they were 
all dancing in I know not how many barbarous gestures and 
figures, thdr own way, round the fire. 

When I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my per- 
spective two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, 
it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought out for the 
slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fell, being 
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for that 
was their way ; and two or three others were at work immediately, 
cutting him open for their cookery, while the other victim was 
left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him : in 
that very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at 
liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started 
away from themj and ran with incredible swiftness along the 
sands, directly towards me, i mean, towards that part of the 
coast where my habitation was. 

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge) when I 
perceived him to run my way ; and especially when, as I thought, 
I saw him pursued by the whole body ; and now I expected that 
part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would cer- 
tainly take shelter in my grove j but 1 could not depend, by any 
means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz. that tlv^ cftict 
savages would not punuc him thither^ and fcui \itti, ^«<:-

iim ; and still more was I encouraged, when I found he outstripc 

hem exceedingly in running, and gained ground of them, so that 

f he could but hold it for half an hour, 1 saw easily he would 

fairly get away from them all. 

There was between them and my castle the creelc, which I 

lentioned often at the first part of my story, when I landed my 

:argocs out of the ship ; and this I saw plainly he must neces- 

iarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there ; but 

'hen the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, 

lough the tide was then up ; but plunging in, swam through 

about thirty strokes, or thereaboutSj landed, and ran on with 

exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came 

the creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the 

lird could not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked

in the mean time, I dawlj advanced towirds the two that 
followed; tlien rushing at once upon the fbrenu»t, I knocked 
him down with the stock of my jMCce; I was loth to fire, because 
I would not have the rest hear, though at that distance it would 
not have been easily heard; and being out of sight of the smoke 
too, they would not have easily kmiwn what to make of it. 
Having knocked this fellow down^ the other who pursued with 
him stc^>pcd, as if he had been fiifj^tened, and I advanced apace 
towaids him ; but as I came neater, I perceived presently he had 
a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me ; so I was 
then necessitated to shoot at him first ; which I did, and killed 
him at the first shoot. The poor savage who fled, but had 
stopped, though he saw both his enemies fidlen, and killed (as 
he thought) yet was so frighted with the fire and noise of my 
piece, that he stood stock-sdll, and neither came forward or went 
backward^ though he seemed rather inclined to fly still than to 
come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come 
forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way, then 
stopped ^gairif and then a little further, and stopped again ; and 
I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been 
taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies 
were. I beckoned him agun to come to me, and gave him all the 
signs of encouragement that I could think of ; and he came nearer 
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of 
acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him and looked 
pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length 
he came close to me, and he then kneeled down again, kissed the 
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by 
the foot, set my foot upon his head. This, it seems, was in 
token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, and 
made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there 
was more work to do yet ; for I perceived the savage, who I 
knocked dowit, was not kilJed, but stunntd 'witki ^^-Wvnr ^ ^vt^

to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making ^gns to him 
that more might come after them. 

Upon this he signed to me that he should bury them with, 
sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they followed ; 
and so I made s^ns again to him to do so : he fell to work, and 
in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, 
big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, 
and covered him, and did so also by the other. I believe he had 
buried them both in a quarter of an hour : then calling him away, 
I carried him not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on 
the larther part of the island ; so I did not let my dream come 
to pass in that part^ viz, that he came into my grove for 
sheltqr. 

Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a 
draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress 
for, by his running ; and having refreshed him, I made signs for 
him to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had 
laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which 1 
used to sleep upon myself sometimes : so the poor creature lay 
down and went to sleep. 

He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with 
straight long limbs, not too large, tall, and well-shaped, and, as 
I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a very good 
countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have 
something very manly in his face, and yet he had all the sweet- 
ness and softness of an European in his countenance too, especially 
when he smiled : his hair was long and black, not curled like 
wool ; his forehead very high and large, and a great vivacity and 
sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not 
quite black, but very tawny, and yet not of an ugly yellow . 
nauseous tawny, as the Erasiltans and Virginians^ and other 
natives of America are; but of a bright kind of a dun olive 
colour, that hzd in it something very agreeabVe, livou^ w^x. n^:x^

ihcy were gone, and had left their two comnwles l>ch!fid thenij 
without any search aiter them. 

But I wtt not content with this diKOvcry ; but having now

my veins, ajtd my heart sunk within me at the horror of the 
■pecHcle : indeed it was a dreadful sight, at leiut it was 90 10 
AC, though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered 
with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, great 
piece* of fledi left here and there half-oten, mangled, and 
scorched ; and, in short, all the tokens of the triumphant fea« 
tfacy had been making there, after a victory over their cncmica. 
I caw three ikullSf five hands, and the bones o( three or four 
kgs and feet, and abundance of other parrs of the bodies ; and 
Friday^ by his signs, made me understand that they brought 
over four prisoners to feast upon ; that three of them were eaten 
up, and that he, pointing to hims-elf, wa.H the fourth : that there 
bad been a great battle between them and their t^ext king, whose

Jfought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather aU the skulls, bones, flesh, and 
'hatever remaned, ajid lay them together on a heap^ and make 

great fire upon it, and bum them all to ashes. I found Friday

that he durst not discover it \ for I hadj by some means, let

When we had done this, we came back to our castle, and

But I needed iK)ne of all this precaution ; for nerer man hod

him ; and I found he was the more amazed, because he did 

tot see me put any thing into the gun ; but thought there must 

some wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing, 

e to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing near or far off: and 

ic astonishment this created in him was such as could not wear 

»fF for a long time ; and I believe, if 1 would have let him, he 

'ould have worshipped me and my gun : as for the gun itself, 

would not so much as touch it for several days after; but 

fould speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when 

le was by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was 

to desire it not to kill him.

TOrk with Friday^ to find out a great tree proper to fell, and 

lake a large pcriagua or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There 

e trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of 

leriaguas and canoes only, but even of good large vessels: but

lOugh, considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that 
Liled, I think it cost me almost as much labour as making the

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as 

^o what belonged to the navigation of my boat i for though he 

.new very well how to paddle the cano?^ he knew nothing what 

jelonged to a sail and a rudder, and was the more amazed when 

ic saw me work the boat to-and-again in the sea by the rudder,

:ourse wc sailed changed ; I say, when he saw this, he stood like 

ine astonished and amazed ; however, with a little use, I made 

ill these things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, 

I'xcept that as to the compass I could make him jnderstind very 

|irde of that : on the other hand, as there was very little cloudy 

'cather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was

whrrr^ 29 I »id in the beginning, I landed my raits from the 
ship; and haling her up to the shore, at high water mark, I 
made my man i-ri^ar dig a httic dock, just b:g enough to bold 
her, and just deep enough to give her water to float in ; and 
then, when the title was out, we made a strong dam crost the

one piftt^, and the other three myself; and in this posture we 
marched out. I took a smal] bottle of rum in my pocket, and

Icclarcd enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular 
leople, and it was lawful for him to attack them- but I could 
say the same with respect to me. These things were so 
■armly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as J went, that I 
lived I would only go and place myself near thcm^ that I 
light observe their harharou*; feast, and that I would act then 
God should direct; but that unless something offered that 
'as more a call to me than yet I knew of, 1 would not meddle 
nth them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with ail possible 
■ariness and silence (^Friday following close at my heels) I 
larchcd till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the aide which 
'35 next to them ; only that one corner of the wood lay between 
je and them : here 1 called softly to Fridayj and shewing him 
great tree, which was just at the comer of the woodj I bade 
lim go to the tree, and bring mc word if he couM sec there 



held my passion^ though [ was indeed enraged to the highest 
degree; and going ligick atiout twenty paces, I got behind soonc 

I bushes, luhich hcU all the way till I came ro the other tree, and 
then 1 caroc to a little ridng ground^ which gave mc a full view 
of them, at the dbtancc of about eighty yards. 

1 had now tv.it a moment to lose ; for luiiccoeii of the dreadiViI

^ jo*t sent the other two to butcher the poor Chhsiiav, and bring 
him, perhaps limb by limb, to their Arc; aiul the)' wrrc scooped 
down to untie the IxLiida at his feet. I (unml to Fndajr ; Now, 
FriJ^t «^ 1, do as I bid thee. Friday said» he would. Then, 

' Friday^ says I, do exactly as you see me do ; lail in nothing. So 

j I act down one of the muskets and the fjwling-piccc u|>on the 
ground, and Frider^ did the like by his; and with the other 
musket I took my aim at the ravages, bidding him do the like. 
Then asking him if he was ready, he said» Yes. I'hcn Are at 
ihem, ^d I ; and the »une moment I Ared also, 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side 
thai he shot, he killed nvo of them, and wounded three more ; 
and on my side, 1 killed one, and wounded two. They were, 
you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation; and all of them, 
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet» b«l did not imme- 
diately know whkh way to run, or which way to look ; for they 
knew not fruni whence their dcsiruction canit-. Friday kq>i his 
«yes close upon me, that as I had btd him, he m^ht observe 
what I did ; so as scon as the lirst sho* was made, I threw down 
llic piece, and took up the fowling-piccc, and Friday did the 
Hke: he sees me cock, anJ prtrsent; he did the same again.

was, as I said, lying upon die beach or shore, between the pLaoc 
where they sat ^nd the sea ; the two butchers, who were j 
going to work with him, had left him, at the surprise of our first 
fire, and fled in a tcnible fright to the sci-sidc, and had jumped 
into a canof, and three more of the rest made the same way: I

tongue, what he was ? He answered in Latin, Christianas ; but 
was so weak and faint, that he could scarce stand, or speak ; I took

he should drink, which he did ; and 1 gave him a piece of breads

was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were so much

mere amazcmtnt and fear, and had no more power to attempt 
their own escape, than their flesh had to resist our shoe ; <tnd that

to keep my charge ready, because I had given the SpoftiarJ my

the trte from whence we fint fired, and fetch the arms which lay 
there, that had been discharged, which he did with great swift- 
oess; and then giving him my musket, I sac down myself to 
load all the rest agauip and bode them come to me when they 
wanted. UTiile I waa loading these pieces, there happened a

delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat ; but when

again like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I

It wa» not ea.sy for me to express how it moved me, to see 
what ecstasy and filial aHectton had worked in this poor savagi^ 
at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death ;

what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub 
them with, which did them a great deal of good. 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the

hat J could not find in my heart to take him off for some time : 
but after 1 thought he could leave him a little, I called him to 
me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the

bread? He shook his head, and said, Ncn£ : uth dor cat

madcj how like a king I looked ; first of all the whole country 
was ray own mere property ; so that I had an undoubted right 
of dominion; idly, [My people were pcrfecdy subjected. I was 
absolute lord and lawgiver ; they all owed their lives to me, and 
were ready to lay down their lives, if thirc had been occasion for 
it J for me ; it wa^ remarkable too» I had but three subjects, and 
they were of three diflerent religions. My man Friday was a 
protestantt his ^ther a fagan and a cannibal ; and the Spaniard 
was a papist : however, I allowed liberty of conscience through-^ 
out my dominions : but this is by the way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and 
given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to 
think of making some provision for them ; and the first thing I 
did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and 
a goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed : when I cut off 
the hinder quarter, and, chopping it into small pieces, I set Fri- 
day to work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good 
dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth ; having put some barley 
and rice also into the broth, and as I cooked it without doors 
(for I made no fire within my inner wall) so I carried it all into 
the new tent ; and having set a table there for them, I sat down 
and eat my dinner also with them; and, as well as I could, 
cheered them and encouraged them, Friday being my interpreter, 
especially to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too : for the 
Spaniard s^^^ the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to 
take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our musquets and other 
fire-arms, which for want of time, we had left upon the place of 
batde ; and the next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would pre- 
sently be offensive ; and I also ordered him to bury the horrid 
remms of their barbarous feast, which I knew were ^tctt^ rcwj:K^

ivas, otherwise than by the comer of the wood pointing to the

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my twa

le thought of the escape ofthejjiTriJ^^w in that canoe ? and whether 
'e might expect a return of them with a power too great for us

Lcver could live out the storm which blew that night they went 
)ff, but must of necessity be drowned or driven scoth to those 
ither shores, where they were as sure to be devoured, as they 
^cre to be drownt^d if they wtire cast away \ but as to what they 
'oidd do if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not : but 
|t was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully frighted with the 
lanner of their bcine attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he

I and all my flnny ; A>r u we wen now four of us, I would hive 
ventured upon a hundred o^" them fairly in the open iidd at any 
dmc. 

I In a little time, however, no more canoes apjx:arinp^ the fear 

of thc^r coming ^-ore ofT, and 1 began to take my former thoughts 

L of a voyage to the main into consideration, being hkcwisc 
avurcd by Frijay's father, that I might depend upon good UKige 
from tkeir nation on his aecount, if I would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a serious 
diKOUT^ with (he Spa/irarJf aiid when I understoodj thar there 
were sixteen more of his couiitrynicn and Poriugt/rs/j who having 
been cast away, and made thdr escape to that side, lived there at 
peace indeed with the savages, but were vcfy sore put to it for 
ntxessaries, and indcrd for lifer. T ^tOced him all the pjirticulaTS 
of their x'oyage, and found they were a Sfsanish ship bound from 
the Hh dt ia PUid to the Havdnna^ being directed to leave their 
heading there, which was chicSy hides and stiver, and ro bring 
bu:k what Eurcpfatt goods they oould meet with there ; thai rhey 
had five p6rtugti€ii seamen on board, who they rook out of ano- 
ther wreck ; that five of their own men were drowned when first 
the ahip WAS lost ; and thai these escaped through infinite dangers 
ind hazards, and arrived almoit starved on the CantriM cotst^ 
where they expected to have been devoured cvcr>' moment. 

f-Ic told me, they had some amis with them, but they were 
perfectly usrle^^ for that they had neither powder or tntl, the 
wnahing of the sea having spoiled all thdr powder, but a little 
which they used at their first landing to provide themselves some 
food. 

I asked him what he thouchc would become of ihem there; 
and if they had formed no design of making any escape ? He 
tnd, chey had many consultations about it; but (hat having 
ncivber vessel, or tools to butlii one, or provisions of any buvL^

I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal 

From mc, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if they 

'ere all here, it might not be done ? 1 lold him with freedom, 

feared mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me, if I put my 

life in their hands ; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in 

jc nature of mail ? nor did men always square their dealings by 

:he obligations they had received, so much as they did by the 

idvantages they expected. I told him, it would be very hard, 

:hat 1 should be the instrument of their dclivcrmcej and that 

:hey should afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spuiit, 

'here an Englishman was certain to be made a sacriiicej what 

lecessity, or what accident soever, brought him thither ; and that 

had rather be delivered up to the savagcT, and be devoured 

ilivej than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be car- 

icd into the inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded,

'I'hcn he toid mc, he would firtt ftwenr rc> mc himself, that he

orders ; and that he would ukc my side to the bat drop of hb 
blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among ha 
oninlrj'men. 

He told me, they were all of them very civil honett men, and 
they were under the greatest distress iiruginable, having nather 
weapons or clorhc^ nor any food, but at the mercy and discre- 
tion of the savagfs ; out of all hopes of rvcr returning to their 
own country ; and that he was sure, if I would imdertake their 
relief^ ihcy would live imd die by me. 

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them* 
if pocsH^le, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard ovifr to 
them to treat : but when he had gotten all things in readiness to 
gOp the SpttmarJ himself started an objection, which had so much 
prudence in !l on on^ hArkt^ and so murh sinccriiy iin the other 
hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it ; and> by 
his advice, put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least 
half a year. The cose was thus: 

1 [e had been with us now about a month ; during which lime 
I had let him see m what manner I had provided, with the assist- 
ance of Providence, for my support ^ and he saw evidently what 
stock of corn and r:ce I had liin up; which, as It was more 
tlojn sufficient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least with- 
oat good husbandry^ for my family, now it was increased to 
nomber four : but much Ic-^ wuuld it be su^ient, if his coun<

I jttrnpeil up, ami, mgardlevi ofdangrr, 1 went out ;t« sMwn aft 
I could get my cloche* on, through my little grove, which (by 
the way) >^^ by t!u3 time grown to be a very thick wood ; I 
say I regardleas of dajigcr* I went without my arms^ which waa 
not my custom to do; but t was surprised, when fuming my 
eyes to the frca, I presently saw a boat at about a league and a 
halTa distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder t/mttt- 
imi sailt as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair lo bring 
them in : also I ob*n.'rvcd presently, that they did not eome from 
that side which the shore lay on, but from the southcrmost end 
of the isUnd. Upon this 1 called Fridaj in, and bid him Ec 
ckae, for xhrsc 'were not thr pncsple we looked for, ami that we 
might not know yet whether they were friends or enemiesi. 

In the next phicc, I went in to fetch my pcTspcctive glaa^, to

Hit, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I 
was apprehetisive of any thing, and to take my view the plainer 
without being dtscovcrcd. 

I had virce set my foot on the hill, when my eye plainly dis- 
covered 3 ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues and a half^

jusincss an English ship could have in that part of the world; 

;mce it was nor the way to or from any part of the world where 
le English had any traffick; and I knew there had been no 

storms to drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they 
:rc English realJy, it was most probable that they were here 

ipon no good design ; and that I had better continue as I was, 
lan fall into the hands of thieves and murderers. 
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger, 
'hich sometimes are given him when he may think there is no 

jossibility of its being real. That such bints and notices arc 

;iven as, 1 believe few that have made any observations of things

of the ihtet I could perceive usirp the most passionate gesturtft

the other two, J couid perceive, lifted up their hands ftomctiincs,

whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amaze- 
ment, and particularly at the wonderful mamicr of my being 
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and indeed, as my 
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply; 
but when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how 1 

Lscemcd to have been prcservetl there on purpose to save his life, 
the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word 

Imore. 

After this communicadon was at an end, I carried him and 

Ihis two men inro my aparrmenc, leading them in just where I

wu a ^cry rational conclusion, and that therefore something wa» 

I to be resutvrd on very speedily, v% well i\> draw the nvcn on

' landing upon us, and dcstroj'ing us: upon this it presently 

occurred to me^ that in a litde while^ the ^ip^a cn::Wf wondering 

whit waa become of thdr coincides, and of the boar^ would 

certainly come on shore in their other boat to sec for them ; and 

tlut then perhaps they might come anncdt and be too strong for 

us: this he allowed was rational. 

Upon this 1 told him, the first thinp we were to dOj was to 
stave the boat, which lay upon the t>each» so that they might not 
cany her off; and taking every thing out of her, leave her so 
{%r tisetoa ai not to be fit tu swim; accordingly we went on 
boardi took the arms which were left on board out of her, and 
whatever ebe we found there, which was a bottle of brandy, and 
another of runt^ » (c^ bisttiit L:UcOf a horn of powder, arid 11 
great lump of sugar in a piece of canvass ; the sugar was five 
or flJC pounds; all which was very welcome to mp, especially 
the brandy and sugar, of which 1 had had none left for many 

When we had cairied all these things on shore (the oars, 
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat, wcjv carried away before, « 
above), we knocked a great hole in her boaom, rh:ti if they had 
cotBC strong enough to muster us, yet they could not curoj <£

Indeed It was iioc muck in mj thoughts, that wc could be 

lie to recover the ship ; but my view was, that if ihey went 

tway without the boat, I did not much question to make her fit 

igain to cany us away to the Lec'ward Islands, and call upon our 

Friends the Spaniards in my way ; for I had them still in my 

Loughts. 

Whik we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by 

Lain strength, heaved the boat up upon the beach, so high that 

tide would not float her ofF at high-water mark. ; and^ 

jEides, had broken a hole in her bottom, too big to be quickly 

itopped* and were sat down musing what we should do, we heard 

je ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her ancient, 

a signal far the bust to come on board, but no boat stirred ; and 

ey fired several times, making other signals for the boat. 

At last, when all thdr signals and firings proved fruitless, and 

:hey found the boat did not stir, we saw them (by the help of 



or RofiiNsoK Crusoe. I7j 

Am new enrerprize ; and wrribly apprehensive he was, that they 
would be too po^vc^fuJ for us, 

I unilcd at htm, and told him, that men in our drcumstances 
were put the operation of fear: thai seeing almoft every con- 
dition that could be wii better than that we were supposed to be 
iHi we ought to expect thai the con<(cqucncc, whether death or 
life, would be sure to be 3 deliverance. I asked him, what he 
dxiught of the circumstances of my life, and whether a deliver- 
iftce w-as not worth venturing for? And where, Sir, aaid 1, i» 
jFOur belief of my beir»g preserved here on purpose to save your 
life, which elcfvated you a licile whiJe ago ? For my pnit» stid 
I, there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it. 
H^kat w /Atf// sa>-s he. Why, said 1, it is that, as you say, 
there arr rhnre or four honest frUows among them, which ^h^iuld 
be ^Mred; had they been all of the wicked p*rt of the crew, I 
thould have thought God'& providence had singled ihem out to 
deliver them into your hands ; fc:ir, depend upon it, every man 
of them That comes ashore arc our own^ and shall die or live, as 
they behave io lis. 

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, 
I found it greatly encoumgcd him; so wc set vigorously to our 
bustncis ; we had, upon the first appearance of the boat's conung 
from the ship, con^crcd of separating our prisoners, and had 
indeed secured them effectually. 

Two of them, of whom the captain was lea a^ure:] than 
ordinary, I scnr with Frijay^ and one of the three (delivered 
men) to my cave, where they were ienK>tc e™>ugh, and out of 
danger of bcir^ heard or discovered, or of finding their way out 
of the woods, if they could have delivered themselves; here 
lliey left them bound, but gave them provisions, and promised 
ihcm, if they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty 
in a day or two; but that if ihcy aitrmpted their esca^ tW^ 
rtiould be put to di:^th v/ithont mercy, Tl\c^ ^omte^ i'a^-

[lly to bear their confinement with patience> and were very 

lankful that they hid such good usage as to have provisions, 

light left them; for Friday gave them candles (such as 

^e made ourselves) for their comfort; and they did not know 

>ut that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage ; two of them were kept 

Hnioned indeed, because the captain was not free to trust them ; 

lut the other two were taken into my service upon their captain's 

xommendationj and upon their solemnly engaging to live and 

ie with us; so, with diem and the three honest men, we were 

'vcn men wdl arrntd; and I made no doubt we should be able 

^o deal well enough with the ten that were coming, considering 

lit the captain had said> there were three or four honest men 

tmong them also. 

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, 
;hey ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore, hauling 

which I was ^lad to see : for I was afraid

dercd, sncl the long-boat staved; accordingly, they tmmcdutcly 
kunchcd rhc hnxt agiun» and got nil of them on board. 

The eapnin was terribly am;ized, and even confounded at 
this, believing they would go on booid the ship again, and set 
aail, giving their comrades up for Iwtt, nrd «o he should still lose 
the ahi[^ whkh he was in hopct we should have recovered ; bnt 
he waa quickly at much frighted the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, but wc per- 
ceived them all coming on shore again; but with this new 
measure in their conduct, which, it seems, they consulted together 
upon, viz* to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go on 
dwrc, and go up into the country to look for their fellows. 

This WRs a great di^ppointmeTit to us ; for now we were at x 
I068 what to do ; for our seizing those seven men on shore would 
be no advant^c Co us if wc let the boot escape; because they 
would then ruw away to the ship; and then the mt of them 
would be sure to weigh, and set sail, aDd so our recovering the 
ship would be lost. 

However, wc had no remedy but to wait and »cc wl\at the 
ianae of things might prcscni: the ^vcii men came on shore^ 
and the three who remained in the boat put her oiF to a good 
distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to watt for 
diem; so that it \v2s imposable for us to come at them in the 
boar. 

Those that came on shore kept ctcac together, marchtng 
towsnls the top of the little hill, under which my habttatton 
la^ ; and wc could sec them plainly, though chcj' could not per- 
ceive us : wc could have been vrry^ gkd diey would have come

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this con-

hould all salJy upon them, just at the juncmre when their pieces

but I presently thought of a snatagcni to fetch them back again* 
ami which answered my end to a tittle. 

I ordered Fridj^y and the captain's trute, to ^ over the little

thicni as far into the island, and among the woods, as po^iblcf 
and then wheel about Rg;tin to mc> by such ways as 1 directed

They were just goirg into the boat, when FriJay, and the 
mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answerii^ 
nin along the shore wctlwarti towanb the vokc they heird, 
when they were prc*cntly stopped by the creek, where, the water 
being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to 
CQtnc up, and set them over, a^ indeed I o:pccted- 

When they had act themselves over, I observed that the txat

Hfrbour within the land, they took one of the three men out of

fastened her to the xiump of a little free on the ahocc 

This was what I wished for, and tmmedkatety leaving FHJay 
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me, 
and eroanng the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two 
men before they were aware, one of ihem lying on diorr, and 
the other being in the boati the fellow on shore was between

In the mean time, Friday and the captain^s mate so well 

lanaged their business with the rest, that they drew them, by 

lallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one 

'ood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left 

lem where they were very sure they could not reach back, to the 

loat before it was dark ; and indeed they were heartily tired 

lihemselves also by the time they came back to us,

My men woitld fsdn have had mc given them leave to fidl

at tome advantage, ^ to spare them, and kill as few of ihem as 
1 could ; and especially I wis unwilling to hazard the killing any 
of our own men, knowing the other were very well armed : I 
resolved to yvM to see if they did not separate ; and rherrforc, to 
make sure of them, 1 drew my ambuscade nearer ; and ordered 
Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and Icct as dose 
to the ground as ihey could, thai they might not be discoveroli 
and get aa near them sis they eould pos^bly, before they oAcred 
to fire. 

They had not been long in Ehat po8t\ire but that the boatswain, 
wbo was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now 
shewn himself the most dejected and dispirited of ill the rett, 
came walking towards them with tv^o more of the crew; the 
captain wu?tso «gcr, aji having this prirripAl niguc u> much m

so near aa to be sure of him ; for they only heard his tongue

The boatsA^ain was killed upon the spot; the next man was

reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired; f<x 
indeed tt was easy to think, as their condition then was, they 
would be very willii^ to capitulate ; so he calls out, as loud as 
he could, to one of them, Tom Smithy Tom Smith. 7m Smith 
answered immediately, IVho's that ! Robinson ! For it seems he 
knew his voice. The other answered, ^, ay ; Jbr Go^s sake^ 
Tom Smith, throw down your arms, and yields or you arc all dead 
men this moment. 

Who must we yield to f Where are they ? says Smith again. 
Here they are^ says he : here is our captain and fifty men with 
him, have been hunting you this two hours; the boatswsun is 
killed ; Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner ; and if you 
do not yield, you arc all lost. 

Will they give us quarter then ? says Tom Smith, and we will 
yield. rU go and ask, if you promise to yield, says Robinson. So 
he asked the captain, and the captain himself then calls out; 
You, Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down your arms 
immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will 
Atkins. 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out. For God's sake, captain, give 
me quarter : what have I done f they have been all as bad as I: 
(which by the way was not true, neither ; for it seems this Will 
Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they 
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, and 
giving hira injurious language:) however the captain told him 
he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the go- 
vernor's mercy, by which he meant me; for they all called me 
governor- 

In a word, they aJI laid down th^r arms, and begged thdr 
lives ; and 1 sent the man that had parlied with them, and two 
more, who bound them all ; and then my great army of fifty

They all appeared very pcnitenr, and begged hard for their 
fives* As for thai he told them they were none of his praoncrs, 
but the commander of the Ulu^d ; that they thought they had 
xct him on shore in a barren uninhabited id^tnd ; but it had 
pleased God so to direct them, that the island ^«^ inhibited, and 
that the governor was an hngShhman ; tluit he might hang them 
all thcre^ if he pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, he 
f up po t ed he would send them to England^ to be dndt with there 
IS justice rcciuircd, except Jikinst whom he was commanded by 
the governor to advise to prepare for death; for that he would 
be hanged in the moming. 

Though this was all a Action of hli own, yet it had its desired 
efiect : ^itktiu fell uixin his knees to beg the captain to intercede 
with the gi^vemor for his life^ :uid all the rest begged of him

Iseizing the shipj which he iikcd of wonderfully well, and resolved 
to put it in exccjtion the next momirg. 

But, in order to execute it with more art, and secure of suc- 
Icess, I told him we must divide Che prisoners, and that he should 
go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and 
send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay ; this was 
committed to Friday^ and the two men who came on shore with 
|the captain. 

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison ; and it was 
indeed a dismal place, especially to men in their condition. 

The other I ordered to my hwer^ as I called it, of which I 
Ihave given a full description ; and as it was fenced in, and they 
pinionedj the place was secure enough, considering they were

so he brought nw an account of the temper he found thcni in, 
and that he verily believed they would be faithfid, 

However, that wc might be very secure, I told him he should 
go hack again, and choose out those Avcj and tell them, rhcy

cbOK five to be his Assistants, and that the governor would keep 
the ocher two> and the three that were ^scnt prisoners to the caatjc, 
(ayf cazr) as hi>stagc*i, for the fidelity nf thotc five; and that if 
they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages sb 
be hanged in chains olive upon the shore. 

This looked severe^ and convinced them that the governor 
was ID earnest; however^ they had no way left them but to 
acGSpt it ; and it was now the busbtens of the prisoners, as much 
V of the captain, to persuade the other five to do thdr duty.

I aiked the captain if he was willing to venture with these 
hands on board the ship : for ha for me and my man Friday, I 
did noe think it waa proper for us to stir, having seven nxn left

When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it was with the 
laptain, who told them, I was the person the governor had 
frdered to look after theitij and that it W05 the governor's plea- 
sure that they should not stir any where but by my direction j 
lat if they did, they should be fetched into the castle, and be 
laid in irons ; so that as we never suffered them to sec me as

governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, up<Mi all 
iccasions. 

The captain now had no difiiculty before him, but to furnish

As 30on as the ship was thus secured, chc oiptain ordered

me, to give me notice of hh success ; which you may be sure I 
was ver)' glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it 
till near two of rhc clock in the morning. 

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down ; and it 
hsving been a day of great fttiguc to me, 1 slept very sound, till 
I WB3 something surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently 
ttimng up, 1 heard a man call me by the name of Governor,

they wciT such rogues, that there was no oMiging them ; and if 
he did carry them away it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be 
delivered over to justice at the first Engiish colony he could come 
at; and I found that the captain himself was very aaaious about

2j6 Life and ADVEMTritES 

could see a gtcat ivay in the valley and woods, which lay towards 
the north-east part^ and where the island lay lowest, they shouted 
and hallooed till they were weary ; and not caring, it seems, to 
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat 
down together under a tree, to consider of it : had they thought 
fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party of them had 
done, they had done the job for us ; but they were too fiill of 
apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they 
could not tell what the danger was they had to fear neither. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this corn 
sultation of theirs ; viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley 
again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we 
should all sally upon them, just at the juncture when their pieces 
were all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we 
should have them without bloodshed. I liked the proposal, 
provided it was done while we were near enough to come up tu 
them, before they could load their pieces ag^n. 

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time, 
very irresolute what course to take ; at length I told them, tiierc 
would be nothing to be done in my opinion till mght; and 
then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find 
a way to get between them and the shore, and so might use some 
stratagem with them in the boat, to get them on shore. 

We waited a great while, though very impatient for their 
removing, and were very uneasy : when, after long consultations, 
we saw them start all up, and march down toward the sea: it 
seems, they had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the 
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board tht ship 
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with their 
intended voyage with the ship- 
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, 1 unagined 
k to be as it really was ; that they had given over their soi^ 
and were for going W:V. ^x^m; and the c^^tun, as sooa as I told 



''%' 



or RomvioK Otuioi, 277 

him my tfioughts, was ready to nnk at die i^spidiettnons of it ; 
but I presently thought of a stnttagem to fetch them back again> 
and n^iich answered my end to a tittle, 

I ordered Frid^^ and the o^ttain's niatej to go orer the little 
creek xBestward, towaida the pUce whem the wvsges came on 
shore when Friday was rescued; and as soon as they came to a 
little rising ground,at ^xmt half a mile cUstance^I bade them halloo 
as loud as ^ey could, and wait till they found the seamen heard 
them ; that as soon as cTcr they heard the seamen answef them, 
they should return it again, and then^ keeping out of sight, take 
a round, always answering when the otheis hallooed, to draw 
them as far into the island, and among the woods, as )>09^ble, 
and then wheel about again to me, by such ways as I directed 
them. 

They were just going into the boat, when Fridtr^^ and the 
mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answeiii^ 
run along the shore v^eittsard towards the voice they heard, 
when they were presently stopped by the creek, where, the water 
being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to 
cpme up, and set them over, as indeed I cxpected- 
f When they had set themselves over, I observed that the boat 
bdng gone up a good way into the creek, and as it were in an 
hirbour within the land, they took one of the three men out of 
faff to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, having 
fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. 

This was what I wished for, and inunediately leaving Frid^ 
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me, 
and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two 
taen before they were aware, one of them lying on shore, and 
the other being in the boat ; the fellow on shore was between 
sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the captain, who 
was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and 
then called out tohimin the boat to yield, or he was a dead man. 



27S LlPE AND AdVSNTURBS 

There needed very few arguments to persuade a ^gle man 
to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade 
knocked down ; besides this was, it seems, one of the three that 
were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew^ and 
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afiterwards 
to join very sincere with us. 

In the mean time, Friday and the capt^n's mate so well 
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, by 
hallooing and answering^ from one hill to another, and from one 
wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left 
them where they were very sure they could not reach back to the 
boat before it was dark; and indeed they were heartily tired 
themselves also by the time they came back to us. 

Wc had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the 
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with 
them. 

It was several hours after Friday came back to me before 
they came back to their boat ; and wc could hear the foremost 
of them, long before they came quite up, calling to those behind 
to come along ; and could also hear them answer, and complain 
how lame and tired they were, and not being able to come any 
faster, which was very welcome news to us. 

At length they came up to the boat; but it is impossible to 
express their confusion, when they found the boat fast a-ground 
in the creek. The tide ebbed out, and their two men gone ; 
we could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable 
manner, telling one another they were gotten into an enchanted 
island; that dther there were inhabitants in it, and they should 
all be murdered ; or else there were devils or spirits in it, and 
they should be all carried away and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by thejr 
names a great many times, but no answer : after some time, wc 
could see rhem^ by the little light there was, run about wringing 



OF RoBiNSOK Crusoe, 279 

their hands, like men in despair ; and that sometimes they would 
go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then come ashore 
again, and walk about, and so over the same thing again. 

My men would fain have had me given them leave to fall 
upon them at once in the dark ; but J was willing to take them 
at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as 
I could ; and especially I was unwiUing to hazard the killing any 
of our own men, knowing the other were very well armed ; 1 
resolved to wait to see if they did not separate ; and therefore, to 
make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer ; and ordered 
Friday and the capt^n to creep upon their hands and feet as close 
to the ground as they could, that they might not be discovered, 
and get as near them as they could pos^bly, before they oiFered 
to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture but that the boatswain, 
who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now 
shewn himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, 
came walking towards them with two more of the crewj the 
capt^n was so eager, as having this principal rogue so much in 
his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come 
so near as to be sure of him ; for they only heard his tongue 
before; but when they came nearer, the captain and Frijayy 
starting upon their feet, let fly at them. 

The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next man was 
shot into the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die 
till an hour or two after ; and the third run for it. 

At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my 
whole army, which was now eight men; viz. myself general- 
issimo ; Fridayy my lieutenant-general ; the captain anct his two 
men, and the three prisoners of war, who we had trusted with 
arms. 

We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that they could 
not see our number ; and I made the man they had left in 



28o Life and AdvbktukeI 

the boat^ who waa now one c^ uSj to call them by name^ to 
tty if I could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps 
reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired; for 
indeed it was easy to think, zs their condition then was, they 
would be very willing to capitulate ; so he calls out, as loud as 
he could, to one of them, Tom Smithy Tcm Smith, Tern Smith 
answered immediately, IVho's that t Robinson ! For it seems he 
knew his voice. The other answered, ^, ay; for Go^s sake, 
Tom Smithy threw down your armsj andyield^ otym are all dead 
men this moment. 

Who must we yield to? Where are they f says Smith again. 
Here they are^ says he ; here is our capt^ and fifty men with 
him, have been hunting you this two hour^; the boatswain is 
killed ; Will Frye is woundcdj and I am a prisoner ; and if you 
do not yield, you are all lost. 

Will they give us quarter then ? says Tom Smithy and we will 
yield, I'll go and ask, i/you promise te yields says Robinson, So 
he asked the captain, and the captain himself then calls out; 
You, Smithy you know my voice, if you lay down your arms 
immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but WsU 
Atkins, 

Upon this Will Jtkins cried out. For God's sake, captain, give 
me quarter : what have I done f they have been all as bad as I: 
(which by the way was not true, neither ; for it seems this Will 
Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they 
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, and 
giving him injurious language :) however the captain told him 
he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the go- 
vernor's mercy, by which he meant me ; for they all called me 
governor. 

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their 
lives ; and I sent the man that had parlied with them, and two 
jnorcj who bound them all ; and then my great anny of fifty 



OP Robinson Crusoe. 281 

men, which, particularly with those tiiree, were all but dght^ 
came up and seized upon them all, and upon th^ boat, only 
that I kept myself and one more out of «ght, for reasons of 
state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of seizing 
the ship ; and as for the capt^n^ now he had leisure to parley 
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of their 
practices with him, and at length, upon the ferther wickedness of 
their design ; and how certainly it must bring them to misery 
and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. 

They all appeared very penitent, and be^cd hard for thdr 
lives. As for that he told them they were none of his prisoners, 
but the commander of the island ; that they thought they had 
set him on shore in a barren uninhabited island ; but it had 
pleased God so to direct them, that the island was inhabited, and 
that the governor was an Englishman ; that he might hang them 
all there, if he pleased ; but as he had given them ali quarter, he 
supposed he would send them to Englandy to be dealt with there 
as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by 
the governor to advise to prepare for death ; for that he would 
be hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired 
effect : Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede 
with the governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him 
for God's sake, that they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was 
come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fel- 
lows in to be hearty in getting possession of the ship ; so J retired 
in the dark from them, that they might not see what kind of a 
governor they had, and called the captain to me ; when J called, 
as at a good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again, 
and say to the captdn. Captain the commander calls for you : and 
presently the captain replied. Tell his excellency I am just a coming. 



SSl LtFl AMD ADTBNTURE5 

This more perfectly flmu^ed them * «id they all believed, that 
^e commander was just by with his fifty men. 

Upon i±e captsun's coming to me, I told him my project fbr 
seizing the ship, which he liked of wonderfully well, and resolved 
to put it in execution the next morning. 

But, in order to execute it with more art, and secure of suc- 
cesS) I told him we must divide the pmoner^} and that he should 
go and take Atkins^ and two more of the worst of them, and 
send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay ; this was 
committed to Frid^j and the two men who came on ^ofc with 
the captain. 

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison ; and it was 
indeed a dismal place, especially to men in their condition. 

The other I ordered to my hfywer^ as I called it, of which I 
have given a fiJl description ; and as it was fenced in, and they 
pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were 
upon their behaviour. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter 
into a parley with them : in a word, to try them, and telt me, 
whether he thought they might be trusted or nOf^to go on board, 
and surprise the ship : he talked to them ofme injury done him, 
of the condition they were brought to : and that though the go- 
vernor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present 
action, yet that if they were sent to England^ they would all be 
hanged in ch^ns, to be sure ; but that if they would join in so 
just an attempt, as to recover the ship, he would have the go- 
vernor's engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be 
accepted by men in their condition \ they fell down on their knees 
to the captain, and promised with the deepest imprecations, that 
they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they 
should owe their lives to him, and would go with him all over 
die world ; that they would own him fbr a fathcx to them tf 
ong as they lived. 



OF Robinson Crusoe, 283 

Well, says the captain, I must go and tell the governor what, 
you say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it : 
so he brought me tag account of the temper he found them in, 
and that he verily believed they would be ^thful. 

However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should 
go back again, and choose out those five, and tcU them, they 
might see that he did not want men ; that he would take out 
those fi^ to be lus as^stants, and that the governor would iceep 
the other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle, 
(mj cave) as hostages, for the fidelity of those five ; and that if 
they proved unfaithful in the execudon, the five hostages should 
be hanged in chains alive upon the shore. 

This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor 
was in earnest ; however, they had no way left them but to 
accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much 
as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do thdr duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition, i. 
The captain, his mate, and passenger. 2. Then the two pri- 
soners of the first gang, to whom, having their characters from 
the captain, 1 had given their liberty, and trusted them with arms, 
3> The other two who I had kept till now in my bower pinioned ; 
but, upon the captain's motion, had now released, 4, These 
five released at last ; so that they were twelve in all, besides five 
we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these 
hands on board the ship : for as for me and my man Friday, I 
did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left 
behind ; and it was employment enough for us to keep them 
asunder, and supply them with victuals. 

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast ; but 
Friday went twice a day to them, to supply them with necessa- 
ries ; and I made the other two carry provisions to a certain dis- 
tance, where Friday was to take it. 



384 Life and Adventures 

When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it was with the 
captain, who told them, I was the person the governor had 
ordered to look after them, and that it was the governor's [Jesk 
sure that they should not sdr any where but by my direction ; 
that if they cUd, they should be fetched into the castle, and be 
laid in hrons ; so that as we never suffered them to sec mc as 
governor, so I now appeared as another person, and spoke of 
the governor, the garrison, the casde, and the like^ upon all 
occasions. 

The captain now had no diiHculty before him, but to furnish 
his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them ; he made 
his passenger captain of one, with four other men ; and himself, 
and his mate, and ^ve more, went in the other; and they con- 
trived their business very well ; for they came up to the ship 
about midnight. As soon as they came within call of the ship, 
he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought off 
the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they 
had found thcmj and the like ; holding theiri in a chatj till they 
came to the ship's side ; when the captain and the mate, cntcrii^ 
iirst with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate 
and carpenter with the butt end of their musquetSj being very 
faithfully seconded by their men; they secured all the rest that 
were upon the main and quarter-dec ksj and began to ^ten the 
hatches to keep them down who were below, when the other 
boat, and their men, entering at the fore-chains, secured the 
forecastle of the ship, and the skutde which went down into 
the cook-room, making the three men they found there pri* 
soners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain 
ordered the mate with three men to break into the round house, 
where the new rebel captiun lay, and, having taken the slann, 
was gotten up, and with two men and a boy had gotten fire-anna 
in their hands ; and when the mate with a crow split open ths 



OP RoBtKSON Crusoe. 2S5 

door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and 
wounded the mate with a musquet ball^ which broke his arm, 
and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. 

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the ro\ind- 
house, wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new cap- 
tain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth> and 
came out ag^n behind one of his ears ; so that he never spoke a 
word ; upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken 
effectually, without any more lives losL 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered 
seven guns to be fired, which was the Kgnal agreed upon with 
me, to give me notice of his success ; which you may be sure I 
was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it 
till near two of the clock in the morning. 

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down ; and it 
having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till 
I was something surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently 
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of Governor, 
governor : and presendy I knew the captain's voice, when climb- 
ing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the 
ship, he embraced me in his arms. My dear friend and delivircr^ 
l^says he, there is your ship^ fw she is all your's, and so are wey 
und all that belong to her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there 
she rode within a little more than half a mile of the shore ; for 
they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of 
her; and the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor 
just against the mouth of the little creek ; and the tide being up, 
the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I 
first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door. 

I was, at first, ready to sink down with the surprise : for I saw 
my deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands, all things easy, 
and a large ship just ready to carry me whither I pleased to go. 
At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one word ; 



^86 Life and Adybktuaes 

but as he had taken me in his anns> I held fast by him, or I 
should have l^cn to the ground. 

He perceived the suiprise, and iznmcdiatcly pulls a bottle out 
of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he brought 
on purpose for me- Aiter I drank it, I sat down upon the 
ground, and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good 
while before I could speak a word to him. 

All this while the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, 
only not under any surprise, as I was ; and he said a thousand 
kind tender things to me, to compose me and bring me to my- 
self; but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all 
my spirits into confusion ; at last it broke out into tears, and in 
a little^while after I recovered my speech. 

Then I took my turn and embraced him as my deliverer, and 
we rejoiced together, I told him, I looked upon him as a man 
sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transactjoji 
seemed to be a chain of wonders ; that such things as these were 
the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence govemiiig 
the world, and an evidence, that the eyes of an infinite power 
could search into the remotest comer of the world, and send help 
to the miserable whenever he pleased. 

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; 
and what heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in 
a miraculous manner provided for one in such a wilderness, and 
in such a desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance 
must always be acknowledged to proceed ! 

When we had talked awhile, the captain told me, he had 
brought me some little refreshments, such as the ship affiuded, 
and such as the wretches, that had been so long his masters, had 
not plundered him of: upon this he called aloud to the boat, 
and bid his men bring the things ashore that were for the go- 
vernor; and indeed it was a present as if I had been one, not 
that was to be carried abng with them, but as if I had been to 
dwell upon the island still, and t^Yc^ *«^:tt ?ii \a ^ without me. 



OF RoBittsQM Crusoe. 2 

First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent coz- 
dial waters, six large bottles of Madfifa wine ; the bottles held 
two quarts a piece ; two pound of excellent good tobacco, twelve 
good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag 
of peas, and about a hundred weight of biscuit. 

He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full 
of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other 
tlungs : but besides these, and what was a thousand times more 
useful to me, he brought me six clean new shirts, six very good 
neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one 
pair of stockings, and a very good suit of clothes of his own, 
which had been worn but very little : in a word> he clothed me 
from head to foot. 

It was a very kind and i^;reeable present, as any one may 
imagine to one in my circumstances ; but never was any thing in 
the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it 
was to me to wear such clothes at their first putting on. 

After these ceremonies passed, and after all his good things 
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what 
was to be done with the prisoners we had ; for it was worth con- 
sidering whether we might venture to take them away with us 
or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible 
and refractory to the last degree ; and the captain said he knew 
they were such rogues, that there was no obliging them ; and if 
he did carry them away it must be in irons, as malefoctors, to be 
delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come 
at ; and I found that the captain himself was very anxious about 

it 

Upon this, I told him, that if he desired it, I durst imdertake 
to bring the two men he spoke of, to make it their own request 
that he should leave them upon the island. I should be very glad 
of that t says the captain, with all my heart. 

Well, said 1, 1 will send for them up, and talk with them for 
you ; so I caused Friday and the two hostages, fot \S\^ ^tx^

them, 1 had had a full account of their vilknous behaviour

Eoccd; however, says the old man* 1 shall give ycm a tnie 
ircount of whit I have received m all, and how I have disjxned 
of it. 

After a few days further conference wiih thb ancient friend, 
be brought mc an accounc of the six first years' income of ni^

of A ^gar-work ; and I found hy ch» atTuunt, rhat every year 
the income corttidcnbly increased : but, as above, the disburso- 
Dicnt being large, the sum at &rst was small : howcrcr, the old 
man let mc sec, that he was debtor to mc 470 moidorcs of gold, 
bciidefl 60 chettf of sugar, and 1 5 douhJe mils of tolucco, which 
were lest in hi^ ship, he having been shipwreclccd eomir^ home 
to LtJicn, about eleven yean after my leaving the place. 

The good nun then began to complain of hi* misfortune*, am) 
how he bad been obliged to make use of my money to recover 
his losses, and buy him a »hare in a new ship; — Hom^ever, my 
old friend, says he, you shall not want a supply in your nc^ 
ccscity ; and as soon as my son rcntms, you shall be fully 
ffllisficd. 

Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives mc 160 P^r-

time> and if it would not straiten him? He told me he could 
not say but it might straiten him a litde : but> however, it was 
my money, and I might want it more than he, 
. Every thing the good man said was full of affection, and I 
could hardly reA^n from tears while he spoke. In short, I took 
one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to 
give him a receipt for them ; then I returned him the rest, and 
told him, if ever I had possession of the plantation, I would 
return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards did: and 
that, as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would 
not take it by any means ; but that if I wanted the money, I 
found he was honest enough to pay me j and if I did not, but 
came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never 
have a penny more from him. 

When this was passed, the old man began to ask me if he 
should put me in a method to make my claim to my plantation. 
I told him, I thought to go over to it myself. He s^d, I might 
do so if I pleased ; but that if I did not, there were ways enough 
to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits 
to my use ; and as there were ships in the river of UsHn^ just 
ready to go away to Brasil^ he made me enter my name in a 
public register, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that I was 
ahve, and that I was the same person who took up the land its 
the planting the said plantation at first. 

This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuratioD 
affixed, he directed me to send it with a letter of his writing, to i 
merchant of his acquaintance at the place ; and then proposed my 
staying with him till an account came of the return. 

Never any thing was more honourable than the proceedings 

upon this procuration ; for in less than seven months I rcc^ved 

a large packet from the survivors of my trustees, the merchants 

for whose account I went to sea, in which were the following 

pardcidar Jetters and papers enclosed.

moidorcs a yor to him during hi» life, out of the efiixts; and 
fifty moidorcs a yau to his aon after hun, fur hU life. And 
rhiis I required my old man, 

I W2S now to consider which way to sttcr my course i>cxt» 
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put 
into my hands; ai>d, indeed, 1 had more care upon my head 
nov than I had in my stieiit state of life in the island^ where i 
wuucd nothing but what I hai, and had nothing but what I 
wanted ; whereas 1 had row a gtea: charge upon me, and my 
btmness was how to tcctire it. I liad never a cave to hide my 
money in, or a place %'here It might lie without lock or Icey, till 
it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body would meddle 
with it. On the cuntnry, 1 knew nor where to put it, or who tu 
tnisc with it; my old patron, the eaptain, indeed, was honest, 
and that was the only refuge I had. 

In the next place, fTiy interest in the Braiilj sccnved tu sii 
mon me thither ; but now I could not tell how to think of 
thither till I had settled my afiairs, and left my eflecis in some 
safe hands behind me. At first I thot^ht of my old friend the 
widow, who, i knew, « as hoMCst, and would be just to me i but 
then she was in yc;u^, and but poor, and, for aught 1 knew, 
m^hr be in debt ; so that> in a word, I hod no way but to go 
bock to ExgUnd myself, snd take my effects with me. 

U was some monthc, however, before 1 resolved upon this; 
and therefore as I had rewarded the old captain fullYt ^^ ^

thinlc of my poor widow, whose husband had been my first bene- 
factor, and she, while it was in her power, my futhful steward 
and instructor- So the first thing I did, I got a merchant in 
Lishn to write to his correspondent in LenJm^ not only to pay 
a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in money a hundred 
pounds Bt)m me, and to talk widi her, and comfort her in her 
poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further 
supply. At the same time I sent my two asters in the country, 
each of them a hundred pounds, diey being, though not in want, 
yet not in very good circumstances ; one having been inanied, 
and left a widow ; and the other having a husband not so kind 
to her as he should be. 

But among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet 
pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, 
that I might go away to the RrasUsy and leave things sail* behind 
me; and this greatly perplexed me- 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasilst and have 
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to the 
place ; but I had some little scruple in my mind about religion, 
which insensibly drew me back, of which I ^lall say more pre- 
Gently. However, it was not religion that kept mc from gcnng 
there for the present ; and as I had made no scruple of bong 
openly of the religion of the country, all the while I was amoi^ 
them, so neither did I yet; only that now and then, having of 
late thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think of 
living and dying among them, I began to regret my having pro- 
fessed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best 
religion to die with. 

But, as 1 have said, this was not the main thing that kept me 

from going to the BrasUs^ but that really I did not know witb 

whom to leave my effects behind me ; so I resolved at last to go 

to England with it, where if I arrived, I concluded I shouU make 

some Acquaintance, or find aomc relstionsj that would be. AkhAil

Jn order to prepare things for my going faonw, I first (the 
Brasii fleet being just going itvny) jt*iu\vcd lo give ans^^ers 
sosmUe to the jun and faiihrul account of things 1 hsul fntm 
thcTKc ; and first to the prior of St- ^ngMJiw, I wrote a letter 
full of thaiiks fur their just dealings, and the offer of the 87a 
moidorc4^. which was undisjwst-d of; which I desired might be 
given, joo 10 the monastery, and 372 to the poor, as the prior 
should direct, dc&tring the good PaJrf'j pravers forme, and the 
like. 

I wrotr next a letter of rhanks to my two trustees, with all 
the acJctiowlcdgment that so much justice and honesty* called for ; 
wfor sendtT^ them any present they were tar above having any 
occision for iL

due to mc> till he should hear from mc more particularly : aasur-

in fJj^f five ptecet of bbclt baiae^ and aome Fisttjtrj lac« of a 
good value. 

Having thus scnlcd my alTairs, sold my cargo, and turned all 
my cilecta into good bilK of cxclunge, rny next difficulty ww$,

the difficulty mcreaiscd upon mc so mucht that though I hod 
once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I akered my miod, 
and that not once, but two or three times. 

It is trucj I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might 
be some of the reasons^ But let no man slight the strong im- 
pulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment. Two of 
the ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean more par- 
ticularly singled out than any other, that Is to say, so as in one 
of them to put my things on board, and in the other to have 
agreed with the captain ; I say, two of these ships miscarried, 
viz. one was taken by the Algerine^ and the other was cast away 
on the Starts near ^orbay^ and all the people drowned, except 
three ; so that in cither of those vessels I had been made miser- 
able, and in which most, it was hard to say. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to 
whom 1 communicated every thing, pressed me earnestly not to 
go by sea ; but either to go by land to the GrGyne^ and cross 
over the Bay of Biscay to RocheiU^ from whence it was but an 
easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and 
Dover; or to go up to Madrid^ and so all the way by land 
through France. 

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at 
all, except from Calais to Dover^ that I resolved to travel all 
the way by land ^ which, as I was not in haste, and did not 
value the charge, was by much the plcasanter way ; and to make 
it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the 
son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with mc; 
after which, we picked up two more English merchants also, 
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris 
only ; so that we were in all six of us, and five servants, the two 
merchants, and the two Portuguese^ contenting themselves with 
one servant between two, to save the charge ; and as for me, I 
got An English sailor to tiavel with me as a servant, besides my

tinued snowing with so much violence, and so long, that the 
jple said, winter was come before its time ; and the roads, 
were difficult before, were now quite impassable ; in a 
^ord, the snow lay In sonic places too thick for us to travcJi 
Lnd lieing not hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries, 
:here was no going without being in danger of being buried alive 
:very step. We staid no Jess than twenty days at Pampeluna; 
'hen (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its 
leing better, for it was the severest winter all over Europf that 
lad been known in the memor}' of man) I proposed that we 
ihould all go away to Fo/ttaraiia, and there take shipping for 
hurdcaux^ which was a very little voyage. 

But while we were considering this, there came in four Fr^ch 
gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French aide of the 
jasses, as we were on the Spanish^ had found out a guide, who 
Lraversinff the country near the head of '

obliged to come bock igain. 

Accordingly wc all set uui from Pamprluna^ with our gU]de» 
on the fifttrcnrh of N^emher^ and indeed, I whs siirprisrd^ when, 
intlead of going forward, he came directly baclc with tts, on the

when having |>as>cd t^-o rtvct^ iind come into the plain countr^'^ 
v.'c found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country 
W38 pleaonc, and no snow to be seen ; but on a suddeii, turning 
CO hb left, he approached the mountairis a^^ther way ; and 
cbough it b true, the hills and ihc precipices looked dreadiu), 
yet he made so many totin>, such meanders, and led us by such 
winding ways, wc insensibly passed the height of the mountain?^ 
without being much incumbcicd with the snow; arnl all un a 
foddcn he shewed ii$ the pleasant fruitful provinces t>\ lutngutd^ 
and Cajcfig^ft all green and flourishing; though indeed it was 
at a great distance, and wc had some ro\igh way to pass yet. 

We were a Hrcle tintuv, hiiwcvcr, when we fot^nd it imowed

but he bid us be easy, we should soon be past it ill. We foui>d, 
indeed, that we b^an to descend every day> and to come mocr 
oprrh than before ; and so, dependmg upon our guide, wc wetit on. 

Jt was about two hours before rught, when our guide being 
aomething before us, and not jttst in sight, out rushed three 
monstrtMis wcJvcs, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way, 
adjwiing to a chick wtxxl: two of the wolves flew upon the 
guide, and hod he been half a mile before us, he had been de- 
voured indeed, before wc could have hdpcd him: one of them 
fiHtrnr'* upon hix hunvc, and the other attacked the man with that

to dnw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to ua moAWtfolL*) .

1, he hallooed, as loud as rhe other, O master I O master!

'ith his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him into the head. 

It 'was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; 
for he, having hetn used to that kiiid of creature in hh countn^ 
lad no fear upon him, but went close up to him, and shot him 
above ; whereas jiny of us would have fired at a farther di5- 
^uicc, and have perhaps cither missed the wolf, or endangered 
ihoorinp; the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I, and 

Indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of 

Viday's pisCoI, we heard on both sides the dismallest howling of 

wolves, and the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountainsj

prisiftg matiTKr, as that which followed between Friday iin<l the 
bear, which gave xm all (though zt first we were fcuqjtiscd and 
afraid for him) thtf greste«t diverHion imaginable; v the bear is 
a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does, 
who is %vr\h and light ; so he has two partjcular qualities, wFuch 
gciicially arc the ndc of his actions; first as to men, nho are 
not his proper prey, I say not his proper prc)% because though 1 
cannot say what excessive hunger might do^ which vn& now their

he doc% not usually attempt thrni, imlrv* thry first art=;c)c him; 
on the contrary, if you meet htm in the woodfi, if yow do not 
meddle with him, he will not meddtc with you; yet then you 
mu&t take care to be very dvil to him, and give him the road ; 
for he is a %'eTy* tucc gentleman ; her will nor go a seep out of the 
way for a priiKc j nay, if you arc really afraid, your best way is 
to look another way, and keep going on ; for sometimes, if you 
Mop, and stand srill, and look siedfssrly at him, he rak^ it for 
tn aifiwit ; and if you throw or loss any thing at him, and it 
hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as your 6nger, 
be takes it for an aifront, and sets all other business aside to 
pursue his rcverge; for he will have satisfaction in point of 
honour, and this is his Rrst quality ; the next is, that if he be 
once affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he has 
hia ncv^ngr, bur f<illow« at a good rouitd rate till he ovcrtidces 
you.

twice over again \ Me eatee him up ; me make you good laugh ;

and gets his boots off in a moment, and put on a pair of pumps 
(as we call the flat shoes they wear) and which he had in his 
pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and, with his gun, 
away he flew, swift like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with 
nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the 
bear could understand him : Hark ye^ hark ye, says Friday y me 
jpeakee wit you. We followed at a distance; for now being 
come down on the Gascoigne side of the mountains, we were

pretty open, though many trees in it scattered here and therc- 

Friday^ who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up 
with him quickly, and takes up a great stone, and throws at him, 
and it hit him j ust on the head ; but did him no more harm than 
if he had thrown it against a wall ; but it answered Friday's end; 
for the TOgue was so void of fear, that he did it purely to make 
the bear follow him, and shew us some laugh, as he called it. 

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he turns 
about, and comes after him, taking devilish long strides, and 
shuiBing along at a strange rate, so as would put a horse to a 
middling gallop : away runs Friday^ and takes his course, as if 
he ran towards us for help ; so we all resolved to fire at once 
upon the bear, and deliver my man ; though I was angry at him 
heartily for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going 
about his own business another way ; and especially I was angry 
that he had turned the bear upon us, and then run away ; and I

The bear soon came to the tree, and ift'e followed at 3 distance ; 
the fir^t thii^ he did, he stopped at the gun, sineJt to it, but let

to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode

When wc came to the tree, there \ras Fridny got out to the

mortcn the story, Friday danccrd so rnuch^ and the bear stood « 
jicklishj that we had laughing enough indeed, but still could not 
rine what the fellow would do i for first we thought he de- 
fended upon shaking the bear off; and wc found the bear was 
lo cunning for that too j for he would not go out far enough 

be thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad claws and 
[eet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, 
ind where the jest would be at last. 

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly ; for seeing rhe bear 
;ling fast to the bough, and that he could not be persuaded to

feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up, and stands still.

Thb wtt9t indeed, a good diversion to lu, biit wc were still in 
s wild pUcCf and our guide very much hun, «ifid what to do wc 
hardly knnv ; the howitrtg of wolvcft run much in my hc-;id ; and 
indeed except the noise I once heard on the shore of yffrUa^ of 
which I have said aomcthtng already, 1 never beard any thing 
that filled mc wifh su much homir. 

These things, and the approach of mght, called as offj <>r else, 
as FriJay would have had uf, we should certainly have taken the 
akin of this monstrous creature uff^ which wa.s worth saving ; but 
wc had rhrre leagues to go, and our guide hastened us ; so m \ 
left him, and went forward on our jouniey. ' 

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep 
and dangcrouM »s on rhe mountains ; and the ravenous ciramrrs, 
IS «c beard afterwatds, wen; come down into the forest and plain 
country^ pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a 
grrat deal of mischief In the villages, where they surprised the 
country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, 
and some people too. 

Wc had one dangcmus place to [oss, which our guide told us, 
if there were any riorc wolves in the countryj we should find 
chem there; and this was In a small plain^ surrounded with woods 
on every side, and a long narrow dciile or lane* which wc were 
to pa.vs to get through the wood, and then wc should come to 
the village where we were to lodge. 

Jt was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the first 
wood ; and a little alter sunset when we came into the plain. 
Wc ruct with nothing in the fint wood, except that in a little 
plain within the wood, which was not above two ^rlonfvs over, 
WC aaw five great wolves cross the road, full speed one after an-

icarted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us ; but we aw 
lo more wolves till we came through that wood^ which was near 
mlf a It^ague, and entered the plain ; as soon as wc came into 
:he plain, we had occasion enough to look ahout us. The fim

'hich the wolves had killed^ and at least a dorcn of them at 
work : we could not s,iy eating of him, but picking of his bones 
■ather ; for they had eaten up all the flesh before. 

We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither 
lid they take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at 
rhcmj but 1 would not suffer him by any means ; for I found we 
'ere like to have more business upon our hands than we were

Thr« gave us Idsure to charge our pieces again, and that we 
might lose no time, wc Iccpt gcirg; but vrc had but little more 
than loaded our fusils^ and put ourselves into a readiness^ when 
wc heard a terrible noise in the same wood, on our it:fi ; only 
that it waft further onward the %ume way we were to go. 

The night was coming ori) and the light b^an to be dusky, 
which nude it the wx>r7C on our side; bvit the noiie increasing^ 
we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yxUing of 
those hellish creatures; and, on a sudden, wc perceived two or 
three troops of wolves on our left, one behind us, and one on 
our front, so that we scenicd lu be surrounded with them ; bow- 
ever, as they did not fall upon u-s wc kept our way fiwwanl, as 
fast as we could make our hon%s go, which, the w^y bdr^ very 
rough, was only a good large trot ; and in this manner we came 
in view of the entrance of a wnod through which we were lo paaSj 
at the farther ride of the plain; but we were gready surprisod, 
when, coRung nearer the lane, or pass, we saw a confused num- 
ber of wolves standing just at the entrance. 

On a sudden, if another opening of the wood, we heard the 
noise of a gun ; and, looking that way, o«it rushed a horse, with 
ft saddle and bridle on him, Hying like the wind, and sixteen or 
acvcntecii wx>tvcs after him fiill speed ; indeed the horse h^ the

But here we had a most horrible sight ; for^ riding up to the 
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcase of ati- 
»ther horse, and of two men devoured hy the ravenous creature, 
tnd one of the men was no doubt the same who we heard fired 
:he gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the 

lan, his head, and the upper part of his body, was eaten up. 

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to 

:alte i but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about 

presently, in hopes of prey ; and I verily believe there were 

hree hundred of them. Ir happened verj' much to our advan- 

lagCj that at the entrance into the wood, but a litde way from it, 

lere lay some large timber trees, which had been cut down the 
lumnier before^ and I suppose lay there for carriage ; 1 drew my 
little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line 

ihind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, ai\d keeping 
:hat tree before us, for a breast-work, to stand in a triangle, or 

iree fronts, indosinc our horses in the centre.

also twelve other gentlemen, with their serTants, some French, 
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were 
obliged to come back ^lun. 

Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with our guide, 
on the fifteenth of N&vefnher^ and indeed, I was surprised, when, 
instead of going forward, he came directly back with us, on the 
aame road that we came &om Madrid, above twenty miles ; 
when having passed two rivers, and come into the pl^n country, 
we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country 
was pleasant, and no snow to be seen ; but on a sudden, turning 
to his left, he approached the mountains another way ; and 
though it is true, the hills and the precipices looked dreadful, 
yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such 
winding ways, we insensibly passed the height of the mount^nSj 
without being much incumbered with the snow; and all on a 
sudden he shewed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc 
and Gascoigney all green and flourishing ; though indeed it was 
at a great distance, and we had some rough way to pass yet. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed 
one whole day and a night, so fast, that we could not travel ; 
but he bid us be easy, we should soon be past it all. We found, 
indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to come more 
north than before ; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on, 

It was about two hours before night, when our guide being 
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three 
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way, 
adjoining to a thick wood : two of the wolves flew upon the 
guide, and had he been half a mile before us, he had been de- 
voured indeed, before we could have helped him ; one of them 
fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with that 
violence that he had not time, or not presence of mind enough, 
to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily* 
My man Friday being next to me, I bid him ride up, and see 



3o6 LiFB AKD Adventures 

what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in ^ht of the 
man^ he hallooed, as loud as the other, O tntuser 1 O masttr! 
But, like a bold fellow, rode directly up to ^c poor manj and 
with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him into the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Fridfff ; 
for he, having been used to that kind of creature in his country, 
had no fear upon him, but went close up to him, and shot him 
as above ; whereas any of us would have lired at a farther dis- 
tance, and have perhaps dther missed the wolf, or endangered 
shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terriiied a bolder man than I, and 
indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of 
Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the dismallest howling of 
wolves, and the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains, 
that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of 
them ; and perhaps indeed there was not such a few, as that we 
had no cause of apprehensions. 

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other, that had 
fastened upon the horse, left him immediately, and fled, having 
happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle 
had stuck In his teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt : 
the man, indeed, was most hurt ; for the raging creature had Irit 
him twice, once on the arm, and the other time a little above 
his knee ; and he was just as it were tumbling down by the 
disorder of the horse, when Friday came up, and shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's pistols we 
all mended our pace, and rid up as fkst as the way (which was 
very diflicult) would give us leave, to sec what was the matter: 
as soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, 
we saw plainly what had been the case, and how Friday had 
<iUsengaged the poor guide ; though we did not presently discern 
what kind of creature it was he had killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a sur- 



OF RoBtKSON Cruiob- ^07 

prising manner, as that which followed between Friday and the 
bear, which gave us all (though at first we were surprised and 
afraid for him) the greatest diversion imaginable ; as the bear is 
a heavy, dumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf docs, 
who is swift and light ; so he has two particular qualides, which 
generally arc the nde of his actions ; first as to men, who are 
not his proper prey, I say not his proper prey, because though I 
cannot say what excessive hunger might c^, which was now thdr 
case, the ground being all covered with snow ; yet as to men, 
he does not usually attempt them, unless they first attack him ; 
on the contrary, if you meet him in the woods, if you do not 
meddle with him, he will not meddle mth you ; yet then you 
must take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road ; 
for he is a very nice gentleman ; he will not go a step out of the 
way for a prince ; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way b 
to look another way, and keep going on ; for sometimes, if you 
stop, and atand still, and look stedl^tly at him^ he takes it for 
an affront ; and if you throw or toss any thing at him, and it 
hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger, 
he takes it for an affront, and sets all other business aside to 
pursue his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in point of 
honour, and this is his first quality ; the next is, that if he be 
once afironted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he has 
his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes 
you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came 
up to him, he was helping him ofF from his horse ; for the man 
was both hurt and frighted, and indeed the last more than the 
first i when, on the sudden we spied the bear come out of the 
wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that 
ever I saw : we were all a little surprised when we saw him ; but 
when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the 
fellow's countenance : 01 0! 0! says Friday, three times.

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance; 
the first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let 
it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, 
though so monstrously heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I 
thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see any thing 
to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode 
nearer to him- 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the 
small end of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got about 
half way to him ; as soon as the bear got out to that part where 
the limb of the tree was weaker, Ha^ says he to us, now you see 
me teachee the bear dance ; so he falls a jumping, and shaking the 
bough, at which the bear b^;an to totter, but stood still, and 
began to look behind him, to see how he should get back ; then 
indeed we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with 
him by a great deal : when he sees him stand still, he calls out 
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak Englhhy 
H^hat^ you come no further ? Pray you CQme further. So he left 
jumping and shaking the trees; and the bear, just as if he un- 
derstood what he said, did come a little further; then he fell a 
jumping again, and the bear stopped again. 

We thought now was a good time to knock him on the head, 
and I called to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the 
bear ; but he cried out eamesdy, O pr^ I O pr^ ! no s/tootj mi 
shoot by and then ; he would have said ^ and iye* However^ to

shorten the story, Ftiday danced so much, and the bear stxxxl so 
ticklishj that we had laughing enough ladeed, but still could not 
iRiagine what the fellow would do ; for first we thought he de- 
pended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bear was 
too cunning for that too ; for he would not go out &r enough 
to be thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad claws and 
feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, 
and where the jest would be at last. 

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly ; for seeing the bear 
cling fast to the bough, and that he could not be persuaded to 
come any farther, WeU^ weil^ says Friday ^ you no c^tfu fartlm^ 
me go^ me go ; you no come to me, me go come te you ; and upon 
this he goes out to the smallest end of the bough, where it would 
bend with his weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sliding 
down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on his 
feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up, and standi still. 

Well, said 1 to him, Fridayj what will you do now ? Why 
don't you shoot him : No sheoty says Friday, no yet ; me shost 
niw me no kill; me st^ give you one more laugh; and indeed so 
he did, as you will sec presently ; for when the bear see his 
enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where he stood, but 
did it mighty Icburely, looking behind him every step, and 
coming backward till he got into the body of the tree ; then with 
the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping 
it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely ; 
at this juncture, and just before he could set his hind feet upon 
the ground, Friday stepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of 
his piece into his ear, and shot him as dead as a stone. 

Then the rt^e turned about, to see if we did not laugh ; and 
when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls a laugtung 
himself very loud ; So we kill bear in n^ country, says Fridetf. 
So you kill them, s^d I ; why you have no guns. No, says he,

OF Robinson Ctiusos. 311 

This was, Indeed, a good divcmon to us, but wc were still in \ 
a Wild place, and our guide very mqch hurt, and what to do we 
hardly knew ; the howling of wolves run much in my head ; and "^^ 
indeed except the muse I once heard on the shore of Africa^ of 
which I have said something already, I never heard any thing 
that fiUed me with so much horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called U3 off, or else, 
as Friday would have had us, we should cert^nly have taken the A 
skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth saving \ buc I 
we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us ; so we ^^ 
left him, and went forward on our journey. ^ 

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep 
and dangerous as on the mountains ; and the ravenous creatures, 
as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain 
country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a 
great deal of mischief in the vills^es, where they surprised the 
country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, 
and some people too. 

Wc had one dangerous place to pass, which our guide told us, 
if there were any more wolves in the country, we should find 
them there ; and this was In a small plain, surrounded with woods 
on every side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which wc were 
to pass to get through the wood, and dien we should come to 
the village where wc were to lodge. 

It was within half an hour of sunset when wc entered the first 
WQod ; and a litde after sunset when we came into the plain. 
Wc met with nothing in the first wood, except that in a little 
plain within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, 
wc saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed one after an- * 
other, as if they had been in chase of some prey, and had it in 
view ; they took no notice of us, and were gone and out of our 
light in a few moments. 

Upon this our guide, who, by the way^ was a wretched faint- 



301 LiFB AND AdVENTUREI 

the difficulty increaised upon me so much, that though I had 
once shipped my baggage m order to go, yet I ahered my mbgd, 
and that not once, but two or three times. 

It is trucj I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might 
be some of the reasons. But let no man slight the strong im- 
pulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment. Two of 
the ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean more par- 
ticularly singled out than any other, that is to say, so as in one 
of them to put my things on board, and in the other to have 
^rced with the captain ; I say, two of these ships miscarried, 
viz* one was taken by the Algerine^ and the other was cast away 
on the Siari, near I'orbayy and al! the people drowned, except 
three ; so that in either of those vessels I had been made miser- 
able, and in which most, it was hard to say. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my oM pilot, to 
whom I communicated every thing, pressed me earnestly not to 
go by sea ; but either to go by land to the Groyne^ and cross 
over the Bay of Biscay to RockelU, from whence it was but an 
easy and safe journey by land to Parisy and so to Calais and 
Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land 
through France^ 

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at 
all, except from Calais to Dover^ that I resolved to travel all 
the way by land ; which, as I was not in haste, and did not 
value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way ; and to make 
it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the 
son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; 
after which, we picked up two more English merchants also, 
and two young Portuguese gendcmen, the last going to Paris 
only ; so that we were in al! six of us, and five servants, the two 
merchants, and the two Portuguese^ contenting themselves with 
one servant between two, to save the chaise \ and as for me, I 
got an EngUsh sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my 



DP RoBiKsoK Crusoe/ 303 

man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of sup- 
plying the place of a servant on the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon : and our company^ 
being very all well mounted and armed, wc made a little troop, j 
whereof did they me the honour to call mc captain, as well / 
because I was the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and/ 
indeed was the original of the whole journey. / 

As I have troubled you ^rith none of my sea journals, so shall 
I trouble you with none of my land journal. But some adven- 
tures that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey, I 
must not omit. 

When wc came to Madridy we, being all of us strangers to 
Spajrt, were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spaing 
and to see what was worth observing ; but it being the latter 
part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out from Madrid 
about the middle of October* But when we came to the edge 
of Navarre^ we were alarmed at several towns on the way, with 
an account that so much snow was fallen on the Fnnch side of 
the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back 
to Pampeluna^ after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to 
pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed ; 
and to me that had been always used to a hot climate, and in- 
deed to countries where we could scarce bear any clothes on, the 
cold was insufferable ; nor indeed was it more painful than it 
was surprising, to come but ten days before out of the Old 
Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but very hot, 
and immediately to feel a wind from the Fyrtnean motmtains, so 
very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger 
benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the mountains 
all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never 
seen or felt before in his life. 



J04 LiF& AMD Adventures 

To mend the matter^ after we came to Pampeluna^ it a»-> 
tinued snowing with ao much violence, and so long, thitt the 
people said, winter was come before ita time; and the roads, 
which were difficult before, were now quite impassable; in a 
word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel \ 
and being not hard trozen, as is the case in northern countries, 
there was no going without being in danger of being buried alive 
every step. We staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluna ; 
when (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its 
being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that 
had been known in the memory of man) I proposed that we 
should all go away to Fontarabiay and there take shipping for 
Bourdeaux^ which was a very litde voy^c. 

But while we were considering this, there came in four French 
gendcmen, who, having been stopped on the French side of the 
passes, as we were on the Spanish^ had found out a guide^ who 
traversing the country near the head o£ Languedoc^ had brought 
them over the mountains by such ways, that they were not much 
incommoded with the snow ; and where they met with snow in 
any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them 
and their horses. 

We sent for this guide, who told us, he would undertake to 
cany us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, provided 
we were armed sufficiendy to protect ourselves from wild beasts ; 
for he said, upon these great snows, it was frequent for some 
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being 
made ravenous for want oS food, the ground being covered mth 
snow. We told him we were well enough prepared for such 
creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two- 
legged wolves, which we were told we were in most danger from, 
especially on the French side of the mountains. 

He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way 
tbzt wt were to go : so we readily agreed to follow htm ; as did

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased, Tou fool you ^ says 
I, he will eat you up, Eatee me up! eatee me up ! says Fridayy 
twice over again; Me eatee him up; me make you good laugh; 
you all stay here, me shew you good laugh : so down he sits, 
and gets his boots o(f in a moment, and put on a p^r of pumps 
(as we call the flat shoes they wear) and which he had in ^his 
pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and, with his gun, 
away he flew, swift like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with 
nobody, rill Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the 
bear could understand him ; Hark ye^ harkye^ says Friday ^ me 
speakee wit you. We followed at a distance; for now being 
come down on the Gascoigne side of the mount^ns, we were 
entered a vast great forest, where the country was pl^n, and 
pretty open, though many trees in it scattered here and there. 

Friday^ who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up 
with him quickly, and takes up a great stone, and throws at him, 
and it hit him just on the head ; but did him no more harm than 
if he had thrown it against a wall ; but it answered Friday's end; 
for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did it purely to make 
the bear follow him, and shew us some laugh, as he called it. 

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he turns 
about, and comes after him, taking devilish long strides, and 
shuffling along at a strange rate, so as would put a horse to a 
middling gallop : away runs Friday^ and takes his course, as if 
he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once 
upon the bear, and deliver my man ; though I was angry at him 
heartily for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going 
about his own business another way ; and especially I was imgry 
that he had turned the bear upon us, and then run away ; and I 
called out^ Tou dogj s^d I, is this your making us laugh f .Gmk

a great oaJc tree, fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow, 
and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gim 
down upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom 
of the tree. 

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance ; 
the first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let

This was, indeed,' a good diveraion to us, but wc were still in \ 
a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we 
hardly knew ; the howling of wolves run much in my head ; and '^'^ 
indeed except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa^ of 
which I have said something already^ I never heard any thing 
that filled me with so much horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else^ 
as Frid^ would have had us, we should certainly have taken the K 
skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth saving ; but 1 
wc had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us ; so wc 1 
left turn, and went forward on our journey. * 

The ground was still covered ^th snow, diough not so deep 
and dangerous as on the mountains ; and the ravenous creatures, 
as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain 
country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a 
great deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised the 
country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, 
and some people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pass, which our guide told us, 
if there were any more wolves in the country, we should find 
them there ; and this was in a small plain, surrounded with woods 
on every side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which we were 
to pass to get through the wood, and then we should come to 
the village where we were to lodge. 

It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the first 
wQod ; and a little after sunset when we came into the plain. 
We met with nothing in the first wood, except that in a litde 
plain within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, 
we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed one after an- ' 
other, as if they had been in chase of some prey, and had it in 
view ; they took no notice of us, and were gone and out of our 
sight in a few moments. 

Upon this our guide^ who, by the way, was a wretched &int- 



J12 Life and Adventures 

hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready postiire, for he believed 
there were more wolves a coming. 

Wc kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us ; but wc saw 
no more wolves till we came through that wood, which was near 
half a league, and entered the plain ; as soon as we Came into 
the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us. The first 
object we met with was a dead horse, that is to say, a poor horse 
which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at 
work : we could not say eating of him, but picking of his bones 
rather ; for they had eaten up all the flesh before. 

We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither 
did they take much notice of us. Friday would have let By at 
them, but I would not suffer him by any means ; for I found wc 
were like to have more business upon our hands than we were 
aware of. We were not gone half over the plain, but wc began 
to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left, in a frightful 
manner ; and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on 
directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a line, as 
regularly as an army drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce 
knew in what manner to receive them ; but found to draw our- 
selves in a close line, was the only way ; so we formed in a 
moment; but, that we might not have too much interval, I 
ordered, that only every other man should fire ; and that the 
others who had not fired, should stand ready to givt them a 
second volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon 
us ; and that then those who had fired at flr^t, should not pretend 
to load their fusils again, but stand ready, with every one a pis- 
tol, for we were all armed with a fusil, and a pair of pistols each 
man ; so we were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half 
of us at a time ; however, at present, we had no necessity ; for, 
upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a ftdl stop, bang 
terrified, as well with the noise as with the fire; four of them 
being shot into the head, dropped ; several others were wounded,

and went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow: I found 
they stopped, but did not immediately retreat ; whereupon re- 
membering that I had been told, that the fiercest creatures were 
terrified at the voice of a man^ 1 caused all our company to halloo 
as loud as we could, and I found the notion not alt<^ether mis- 
taken ; for upon our shout, they began to retire, and turn about; 
then I ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear^ which 
put them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods. 

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and that we 
might lose no timcj wc kept going ; but wc had but littic more 
than loaded our fusils, and put ourselves into a readiness, when 
wc heard a terrible noise in the same wood, on our left ; only 
that it was further onward the same way we were to go. 

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, 
which made it the worse on our side ; but the noise increasing, 
wc could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of 
those hellish creatures; and, on a sudden, wc perceived two or 
three troops of wolves on our left, one behind us, and one on 
our front, so that wc seemed to be surrounded with them ; how- 
ever, as they did not fell upon us, we kept our way forward, as 
fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being very 
roi^h, was only a good large trot ; and in this manner we came 
in view of the entrance of a wood through which we were to pass, 
at the farther side of the plain ; but wc were greatly surprised, 
when, coming nearer the lane, or pass, we saw a confused num- 
ber of wolves standing just at the entrance. 

On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the 
noise of a gun ; and, looking that way, out rushed a horse, with 
a saddle and bridle on him, fiying like the wind, and sixteen or 
seventeen wolves after him full speed ; indeed the horse had the 
heels of them ; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at 
that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at 
last ; and no quesdon but they did.-

But here we had a most horrible sight ; for, riding up to the 
entrance where the horse came out» we found the carcase of an- 
other horse, and of two men devoured by the ravenous creatures, 
and one of the men was no doubt the same who we heard fired 
the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the 
man> his head, and the upper part of his body, was eaten up. 

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to 
take \ but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about 
us presently, in hopes of prey ; and I verily believe there were 
three hundred of them. It happened very much to our advan- 
tage, that at the entrance into tfie wood, but a little way from it, 
there lay some large timber trees, which had been cut down the 
summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage ; I drew my 
little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line 
behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping 
that tree before us, for a breast-work, to stand in a triangle, or 
three fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre. 

We did so, and it was well we did : for never was a moit 
furious charge than the creatures made upon us in the place 1 
they came on us with a growling kind of noise, and mounted 
the piece of timber (which, as I said, was our breast-work,) as 
if they were only rushing upon their prey ; and this fury of 
theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their sedng our 
horses behind us, which was the prey they aimed at : I ordered 
our men to fire, as before, every other man ; and they took thdr 
aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the wolves at ^ 
first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual 
firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on 
those before, 

When we had fired our second volley of our fii^s we thoi^t 
they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone ofi^ but 
It was but a moment, for others came fi>rward again : so we fired 
two volleys of our pistols ; end I believe in these four firings 



or RoBrNsoN Crusoe. 315 

we had killed seventeen or dghteen of them, and lamed twice as 
many ; yet they came on again. 

I was loth to spend our last shot too hastily ; so I called my 
servant, not my man Friday ^ for he was better employed ; for, 
with the greatest dexteiity imaginable, he had chai^;ed my fusil 
and his own while we were cng^ed ; but, as I said, I called my 
other man ; and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a 
train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a lai^e train ; he 
did so, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came 
up to it, and some were got up upon it; when I, snapping an 
uncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that 
were upon the timber were scorched ^th it, and six or seven of 
them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force and 
fright of the fire ; we dispatched these in an instant, and the rest 
were so frighted with the light, which the night, for now it was 
very near dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a little. 

Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one 
volley, and after that we gave a shout; upwn this the wolves 
turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame 
ones, who we found struggling on the ground, and fell a cutting 
them with our swords, which answered our expectation ; for the 
crying and howling they made were better understood by their 
fellows ; so that they iled and left us. 

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them; and 
had it been day-light, we had killed many more. The field of 
battle being thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had 
still near a league to go ; we heard the ravenous creatures howl 
and yell in the woods as we went, several times ; and sometimes 
we fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling our 
eyes, we were not certain ; so in about an hour more we came 
to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible 
fright, and all in arms ; for, it seems, that, the night before, the 
wolves and some bears had broke into the village in the night. 



3i6 Life and Adventures 

and put them in a terrible fright ; and they were obliged to keep 
guard night and day> but especially in the night, to preserve thdr 
catde, and indeed their people. 

The next morning our guide was so til, and his limbs so swelled 
with the rankling of his two wounds^ that he could go no further; 
so we were obliged to take a new guide there, and go to T^a- 
lousff^ where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant coun- 
try, and no snow, no wolves, or any thing like them ; but when 
we told our story at Thculousej they told us it was nothing but 
what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the moun- 
tainSj especially when the snow lay on the ground ; but they in- 
quired much what kind of a guide we had gotten, that would 
venture to bring us that way in such a severe season ; and told 
us, it was a great chance we were not all devoured. When we 
told them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in the middle, 
they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but 
we had been all destroyed ; for it was the sight of the horses 
which made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey ; and that at 
other times they are really afraid of a gun ; but the being exces- 
sive hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come 
at the horses had made them senseless of danger ; and that if we 
had not by the continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of Ae 
train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that 
we had been torn to pieces ; whereas, had we been content to 
liave sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would 
not have taken the horses so much for their own, when men 
were on their backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that 
at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our horses, they would 
have been so eager to have devoured them, that we might have 
come off safe, especially having our fire-arms in our hands^ and 
being so many in number. 

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life ; for 
seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed 



OF Robinson Crusos, j 

to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I 
gave myself over for lost ; and as it was, J bdievcj I shall never 
care to cross those mountains ^ain ; I think I would much 
rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I were sure to meet 
with a storm once a week, 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage 
through France; nothing but what other travellers have given 
an account of, with much more advantage than I can. I travelled 
from Thouhuse to PariSy and without any considerable stay^ came 
to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the fourteenth of January, 
after having had a severe cold season to travel in- 

I was now come to the centre of my travels^ and had in a little j^ 
time all my new discovered estate safe about me, the bills of 
exchange, which I brought with mc, having been very currently 
paid. 

My principal guide and privy counsellor, was my good an- 
cient widoWj who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, 
thought no pains too much, or care too great, to employ for mc ; 
and I trusted her so entirely with every thing, that I was perfectly 
easy as to the security of my eiftcts ; and indeed I was very 
happy from my beginningj and now to the end, in the unspotted 
integrity of this good gentlewoman, 

And now I began to think of leaving my eflects with this 
woman, and setting out for Lisdon, and so to the Brasih : but 
now another scruple came in the way, and that was religion ; for 
as I had entertained some doubts about the Roman religion, even 
while 1 was abroad, especially in my state of solitude ; so I knew 
there was no going to the Brasils for me, much less going to 
settle there, unless I resolved to embrace the Rtman Catholic 
religion, without any reserve ; unless on the other hand I re- 
solved to be a sacrifice to my principles, be a martyr for religion, 
and die in the Inquisition: so I resolved to stay at home, and if 
I could find means for it, to dispose of my plantation. 



iB Life and Advetjtures 

To this purpose I wrote to my old Triend at Lisbon^ who in 
;turn gave me notice, that he could easily dispose of it there: 
Hit that if I thought fit to give him leave to offer it in my name 

die two merchants, the survivors of my trustees who lived in 

• Brasihi who must fully understand the value of it, who lived 
[ust upon the spot, and who I knew were very rich, so that he 

?Iiev&d they would be fond of buying it ; he did not doubt, bul 

should make 4 or 5000 pieces of eight the more of it. 

Accordingly I agreed, gave him order to offer it to them, and 
le did so; and in about eight months more, the ship being then 
■efurned^ he sent me account, that they had accepted che offer, 
Lnd had remitted 3j,ooo pieces of eight to a correspondent of 
rheirs at Lisbon^ to pay for it- 

In return I signed the instrument of sale in the form which 
:hey sent from Lisbon^ and sent it to my old man, who sent mc 
Jills of exchange for 32,800 pieces of eight for the estate; re-

shorten the Book^ that they may seem to reduce the value, 
they strip it of all those reflections, as well religious as moral, 
which are not only the greatest beauties of the Work, but art 
calculated for the infinite advantage of the Reader. 

By this they leave the Work naked of its brightest orna-

Author has supplied the story out of his invention y they take 
from it the improvement which alone recommends that inven-

The injury these men do the Proprietor of this Work, is 
a practice all honest men abhor ; and he believes he may chal-

on the highway, or breaking open a house. 

If they cannot shew any difference in the crime, they toill 
find it hard to shew why there should be any difference in the 
punishment: and he will answer for it, that nothing shall 
be wanting on his part to do them justice.

in it, told me very seriously one night, that she believed there 
some secret powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which 
lad determined me to go thither again ; and that she found no- 
thing hindered my going but my being engaged to a wife and 
children. She told me^ that it was true she could not think of

iou\d be the first thing I would do ; so, as it seemed to her 
:hat the thing was determined above, she would not be the on3y

Found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very

stopped. ] asked her why she did not go on, and say out what

an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, 
I had no notion of that ; so after many of these c^itaiions, I 
struggled with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself 
out of it, tfj / kli^'f people may always dc irt liAt c4U€i^ if thtry 
-will; and, in a word, 1 ETon^juerod it; composed myself with 
auch arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my pre*

as the most effectual method, 1 resolved to divert my^lfwtth 
other thing*, and (o engage in some business that might effectu- 
ally tie me up from any more excursions of this kind ; for I 
found the thing return upon me chiefly when I wn:» idle, had 
nothing to do, or any thing of moment immediately before me. 

To this purpose I bought a little farm h\ the county of Bt4-

1 farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to pay^ was limited 
sy no articles, I could puJI up or cut down as I pleased : what 1 
jlantcd was for myself, and what I improved, was for my family ; 
Lnd having thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not the 
least discomfort in any part of my life, as to this world. Now 

thought indeed, that I enjoyed the middle state of life that my 
'ather so early recommended to me, ?, kind of heavenly life, 
jomething like what is described by the poet upon the subject of 

country life. 

Free from 'vkes^fre^ from care^ 
Age has no paia, and youth no snare. 

But in tht middle of all this felicity, one blow from unfore- 
ieen Providence unhinged me at oncej and not only made ^ 
»rcach upon me, inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its 
:onsequence, into a deep relapse into the wandering disposition;

Brasils when I wcnc lint on shore ihcrrc; and as much alone, 
except as to the asdscince of servants^ u I was in my island. 1 
knew neither what to do, or what not to do. 1 saw the world 
. busy round mc, ontc part labouring for bread, and the other jmt 
I itfjuandering in vUc cxccs^tH ur empty pleasures, eqmJly misera- 
ble, because the end they proposed still fled from them , for the 
man of pleasure every day surfeited of his vice, and heaped up 
work for sorrow and repentance ; and the men of labour xpenr 
their srmigth in daily 4trugglings for bread to miimsin the vital 
strength they laboured with ; so living in a daiiy circulation of 
urrow, living but to work^ and working but to livc^ as if daily 
bread were the only end of weansomc life, and a wearisome life 
the only occasion of daily bre-id. 

This put me in mind of the lite I lived in my kii^dom, dw

not want it ; and bred no more goaCSj becatne 1 had no more 
use for them : where the money lay in the drawer dll it grew 
mouldy, and had scarce the favour to be looked upon in twenty

were pi^ently satisfied we should discover it, because the ftrther 
we sailed, the greater the light appeared, though the weather 
being haiy wc could not perceive any thing but the light for a 
while; in about half ?m hourS sailing, the wind l.teing fair for 
U4, chough not much of it, and the weather clearing up a IJnle, 
we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on 6rc tn the 
middle of the sea- 

I was most sensibly couched with this dnaster, though noc at 
all acqtttinted with the persons engaged b it ; I presently reeol- 
lectcd my former cticumstanccs, in what condition 1 was in when 
taken up by the Pttrtitj^aJ captain ; and how much mnre dcjiUi-

'ho, I concluded, must be either all destroyed in the ship, or be 
the utmost distress in their boat in the middle of the occ^n, 
[which :it: present, by reason it was dark, I could not see: how- 
ever, to direct them as well as I could, I caused lights to be 
hung out in all the parts of the ship where we couldj and which 
wc had iaiithorns for; and kept firing guns Liil the night long; 
|letting them know by this, that there was a ship not far off- 

About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered the ship's 

boats, by the help of our perspective glasses ; found there were 

two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in the water; 

'e perceived they rowed, the wind being against them ; thit 

icy saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us sec them.

and prDvisiDM inm her, after they had seotre^l rhcir lives from

into these boats tt that distance from any land ; ordy, as they 
said wdl, due they were escaped from the &rc, and had a po&st- 
bilitr^ thac some %Hip might happen to be at sea, and might take 
them ID. They had sail&t oax^, aiid a compass -, and were pre- 
paring to make the best of their way back to Ncwf^undUnJ^ the 
wind blowing pnrtty l^ir ; for it blew an ca^ ga3c at S. E. by E^ 
They had as much pro^fiions and water, as^ with sparing it to 
OS to be next door to starving, might support them about twelve 
days; in which^ if they had no h^d wrathcr, and no a>ntrary 
winds, the captain said, he hoped he might get the barks of JVrw- 
/iwrJianJt and might perhaps take some &^ to sustain them till 
tfacy might go on shore. But there werr so many chances 
■gainst them in all theie ca«e« ; ftuch as <torms ro overset and 
founder them ; rains and cold to benumb and perish their limbs ; 
contrary winds to keep them out and starve them ; that it must 
have been nexc ta miraculojs if they had escaped. 

In the midst of their consultations^ every one being hopelen, 
and ready to despair, the captain with tears in his eyes told n>e,

:hem to work with their oars to keep their boats a-head, at least 
:hat we might the sooner come up with them; and at last, to 
icir inexpressible joy, they found wc saw them. 
Tt is Tm|yDssible for me to express the several gestures, the 
itrange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these poor dc- 
ivered people run into, to express the joy of their souls at so 
inexpectcd a deliverance. Grief and fear arc easily described; 
;ighs, tears, groans^ and a very few motions of the head and 
lands, make up the sum of its variety ; hut an excess of joy, a 
turprisc of joy, has a thousand cxtravag;^nccs in it; there were 
iome in tears, some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had 
seen in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving and 
lownnght lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with their

It IK further observable, that thc^e esctravagajices did not shew 
themselves in that different manner I have mentioned, in di ff erent 
persons only : bfit all the variety vrould appear in a shcxt sue- 
CTRiion of motnents, in one and the same penon. A m*n fhst

been had, wouhl in a few nuimciits more have been Jeid ; and

diately applied proper remedies to recover him ; and was the only 
jnan in the ship that believed he was not dead : and at length he 
opened a vein in hii arm, having 6rst chafed and ruhhed the

ifter, they came runmiig into the cabin to the surgeon, who -was 
jleeding a French woman that had fainted; and told him, the 
iriest was gone stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve 

le change of his circumstance, and again this put him into an 
ecstasy of joy \ his spirits whirled about faster than the vessel* 
lid convey them ; rhe blood grew hot and feverish ; and die 

lan was as fie for EsMam as any creature that ever was in it; 
[he surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition, bur 
^avc him something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after 

ime time, opemted upon him, and he waked the next moming 

Tfectly composed and well- 

The younger priest behaved with great command of his pas- 
iions, and was really an example of a serious well-governed mind; 
Lt his first coming on board the ship, he threw himself flat on 
lis face, prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance; 

unseasonably disturbed \

But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of 

iting too much, even of that little we gave them ; the mate or 

lommander brought six men with him in his boat; but these 

^oor wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak, they 

rould hardly sit to their oars : the mate himself was very ill, and 

lalf-starvcd ; for he declared he had reserved nothing from tlic 

len, and went share and share alike with them in every bit 

:hey ear. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him im- 

lediatcSy, and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began 

to be sick, and out of order j so he stopt awhile, and our surgeon 

lixed him up somethine with some broth, which he sdd would

,vul wIkj he &ecmcd to confess ihcy had wholly neglected* their 
own cxtnrmitics being so great ; by which 1 underwood, tfa>t 
they had really given tSem tw food at ill ; and that thercfbn 
they must be jwri^ed, and be all lying dead perhaps on the floor 
or deck of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, who we then called captain^ 00 
board with his men to refresh them, so 1 also forgot not the 
starving crew that were left on bonrd, but ordered my own boat 
to go on bovd the »h:p, and with my mate and twelve men to 
carry ihetn a Kurk of breoxl, and fuur or five pieces of beef to 
boiL Our surgeon ehaiged the men to cause the meat to be 
boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room to 
prevent the mm taking it to car raw, nr tnkmg it out of the |xit 
before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very 
little at a time; and by thti caution he preserved the mcn» who 
would orherwisc have killed thcf:i±clvcs wirh that very food that 
was given thum on purjHJse to save their Viva. 

At the same time, 1 ordered the mate to go into the great 
cabin» and sec what condition the psor passengers were b, and* 
if they WTie alive, to comfort thcni and give them what rrfresh- 
ment was proper; and the ^jrgeon gave him a lif^ pitcher 
with some of the prepared broth which he had given the mate 
that was on boards axul which he did not qucsdoti would restore 
them gradialty* 

I was not satisfied with thi^; but as I said above, having a 
great mind to sec the scene of misery which I knew the ship 
itwlf wouki present me with, in a more lively maniKr than I 
could have ic by report, I rook the captsun of the ship, at we 
now called him, with me, and went mvself a little after in their 
boat.

victuals out of the boiJer before it waa readf *. ^ux icv^ xc^a^^

observed -his order, and kept a good guard at the cook-roan 
door; and the man he placed there, after iising all pos^blc per- 
suasion to have patience, kept them off by force ; however, he 
caused some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened 
with the liquor of the meat, which they call brcwis, and gave 
them every one one, to stay their stomachs, and told them it wu 
for their own safety, that he was obliged to give them but a littk 
at a time. But it was all in vain, and had I not a>me on board, 
and their own commander and officers with me, and with good 
words, and some threats also of giving them no mor«, I believe 
they would have broke into the cook-room by fcMx:e, and ttwc 
the meat out of the furnace ; for words are indeed of very small 
force to a hungry belly : however we pacified them, and fed 
them gradually and cautiously for the first time, and the next 
time gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and the 
men did well enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of 
another nature, and far beyond the rest ; for as, first, the ship's 
company had so little for themselves, tt was but too tnic, that 
they had at first kept them very low, and at last totally neg- 
lected them ; so that for six or seven days, it might be said, 
they had really had no food at all, and for several days before 
very little. 

The poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman 
of good sense, and good breeding, had spared all she could get 
so affectionately for her son, that at last she entirely sunk under 
Jt: and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the 
floor or deck, with her back up against the sides, between two 
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk in between her 
shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead* My mate said 
all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon put 
some broth into her mouth : she opened her lips, and lifted up 
one hand, but could not speak : yet she understood what he said.

[nd such as are not worth relating ; but at last it broke out into

fan be imagined, without reasoHj without provocationj contrary 

o nature, and indeed to common sense ; and though it is true, 
|hc first relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, 

■horn [ may call the accusers, vet when I came to examine tlic 

.'Hows, they could not deny a word of it. 
But before I come to the particular of this part, 1 must suppiy 

defect in my former relation ; and this was, that I forgot to act 
kown among the rest, that, just as we were weighing the anchor 
p set sail, there happened a little quarrel on board our shipj 
Ivhich 1 was afraid once would have turned to a second mutiny; 

lor was it appeased till the captain, rousing up his courage, and 
piking lis all to his assistanccj parted them by force, and making 

wo of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in 

rons ; and as they had been active in the former disorders^ and 

et fall some ufflv dansierous words the second time, he chrearened 



OF RoBiMso>j CnesoE, 363 

But thk mutiny fiAd brought us m an nnchof for &M nigh^ 
the wind alto fnlling calm ; next moming w<e foiind» that our two 
men who had been laid in irons, had ^tole c;;ch of them a tnu«- 
qxKtf and 5timc ut\\a wca|)on« ; what powder or sJioi they had, 
1WC know not ; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which was not 
yet haled up, and ran a^Tiy with her to their companions in 
roguery on the shore, 

Aa soon js we found this, I ordered the king-boat on shore, 
with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to i«ek the 
[ logycs; but they could neither find them, nor any of the rc3t ; 
fee they all fled into fhe woods when they smw the bont coming 
oa shore. The mate was once rescrfved^ in justice to their 
rogucTT, to have destroyed their pkntationi:, burnt all their house- 
bokl-fltuJf and fumiturc, and left them to !<hift without it; but 
having no orilrr, he let ii all alone, left every thing -as they 
found it» and bringing the pinnace away, eame on board without 
them. 

These two men made their number five \ but the other three 
vilUos were «o much wickrder than the«e, that after they had 
been two or three days together, they turned their two new- 
cotn era out of door^ to shift for themselves, and ^x>uld have no- 
thing to do with them i nor could they for a good while l>e pcr- 
fuaded to give them any food : at for the Sfomidriis, they were 
aoc yet come. 

When the S^iar^ came first on shore, the business began 
to go forward ; the SfMniards would have persttaded the three 
English brutes to have taken in their two ctmntryiren again, thii, 
as Chcy said, they might be all one family : but they would not 
heaf of it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves; and

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, ajid the odier 
Ito lay up their magazines and stores in ; and the Spaniards 
having given them some com for seed, and especially some of 
the peas which 1 had Jcft them, they dug and planted, and at- 
closed after the pattE:ni I had set for them allj and began to live 
pretty well. Their first crop of com was on the ground, and 
[though it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at 
irst, having had but a Hllle time, yet it was enough to rclie^'c 
them, and find them, with bread or other eatables; and one of 
the fellows, being the cook's mate of the ship, was veiy ready at 
making soup, puddings, and such other preparations, as the rice 
and the milkj and such little flesh as they got> furnished him to 
Ido. 

They were going on in this little thriving posture, when the 
[three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mcic 
humour, and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told

seeing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and imme- 
diately they cairtc both oat with their muaqucis; and the man 
that was first struck at with the pole, knocked the fellow down, 
that had begun the quarrel, with the stock of his musquet, and 
that before the other two could come to help him ; and then sec* 
ing the rest come at them, they stood together, nnd presenting 
the other ends of their pieces to thcn^ bade them stand off. 

The other had fire arms with them too: but one of the two 
honest men bolder thaii his comrade, ai^ made desperate by hb 
danger, told them, if thry offered to move hand or (bot, they 
were dead men j and boldly commanded them to lay down their 
arms. They did not indeed lay down their amis; but* seeing 
him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and they cofuenied 
to take their wuundol man with them, and be gone; and in- 
deed, it seems the fellow was wounded suffidently with the 
blow; however, they were much in the wrot^, ntice they had 
the adrantage, that ihey did nor disarm ihcm effectually, as ihcy

But not to crowd this pan wtrh an account of the lesser part 
of their rogueries, such as treading down their com, shooting 
three young kids, and a she-goat which the poor men had got to

ime they had a fair opportunity. In order to this> they reserved 
o go to the castle, as they called it, that was my old dwelling, 
vhere the three rogues and the Spaniardi all lived together at that 
imcj intending to have a fair battle, and the Spanicrds should 
tand by to sec fair play. So they got up in the morning before 
ay, and came to the place, and calicd the Englishmen by their 
lame^, telling a Spaniard that answered^ that they wanted to 
peak with them, 

Jt happened that the day before two of the Spaniardj^ having 
een in the wciois, had seen one of the two Englishm^n^ whom, 
'or distinction, 1 call the honest men; and he had made a sad 
omplaint to the Spajiiards^ of the barbarous usage they had met 
ith from their three countrymen, and how they had ruined their 
Uritation, and destroyed their corn, that they had laboured so 
ard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat, and their three 
ids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance; and

returned, Do! d — n them, they should be servants, and work 
for them. But how can you expect that of them ? says the 
Spaniard, they arc not bought with your money ; you have no 
right to make them servants. The Englishman answered, the 
island was theirs, the governor had given it to them, and no man 
had any thing to do there but themselves ; and ^th that swore 
by his Maker, that they would go and bum all their new huts ; 
they should build none upon their land. 

Why, Seignior, says the Sfansard^ by ^e same rule, we must 
be your servants too. Ay, says the bold dog, and so you shall 
too, before we have done wth you, mixing two or three G — d 
d — n-me*s in the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard 
only smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this 
little discourse had heated them ; and starting up, one says to 
the other, I think it was he they called fViU Atkins, Come, Jack, 
let us go and have the other brush with them ; we wilt demo- 
lish their casdc, I will warrant you ; they shall plant no colony 
in our dominions. 

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every man a 
gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things 
among themselves, of what they would do to the Spaniards too, 
when opportunity oficrcd ; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not 
so perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars; 
only that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking the 
two Englishmen's part. 

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that 
evening, the Spaniards s^d they did not know ; but it seems 
they wandered about the country part of the night ; and then 
lying down in the place which I used to call my bower, they 
were weary, and overslept themselves. The case was this : they 
had resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the two poor 
men when they were asleep ; and as they acknowledged after- 
wards, intended to set fire to their huts while they were in them,

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I 
Ihavc saidj though a much fairer one than that of burning and 
'rderingj it happened, and very luckily, for them all, that they 
'ere up and gone abroad, before the bloody-minded rogues came 
Ito their huts.

It seems was the for^vardest man, called oi^t to his comrades,

:hey mused awhile to think what should be the occasion of their

\Spaniards had given them notice of it ; and with chat they shook 
lands, and swore to one another, that they would be revenged

would have had their arms again ; but the Spaniards considenng 
the feud that was between them and the other two Engli^hmen^ 
and that it would be the best method rhey could take to keep 
them from killing one another, told them they would do them 
no harm ; and if they would live peaceably they would be very 
willing to assist and associate with them, as they did before ; but 
that they could not think of giving them their arms again, while 
they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to their own 
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make them 
Itheir servants. 

The rogues were now more capable to hear reason than to act 
ireason \ but being refused their arms, they went raving away,

The two Englishmen yielded to this vcty awkwardly, and 
with great reluctance; but the S^niards protested, they did it 
only to keep ihcm from bloodshed, and io make ali e^y al last,

It happened one night, that the Spaniani governor, as 1 call 
him, that i» to say, the Spaniard whose life 1 had saved, who 
waa now the captain, or leader, or governor of the rest, found 
himself very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any

fighting and killing of one anoiher, but wiu broad awake, and

trees I had set, quite down to the .side of the creek, where> as I 
said, I landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where the 
tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or any sign 
that there had been any landing thereabout : these stakes also, 
being of a wood very forward to grow, as I had noted formerly, 
they took care to have generally very much larger and taller 
than those which I had planted, and as they grew apace so they 
planted them so very thick and close together, that when they 
had been three or four years grown, there was no piercing with 
the eye any considerable way into the plantation : as for that 
part which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a 
man's thigh ; and among them they placed so many other short 
ones, and so thick, that in a word it stood like a palisado a 
quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate 
it, but with a little army, to cut it all down ; for a litde dog could 
hardly get between the trees, they stood so close. 

But this was not all ; for they did the same by all the ground 
to the right hand, and to the left, and round even to the top of 
the hill ; leaving no way, not so much as for themselves to come 
out, but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then 
lifted up, and placed again from the flrst stage up to the top : 
which ladder, when it was taken down, nothing but what had 
wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at them. 

This was excellently well contrived : nor was it less than what 
they afterwards found occasion for; which served to convince 
me, that as human prudence has the authority of Providence to

ify itj so it has, doubtless^ the direction of Providence to«r 

|t to work ; and, would we listen carefully to the voice of it, 1 

im fuUy persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters 

lich our Jives arc now, by our own negligence^ subjected ta 

lut this by the wav. 

I return to the story : they lived two years after this in per- 
fect retirement, and had no more visits from the savages ; they 
lad indeed an alarm given them one morning, which put than 
Into a great consternation ; for some of the Spaniards being out 
^arly one morning on the west side, or rather the end of the 
(sUnd, which, by the way, was that end where I never went, 
for fear of being discovered, they were surprised with seang 
ibove twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore- 

They made the best of their way home, in hurry enough i 
ind giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that 
lay and the next, going out only at nightj to make observation: 
»ut they had the good luck to be mistaken ; for wherever

he intended to serve the savage ; which the Spaniard perceiving, 
avoided the blow, and with a shovel, which he had in his hand 
(for they all were working in the field about thdr com land), 
knocked the brute down : another of the Engliskment running 
at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard 
down; and then two Spaniards more came to help their man, 
and a third Englishman fell in upon them. They had none of 
them any fire-arms, or any other weapons but hatchets and 
other tools, except this third Englishman ; he had one of my old 
rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the two last Spaniards^ 
and wounded them both : this fray set the whole ^mily in an 
uproar, and more help coming in, they took the three Englishman 
prisoners- The next question was. What should be done with 
them ? They had been so often mutinous, and were so furious, 
so desperate, and so idle withal, that they knew not what course 
to take with them, for they were mischievous to the highest 
degree, and valued not what hurt they did to any man ; so that, 
in short, it was not safe to live with them. 

The Spaniard, who was governor, told them in so many 
words, that if they had been his own countrymen, he would 
have hanged them; for all laws, and all governors, was to pre- 
serve society; and those who were dangerous to the society 
ought to be expelled out of it; but as they were Englishmen, 
and that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman 
that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would 
use them with all possible lenity, and would leave them to the 
judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were thor country- 
men. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said, they 
desired it might not be left to them : for, say^ he, I am sure we 
ought to sentence them to the gallows ; and with that he gives 
an account how IVill Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to 
have all the five Englishmen join tc^ethcr, and murder all the 
Spaniards, when they were in their sleep.

When the SpafJish governor heard this, he calls to H^illiam jft- 
\kijfs. How, Seignior Atkins^ says he, would yon murder us all? 
What have you to say to that ? That hardened villain was so fer 
from denying it, that he said it was true, and G — d d — mn him 
they would do it still before they had done with them. Well, 
but Seignior Atkins^ said the Spaniard^ what have we done to you

And what must we do to prevent you IcilHiig us ? Must we kill 
you, or you will kill us ? Why will yon put us to the necessity 
|of thisj Seignior Atkim ? says the Spaniard very calmly, and 
smjhng. 

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard'^ making a 
jest of it, that, had he not been held by three men, and withal 

lad no weapons near him, it was thought he would have at-

be done to keep them from domg the mischief they designed; 
for all agreed, governor atnd tdl» rhit mrana wtrnr to be u»rd Tor

^reedt first, thai they should be disarmed, and not permitted to 
have cither gun, or powder, or shot* or sword^ or any weapon, 
and shoiil<] be turned out of the society^ and left to live where 
thcf would, and how they would, by themselves ; but that none 
of the rest, cither Spaniards or EtigJish, should co-ivcrsc with 
them, xpcak wi(h them, or have any thing to do with them ; that 
they should be forbid to come withm a certain disnuxe of the

any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or dotroy any of the 
com, phuitiirgs, buildings fences, or cattle belonging to the 
ftocietyt that they should die without mercy, and they would 
shoot them wherever they could And them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, mvtstng upon the

honest En^ihhmeMj said. Hold; you must nrfiect, that It will be 
long ere they can raise com imd cattle of their own, and they 
must not starve ; 'ftx must therefore allow them provinkms. So 
he caused to be added, that they ?^uld have a proportion of 
com given them to Is^ them eight months, and for seed to sow, 
by which dmc they might be Buppooed to raise some of their 
own ; that ihey should have sjx mikh-goAts, four he-goats, and 
$ix kids» given them, as well for present subsistence, as Am- a 
store ; ajid that they should have tools given them for their wofk 
tn the field; such as, six hatchets, an axe, t saw, arid the like. 
But they should have rone of these tools or provisions, unless 
they would swear solemnly, that they would rot hurt or injure

ihifi for themselves. They went away sulkn and refractory, a 
leicher conrented to go away or to stay ; but as there was no 
■emedy, they went, pretending to go and choose a place wheie 
:hey should settle themselveSj to plant and live by themselve; 
ind some provisions were given them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for book 
■iccuals, and gave the governor an account where they had 
bitched their tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and 
plantation ; and it was a very convenient place indeed, on rhe 
-emotest part of the island, N, E. much about the place wheiel 
landed in my first voyage, when I was driven out to sea, tbt 

>rd knows whither, in my attempt to surround the island. 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived 
;hem in a manner like my first habitation, being close under tht 
lidc of a hill, having some trees growing already to the three

plmce at best, compared to mine; and e«pccUll]^ as mine was 
then ; for the Spanu$rds had greatly aibrgcd it» and made acvcml 
new apartment) in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this sepvtwcm, a new 
frolic took these rogues, which together with the former v^Uany 
they had comniLttcd> brought miachtcf enough upon them, and 
had vciy near beta the njin of the whole colony ; the thrc* new

TT*c project was tjOX fK> |irtpastCTotis, if ibcy had gone no 
further; but they did notblng^ and proposed nothing, but had 
cither mischief in the design, or mischief m the event ; and, if I 
may give my opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from 
Hea^'en; for if we will not allow a viable curse to pursue visihtc 
crimcSi how shall wt: reconcile the events of things with the 
divine justice ? It was certainly an apparent vengeance on their 
crime of mutiny and piracy, tliftt brought them to the state they 
were in ; and, as the)* shewed not the least remorse for the 
crime, but added new villanics to it, such as, poiticularly^ the 
piece of munsiroua cruelty of wounding a poof slave, because he 
did not, or perhaps could nor, understaiMl to do what be waiv 
directed ; and to wound him in such a manf>er, as no question 
made him a ctipplc all his liJe, and in a place where no surgecn 
pr raedicinc could be had for his cure : and, wh4t was still worse, 
the murderous intent; or, to do ji«rice to iiNt cnrt\e,*flt^m«»-

tional murder, for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards the 
formed design they aJl ]aid| to murder the Spaniards in cold 
blood, and in their sleep. 

But I leave observing, and return to the stOTy : The three 
fellows comes down to the Spaniards one morning, and, in very 
humble terms, desired to be admitted to speak with them : the 
Spaniards very readily heard what they had to sayj which was 
this : that they were tired of living in the manner they did ; that 
Acf were not handy enough to make the necessaries they 
wanted ; and that having no help, they found they should be 
starved ; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take one 
of the canoes which they came over in, and give them anns and 
ammunition, proportioned for their defence, they woxild go over 
to the main, and seek their fortune, and so deliver them from the 
trouble of supplying them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them ; but yet 
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction they 
were running into; told them, they had suffered such hardships 
upon that very spot, that they could, without any spirit of pro- 
phecy, fell them, that they would be starved or be murdered ; 
and bade them consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they 
stayed here, for they could not work, and would not work ; and 
they could but be starved abroad ; and if they were murdered, 
^ere was an end of them, they had no lA^ves or children to cry 
after them - and, in short, insisted importunately upon their 
demand, declaring that they would go, whether they would give 
them any arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they 
were resolved to go, they should not go like naked men, and be 
in no condition to defend themselves; and that though they 
could ill spare their fire-arms, having not enough for themselves.

yet tliqr would kt them have two musqucts, a pistol^ aiid a cut-

bftsket full oT dried grape*, n pot ^1 of fresh wnter, and a yoiing

the so, where it was at least forty miles broad. 

The boat wsi indeed a large one, and would have very well 
earned fifteen or twenty men ; and therefore was rather coo big 
for them to manage : but aa they had a fair breeze and the ilood- 
cide with them^ ihcy did well enough : they had made a mast of 
a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they 
Iiad sewed or bced together: andawvy they went merrily enough:

took her that was reckoned the homciiest, and the oldest of the 
five, which made mirth enough among the rctt: and even the 
SpaMwrds laughed at it; but the fellow considered better than 
any of them, that it waa application and business, that they were 
to expect assistance in, as much as any thing else; and she 
proved the best wife of all the parcel.

their lUvcs \ bui that parr was now so familiar to the Spamards^ 
and to okir men loo, that they did i\ot concern thcm%lvcs about 
it, as 1 did ; but, having been made sensible by^ their experience, 
that their only business was to he concealed, and that, if rhey 
were HOC seen by any of the savages, they wwdd go off" again 
quietly, when their buiinos was done, having ai yet i^oc the 
least notion of there being any inhabitants in the itland ; I say> 
having been made sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to 
give notice to dl the three plai^tations to keep within door?, and 
not to !(hew themwlvcs ; only pladng a scout in a proper place, 
to give notice when the boat9 went to sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a disaster spoiled 
all these nieasurca, and made it known among the ravages, that 
they were tnhalnraiits there; which was, in the end, the desola- 
tion of almost the whole colony. After the canoes with the 
savages were gone off, the SpanUrds peeped abroad again, and 
BOunc of them had the curiosity to go to the place where they 
had been, to see w}nt they had been doing. Here, to their 
great surprise, they found three savages left behind, and lyii^ 
fast asleep upon the ground; it was sujiposed they had cither 
been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they 
were asleep^ and would not st-r when the others went, or they 
were ^-aiulcrcd into the woods, and did noe come back in time 
to be taken in. 

The SpaniarJs were greatly mrprnod at thh sight, and per- 
fectly at a loss what to do : the SpaxiarJ governor, as it hap- 
pened, was with tfacm, and his advice was asked; but he pn>- 
fosed he knew not what to do : as ^ slaves, they had enough 
already; and at to killing them, they ^-ere nortc of them in-

ind f hey thought thc^ had no just quarrel against them to take 
tway their lives. 

And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards^ observe, dut 
let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what 
:hey will, I never met with seventeen men, of any nation what- 
soever, in any foreign country, who were so universally modest, 
:;eniperate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so courteous, 
these Spaniards; and, as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in 
leir very nature ; no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous 
lassions, and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit, 

Their temper and calmness had appeared in their bearing the 
msuFerahIc usage of the three Englishmen ; and their justice and 
lumanity appeared now in the case of the savages, as above: 
ter some consultation, they resolved upon this, that they would 
lie still a while longer, till, if possible, these three men might bt 
Fone; liut tlien the ^ov^mor Spaniard recollected that the three 
lavages had no boat ; and that if they were left to rove about

for them to do : and whether it was by negligence in gusu^iing 
them> or that they thought the fellows could not mend them- 
selves, I know not, but one of them run away ; and, taking into 
the woods, they could never hear of him more. 

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon 
after in some other boats or canoes of savages, who came on 
shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their 
revels as usual, went oiF ^ain in two days time; this thought 
terrified them exceedingly ; for they concluded, and that not 
without good cause indeed, that if this fellow got safe home 
among his comrades, he would certainly give them an account 
that there were people in the island, as also how weak and few 
they were ; for this savage, as I observed before, had never been 
told, and it was very happy he had not, how many they were, or 
where they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any 
of their guns, much less had they shewn him any of their other 
retired places, such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat 
which the two Englishmen had made, and the like. 

The first testimony they had, that this fellow had given intel- 
ligence of them was, that about two months after this, six canoes 
of savages, with about seven or eight, or ten men in a canoe, 
came rowing along the north side of the island, where they never 
used to come before, and landed about an hour after sun-rise, at 
a convenient place, about a mile fi'om the habitation of the two 
Englishmen^ where this escaped man had been kept : as the Spa- 
niard governor said, had they been all there, the damage would 
not have been so much, for not a man of them would have 
escaped : but the case differed now very much \ for two men to 
fifty was too much odds : the two men had the happiness to dis- 
cover them about a league off, so that it was above an hour be- 
fore they landed ; and as they landed a mile fi^m their huts, it 
was some time before they could come at. them. Now having 
great reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first thing they 
did Witt to bind the two slaves which were left, ^Jid ca>iSR \sic ^

Lve them an account of it all ; for they went directly to the 
t)ace. When the two poor frighted men had secured their 
'ivcs and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three, 
'ho came with the women, and who was at their place by acci-

was hoUow, and rasrly large; and in this tree ihcy both took 
their Btanding, resolving to 9ce what might offer. 

They had not stood there loi^j but two of the savages ap- 
peared running dirrcily ihar way> as if thry had alrrady had 
nocke where they stood, and were coming up to attadt them ; 
Kod a little way farther they apiod three more comtng after them,

which, they saw s«vcr or eight more at a distance runnmg another 
way; for, in a word, they ran every way> like sportsmen beating 
for their game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity, whether thej^ 
should stand, and keep thctr po^nirCp or fly ; hut after a very 
ffcort debate with themselves, they considered, that if the savages 
ranged the country thus> before help came, they might, perhaps 
find oat thetr r c t m t in the woodt^ and then all would he lost ;

were landed, wluch was near fift)-, were to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether chcy 
should firr at the firsr two, or wait for the three, and so take the 
middle party ; by which the two and the 6vc that tbUowed would 
be sepflrakrd ; and tbcy rcaolvcd to let the two first pass by,

Seeing them come so straight towards chemj they resolved tt>

While the/ were thus waiting, and the savages came on, xhtj 
>lainly saw that one of the three was the run-away savage that 
lad escaped from them, and they both knew him distinctly, and 
■esolvcd thatj if possible, he should not escape, though they 
should both fire ; so the other stood ready with his piece, that 
\f he did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to have i

that, perhaps, was ever shot oiF in that place since it was an 
island. 

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what 
the matter was, came on unconcerned till they came to the place 
where their companions lay, in a condition miserable enough ; 
and here the poor ignorant crcatureSj not sensible that they were 
within reach of the same mischiefi stcxid all of a huddle over the 
wounded man, talking, and, as may be supposed, inquiring of 
him how he came to be hurt ; and who, 'tis very rational to be* 
lieve, told them that a flash of fire first, and immediately after 
diat, thunder from their gods, had killed diose two, and wounded 
him. This, I say, is rational ; for nothing is more certain dian 
that, as they saw no man near them, so they had never heard a 
gun in all their lives, or so much as heard of a gun ; neither 
knew they any thing of killing or wounding at a distance, with 
fire and bullets ; if they had, one might reasonably believe, that 
they would not have stood so unconcerned, in viewing the fate 
of their fellows, without some apprehension of their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved 
them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who at the 
same time had no notion of their danger ; yet, having them all 
thus in their power, and the first having loaded his piece ag^, 
resolved to let fly both together among them ; and singling out 
by agreement which to aim at, they shot together, and killed, or 
very much wounded, four of them ; the fifth, frighted even to 
death, though not hurt, fell with the rest ; so that our men, see- 
ing them all iall together, thought they had killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed, made our two men 
come boldly out from the tree before they had charged their 
guns again, which was a wrong step ; and they were under some 
mrprise, when they came to the place, and found no less than 
four of the men alive, and of them, two very little hurt, and one 
not at all :. this obliged them to fall upon them with the stocks

It was five or six months after fhi^ tiefore they heard any

of better* when, on a sitddcn* they were mvadcd with « most

savages, armed with bows and arrows^ great clubg, wooden 
9words, and such like engines of war; and they brought such 
numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into the 
urmosc consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost 
side of the island, our men had that night to consult and consider 
what to do; and in the first place, knowing that their hdng en- 
tirely concealed was their only safety before, ard would much 
niorc be so now, while the number of their enemies was so great, 
they therefore resolved first of all, to take down the huts which 
were built for the ppi'o Kn^ihhmeMt and drive away their gosts to 
the old cave; because they supposed the savages would go 
directly thither, as soon as it was djy, to play the old game over 
agaun, though rhcy did nocnowhnd wirhin two lc:igtiesaf it.

When the savages came on, they run str^^ltng about every

raged, and so he might manage accordingly. 

This stratagem took; for, as soon as the savages heard the 
first gun, and saw the flash of the second, they started up upon 
their ktt in the greatest consternation imaginable ; and, as our 
men advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and 
yawling away, with a kind of a howling noise, which our men 
did not understand, and had never heard before ; and thus they 
run up the hills into the country- 

At first, our men had much rather the weather had been calm, 
and they had all gone away to sea ; but they did not then consi- 
der, that this might probably have been the occasion of their 
coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, 
to come so many and so often, as would quite desolate the island, 
and starve them. fVill jitkins therefore, who, notwithstanding 
his wound, kept always with them, proved the best counsellor in 
this case ; his advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and 
clap in between them and their boats, and so deprive them of the 
capacity of ever returning any more to plague the island. 

They consulted long about this, and some were against it, for 
fear of making the wretches fly into the woods, and live there 
desperate ; and so they should have them to hunt like wild 
beasts, be afr^d to stir out about their business, and have their 
plantations continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, 
in short, be reduced to a life of continual distress,

Tom a dead tree, theytried to set some of them on fire ; b\2t 

:hey were so wet, that they would not burn. However, the Sre

"-ere about, some of them came running out of the woods, and

Tied, Oa, Oa, f^aramokaa, and some other words of their lan-

they made pitiful gestures, and strange noises, it was cisy to

[ejected handful of people ; that if means had been put into their 

lands, they had yet so abandoned themselves to despair^ and so 

lunk under the weight of their misfortunes, that they thought of 

kothing hut starving. One of them, a grave and very sensible 

^lan, told me, he was convinced they were in the wrong ; th« it 

■Z3 not the part of wise men to give up themselves to their 

liscry, but always to take hold of the helps which reason offered, 

[5 well for present support, as for future deliverance ; he told

the Englishmen f had tasted for many years ; and which, it may 
be supposed, they were exceedmg glad of. 

The Spaniards added tO our feast five whole kids, which the 
cooks roasted ; and three of them were sent covered up close, on 
board the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat 
from on shore^ as we did with thcilr salt meat Bxim on board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innoccndy merry, I 
brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, that there might be 
no dispute about dividing, I shewed them that there was suffi- 
cient for them all ; desired, that they might all take an equal 
quantity of the goods that were for wearing ; that is to say, 
equal when made up. As, first, I distributed linen sufficient to 
make every one of them four shirts ; and> at the Spaniard's 
request, afterwards made them up six; these were exceeding 
comfortable to them, having been what, as I may say, they had 
long ^nce foi^ot the use of, or what it was to wear them. 

I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before, 
to make every one a light coat, like a frock, which I judged 
fittest for the heat of the season, cool and loose ; and ordered, 
that whenever they decayed, they should make more, as they 
thought fit. The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, and hats, iSc. 

I cannot express what pleasure, what satis^icdon, sat upon 
the countenances of all these poor men, 'when they saw the care 
I had taken of them, and how well I had furnished them : they 
told me, I was a father to them ; and that, having such a cor- 
respondent ELS I was, in so remote a part of the world, it would 
make them forget that they were left in a desolate place ; and 
they all voluntarily engaged to mc, not to leave the place with- 
out my consent. 

Then I presented to them thri people I had brought with mc ;

'ork immediately, and with my leave, made them every one i 

t the first thing he did ; and, which was still more, he taugBl 

ic women tiot only how to sew and stitch, and use the needlt^

ir al! the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they 
rere, for they took in pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, 
md made them clever, convenient tables, stools^ bedsteads, cufH 
joaj-ds, lockers, shelves, and every thing they wanted of thai

But, to let them see how nature made artificers at first, 1 car- 
'ied the carpenters to see fj^ill ^4tkins's basket-house, as 1 called 
it; and they both owned, they never saw an instance of such 
lamral ingenuity before ; nor any thing so regular, and so handily 
luilt, at least of its kind : and one of them, when he saw it,

that every one gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an 
unhappy lite with us, there Sdng no woman in the ship but 
herself; but she bore it with padcncc. After a while, seeing 
things so well ordered, and in so fine a Avay of thriving upon 
my island, and confiidering that they had neither business or ac- 
<)uaineance in the East IkJus^ or reason for caking so long a 
voy^c; I <ay, considering all this, both of them came to me, 
and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island^ 
and be entered among my family, at they called it 

I agreed to it readily ; and they had a little plat of ground 
allottcil to ihetn, where ihcy had ihrre icnts ur houses set up, 
surrounded with a basket-worlc, palisado'd like jitkins'Sy adjoin* 
ing to his plantation ; their tents were contrived so, that they 
had each of them a room, a pare to lodge in, and a m^Jdle tent* 
like a girat storc-houw, to lay all their goods in, and to cat and 
drink in. And now the other two Engiithmen removed their 
habintion to the same place : and so the island was divided into 
three colonies, and no more; vix. The Sfamurds^ with oM

if they had not known there was such a things and looked on

The first hour that I began to convtrw with him, after he

delight exceedingly in hb conversation. And he first began wirfi 
me about religion, in the nu»t obliging manner !magiml>!c. 

Sir, siys he, you have no: only, under Goo (and at that be 
crossed his breast) saved my life, but you have admitted me to 
go this voyage in your ship, ajid by your obliging civility, bavc 
taken mc into your ftnuly, giving mc an opportunity o( free 
conversation. Now, Sir, says he, you sec by my habit what 
my profts»on is; and I guess by your nation, what your's is: 
I may think it is my duty, and doubOciu it iit *«j, to xisc my ut- 
most endeavours, on all occasions, to bring all the m>uU I can to

therefore 1 shall not, without your leave, enter into any debates

than you shall give me leave.

ind himself the worse used for being of a diiFerent opinion from 
lus ; and if wc did not converse without any dislike on citbcr 
isidej upon that score, it should be his fault, not ours. 

He replied. That he thought all our conversation might be 
leasily separated from disputes; that it was not his business to 
leap principles with every man he discoursed with ; and that he 
ir^iiher desired me to converse with him as a gentleman, than as 
a religieux : that if I would give him leave, at any time, to dis- 
course upon religious subjects, he would readily comply with it; 
[and that then he did not doubt but I would allow him also to 
ilirfL-iid his own opinions, as well as he could : but thatj without

say* thar wc may not dtScr in the general principles, though we 
miy be of some diifcnng opiDDons in the practice of pirticula:^. 
Fintt Sir, chough wc differ in some of the doctrinal snicks of 
rdjgioii, imd it is very unhappy that it is so, especially in the 
case bc&rc us, as I shall shew afterwards; ycc ihcrc arc some 
gencrJ principles in which wc both agree ; viz. First,, that there 
is a Goi>, and that thU God, having given us some stated ge- 
nera) tm\c^ for our service and obedience, wc ought not willingly 
and knowingly to oflcnd him, cither hy neglecting to do what 
he haa commanded, or by doing what he has exprexaly forbidden^ 
■nd Jet our different religions be what they will^ this general 
prtnd^e b readily owned \jy us alL That the blessing of Goo 
doo not oirdinarily follow a presumptuous sinning ^atnst his 
command; and cvxry good Christian will be affectionately con- 
cerned to prevent any that are under his care living in a total 
ticglect of God and his commands. It is not your men 
Protestants, whatever my opinion may lie of such, that di 
me from being concerned for their souls, and from endeavour- 
ing, if it lies before me, that the) should live in as little distance 
frum, andcnmtty ^ith their M^cr as [x>^blc; especially if you

concern himself for us; and begged be would expUin the jnr- 
Dculars of what he had observed, that, like J^hwt, (to take hia

and yet axe doc married to them after any stated legal manitcri 
as the lavrs of God and man require; and thcfetore arc yet, la 
the sense of both, no less than atiultfr^rj, atid living In adultery* 
To thiR, Sir, says he^ I know you will object, that there wu M 
clergyman, or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to pcr^ 
form the ceremony : nor any pen and ink, or paper, to writQ 
down a comvact of marriage, and have it signed between rheru, 
And I know also, Sir, what the ^^jA/^r^ governor has told youg 
I mean o^ the agreement that he obliged tbcm to make when 
they took these womcn^ viz. That they should chusc them ocit 
by content, and kc<-p separATely to them; which, by the wtyi 
is nothing of a m^rnage, no agreement with the women as 
wives, but only an agreement among themselves, to keep them 
from (iu;melling. 1 

But, Sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so IM 
called It, being a RsmAn) consists not only in the mutual coascnfi 
of the parties ti> take one another as man and wife^ but in tho 
formal and legal obligation that there ts in the contract, to oovn^ 
pel die man and woman, at all times, to own and acknowta^ 
each other; obliging the men to abstain from aU the othcr^^ 
men, to engage in no other contract while these subsi&t; and on 

Elll occasions, as ability allou-v, to provide honestly for thctn, and. 
their children ; and to oblige the women to the same, or hkc con*

Now, Sir, /tfy/ ht^ thcac men may, when tHcy picuc, or when

men, who at present are your subject*, under your absolute go- 
vernment and dominion, arc allowed by you to live in open 
adultery? 

I confess, I was stnick at the thing itself, but much more vtth 
the convincing arguments he supported it with ; for it was ee^ 
txinly true, that though ihey had no clergyman on the spot, vet 
■ formal contract on both lidcsj made before onenesses, and oon- 
tirmed by any token, which they had all agrted to be bound by, 
though it had been but breaking a stick between them, cng^ing 
the men to own these women for their wives upon ^t occasions^ 
snd never to abandon them or their children, and the women to 
the same with their hiubinds, had been an efiectual lawful mar- 
riage Ln the sight of God ; aiid it was a great neglect that it was 
not done. 

But 1 thought to have gotten off with my young prie«ti by 
telling him, that aJl that part was doiK when I was not here; 
amd fhcy had lived so many years with them now^ that if it was 
an adultery, ic was put remedy \ they could do nothing in ic 
now. 

Sir, jays hc^ asUng yattr fwrtbn fffr such freedom^ you are right 
in thia; that it being done in your absence, you cotjld not be

your power now to put an end to it -, and in. nobody's power Sot 
your's, 

I was 50 dull still, that I did not take him right i but I ima- 
gined, that, by putting an end to it, he mcan'd, that I should 
part them, and not suffer them to live together any longer; and 
J said to hintj I could not do that by any means, for that it would 
put the whole island into confusion. He seemed 3uq>n5ed that 
I should so far mistake him. No, Sir> says ke, I Ao not mem 
that you should now separate them, but legally and effectually 
marry them now. And as, Sir, my way of marrying may not 
be so easy to reconcile them to, though it mil be as effectual, 
even by your own laws ; so your way may be as well befbie 
God, and as valid among men; I mean, by a written contract, 
signed by both man and woman, and by all the witnesses pre- 
sent ; which all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid* 

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity 
of zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse, as to 
his own party or church, and such true warmth for the preserv- 
ing people that he had no knowledge of, or relation to ; I say, 
for preserving them from transgressing the laws of God ; the 
like of which I had indeed not met with any where. But re- 
collecting what he had said of manying them by a written con- 
tract, which I knew would stand too, I returned it back upon 
him, and told him, I granted all that he had said to be just, and, 
on his part, very kind \ that 1 would discourse with the men upon 
the point now, when I came to them. And I knew no reason 
why they should scruple to let him marry them all ; which I 
knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid 
in England^ as if they were married by one of our own cletgy- 
men. What was afterwards done in this matter, I shall qxak 
of by itself 

I then pressed him to tell me, what was th£ second cmtiplmm 
which he had to make \ acknowledging, that I was very moch

hb debtor for tht first ; and thanked him hcartil)' for it. He 
told me he would use the simc ffredom ami pUmncss in the 
second ; and hoped I would rake ir ns well : and rh:s was, that 
noTAHthstandiiig these Evgirjh subject:^ of mine^ as he talkd thtm^ 
had lived with those women for ^ilmoat seven vcats, had taught 
thcrii tci sjxr^tk English, ami rvcn Ui read it ; aiid thjit they vrcrc, 
as he perceived, i^omen of tolerable understandings, and capable 
of instniction ; yet they' had not to t}us hour aught them any 
thing of the Christian religion ; no» not so much to know chat 
there w«s a God, or a worship, or in what manner Goi> was to 
be served ; or that their own idolatry, and wonhipf^ng they 
knew not who, was false and absurd* 

This, he aaid, was an unaccountable neglect, and what God 
would certainly call them to account for; aiid, perhaps, at last 
take the work out of their hards. He spoke this very ailec- 
txnatelf and warmly. I am persuaded, s^ys Ar, had those men 
lived in the savage country, whence their wjvca came, the savages 
wRQiuld have taken more pains to have brought them to be idoLa- 
terSf and to worship the dcvit, than any of these men, s^ far as 
he €9uld stf^ hod taken with than» to teach them the knowledge 
of the tnte God. Kow, Sir, suid he^ thoi^h I do not acknow- 
ledge your religion, or you mine, yet we should be glad to 9ce 
the dcvil'5 servants, and the subjects of hb kingdom, taught to 
know the genciai principles of the Christian rcl^k^n ; thai [hey 
might ac least hear of God, and of a Redermer^and of the rcsar^

Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an' occa^on of do- 
ing good ; which is really worth the expense of a man's whole life, 
I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say s 
I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion 
before me, let his particular principles be of what kind soever. 
As for me, I had not so much as entert^ned a thought of this in 
my heart before ; and, I believe, should not have thought of it ; 
for I looked upon these savages as slaves^ and people, who, had 
we any work for them to do, we would have used as such, or 
would have been glad to have transported them to any other part 
of the world ; for our bu^ness was to get rid of them ; and we 
would all have been satisfied, if they had been sent to any coun- 
try, so they had never seen thm own. Buty to the case : I say, 
1 was counfounded at his discourse, and knew not what answer 
to make him. He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some 
disorder : Sir, says he^ I shall be very sorry, if what 1 have said 
gives you any offence. No, no, si^s /, 1 am offended with no- 
body but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to 
think that I should never take any notice of this before, but with 
reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now. You know. 
Sir, said /, what circumstances I am in ; I am bound to the East 
Indies J in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it would 
be an unsufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the 
men lying all this while at victuals and wages upon the owner's 
account ; it is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here ; and 
if I stay more, I must pay 3/. sterling per diem demmr^e ; nor 
can I suy upon demurrage above eight days more ; and I have 
been here thirteen days already; so that I am pcrfectiy unable 
to engage in this work, unless I would su^er myself to be left 
behind here agun ; in which case, if this single ship should mis- 
carry in any part of her voyage, I should be just in the same 
condition that I was left in here at first; and from which I have 
been so wonderfiilly delivered.

I w^Ls sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday^ because I 
could not think of parting with him, and that for man)' rtasons; 
he had been the companioi^ of my tmvels ; he was not only faith* 
ful to me, but sincerely affectionate to the last degree ; and I had 
Tcaolvcd to do something considcrubtc for him, if he out-lived 
me, as it waa probable he would : then I knew, that as I had bred 
Friday up to be a Protestant, it would quite confixmd him, to 
bring him to embrace another profe^ion; and he would never, 
while his eyes were open believe, hts old master was a heretic. 
and would he damned ; and this might in ^ end rviti the poor 
felloWs principles;, and so turn htm to his first idolatry. 

However, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it 
was this : I told him, I could not say that I was witling to t^njtl

He seemed very much concerned at it ; for he had no rational

given me. 

Before I went from their quarter, they all came to me, and 
told me, they had been considering what I had said; that they 
were very glad to hear I had a clergyman in my company ; and 
they were very willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, and 
to be formally married as soon as I pleased; for they were far 
from desiring to part with thrir wives ; and that they meant no- 
thing but what was very honest, when they chose them ; so I 
appointed them to meet me the next morning ; and that, in the 
mean time, they should let their wives know the meaning of the 
marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent any scandal, 
but also to oblige them, that they should not forsake them, 
whatever might happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the 
thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had 
reason to be ; so they failed not to attend all together, at my

very faithfully distinguished between what I said from myself, and

I agreed with him in that part rauUly* and was for going 
ibout it presently. No, no ; hold^ Sitj Mid ht^ (hough I would 
have her be baptised by all mnns, yet I must obocrvct that /^i// 
yfikini, htT tiusbattd^ has indecid broit^fhc her^ in a wonderful 
manner^ to be willing lo embrace a religious life ; and has g^vcn 
her just ideas of the being of a God, of his power, justke, 
mercy ; yet I desire to know of hini> if he has said any thing tu 
her of JeHuf Christ, and of the EalvarJon of sinnen ; of the 
nature of faith in him; and redemption by him; of the Holy 
Spirit, the resurrection, the laat Judgment, and a future state. 

I called fflU Atkins again, iutd fuJced him : but the jxjor 
fellow fell immediately into tear^, and told us, he had said some- 
thing to her ofail those things, but that he was himsctfio wicked a 
CTtacurc, and his own cotuciciicc so rcproichcd him vrjth his 
horrid ungodly life, thai he trembled at the apprehensions, that 
her knowledge of him should lessen the attuntion she should give 
lo those things, and make her rather contemn religion than receive 
it : but he was a^ured^ he siiJ^ that her mind wji5 so disposed 
to receive due impressions of all those things, chat if I would but 
discourse with her, she would make it appear to my satistactioni 
that my Ubour would iwt be lost upon her. 

Accordingly 1 called her in, and placing mytelf as interpreter, 
between my religious priest and tbc woman, I entreated him to 
begin with her : but sure such a scimon was never preached by a 
|x>])iHh prk'st In ilu-^ latter ag<^^ of rhc world ^ and, as J iciJ him^ I 
thought he had all the zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity 
of a Christian, without the errora of a Kcman Catholic ; and chat 
I took him to be such a dergynun as the Hsman bishops were, 
before the church of R^mt assumed spiritual »uvcreignty over 
the consciences of men. 

In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace the

But my clergyman had not dotie ycc, his thoughts hung 
continually upon the conversion of the leven and thirty savages; 
and fain he would Y\a\'^ staid upon the island to have undertaken 
it: but I convinced him^ l-ir^, chat his urtdcnaking was imprac- 
ticable in Itself; and secoTidIy> ihki perhaps I would put it iiiro 
ft way of being done, in his absence, to his sscififaction ; of which 
by ar^ by. 

Having thus brotcght the affair of the island to a narrow 
compass, I was prq^aring co go on Iwanl the ship, when 
the young man, who I had taken out of the famished ship's 
company, came to me, and told me, he understood I had a 
clergyman with me, and that I had cauxd the Englishmfn to he 
married to the savages, whom they called wives; that he had a 
match too, which he desired might be finished before I went, 
l>ccweca two Christians ; which he hoped would not be disagtee-

1 knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's 
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island; 
fto I began to persuade him not to do any thb^g of that kind 
nuhly, or be<^use he found himself in this solitary carctimslHnce. 
1 represented to him, that he had some considerable substmce in 
the world and good tricnds, xs 1 understood by himself, and by 
his maid also ; that the m»d was not only poor, and a servant, 
but was urwqual to him, she being six or seven and twenty ye«n

have givxn ftJK&dy ; and as for tbc maid, ^ wis a vtTy honest, 
mcxlc«t, sobcT^ and religious ^'oung wom.in ; had a very good 
tiun offense ; was agreeable enough in her penaon ; $poke very 
handsomely, and to the purpose ; aJways with decency and good

ness to the who!c island ; she knew ver)' well how to behave to 
all kind of fblkK vhe had about her, and to better, if she had found 
an^ there. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them 
the Aamc day ; and, -^ I wa^ fithi-r at the altar, ax I may ^y^ 
and gave her away, to I gave her a portion ; for I appointed her 
and her husband a handsome large ^ce of ground for their 
plantation ; and, indeed thii matcli, and the proposal the young 
gentleman m^Kle^ to give him a small property in the bland, put 
me upon paroclljfig it out ar»ong?t them, that they might not 
quarrel afterwards about their situation. 

7*his sharing out the land to them I left to H^il/ jffkintj who, 
indeed^ was now grown a most sober, grave, managing firllow ; 
perfectly reformed, exceeding pious and religious ; and, as far as 
I may be allowed to speak positively in such a case, I verily bc-

told him, that no^' 1 thought it was put in a fair way ; for the 

kv^cs being thus divided among the Christians, if they would 

but every one of them do their part with those which came under

Our ship W3« on a tnding voyage, aiul had a supercargo on

by charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to: this was 
none of my business, neither did 1 meddle with tc at all ; my

and friendship, but when it is accepted, tbc other side set up 
three poles, or boughs \ which is a signal that they accept the 
truce too ; but then this is a known condition of the truce, that 
you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards them, nor 
they come past your three poles or boughs towards you ; so that 
you are perfectly secure within the three poles ; and all the space 
between your poles and thor's, is allowed like a market, for free 
converse, traffick, and commerce. When you go there you must 
not cany your weapons with you ; and if they come into that 
space, they stick up their javelins and lances, all at the first poles, 
and come on unarmed ; but if any violence is oiFered them, and 
the truce thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay 
hold of their weapons, and then .the truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a 
greater number of their people came down than usual, but all 
was very friendly and civil, and they brought in several kinds 
of provisions, for which we satisfied them with such toys as we 
had; their women also brought us milk and roots, and several 
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we made 
us a little tent, or hut, of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore 
all night. 

I know not what was the occa^on, but I was not so well sa-^ 
tisfied to lie on shore as the rest ; and the boat riding at an an- 
chor about a stone cast from the land, with two men in her to 
take care of her, I made one of them come on shore ; and get- 
ting some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread 
the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under the cover of 
the branches of trees, all night in the boat. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men 
make a terrible noise on the shore calling out for God's sake to 
bring the boat in, and come and help them, for they were all 
like to be murdered ; at the same time I heard the fixe of fivo 
musquets, which was the number of, the guns they had, and

so easily frighted with guns as the savftgcs were in jimakt^ 
Iwherc I had to do with them, 

AJl this whiie I knew not what was the matter \ but rousw 
limmediately from sleep with the noise, 1 caused the boat to U 
thrust in, and resolvedi with three fusils we had on boards £0 
lland and assist our men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore; but our men were in tco 
Imuch haste; for^ being come to the shore, they plunged into 
the water, to get to the boat with all the expedition they could, 
Ibeing pursued by between three and four hundred men- Ouf 
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had fusees with 
them ; the rest had indeed pistols and swords, but they were of 
Ismail use to them- 

We took up seven of our menj and with difficulty enougii

still worse, was, that while wc stood in the boat to take our riM

followed; and then another; and, in a word, they all left tne 
but one, who 1 persuaded to stay ; so the supercargo and I, wdi 
the third man, went back to the boat, where wc told them, wt 
would stay for them, and take care to take in as many of ihcffl 
as should be left ; for I told them, it was a mad thing they wnc 
going about, and supposed most of them would run the fatc</ 



«lK>iit, yct» to give them their due, they i^-cnt about it as warily 
ta boldly. They vrcre g<dUnlly anncd, thxt is nuc; for tlicy 
had every man a fusee or mu^guef^ 1 tnyoner, cvtry man a 
pisCol ; some of them had brood cutlasses, some of them hingcrs; 
and the boAt9W«in> and two morc^ had polc-axcs: bcndcs alJ 
whid^, they had airoi^ them thirteen hind-graiadoes. Btilder 
fellows, and better [vovidcd never went about any wicked work 
in the world. 

When they went out, their chief design was plunder; and 
they were in itiighty hojjcs tyf fimling gold there ; but a circum- 
stance, which rone of them were aware of^ set them on fire with 
rrvenge, and made deviU of them oil. When they came to the 
few jKJian houaes* which they thought had been the town, which 
was not above h&lf a mWe off, they were under a great disappoint 
ment ; for there was not above t^fc-clve or thirteen houses ; and 
where the town was. or how big, they knew not; they consulted 
chcrcforc what to do, and was some time before they could 
resolve: for if they fell upon these, chcy must cut all their 
throats; and it was ten to one but some of them might escape, 
it being in the night, though the moon vras up ; and if one es- 
caped, he would run away, and raise all the tcnvn, so they should 
hstvc a whole army upon them. Again, on the other hand, 
if they went away, aixl left tbo% untouched (for the pcojile were 
^1 asleqi) they could not tell which way to look tor the town. 

However, the last W3» the be«t advice ; so they resolved m 
leave rhcm> and look for the town as well as they could. They 
went on a liitic way, and found a cow tied to a tree ; this they 
presently concluded would be a gixxl guide iu tbcm ; for they 
said the cow certainly belonged to the town before theTn» or the 
town behind them ; and if they untied her, they should we which 
way she went : if she went back, they had nothing to say to her ; 
but if she went forward, they had nothing to do but to follow 
her ; so they cut the cord, which was made of i:v<\i£U^ ^as^, ^s^

the cow went on before them. In a word, the cow 1b 
directly to the town, which, as ^ey report, connted a 
loo houses, or huts ; and in some of these the^ finind 
jamilies living tt^ethcr. 

Here they found all in silence ; as profoundljr sectlR, 
and a country that had never seen an enemy of that Idn 
make them. And iirst they called anodic council, oi t 
what they had to do ; and, in a word, they resolved ti 
themselves into three bodies, and to set three Houses oi 
three parts of the town ; and as the men came out to saz 
and bind them ; if any resisted, liiey need not be asked 
do then ; and so to search the rest of the houses for plund 
they resolved to march silendy first tiirough the town, 
what dimcn^ons it was of, and if they might venture up 
no. 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would 
upon them ; but while they were animating one anothei 
work, three of them, that were a little before the rest, ca

take fire ; but after a little search, they /bund that would \^g ^ 
no purpose ; but the most of the houses were iow> and ^am^xdied 
TWth flags or rushes, of which the country b full ; so they yj/tv 
sently made some wild fire, as we call it, by wetting a little pow- 
der in the palms of their hands { and in a quarter of an hour they 
set the town on iire in four or five places ; and particularly that 
house where the Indians were not gone to bed. As soon as the 
fire began to blaze, the poor frighted creatures began to rush out 
to save their lives ; but met with their fate in the attempt, and 
especially at the door, where they drove them back, the boatswain 
himself killing one or two with his polc-axc ; the house being 
lai^, and many tn it, he did not care to go in, but called for a 
hand-grenado, and threw it among them, which at first frighted 
them ; but when it bursty made such havock among them, that 
they cried out in a hideous manner- 

In short, most of the Indians who were in the open part of the 
house, were killed or hurt with the grcnado, except two or three 
more, who pressed to the door, which the boatswain and two 
more kept, with the bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and 
dispatched all that came diat way. But there was another apart' 
inent in the house, where the prince, or king, or whatever he 
was, and several others, were ; and these they kept in, tiU the 
house, which was by this time all of a hght flame, fell in upon 
them, and they were smothered, or biunt together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not 
waken the people faster than they could master them ; but the 
fire began to waken them fast enough, and our fellows were glad 
to keep a little together in bodies ; for the fire grew so n^ng, 
all the houses being made of light combustible stuff, that they 
could hardly bear the street between them ; and their business 
was to follow the fire for the surer execution. As &st as the fire 
cither forced the people out of those houses which were burning, 
or Hinted them out of others, our people were ready at tiicir

icldcd to their importunity, and had «cnt for his goods from

I had another way before mc, which was to wait for some 

Ingiish ships, which were coming to B^ngai from Achin^ on the

EHS I came hither without any concern wiih the Kng/ish Eeut

and I was very well satisfied with my adventure. I ob^rvt 
that our people in England often admire how the officers, whki 
the Company send into India^ and the merchants which gtfit 
rally stay there, get such very great estates as they da, ao^ 
sometimes come home worth 60 to 70 and 100 thousand pourxk 
at a time. 

But it is no wonder* or, at least, we shall sec so much fardv 
into it, when tvc consider the innumerable parts and plafies whet 
they have a free commerce, that it will then be no wonder; aad 
much less will it be so, when we consider, that at all those plios 
land ports where the English ships come, there is so much, znd 
such constant demand for the growth of all other countries, that 
there is a certain vent for the returns, as well as a market abraa4 
for the goods carried out. 

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so modi 
money by the first adventure, and such an insight into th« lUfr

chanf'H life; who, when he xk nt>road u[ion ulvcntttrtrs, it is hb 
urifdom to stick to that, as the be*rc thing for him, which he is 
like to get the most mone^ by. My new friend kept himKlf

licaui of the boat to keep her from sinking ; so she Uy by, ;iiid 
<:nou{*h of it ; but vcetng the foremost bout crowd on after 
we made ready to fire at her in pirtieuUr. 
While this vns doing, one of the three boats that was bchiodr 
being forwarder than the other iwo, nude uji to die botit which 
we had disabled, to relieve hcr^ and wc could afcervnrdn we her 
take out the men: wc called again to the foremost boat, and 
oftred a truce to parley again, and to know what was ha buai- 
ne» with Ufi ; but had no answer : only ^he crowded close under 
our atem. Upon this our guimer, who vns a very dexttroiis 
fellow, run out his two chase guns, and fired again at her ; but 
the Hhut mb&.'cing, ihc ricn in (he IkkU ^u>iitrJ, waved their L':tps, 
and came on; but the gunner, getting (juickly ready again, fired 
among them the second time ; one shot of whidt, though it 
missed the txMt itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could 
easily see had dore a great deal of mischief among them ; but 
we, taking no notice of that, ^^vared the ship again, and hroughl 
our quarter to bear upon them ; and, finng three guns more, 
we found the boat was split almost to pieces ; in particular, her 
rudder, and a piece of her 5tem, was shoe quite away ; so they 
handed their sal] immediately, and were in great disorder : but, 
to complete their mistbrtunc, our gunner let fly two guns at 
them again ; where he bit them we could not tell, but wc found 
the boat was »nking, atxl some of rhe men already tn the water. 
Upon this I immediately manned out our pinnace, which we 
had kept clo^e by our &idc, with orders to pick up some of the 
men, if they could, and save them from drowning, and immcdj* 
atcly to come on board with them ; because we saw the rest of 
the boats began to come up. Our men in the f^nnace followed 
their ordcr?^, and look up three men ; one of which was jtnt 
drowmng, and it was a good while before we c&v^t«»it:x*^uiKGk. 



J32 Life and Adventurks 

As soon as they were on board, we crowded all the sail wz could 
nuke, and stood tkrther out to sea ; and we found that when die 
other three boats came up to the first two^ they gave over tbdr 
chace. 

Being thus ddivered from a danger, which though I knew not 
the reason of it, yet aeemed to be much greater than I a^qnc- 
hended, I took care that wc would change our course, and not 
let any one im^nc whither we were going ; so we stood out to 
sea eastward, quite out of the course of all European ships, -wbc- 
ther they were bound to Chinas or any where else, mthin tlie 
commerce of the European nations. 

When we were now at sea, we began to consult with the two 
seamen, and inquire first, what the meaning of all this should 
be? And the Dutchman let us into the secret of it at once; 
telling us, that the fellow that sold us the ship, as we said^ wis 
no more than a thief that had run away with her. Then he tobi 
us how the captain, whose name too he told us, though I do not 
remember, was treacherously murdered by the natives on the 
coast of Malacca^ with three of his men ; and that he, this 
Dutchman^ and four more, got into the woods, where they wan- 
dered about a great while ; till at length, he, in particular, in i 
miraculous manner, made his escape, and swam off to a Duid 
ship, which, sailing near the shore, in its way from China^ had 
sent their boat on shore for fresh water ; that he durst not come 
to that part of the shore where the boat was, but shift in tbc 
night Co take the water farther off, and the ship's boat took him 
up. 

He then told us, that he went to BataviHy where two of tbe 
seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest 
in their travels \ and gave an account, that the fellow who Itfl 
run away with the ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pinDci, 
which were gone a cruising in her; and that they had alrevt^ 
taken an English ship, and two Dutch ships, very richly laden.

X knew it to be false, >xt» as my partner said very well, if we 
Liul fnWcn into their hands, and they had had aucb a prepossess 
lion afraintt us before-hand^ it hid been in vain for us to have 
leftnded ourselves, or to hope for any good f^uarter at their i

bur judges, and that we could have exjwcted nothing from them 
[C what rage would have dictated, and an ungoveriied passion

It in, who we bought her of, and the like ; and, which was 
lorr than all the rear, if we were put fo ihc necewity of bring- 
it before the proper judges, we should be sure to have some 
tCice ; and not be hanged lir^t, and judged afterwards, 
I was some time of my partner's opinion ; but after a little 
venous thinkings I told him, I thought it waa a very great 
(hazard for us to attempt returning to Sfn^ai^ for that we were 
ton the wrong side of the straits of Mdttuta ; and that if the 
^larm was given, we ^ihould be ^itre tu Ik way-lud on every dd^ \

if we should be taken, as it were, runnir^ sivay, we should even 
condemn ourselves, and there would want no nwre evidence to 
destroy us, I also asked the Engliih sailor's opinion, who said, 
lie was of my mind, and that we should certainly be taken, 
I Thia danger a little startled my partner, and all the slup'a 
pmpany ; and we inunediitety resolved to go away to the eoasc '

gw, began to throw themselves into the long-boat, where k 
had but five men in all to defend it : but one accident gave ov 
men a complete victory, which deserved our laughter rather i)ib 
any thing else ; and that was this — 

Our carpenter being preparing to grave the outside of the lUp, 
as well as to pay the seams where he had caulked hcr^ to sttf 
the leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the boat ; ou 
filled with boiling pitch, and the other with rosin> tallow, and 
oil, and such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work i and die 
man that tended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, 
with which he supplied the men that were at work with that hoi 
stuff: two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where this 
fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets; he immediately saluted 
them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and 
scalded them, being half-naked, that they roared out like two 
bulls, and enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. The 
carpenter saw it, and cried out, Well done, Jack^ give them 
some more of it ; and stepping forward himself, takes one of 
their mops, and dipping it in the pitch-pot, he and his man threw 
it among them so plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in 
three boats, there was not one that was not scalded and burnt 
with it in a most frightful pitiful manner, and made such a howl- 
ing and crying that I never heard a woree noise, and, indeed, 
nothing like it; for it is worth observing, that thou^ pain 
naturally makes all people cry out, yet every nation has a par- 
ticular way of exclamation, and make noises as different from one

He tone of it ; for I never heard aiiy tbiog more like tJie nobc 
Hf the wolves, which, ns I bivr s^td, I heard howl tn the forest 
^oh the froTiricrs of Lan^ufjp£, 

J I was never pleased with a victory better in my life ; not only 
I i$ it wm a perfect surprUc to mc, aiid that our diuigcr was tm- 
., mtncrt bcfotc ; but as we gcK this victory without any blooti- 
fthed, exccj^t of that man the fellow killed with his naked hands, 
and which I was ver>' much concerned at ; for 1 was sick of kill- 
ing such [x>or navagc wretches, even though it was iri my uwn 
defence, knowing they came un errands which they thought juu^ 
and knew no better : aiid that though it may be a just thing, 
because necessary, tor there is no necessary wickodncts in nature ; 
yet I thought Jt was u ^ life* which wc mu^ be always obl^ed 
to be killing our fellow-creacureE to preserve ; and, iitdeed, I 
think so still ; and 1 WM3uld> even now, sulier a great deal, rather 
than I would lake away the life even of that person injunng mc. 
Ami 1 believe all considering pcopli-, who know the value of 
life, w^uld be of my opinion^ at least they would, \f they entered 
seriously into the consideration of it. 

But to nrtum to my stoi>' : all the while this was doing, my 
partner and I, who managed the rest of the men on board, had^ 
with great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights; and, 
having gotten the guns into their places again, the gunner called 
to me, to bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly 
among them. 1 called back again to him, and bid him not oAer 
to Arc, rbr the carpenter woukl do the work without him; but 
bade him heal aiwiher pitch-kcttk; which our cook, who was 
on board, took care of. But the enemy was so terrified with 
what they had met with in their fltsC attack, that they would not 
come on again ; and some of them, that were farthest ofF, seeing 
the ship swim, as it were, upright, lx^uw» a* «t«o:^(pj*\^Vi>Wi

From hence we sailed still nonh, kficptng the coast of China 
at an equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports 
of CAiJtftf^ where otir Euroftan ships usually come; being rt-

in this country, where, as our circunxstanccs were, wc could not 
£ul of being entirely ruined ; nay, so great was my fear in par- 
tictibr, as to my being taken by them, that I believe firmly I 
would much rather have chosen to fal! into the hands of the 
Spanish Inquisiiicn. 

Being row come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolred f o put 
into the firat trading port wc should come at ; and standing in for 
the shoee, a boat eame off t^-o leagues to ue» with an old P9ttu-

came to ofltr his service, which, indeed, we were very glad of, 
and took him on board ; upon whjch» withour asking us whither 
wt would go. he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent them 
back. 

1 thought it was noir so much in our choice to make the old 
man carry us whither wc would, that I began to talk ^-ith him 
about carrying us to the Gulph of NdH/jitin^ which b the most 
iKsrthcm part of (be coast of CTiikj, The old man said he knew 
the Gulph o( Nanquin very well { but smiltDg, asked us what wt 
would do there? 

I told him we would m^II our cargo, and purchase Chiwd wires, 
calicoes^ raw silks, tea, wrought silks, ye- and » would return

a market for our opium^ to our satisikctionf and might, for out I 
money, have purchased all sorts of Chim goods as cheap as ve 
could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old nun out of his talk, of which 
he was vciy opiniatcd or conceited, I told him vc were gcntk- 
men as well as merchants, and that we had a mitid to go and sec 
the great citjr of Peking and the famous court of the monardi 
of China, Why then, says the old man, you should go to 
NingpQ^ where, by the river which runs into the sea there, you 
may go up within five leagues of the great canaL This canal tsi 
navigable river, which goes through the heart of that vast em;xjt 
of China^ crosses all the nvcrs, passes some considerable hills by 
the help of sluices and gates, and goes up to the city^ of P^om^ 
being in length near 270 leagues. 

Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese^ but that is not our business 
now : the great question is. If you can carry us up to the dty of 
Nanquin^ from whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards ? Y«, 
he said, he could do so very well, and that there was a great 
Dutch ship gone up that way just before. This gave me a little 
shock ; and a Dutch ship was now our terror, and we had much 
rather have met the devil, at least if he had not come in too 
frightful a figure: and we depended upon it, that a Dutch ship 
would be our destruction, for we were in no condition to fight 
them ; all the ships they trade with in those parts being of great 
burden, and of much greater force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused, and under some con- 
cern, when he named a Dutch ship; and said to me. Sir, you 
need be under no apprehension of the Dutch^ I suppose they we 
not now at war with your nation. No, said 1, that's true \ but 
I know not what liberties men may take, when they are out of 
the reach of the laws of their country. Why, said he,^«« m-i 
no pirates, what need you fear ? They will not meddle with 
peaceable merchants, sure.

disorder and confusion imaginable; nor was it possibly ^ ^^^^ 
to conceal it so, but that the old man easily perceived it. 

Sir, said'he, I find you arc in some disorder in your thoughts 
at my talk : pray be pleased to go which way you think fit ; and 
depend upon it, I will do you all the service I can- Why, 
Seignior, said I, it is true, I am a litde unsettled in my resolution 
at this time, whither to go in particular ; and I am something 
more so, for what you said about pirates : I hope there are no 
pirates in these seas ; we are but in an ill condition to meet with 
them ; for you see we have but a small force, and but very 
weakly manned. 

Oj Sir, said he^ do not be concerned ; I do not know that 
there has been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years, except 
one, which was seen, as I hear, in the bay of Siamy about a 
month mce ; but you may be assured she is gone to the south- 
ward ; nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the work ; 
she was not built for a privateer, but was run away mth by a 
reprobate crew that were on board, after the captain and some 
of his men had been murdered by the MaUccans^ at or near the 
island of Sumatra, 

What ! said I, seeming to kni>w nothing of the matter^ did they 
murder the captain? No, said ^, I do not understand that they 
murdered him ; but as they afterwards run away with the ship, 
it is generally believed they betrayed him into the hands of the 
MaUucans^ who did murder him ; and, perhaps, they procured 
them to do it. Why then, said /, they deserved death, as much 
as if they had done it themselves. Nay, said the old man^ they 
do deserve it; and they will certainly have it if they light upon 
any English or Dutch ship ; for they have all agreed together, 
that if they meet that rc^e, they will give him no quarter.

adding, that they would have the blood of those men, who we 
killed there, in our just defence, to answer for. 
~ The old man was amazed at this relation ; and told us, we 
were very much in the right to go away to the north ; and that 
if he might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China^ 
which we might very well do, and buy or build another in the 
country : and, said he, though you will not get so good a ship, 
yet you may get one able enough to carry you and all your 
goods back again to Bengaly or any where else. 

1 told him I would take his advice, when I came to any port 
where I could find a ship for my turn, or get any customer to 
buy this. He replied, I should meet with customers enough for 
the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would serve me very 
well to go back agdn ; and that he would procure me people both 
to buy one, and sell the other. 

Wcll^ but, Seignicr, says I, as you say they know the ship so

But fear, that blind usele^ passion, ^^rked another way, anc^ 
threw us into the vapours ; it bewildered our understandings, 
and set the imagination at work, to form a thousand terrible 
things, that, perhaps, might never hap|)ch» We firet supposed, 
as indeed every body had related to us, that the seamen on board 
the English and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so 
enraged at the name of a pirate, and especially at our beating of 
their boats, and escaping, that they Vould not give themselves 
leave to inquire whether %b Wcfc pirates Or no ; b'ut would exe- 
cute us off-hand, as we call it, without giving us any room for 
a defence^ We reflected that there was really so much appa- 
rent evidence before them, that they would scarce enquire after 
any more \ as, first, that the ship was certainly the same, and 
that some of the seamen among them knew her, and had been 
on board her ; and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at 
the river of Cambodia^ that they were coming down to examine 
tis, we fbtight their boat, and flcd» So that we made no doubt 
but they were fully satisfied of our being pirates as we were sa- 
tisfied of the contrary ; and as I often said, I know not but I 
should have been apt to have taken those drcumstances for evi- 
dence, if the taUes were turned, and my case was theirs ; and 
have made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without 
believing, or perhaps considering^ what they might have to offer 
in their defence.

of ^mhyna came into my head, and how the Dutch might, pcf- 
haps, torture us, as they did our countrymen there ; and nab 
some of our men, by extremity of torture, confess those crima 
they never were guilty of; own themselves, and all of us, to be 
pirates \ and so they would put us to death, with a formal if-

Life and AovENTUitEa 



As this IS the only excursion of this kind which J have made 
all the account 1 have given of ray Iravcis, so I shall nuke 

I more descriptions of countries and people : It is none of my 
jusiness, or any part of my design; but giving an account of 

ly own adventures, through a life of inimitable wanderings, and 
long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few that come after 

le will have heard the like of, I shall therefore say very little of 
ill the mighty places, desert countries, and numerous people, I 

lavc yet to pass through, more than relates to my awn ston'. 
ind which my concern among them will make necessary, I was 
low, as near as 1 can compute, in the heart of Chinaj about 
:he latitude of thirty degrees north of the line, for wc was 

eturned from Nanquin : 1 had indeed a mind to sec the city of 

V^/>, which I had heard so much of, and father Sim&Ti impor- 
:uned me daily to do it. At length hts time of going away being

irrived from MucaOy it was necessary that we should resolve

of the provisions, collected it duly from us ; so that our travel- 
ing in the retinue of the mandann, though ic wu a. vcrjr grmt 
kinilnoa to m, was not such a. mighty favour m him, but was, 
indeed, a gKat ad\*ant^ to him, considering there were ibove 
thirty other people ira*^llcd in the stmc minrxr besides us, 
under the procection of his retinue, or, as wc mzy call it» under 
his convoy* This, I say, vna a great advantage to him; for 
the country furnished all the proviiions for nothing, and he took 
oil our money for them. 

We were live-anii-twenly *iays iT^velling to Pekin^ through a 
oouritry infinitely popubuft, but miserably cultivated ; the hufr- 
bsuidry, the oeconomy, and the way of living, miacnble ; Chough 
they bout so much of the industry uf the people: I say miserable; 
and 90 it is; if we, who undcrstard how to live, were 10 endure 
it, or to compare it with our own ; but not so to these poor 
wretches, who know no other. The pride of these people is 
infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing but their puvcrty, 
which adds to that which 1 call their misery. And I mu« needs 
titink the naked savages of Am^ruA live much more happy, 
because, a they have nothing, so they desire nothing ; whereas 
these are |>roud and invilent, and, in the main, are mere beggars 
xnd drudges; their ostentarion is inexpressible, and is chiefly 
shewed in their clothes and building, and in the keeping multi-> 
cudes of servants tx »lave?t, aiul, which is to the kst degree 
ridiculous, their contempt of all the world but themselves, 

1 must confers, I travelled more pleasantly afterwarxis, in tho 
dcaota and vast wildernesses of Grand 7iar/itfrv, than here; and yet 
tbe roads here are well piivrd, and well kepi, and very conveni- 
ent for travellers : but nothing was more awkward to me, than 
to tee such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the mtdst 
of the grossest simplicity and ignorance; for all chcir famed in- 
genuity is no more. And my friciKt, bther SimfiHf and I, used

f these people : for example, coming by the house of a courtry 
rendeman, as J^rher Simon called him, about t^n leagues off of 

he city of Nam^uin^ we had, first of all, the honour to ride wiii 
the master of the house about two miles ; the state he rode is 
was a perfect Don QuixGiismj being a mixture of pomp and 
poverty. 

The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a scan- 
nouch, or nierrj'-andrcw, being a dirty calico^ with all the taw- 
iry and trapping ofa fool's coat, such as hanging sleeves, tassels, 

nd cuts and slashes almost on every side ; it covered a taffen' 

est, as greasy a3 a butcher, and which testified, that his honour 
must: needs be a most exquisite sloven, 

jHis horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling creature, such as 
in Ertgland might sell for about thirty or forty shillings ; and he 
had two slaves followed him on foot, to drive the poor creature 

long : he had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beasr 

fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail ; znd thus

it had been o ff e i ed him> viz. a meu of boiled rice, with a great 
piece of garlick in it, and a little b^ filled with green pcppcfi and 
another pLnnt which they have there, something like our gingeti 
but smelling lilce mu«k, and tasting like mustard ; all this was 
put together, and a sntall lump or piece of lean muEtoti boiled in 
it; and this was hb worship's repast, four or five servants nnrc 
attending at a distance. If he fed them meaner thati he was fed 
himself, the spice excepted, the)' must fare very coarsely indeed. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he was respected 
like a king ; surrounded always with his gendemcn, and attend- 
ed in all his appearances with such pomp, that I saw littk of him 
but at a dbtance ; but this 1 observed, that there was not a 
hone in his retJnuc, but that our carriers' pack-bones in EM^UitJ 
seemed to me to look much better ; but they wrrc so covered with 
equipage, miniles, trappings aitd «uch like trumpery, that you

who I hod stinx kiiowlnlge of at NanqHtn^ and who cune to 
PektB on his own a£urs, went to N^wqnin, where I bought 
nineCy pieces of tine daxnaslu^ with about two hundred preoes of 
other very fii^c stlk}&, of acvcral »ort3, some mixed with gold, and 
had all these brought to Ffkin against niy partner's rcmmi 
bcffldes this we bought a very latge quantity of raw sllk^ and 
some other goods; our cargo amounting, in these goods onlyp 
to about three thou^-uid five hundred pounds sterling, whkh» 
together with tea and some fine calicoes, awl three camek' loads 
of nutHKg^ and cbvcs, loaded in all eighteen camcb for o«jr

in short, twenty -six camels and horses in out retinue. 

The company wu very great, and^ as near ts I can remen^ 
ber, ma^le between three and four hiindml hiirsc, and upward of 
a hundred and twenty men, ver)' well anned> and provided fix all 
events. For, as the eastern caravans are subject to be attaclrcd 
by the jfrah, so arc these by the Tartars ; but they arc not 
altogether so dangerous as the jtrahs^ nor so harbuuus when 
they prevail. 

The company coofiisted of people of several natioRS^ such as, 
Muscovius chiefly ; for there were above sixty of them who 
were merchants or inhahiranu of M9S€9W^ though of them some 
were Uv^iiaws ; and, to our parijcuhr saxisftcaon, five of them 
were Sc^t^ who appcaicd also to be men of great experience in busi-

lutt ; but it was not much, only what wc call a broken head ; 
■either did I afterwards find any great inconvenience from the 
)low, other than the place which was hurt, and which was well 
Lgain in two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory ; for we 
ost a camel, and gained a horse : but that which was remarkable, 
vhen we came back to the village^ the man demanded to be paid 
br the camel ; I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing 
jcfore the Chinese judge of the place \ that is to say, in English j 
ve went before a justice of the peace. Give him his due, he 
u;ted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality ; and hav- 
ng heard both aides, he gravely asked die Chinese man that 
rent with me to buy the camel, whose servant he was f I am 
lo servant, says he^ but went with the stranger. At whose re- 
quest? says the justice. At the stranger's request, says he. 
Why then, said the justice, you were the stranger's servant for 
Jie time ; and the camel being delivered to his servant, it was 
delivered to him, and he must pay for it. 

I confess the thing was so dear, that I had not a word to say ; 
but admiring to see such just reasoning upon the consequence, 
md so, accurate stating the cause, I paid willingly for the camel,'

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire : they 
call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications go there; for this I 
will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathay^ which, 
I believe, are some millions, could not batter down the walls 
with their bows and arrows ; but to call it strong, if it were at- 
tacked with cannon, would be to make those who understand it 
laugh at you.

diately I rode up to ojt leiderj and told him^ who was exactly 
of our mind; and accordingly fifty of us marched to the right 
vring, and Afty to the Icfc, and the rest made a Ymc of rescue ; 
and so we mnrched, leaving the Imt two hundred men to make 
another body by themselves, and to guard the camels \ only 
that, if need were, they should send a hundred men lo assist the 
last fifty. 

In a word, the Tarteri came on» and an innumen^e company 
chcy were; how many^ we could not tcil^ but ten thousand we 
thought was the least. A party of ihcm came on first, and 
viewed our posture, rravrr^irg the ground in the front of our 
line ; ainl as wc found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered 
the two wings to advance s^tiy, and give them a salvo on each 
wing with thctr shoe, which wa.-i i^onz ; but they went oif, and I 
MJppose back to give an account of the recqxion they were Hke 
to meet with; and, indeed, that salute clogged their stomachfi; 
for they immediately halted, stood awhile to con^dcr of it, and, 
wheeliitg off to the left, they gave over the dexign, and loid no 
more to \& for that time ; which w:i^ very agreeable to our eir- 
cumstanccs, which were but vcr)' inditlcrent for a battle with 
such a number.

be God, we are once again come among Christians ! He smilec::^ 
and answered. Do not rejoice too soon, countryman ; the^^ 
Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the 
name of it, you may see very little of the substance for some 
months farther of our journey. 

Well, says I, but sdll it is better than paganism and wor- 
shipping of devils. Why, I'll tell you, says he ; except the 
Russian soldiers in garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of the 
cities upon the road, all the rest of this country, for above a 
thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and most 
ignorant of pagans: and so indeed we found it. 
- We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth, 
if I understand any thing of the surface of the globe, that is to 
be found in any part of the earth : we had at least twelve hundred 
miles to the sea, eastward ; we had at least two thousand to the 
bottom of the Baltic sea, westward ; and above three thousand 
miles, if wc left that sea, and went on west, to the British and 
French channels; wc had full five thousand miles to the Indian 
or Persian sea, south ; and about eight hundred miles to the 
frozen sea, north: nay, if some people may be believed, there 
might be no sea north-east till we came round the pole, and 
consequently into the north-west, and so had a continent of land 
into America^ the Lord knows where ; though I could give some 
reasons why I believe that to be a mistake. 

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a good while 
before we came to any considerable towns, wc had nothing to 
observe there but this : first, that all the rivers run to the east ; 
as I understood by the charts which some in our caravan had 
with them, it was plain all those rivers run into the great river 
Tamoury or Gammour. This river, by the natural course of it, 
must run into the east sea, or Chinese ocean- The story they 
tei/ us, that the mouth of this river is choked up with bulrushes 
of ^ jiionstrous growth, viz_, three foot about, and twenty or

were Rumatis and professed Christiana, yet the inhabitants of 
the coxintry vtcrc mere pagans^ sacrificing to bdah, and wor- 
ahipping the tun, moon, and stars, cr all the host of heaven ; 
and not onJy so» but were, of all the heathinj and pa^ant that ever 
1 met with, the most barbarous, except only that they did not eat 
man*s fleshy as our savages of /frntrka did. 

Some instances of this we met with in the country between 
Argnna^ where we enter the Miuc^viU dominions, and a city of 
Tartars and Russians together, called NfrXzimkay ; im w)ttch i;* 
a conriniJc^Ei dr^urn tir fortst, which cost u* twenty days to travel 
over it. Ill a vill^, near the last of thaw placca^ I hsd the 
curiosity to go and 3CC !hcir way of living ; which is moat bnitish 
and insufferable : they had, I ftuppo^, a great sscnlicc that day ; 
for there stood out upon an c^d stump of a uee, an i^I mode of 
wood, frightful as the devil ; ac least as any thing wx can chink 
of to reprc<tcnr the devil can be made. It had a head certainly 
not so much as resembling any creature that the woir!d ever 
saw ; ears a& big as goats' hofiis, and as high ; e>-cs as big as a 
crown piece; a nose like a crooked ram's horn, and a mouth 
extended four-conicrcd, like that of a lion, wirh hofriblc ircth^ 
hooked like n parrot's uikJct bill, h was dnrs&ed up in the

of shccp'-ikins, with the wool outward; a great 7sri4r bonnet 
on the head> with two horns growing through ft; it wns about 
eight foot high, yet had no feet or legs, or any other proportion 
of parts. 

This scarecrow wa% set up at the outer aide of the village: 
and when I came ticar to it, there were uxteen or seventeen 
creatures, whether men or women I could not tell, for tbcy 
make no distinction by ilicir habits, either of body or bead :

otherwise they would bum us all with fire. Our men looked 
very blank at this mess^e, and began to stare at one another, to 
see who looked with most guilt in thar ^ces^ but, noho^ wu 
the word, nobody did it. The leader of the caravan sent wwd, 
he was well assured it was not done by any of our camp ; that 
wc were peaceable merchants^ travelling on our business; that 
we had done no harm to them, or tti any one else ; and that 
therefore they must took farther for their enemies, who had 
injured them, for we were not the people ; so desired them not 
to disturb us ; for if they did, we should defend ourselves. 

They were fer from being satisfied with this for an answer, 
but a great crowd of them came down in the morning, by break 
of day^ to our camp ; but, seeing ua in £iuch an unaccountable 
situation, they durst come no farther than the brook in our front, 
» where they stood, and shewed us such a number, that indeed 
terrified us very much ; for those that spoke least of them, spoke 
of ten thousand- Here they stood, and looked at us a while, 
and then setting up a great howl, they let fly a cloud of arrows 
among us \ but we were welt enough fortified for that, for we 
sheltered under our baggage; and I do not remember that one 
man of us was hurt. 

Some time after this, we see them move a little to our right, 
and expected them on the rear, when a cunning fellow, a Cossacif 
as they call them, of Jarawena, in the pay of the MuscovtUSy 
calling to the leader of the caravan, said to htm, I will go send 
alt these people away to Sibeilka^ This was a city four or five 
days' journey, at least, to the south, and rather behind us. So 
he takes his bow and arrows, and, getting on horseback, be 
rides away from our rear directly, as it were, back to Ntrt- 
xinskay ; after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes to 
the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to tell 
them a long story, that the people who had burnt their Cham- 
Chi'Thatingu were gone to Sibeilka^ with a caravan of ituacrcants,

monster, call it what you will, and with my sword cut the bonnet 
diat was on its head in two in the middle, so that it hang down 
by one of the horns ; and one of our men that was with mc, 
took hold of the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled at it, 
when, behold, a most hideous outcry and howling run through 
the village, and two or three hundred people came about my 
ears, so that I was glad to scour for it ; for we saw some had 
bows and arrows ; but I resolved from that moment to y'mt 
them again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about 
four miles off, in order to provide some horses, which they 
wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with 
the badness of the way, and long march over the last desert ; so 
we had some leisure here to put my design in execution, I 
communicated my project to the Scots merchant of Moscow^ of 
whose courage I had had sufficient testimony, as above. I told 
him what I had seen, and with what Indignation I had since 
thought, that human nature could be so degenerate. I told him, 
I was resolved, if I could get but four or five men well armed 
to go with me, I was resolved to go and destroy that vile 
abominable idol ; and let them see that it had no power to help 
itself, and consequently could not be an object of worship, or to 
be prayed to, much less help them that oil^red sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at mc; s^s he. Your zeal may be good; but 
what do you propose to yourself by it ? Propose ! said I; to 
vindicate the honour of God, which is insulted by this devil- 
worship. But how will it vindicate the honour of God f said 
hCy while the people will not be able to know what you mean by 
it, unless you could speak to them, and tell them so ; and then 
they will fight you and beat you too, I will assure you ; for they 
are desperate fellows, and that especially in defence of thdr 
idolatry. Can we not, ssdd I, do it in the night, and then leave 
tftcoi the reasons and caus e s, in writing, in their own langua^ I 




j88 f Life and Advektukxs 

Writing ! said he, why there is not a man in five nations of 
them, that know any thing of a letter, or bow to read a word ■ 
any language, or in their own- Wretched ignorance! said I to 
him ; however, I have a great mind to do it ; perhaps nature 
may draw inferences from it to them, to let them sec how brutidi 
they arc to worship such horrid things. Look you. Sir, said be, 
if your zeal prompts you to it so warmly, you must do it; bin 
in the next place, I would have you consider these wild naticBB 
of people are subjected by force to the Cxar of Muscovfi 
dominions ; and if you do this, it is ten to one but they will 
come by thousands to the governor of Nertzinskay^ and cwd- 
plain, and demand satisfaction, and if he cannot give them sadv 
faction, it is ten to one but they revolt ; and it will occa^on i 
new war with all the I'artars in the country. 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for a whiles 
but I harped upon the same string still ; and all that day I was 
uneasy to put my project in execution. Towards the evening, 
the ScQis merchant met me by accident in our walk about the town, 
and desired to speak with me, I believe, said he, I have put 
you oiF of your good design; I have been a little concerned 
about it since; for 1 abhor the idol and the idolatry as much as 
you can do. Truly, said /, you have put it off a little as to 
the execution of it, but you have not put it at all out of my 
thoughts; and, I believe, I shall do it still before I quit thi 
place, though I were to be delivered up to them for satisfacdon. 
No, no, says he; God forbid they should deliver you up to 
such a crew of monsters; they shall not do that neither; that 
would be murdering you indeed. Why, says I, how would tiiey 
use me ? Use you ! says he ; I will tell you how they served a 
poor Russian^ who affronted them in their worship just as you 
did, and who they took prisoner, after they had lamed him with 
an arrow, that he could not run away ; they took him and strip- 
ped him stark naked, and set him upon the top of the iiiol twMi- 



OF Robinson- Cri;soe. ^s^ 

ster, and stood all round him, and shot as many ^^rows into him 
as would stick over his whole body ; and then they burnt bim 
and all the arrows sticking in hini» as a sacriiice to the idol. 
And was this the same idol ? Yes, says he, the very same. 
Well, says It I will tell you a story. So I related the story of 
pur men at Madagascar, and how they burnt and sacked the 
village therc> and killed man^ woman, and child, for their mur- 
dering one of our merit j^^ ^ '^ related before ; and when 
I had done, I added, that I thought wc ought to do so to this 
village. 

He listened very attentively to the story ; but when I talked 
of doing so to that village, says he, you mistake very much ; it 
was not this village, it was almost a hundred miles from this 
place ; but it was the same idol, for they carry him about tn pro- 
cession all over the country. Well then, says I, then that idol 
ought to be punished for it ; and so it shall, says I, if I live this 
night out. 

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told 
me, I should not go alone, but he would go ^th me ; and biing 
a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us ; and 
one says he, as famous for his zeal as you can desire any one to 
be against such devilish things as these. In a word, he brought 
me his comrade, a Scotsman^ who he called Captain Richardson ; 
and I gave him a full account of what I had seen, and, in a word, 
of what I intended ; and he told me readily, he would go with 
mc if it cost him his life. So wc agreed to go, only us three. 
I had, indeed, proposed it to my partner ; but he declined it. 
He s^d, he was ready to assist me to the utmost, and upon all 
occasions, for my defence ; but that this was an adventure quite 
out of his way : so, I say, we resolved upon our work, only us 
three, and my man-servant, and to put it in execution that night 
about midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable. 
However, upon second thought, we were willing to delay it

ill the next night, because the caravan being to set fonrtnd a 
he morning, we supposed the governor could not preicrKl M 
ive them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of lui 
x>wcr. — The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution fortijt 
enterprise, as bold "in executing, brought me a 1'arcar^s robe s

hat the people, if they saw us, should not be able to detcmint

All the first night wc spent in mixing up some combusntle 
natter with aqua-vita:, gunpowder, and such other materials u 
could get ; and, having a good quantity of tar in a little poi» 
ibout an hour after night we sec out upon our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, ind 
bund that the people had not the least jealousy of danger ai- 
ending their idol ; the night was cloudy, yet the moon ga.ve as 
ight enough to see that the idol stood just in the same posture

As it happened, we hod twine or pckthresd enough about u»» 
which w» u!»ed to tie our firc-workx together with; ao wc re- 
solved to artsick these people first, and with as little noise as wc 
could- The first things we did, we knocked at the door, which 
issued just as wc desired it» for one of their idol priests came to 
the door, wc immediately seized upon Kim, stopped his mouth* 
and tied his hands behind him^ and led him to the idol, where 
wc gagged him that he might not make a noise ; tied hU feet 
obo together, aj^ left him on fhe giound. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another 
would come out to sec what the matter was ; but we waited so 
long till the third man came back to us; and then, ttobody 
coming out wr kntn:ktii again gcndy, and immeiliiitely out came 
two more, and we served them just in the same manner, buc wis 
obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by the idol 
aomc distance from one another; whrn, going luck, wc found two 
more were come out to the dcx>r, and a third *!ooti hchin^l ihem 
within the door. We seized the two, and immediately tied 
them: when the third stepping back, and crying out, my 6'cHj 
rncrchant went in after him, aiKl taking out a composition we 
had made, that would only smoke and stink, he set fire to it, 
and threw it in among them : by that time the other ^^Vw/sMff 
and my man taking charge of the two men who were already 
bo<md, and tied together also by the arm, led ihem away to the 
idol, and left them there, to see if their idol would relieve thenit 
making haste back to us. 

When the fute we had thrown bi had filled the hut with so 
mudi smoke that they were almost suffocated, we then threw in 
a small leather bag of another Icind, which flamed like a candle, 
and, following it in, wc found there wa^ but four people left,

posed, had been ^bout some of thdr diabolic sacrifices. Htcf 
appeared, in short, irighted to death, at least so as to ^t trem- 
bling and stupid, and not able to speak neither, for the smoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as wc had the other, 
and all without any noise, I should have said, wc brought them 
out of the house, or hut, first; for, indeed, we were not able to 
bear the smoke any more than they were. When we had done 
this, we carried them altogether to the idol : when wc came that, 
we fell to work with him ; and iirst we daubed him all over, and 
his robes also, with tar, and such other stuiF 2s we had, which 
was tallow mixed with brimstone ; then we stopped his eyes, 
and ears, and mouth full of gunpowder; and then we wrapped 
up a great piece of wild-fire in his bonnet ; and then sticking all 
the combustibles we had brought with us upon him, we lookel 
about to see if we could find any thing else to help to bum him; 
when my man remembered, that by the tent, or hut, where the 
men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw or 
rushes I do not remember : away he and one of the Scotsmen run, 
and fetched their arms full of that. When we had done this, wc 
took all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied thdr 
feet, and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and 
set them just before their monstrous idol, and then set fire to the 
whole- 

Wc stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till the 
powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up, 
and, we could perceive, had split and deformed the shape; and, 
in a word, till we saw it bum into a mere block or log of wood ; 
and then setting the dry forage to it, we found it would be quite 
consumed; when we began to think of going away; but the 
Scotsman said, No, we must not go; for these poor deluded 
wretches will all throw themselves into the fire, and bum them- 
selves with the idol. So we resolved to stay till the forage 
was burnt down too, and then we came away and left Acm. 



OF RoBivsos Cri^^so e. ^cj^ 

In the morning wc appeared vnong^ o^^ fellow traveJlers, 
exceeding busy in getting ready for our journey ; nor could any 
man suggest that we had been any where but in our beds, as 
travellers might be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the 
£itigues of that day's journey. 

But it did not end so ; the next day came a great multitude 
of the country people, not only of this village, but of a hundred 
more, for aught I know, to the town gates ; and, in a most out- 
rageous manner, demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor^ 
for the insulting their priests, and burning their great Chtzm-Chi- 
Thaungu ; such a hard name they gave the monstrous creature 
they worshipped ; the people of Nertzinskay were at first in a 
great consternation ; for they said, the Tartan were no less than 
thirty thousand, and that in a lew days more, would be one 
hundred thousand stronger. 

The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease them, 
and gave them all the good words imaginable. He assured 
them he knew nothing of it, and that there had not a soul of his 
garrison been abroad; that it could not be irom any body 
there ; and if they would let him know who it was, they should 
be exemplarily punished. They returned haughtily : That all 
the country reverenced the great Cham-Chs-7haungu^ who dwelt 
in the sun, and no mortal woujd have decreed to offer violence 
to his image, but some Christian miscreant ; so they called them^ 
it seems; and they therefore denounced war against him^ and 
all the Russians ; who, they said, were miscreants and Chris- 
tius; 

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach, 
or to have any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the 
Czar having straighdy charged them to treat the conquered 
ocKuitiy with gentleness and civility, gave them still alt the good 
words he could ; at last he told them, there was a caravan gone 
tovards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of them

*= is a very great river when it passes farther north ; but where ^ 
^ oune to It, we found it narrow and fordable, 
i The third day they either found their mistalce, or had int^^if^ 
^ gence of us, and came pouring in upon us, towards the dusk o^ 
r the evening. We had, to our great satisfaction^ just pitched 
upon a place for our camp, which was very convenient for the 
night ; for as we were upon a desert, though but at the banning 
of it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had no towns 
to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the city Jarawena^ 
which we had yet two days' march to ; the desert, however, had 
some few woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all 
into the great river Vida^ It was in a narrow str^t between 
two little, but very thick woods, that we pitched our little camp 
€oT that night, expecting to be attacked in the night. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for ; but 
as it was usual for the Mongul Tartars to go about in troops in 
that desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves every 
night against them, as against armies of robbers; and it was 
therefore no new thing to be pursued. 

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a 
most advantageous camp ; for we lay between two woods, with 
a little rivulet running just before our front ; so that we could 
not be surrounded or attacked any way, but in our front or rear : 
wc took care also to make our front as strong as we could, by 
placing our packs with our camels and horses, all in a line on the 
inside of the river, and felling some trees in our rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy 
was upon us before we had finished our situation : they did not 
come on us like thieves, as we expected, but sent three messengers 
to us, to demand the men to be delivered to them, that had 
abused their priests, and burnt their god Cham-Chi-7'haitngu 
with fire, that they might bum them with fire ; and, upon this, 
tliey said they would go away, and do us no farther harm^

as barbarous as the remotest of the Tartars; nay, as any 

for ought I know, in Asia or America. I also found, 
I observed to the Muscovite governors, who I had oppor- 
to converse with, that the poor pagans arc not much the 
or the nearer Christianity, for being under the Muscovite 
jnent; which they acknowledged was true enough, but, 
r sdd, was none of their business ; that if the Czar cx-

be done by sendlrig clergymen among them, not soIcUers;

it was not so much the concern of their monarch to make

way in EnxianJ, of making fires in every room in the houK, in 
open chlnmies, which, when the fire was out, always kept the 
air in the room cold ai the climate. But taking an apartment 
in a good house in the town, 1 ordered a chimney to be huitt

sorts, and some flesh of mutton^ and of the buffaloes^ which is 
pretty good beef- All the stores of provbions for the winter arc 
laid up in the summer, and well cured; our drink was water 
mixed vnth aqua vita; instead of brandy ; and, for a treaty mead 
instead of wine, which, however, they have excellent good. The 
hunters, who venture abroad all weathers, frequently brought us 
in fresh venison, very fat and good ; and sometimes bear's flesh, 
but we did not much care for the last. We had a good stock 
of tea, with which we treated our friends as above ; and, in a 
word, we lived very cheerfully and well, all things considered. 

It was now Marck^ and the days grown considerably longer, 
and the weather at least tolerable ; so the other travellers began 
to prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and to get things 
ready to be going ; but my measures being Jixed, as I have said, 
for Arch-Angelj and not for Muscovy^ or the Bahtc, I made no 
motion, knowing very well, that the ships from the south do 
not set out for that part of the world till May or Junff ; and that 
if I was there by the beginning oi August ^ it would be as soon 
as any ships would be ready to go away ; and therefore, I say^ I 
made no haste to be gone, as others did ; in a word, I saw a 
great many people, nay, all the travellers, go away before me. 
It seems, every year they go from thence to Moscow for trade ; 
viz, to cany furs, and buy necessaries with them, which they 
bring back to furnish their shops; also others went of the same 
errand to Arch- Angel; but then they also, being to come back 
Hgun above eight hundred mUes, went all out before me. 

In short, about the latter end of May^ I began to make all 
ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this, it occurred to me, 
that seeing all these people were banished by the Czar of Muscovy 
to Siberia^ and yet^ when they came there, were left at liberty to 
go whither they would ; why did they not then go away to any 
part of the world wherever they thought fit ? and I be^an ta

But my wonder was over» when I entered upon that sut^ 
with the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus. 
Consider, first, ar, said he> the place where we arc ; and secondly, 
the condition we are in ; especially^ said he, the generality of tbe 
people who arc banished hither. We arc surrounded, said be, 
with stronger things than bars and bolts : on the north side an 
iinnavigablc ocean, where ship never sailed^ and boat ncm 
swam ; neither, if we had both^ could we know where to go with 
them. Every other way^ said he, we have above a thousand 
miles to pass through the Czar's own dominions, and by wayt 
utterly unpassable, except by the roods made by the governor, 
and by the towns garrisoned by his troops ; so that wc could 
neither pass undiscovered by the roadj or subsist any other way ; 
so that it is in vain to attempt it. 

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were in i 
pnson every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the 
castle at Moscow; however, it came into my thought, that I 
might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape of 
this excellent person, and that whatever hazard I run, I would 
certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this I took an 
occasion one evening to tell him my thoughts : I represented to 
him, that it was very easy for me to carry him away, there being 
no guard over him in the country ; and as I was not going to 
Moscow^ but to Arch- Angela and that I went in the nature of a 
caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns 
in the desert, but could encainp every night where I would, « 
might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-Angtl^ where I would 
immediately secure him on board an English or Dutch ship, and 
carry him off safe along with me ; and as to his subsistence, and 
other particulars, it should be my care, till he could better supply 
himself.

that he ought to look upon this as a door opened by Heaven for

quickly lose sight of; for I am but flesh, a man, a mere man,

me as any man. O be not my friend and my tempter both

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood 
silent, looking at him ; and, indeed, admired at what I saw ; the 
struggle in his soul was so great, that though the weather was 
extremely cold, it put him into a most violent sweat, and I found 
he wanted to give vent to his mind ; so 1 said a word or two, 
that I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on him again; 
and then I withdrew to my own apartment. 

About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near the door 
of my room, and I was going to open the door ; but he had 
opened it, and came in. My dear friend, says he, you had

a particular vahic, and should have been glad to have been the

he would not be (Uspleased with me, if he was widi my answer. 
He told me^ it was only his son, who> though I had not seen, 
yet was in the same condition with himself, and above two hun- 
dred miles irom him, on the other side the Oiy ; but thatj if I 
consented, he would send for htm. 

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I nude 
some ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly otv 
his account ; and that seong I could not prevail on him, I would 
shew my respect to him by my concern for his son : but these 
things are too tedious to repeat here. He sent away the nzsl 
day for his son, and in about twenty days he came back with 
the messenger, bringing ^ or seven horses loaded with very 
rich furs, and which, in the whole^ amounted to a very great 
value. 

His servants brought the horses into the town, but left the 
young lord at a distance till nighty when he came incognito inio 
our apartment, and his father presented him to me; and, in 
short, we concerted there the manner of our travelling, and every 
thing proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox- 
skins, fine ermines, and such other furs as are very rich ; I say, 
I had bought them in that city in exchange for some of die 
goods I brought from China ; in particular, for the cloves uid 
nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part here ; and the rest 
afterwards at Arch-Angsl^ for a much better price than I could 
have done at London ; and my partner, who was sen^ble of the 
profit, and whose business, more particularly than mine, was 
merchandize, was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of 
the traffic we made here. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place, a 
city, I believe, little heard of in the world ; and, indeed, it is »

kr>ow not, neither did ic concern mc to in^juirc. We had here 
the wor^ and the largest desert to psss over that we met vitl^H 
in all thcjoumcy; indeed 1 call it the worst, because the way^^ 
was very deep in some plates, and very uneven in others ; ihc 
beat we had to tay for it* was^ that we thought we had no troopa 
of Tartars and robbers to feir, and that they never otmc on this 
side the nVer Ofy^ or at least but very seldom ^ but we found 
it ocfcerwite. 

My young lord had with him a ftiithful Mmcovitc servant, or 
father a Siberian servant, who was perfectly aoquaiotcd with ihc 
country ; ami led us by private roads *^^' *^ avoidftJ earning 
jnto the principal towns and cities upon the great rood, such as 
Tuman^ S'oJcy Kamaskoy^ and several others; because the Afuj^o- 
we garrUin^?!, which are keftt there, arc very curious and strict 
in their observation upon travellers, and searching lest any of 
the banished persons of note should make their escape that way 
into Muftovj ; but by this means, a* we were kqit out of the 
ctticsj so our whole journey was a desett, and we were obliged 
to encamp and lie in our tents, when we might have had very 
good accommodation in the cities on the way : this the young 
brd was so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abruid^ 
when we eame to several cities on the way ; but lay abroad him- 
cdf, with his servant, in the woods, and met us always at the 
■ppointcd places.

and here wc thought to have seen some evident alteration in dx 
people, thar manner, thdr habit, their religion, and their bus- 
ness ; but wc were mistaken ; for as wc had a vast desert tn 
pass, which, by relation, is near seven hundred miles long In 
some places, but not above two hundred nulcs over where ¥t 
passed it; so, till wc came past that horrible place, we found 
very little difiercnce between that country and the Mongul Tv- 
tary; the people mostly Pagans, and little better than the sa- 
vages of jlmerka ; their houses and towns full of idols, and their 
way of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities as aboTt, 
and the villages near them ; where they are Christians, as they 
call themselves, of the Greek church; but have their religion 
mingled with so many reliques of superstition, that it is scara 
to be known in some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft. 

In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must, after all 
our dangers were, in our imagination, escaped, as before, have i 
been plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered by a troop 
of thieves; of what country they were, whether the roving | 
bands of the Osfiackit a kind of TartarSj or wild people on the j 
bank of the Ohy^ had ranged thus far; or whether they were [ 
the sable-hunters of Siberia^ I am yet at a loss to know; but , 
they were all on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and weit 
at first about five-and-forty in number ; they came so near to us 
as within about two musquet shot ; and, asking no questions, 
they surrounded us with their horse, and looked very earnestly 
upon us twice ; at length they placed themselves just in our way; 
upon which we drew up in a little line before our camels, being 
not above sixteen men in all ; and being drawn up thus, *t 
halted, and sent out the Siberian servant who attended his ]oni»

aiiy of thcra ever were seen so far nortli before. 

This was small comfort to ufi ; however, wc had no remedy : 
there was on our left hmd^ at about a quarter of a mile's distance, 
a little grove or clump of trees, which stood close togcthcTp and 
vcTj' near the road ; I immediately resolved we would advance 
to those trees, and fortify our«lves as well ns wc could there ; 
for, first, I considered that the trees would In a great measure 
cover us from their arrows; and in the next pbce, they could 
not come to chaise us in a body : it was, indeed^ my o!d P^- 
tu^uci^ pilot who proposed it ; and who had this csccellency at- 
tending him, namely, that be was always reiuiie:iit and most ;ipt 
to direct and encourage us in cases of the most danger. We 
jid^'anccd immediately with what speed we could* and guncd 
nat little wood, the Tartars^ or thieves, fijc wc know not whjit 
to call them, keqiing their stand, and not attempting to hinder 
UB. When we came thirher, wefound, to our great satisfaction, 
that it was a swampy^ springy pecc of ground, and, on the one 
side, a very great spring of water, which running out !n a littie 
rill or brook, was a Itttle farther joined bj' another of the like 
bigness ; and was, in short, the head or source of a consHJeiabk 
river, called a f ter w ards the fVirtsia. The trees which grew 
about tliU spring, were not iJI above two hundred^ bur were 
¥ay large and stood pretry ^ck ; so that as soon as we got in, 
we saw ourselves perfectly saib from the enemy, urUcss they 
alighted and attacked us on foot.

But my wonder was over, when I entered upon that sulijcd 
with the person I have mentioned, who answered mc thus. 
Consider, first, sir, said he, the place where we are ; and secondly, 
the condition we are in ; especially, said he, the generality of the 
people who are banished hither. We are surrounded, said be, 
with stronger things than bars and bolts : on the north side u 
unnavigable ocean, where ship never sailed, and boat never 
swam ; neither, if we had both, could we know where to go widi 
them. Every other way, s^d he, we have above a thousand 
miles to pass through the Czar's own dominions^ and by wayi 
utterly unpassable, except by the roads made by the governor^ 
and by the towns garrisoned by his troops ; so that we could 
neither pass undiscovered by the road, or subsist any other way ; 
so that it is in vain to attempt it, 

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were in a 
prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the 
castle at Moscow ; however, it came into my thought, that I 
might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape of 
this excellent person, and that whatever hazard I run, ] would 
certainly try if I could carry him off. Upon this I took ui 
occasion one evening to tell him my thoughts : I represented to 
him, that it was very easy for mc to carry him away, there being 
no guard over him in the country \ and as 1 was not going to 
Moscow J but to Arch-Angely and that I went in the nature of a 
caravan, by which 1 was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns 
in the desert, but could encamp every night where I would, wc 
might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-Angel, where I would 
immediately secure him on board an English or Dutch ship, and 
carry him off safe along with me ; and as to his subsistence, and 
other particulars, it should be my care, till he could better supply 
himself. 

He heard mc very attentively^ and looked earnestly on me all 
tAc while Ispoke; nay^l cQu\i.^^x\'cv\iaN^:r^^'w;,^^'^s^a!_^^t

About an hour aftcr^ they made a motion to attack us again^ 
and rode round our little wood^ to see where else . they might 
break in ; but finding us always ready to Jace them» they went 
off sLgain, and we resolved not to stir Irom tiic place for that 
night. 

We slept little, you may be sure ; but spent the most part of 
the night in strengthening our situation, and barricading the 
entrances into the wood ; and, keeping a strict watch, we waited 
for day-light, and, when it came, it gave us a very unwel- 
come discovery indeed : for the enemy, who, we thought, were 
discouraged with the reception they had met with, were now in- 
creased to no less than three hundred, and had set up eleven or 
twelve huts and tents, as if they were resolved to beseigc us ; 
and this little camp they had pitched upon the open plain, at 
about three quarters of a mile from us, Wc were indeed sur- 
prised at this discovery ; and now, I confess, I gave myself over 
for lost, and all that I had. The loss of my effects did not lie so 
near me (though they were very considerable) as the thoughts of 
l^ing into the hands of such barbarians, at the latter end of my 
journey, aftet so many cUiRculdes and hazards as I had gone 
through ; and even in sight of our port, where we expected 
safety and deliverance. As for my partner he was raging : he 
declared, that to loSe his goods would be his ruin ; and he would 
rather die than be starved ; and he was for fighting to the last 
drop. 

The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh shewed itself, was for 
fighting to the last also; and my old pilot was of the opinion 
we were able to resist them all, in the situation we then were in : 
and thus wc spent the day in debates of what we should do ; but 
towards evening, we found that the number of our enemies still 
increased ; perhaps, as they were abroad in several parties for prey, 
the first had sent out scouts to call for help, and to acqu^nt them of 
the booty ; and we did not know but by the morning they nuq^ht

still be a greater number ; so I began to inquire of those poqJc 
wc had brought ftom Tobolski^ if then was no other or meet 
private wayS) by which wc might avoid them in the nigh^ tnl 
perhaps, either retreat to some town, or get help to guard m 
ovtr the desert. 

The Sibirian^ who was servant to the young lordi told us, if 
we designed to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to 
carry us off in the night to a way that ^went north towards tbe 
PetraXf by which he made no question but we might get aw^, 
and the Tartars never the wiser ; but he said, his lord had told 
him he would not retreat, but would rather chusc to fight I 
told him, he mistook hb lord ; for that he was too wise a man to 
love fighting for the sake of it ; that I knew his lord was bran 
enough by what he had shewed already ; but that his lord knev 
better than to desire to have seventeen or aghteen men fight five 
hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced them to it ; and 
that if he thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we 
had nothing else to do but to attempt it. He answered, if his lord 
gave him such orders, he would lose his life if he did not peHbrm 
it. Wc soon brought his lord to give that order, though pri- 
vately, and we immediately prepared for the putting it in practice. 

And first, as soon as it began to be dork, we kindled a fire in 
our littie camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to 
make it bum all night, that the Tartars might conclude we were 
still there ; but, as soon as it was dark, that is to say, so as we 
could see the stars (for our guide would not stir before), having 
all our hordes and camels ready loadcn, we followed our new 
guide, who, I soon found, steered himself by the pole, or north 
star, all the country being level for a long way. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be 

lighter still; not that it was quite dark all night, but the moon 

began to rise, so that, in short, it was rather lighter than W 

^ wished it to be ; but by m. tfdcidt ^ica w^as. motning we were

gotten near forty milcst though the truth is, «c almost spoiled 
our horses. Here we found a Russian village, named Kirma- 
zinsii^t where we rested, and heard nothing of the Kalmuck 
Tartars that day. About two hours before tught we set out 
again^ and travelled till eight the next morning, though not quite 
so hard as before ; and about seven o'clock we passed a little 
river, called Kiriza, and came to a good lat^ town inhabited by 
Russians^ and very populous, called Qxomys, There we hcard^ 
that several troops, or hordes of Kalmucks had been abroad upon 
the desert, but that we were now completely out of danger of them, 
which was to our great satisfaction^ you may be sure. Here we 
were obliged to get some ^esh horses, and having need enough 
of rest, we stiud five days \ and my partner and I agreed to give 
the honest Siberian^ who brought us thither, the value of ten 
pistoles for his conducting us. 

In five days more we came to Veussima^ upon the river JVit^ 
zogJa^ and running into the Dwina^ we were there very happily 
near the end of our travels by land, that river being navigable 
in seven days' passage to j^rch- Angel: from hence we came to 
Lawrenski^i the third of July ; and providing ourselves with 
two luggage-boats, and a bat^c, for our own convenience^ we 
embarked the seventh, and arrived all safe at Arch-Angel the 
eighteenth, having been a year, and five months, and three day9 
on the journey, including our stay of eight months and odd days 
At Toiolski. 

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival 
of the ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamhurgker 
come in above a month sooner than any of the English ships ; 
when, after some consideration that the city of Hamburgh might 
happen to be as good a market for our goods as London^ we all 
took freight with him ; and having put my goods on board, it 
was most natural for me to put my steward on board to take 
care of them ; by which means my young lord had a ^uffici^^

opportunity to conceal himself, never coming on shore in ail die 
time we staid there ; and this he did, that he might not be seen 
in the city, where some of the Mascffw merchants would certainh- 
have seen and discovered him, 

Wc sailed from Arch-Angd the twentieth of August the same 
year ; and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived in the 
Elbe the thirteenth of September, Here my partner and I found 
a very good sale tor our goods, as well those of China as dte 
sables, (^c. of Siberia ; and dividing the produce of our effects, 
my share amounted to £3475 17/. 3</. notwithstanding so many 
losses we had sustained, and charges we had been at ; only rt- 
membeiing that I had included in this about six hundred pounds' 
worth of diamonds which I had purchased at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up the 
E/bffj in order to go to the court of Vienna^ where he resolved 
to seek protection, and where he could correspond with those of 
his father's friends who were left alive. He did not part \v'ith- 
out all the testimonies he could give me of gratitude for the ser- 
vice I had done him, and his sense of my kindness to the prince 
his father. 

To conclude ; having staid near four months in Hamburgh^ I 
came from thence over land to the Hague^ where 1 embarked in 
the packet, and arrived in London the loth oi January 170J, 
having been gone from England ten years and nine months. 

And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I am prepar- 
ing for a longer journey than all these, having lived seventy-n^'O 
years a life of infinite variety, and learned sufficiently to know 
the value of retirement, and the blessing of ending our days in 
peace,
