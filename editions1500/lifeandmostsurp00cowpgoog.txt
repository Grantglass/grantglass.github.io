* ah 

IwJms torti at York, in thd year 1632, of a 
KcpiHable family. My father was a native of 
Bremen/ who, by hieff^an^zing at Bull hv 
some tinle, ^ned' a very plentifiil fortune. 
He xnanried ray mother at York, who received 
b^ first bi«ath in that ^-otmtry : and as her 
nUtiden ntoe was Robitison, I wi(& called 
Mohimon Kirekfznaer, .which not being easily 
pronoimced vn Ihe English tbngofe, we are com- 
annklf known by the name of Crosoer 

1 was&^yoiin^eiH of three bro^^t^. The 
^Mest was a lientenfaiit.colotoel in Lookhitrt's 
i^Smeni bnl' slain by the Sptmiards: what 
became of tha o^her I could never learn. 

Nt> chaige ndr pains were wanting iii m^ 
edtieaiioh. My rother designed me for the 
tew, yet nothing could serve me But I miist go 
to;M8» both against the wUl of my father, the 



6 

lem of mr motbec, and the intreaties of my 
friends. One morning, my father expostulate, 
veiy warmly with me* What reaso]|y says he^ 
' have you to leave yoar native country, where 
there mutt foe a more certam prospect of eon^ 
tent and happiness, to enter into a wandering 
condition of uneasiness And ^incertainty ? He 
recommended to me Agur*8 wish, Netiher to 
demnf fmmilp, mr riches; that a middle «tale 
of Iffe was the most happy ; and that the high 
towering thoughts of raising our condition by 
wandering abroad, were surrounded with mi- 
sery and danger, and often ended with confii- 
sion and disappointment. I entreat you, nay, 
I command you, (says he,) to desist from these 
iotentiqiis^ If you "will go» padded fae) mj 
prayers shall however be offered for your pre- . 
«ervation ; but a time may comie, when deso- 
iate, ^pressed, or forsaken^ you may wish 
ypu had taken your poor demised father's 
counsel. He pronounced those words with 
euch a JBloving and paternal eloquence, while 
floods of tear^ ran down his aged cheeks, that 
it seemed to stem the torrent of my resolutions* 
But this soon wore q% ^d a little after, I in- . 
formed raf mother tl^t J could not settle fit 
any fondness, my^ resolution was so strong to 
see the world, and begged she would gain mv 
father's consent only iK> go one voyiige; whicn . 
if it did npt prove prosperous^ • J would never 
attempt a second. But my desire was as vain ^ 
as my folly in asking. My mother passionatdy^

their nosti,' and another bad fbun^ried : two 
taote ibat bad lost tbeir anchors, were fbrc<Ki 
out ib the mercy of the ocean : and, to «a?e 
•our lirw, we Were forcdd to cut our foremast 
and mainmast quite away. 

Who is there so ignorant as not to judge of 
ray dreadful condition? I was but a fresh 
waier sailor, and therefore seemed more ter^ 
rified. Our ship was very good, but over^ 
loaded ; wbicb made the sailors often cry out, 
Sh$wiU fcundtr : Wordd I then was ignorant 
of. All this while, the storm continuing, and> 
rather increasmg, the ma^r and the more 
sober part of the men went to prayers, ex* 
pecthig death every moment. In the middle 
of the night, one cried out, We had sprung a 
leak: BXkoiheT, Thai' there was Jimr feet water 
in the hold. I was just ready to expire witb 
fear, when immediately all bands were called 
to Uie pump ; and the men forced me also in 
that extremity to share with them in their la« 
bour. While thus employed, the master csDy.> 
ing some coUierR, fired a gun as a sigiial of ais* 
tr^ ; and I not understanding what it meant, 
and thinlcing that either the ship was wreete^ 
or some dreadful thing had happened, Ie^II ittto 
aswoOn. Even in that condition of w6, nobochr 
minded me, exciting to thrust me aside with 
tbeir feet, thinking me dead ^ and I was a great 
while before 1 recdvered. 

Happy^ it was for us, when, upon the signal 
givei|, they ventured out th<sir boat to save pur 



9 

l^e8» All our pumping had been in Tsdn, and 
▼aia hf4 aU Our other efforts been, had they not 
cqme to.our ship's side, and our men cast 
ihem a rope over the stem with a buoy. to it, 
which after great difficulty they caught hold of, 
aod we hauliDg them t6 us got into their l^dat, 
and left our ship, which we perceived si^k 
w;ithin less than a qiiarter ot an hour : and 
thus I learned what was meant \)y foundering 
at sea^ And now the men incessantly la- 
boured to recover their own ship; but. the 
sea vail so high, and, the wind blew so hard, 
that they thought it convenient to haul\ih 
shorev which with great difficulty and dajiger 
at last we happily effected, landing at a place 
called. (^rontet% uot far from Winterton light. 
house ; from whence we all walked to Yar- 
n^outh, where, ^ objects of pity, many good 
people furnished us with the necessaries to cany 
m either to Hull or Xjondon. i 

Strainge ! tbat after all this, I did not, like 
the prodigal son, return to my father : who, 
-'Jiiparingof the ship's calamity, for a longtime 
thought me entomoed in the deep. No doubt 
\aX I should have shared in his fatted calf, as 
the Scripture ez^presseth it ; but my wayward 
^l^osi^on still pushed me on, in spite of the 
^0«rerful co|)victipns of reason and conscience. 

Wh6n we had been at Yarmouth three days^ 
I pet my old companion who had given me 
the ipvitatiou to go on boar^ along with his 
father f?i5 l^haviour and speech were f^Uer^d,

aud, In amelancbolyiuaanf r he aiked. me bowf * 
5ijd? telling his father who I was, andhowl had 
made this voyage for a trial only before I siiould 
proceed farther abroad. Upon which the old 
gentleman turning to me, said. Young tnan,£ 
recommend you tockuse another line of life; the 
4sea is an uncertain element to trust to, {zndyou 
hane lately experiencedsome of the hardships to 
which sailors are trposed. Sir,, answered f, 
will you take the same resolution f It is a dif" 
ferent case, said he, it is my c<iUing, and, co/u 
sequentfymy duty to remain contented with it : 
6ut as you have made this voyage for a trial 
merely, and have every other line open to yon, 
I think you miglU chase one less Uable to hard^ 
ship and reverses. But pray what are you, and 
on what account did you goto sea. Upon which 
1 very freely declared m^ whole story ; at the 
end of which he said, in a tone of seriousness^ 
which I shall never forge^ Young man, you 
ought to thank God, that you did not perish 
tdkilst you were committing tkisact of disobedi* 
encetoyour Pother ; had I known these cir- 
cumstances, you may be assured I never should 
have suffered you to sail along with us; thank 
God, however, that yon may still atone fof* the 
past. Return to your Parents, they will for* 
give you, but if you do not, recollect your Fa* 
ther' swords, and beware lest his warning s/wuld ' 
he realized ; — and^o we parted. 

I thought at fitst to return home; but shame 
opposed that good notion, as thinking t should 



It 

b^lattghed jitfeymy ne^bout* iiiid ab^aaiinlr^ 
Alices. ' So strang0 is th« nature of youth, wh(i* 
are not ashamed to «in, but yet asttaraed to re-' 
pent ; and s6 HsLt from being ashamed of those , 
actions for whidh they may be accoiintetT tools, 
they think it folly to return to their duty, which 
is th^ princfpal mark of wisdom. In short, 1 
travelled up to London, lesolviaf; upon a 
Toyage; and a voyage I soon heard of, by my 
acquaintance wi^h a captaii^ who took a fancy' 
to me, to go to the coast of Guinea. Haviu{»; 
some money, anil appearing like a gentleman, 
I went on board, not as a common sailor o)c 
foremast-man ; nay, tb© corh^nander agreed I 
•hould go that voyage with him without any 
expense ; that i should be jiis messmate and 
companion, and^ that I was welcome to carry 
any thing with me;* dnd make the best me^

I blessed ray happy fortuhe, and buniWy 
thanked the captain for his offer, aqd iji^quaiat*^

father and mothejr cootiibuted, with wliich I 
hdught toys and trifles; as the captaiii directed 
me. My captain also taUght me navit^ation, 
so that 1 soon kn^w how to keep an account 
of ^e «^ip'8 couMfe, and to take an observa- 
tion, and also became acquaintied ^ith se v^al use«

there; but the pirate capit^ia takiaj; notice of 
me, kept me to be his own slave. 

In this condition, I thought royself the most 
miserable creature on earth, and the warning 
of my father came afrei^h into ray. thoughts* 
However, my condition was better than I 
thought it to be, as will soon appear. , Some 
hopes, indeed, I had that my new patron would 
go to sea again, where he^ might be taken by a 
Spanish or Portuguese man of war, and then 
I shovild b^ set at liberty. But in thi» I i|?as 
mistaken ; for he^ pever. took me with him, but 
left me to look after his little garden^ and do 
the drudgery of hi|5 house, and when he re^ 
turned , from s^a^ would make me lie in the 
cabin, and look after the ship. I had no. one 
that I could communicate my thoughts to, 
which were continually ipeditating my, escape, 
No Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman,, in. 
short, no Briton amongst his slaves bpt myself ; 
and for two years I pould see nothing practica* 
bie, but onlv p}eased myself with ^devising 
plans which I was always obliged to relinquish. 

Aftqr some lepgth of i|me, my patron as I 
found, grew so poor, th^t he could not fit out 
his ship as usual; and then he used coostantly 
oncepr twice a week, if the weather was. fair, 
to go .out a fishing, taking me and a young 
Moorish boy to ro^v the ooat ; aad so ipuch 
pleased was he with noe fpr my dexterity, in 
catching the fish, that he would often send me 
with a Moor, who was one of bigkipismen, an4 
the youth before-mentioned, to cajtch a dish q{ 
fish |6r him. 



i4 

• ■ . ' " I 

One mornings as wa ^ere fishing, tberd . 
arose such a iluck fog, that, we lost si^ht of the 
«hore ; and rowing; we knew noi, which way, 
we laboured aH t^e night, and in the morning 
we found ourselvcH in the ocean, two leagritis 
from land/ However, we attained there at 
len^h, aod made the gr0atest ha^tte, because 
oar stpn^Skebfi were exceedingly sharp and hun- 
gry. In order to prevent such dLsa<>ters for 
the future, my patron erdered a carpenter to 
build a little state-room or cabin in the middle 
pf the long boat, with a place, behind it to 
steier'and haul home the main sheet, with other 
donveniencies to keep him from the weather, a8 
also lockers to put in all manner of provisioni ; 
with a handsome shoulder-of-mutton sail, gibmg 
over the cabin; 

In this, he frequently took us out a fishing ; 
and onetime, inviting two or three persons of 
distinction to go with him, laid in provisions 
citriiordinafy: providing also three fusees, 
with powder and shot, that they might kill 
some fiea fowl along the coast The next 
morning, the boat was m4cki clean, hor^neients 
and pendants out, and every thing ready ; bdt 
their minds alteriQ^, my patron ordered us to 
go a.fishihg, for that his guests would certainly 
sup with him that night. 

And now I began to think of my deliverance 
indeed. In order to this, I persuaded the 
Moor to get some provisions on board,^ and to 

Procure some powder and s hot, pretending to 
ill sea-curlews, v^ich he iBnocently and rea. 



15 

^i^llgreedM In thort, being ptotided with 
«SI things ntecessaiy, ' we sailed out. 

When we had passed the castle, we feU to 
afishing ; but though I knew there was a bite, I 
dissembled the matter, in order to put farther 
out to sea. Accordingly we ran a league far-r 
ther, when, giyijig the boy the helm, and pre- 
tendbg to stoop for something, I seized Muley 
by surpi^, and threw him overboard. As 
he was i^n excellent swimmer, he soon arose, 
and BKide towards the boat; upon which I 
took out a fusee, and presented it at him; 
*' Mulsey/' said f, **I neVer yet designed to 
" do you any harm, and seek nothing now but 
'* ray* freedom. I know you are able enough 
" to swim to shore* and save your life ; but if 
" you are resolved to follow me to the en- 
" aangering of mine, the very moment you 
" pro^ed^ I will shoot you through the hefcd.*' 
The harmleBS creature, at these words, turned 
himself ^om me, and, I xnalie no doubt, got 
«afe to load. Thm turning to the boy Xury, 
I perceived he trembled at the action ; but I 
mi him out of all fear^ telling hina, that if 
he would be true and ftdthfal to me, i virould 
dowdlbylum, and not hurt him. 

We then putsued our voyage, I kept to the 
sou^ward, to the truly Raroariali cdast ; hot 
in the daric of th6 evening I changed my course, 
that I might keep near the shore ; and having 
a 'fitesh gale of wind, with a very pleasant 
smooth sea, by three o'clock n6xt day, I was

" If wild mans come, they eat me, yon go

ti€o for the chHd. " Well; deur Xuiy,'* saM I, 
** we will both go ashore, both kill wild mans, 
** and tbey «hall eat neither o# ns." So giving 
Xwy a piece of bread to eat, we Waded amiore, 
carrying^ nothing with us but oat avms, and two 
jan for water. I did not go out of sight of the 
boat> as. dreading the savages coining down the 
river i^ thoir canoes: but the boy* seeing a low 
descent or vale about a mile in the counlay, he 
Wandered to it; and ^en running back tomev 
with great^pr^pitation, I thought he v^aspur- 
sued by soine" savages or wild b^ts,^ upon 
which^I approache4> reiBdlving to periA, oi* pro- 
tect him from dabger. As he cami» nearer lo 
me, I saw something hangfngover bis shouk

hare, but diiSerent in colour, aind with longer 
legs ; however, we were glad of it, f6r it proved 
wholesome and nfourishing htieat; but what 
added to our joy was, my hot assured me 
there was plenty of water, and that he* ** sa^ 
" no wild mans." And greater sttU vras out 
comfort, when we found fresh waM in the 
creek where wo were, when the tide was out, 
without going so far \ip intothe country'. 

In this place I began to hope &at I should

But this was spending oar ammunition is

was like a champion, and comes 01^ boi^rd for 
a hatchet to cut off the hei^ of his enemy, ;

And now we f^tdled southerly, living spar^

One day as^ we were sailiijg along, .we saw 
people standing on the ^hore,^d looking at us ; 
5ve. could also perceive they were black, and 
iljark naked. I was inclined to igo on shoj^e p . \^i

Xniy cried, No, no; however, I' ^pproaclied

It U Imposj^ble .t(> express tlje coastematioa 
ilie poor negroes were in at the firing of nay 
gun; niucli less cup I mention their surprise, 
when they perceived the creature to be slain by 
it. I made signs to' them to draw it Ti?ar with 
a rope, and tiien gave it to them to haul on 
shore. It was a beau tiff il leopard, which made 
me desire its skin ; and the negroes seeming 
to cOvet the carcase, i freely gave it to them. 
Aa for the other leopard, it made to shore, 
and ran with a prodigious swiftness out of 
sight. The negroes having kipdiy furnished 
me with water, and with what roots an4 grainy 
their country afforded,^ I took my leave, and 
after eleven 4^ys sail, : came in sight of the 
Cape de Verd. But the great distance I wa« 
from it, and fearing contrary winds yre^ld' 
prevent my reaching tben^ I began. to grovir 
melaricholv and dejected, when upon a sudden, 
Xury cried out, " Master, mij^ter," looking^ as 
affrighted as if it was his noiaster's ship sent in 
search of us. But I soon discovered she wa^ 
a Portuguese sliip. Upon which I strove for 
life to come up to them. But in vain bad it 
been, if through their perspective glasses, they 
had not perceived us^ and sl^prtened tneir ^ail 
to let us come in» E4pcoMraged at. this, I se^

tailed, And then I told him I was an English- 
man, who had escaped from the Moors at 
iSalee, upon which they took me kindly on 
boards with all my effects. 

Having a pleasant voyajge to the Braziln, 
we arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, 
or, All Saints Bay, in twenty- two days after. 
And here I cannot forget the generous treat* 
ment of the captain. He would take nothing 
for my passage, gave me twenty ducai<) for 
the leopard's skin, and thirty for the lion's. 
Every thing he caused to fee delivered to me, and 
Hvhat r would sell he bought In sjiort, I 
made 220 pieces of my cargo, and with this 
' stock I entered once more, as I may say, into 
the scene of life 

To be brief, I bought a settlement next 
door^tb an honest and kind neiffhbour, born 
at Lisbon, of English parents, whose planta- 
tion joining to mine, we improved very am i- 
<!;abfy together. Both our stocks Were low ; 
and for tWQ years we planted only for food r 
but the third year we planted same tobacco; 
and each of us dressed 'a large piece of ground, 
the ensuing year, fo»r plantijig sugar-canes. 

I was in some measure' settled.' before the 
captddn who took me up departed iroin the Bra- 
zils. One 4ay I went to him, ahd told him what 
stock I had in London, desiring his assistance 
ill getting it sent out to me; to which the good 

feniflcman readily consented, but would only 
ave me send'for half niy nionoy, iest.it should 
lui^carryi ^Wch, it it id, I might still have the 



rrHi^mdet tb support me ; &nd j?o taking" Ut* 
tors of procuration from mo, bid roe.troublir 
mvself no fffrtiier about it 

And inJced, be not only procured the 
money I luid drau^n for upon my captain's 
widow, but 8ent hie over a servant, with a 
cargo pf oportiomible tb uiy condttion. He 
also sent me over totals of all sorts^ iron work 
and wten»ils necessary for my plantation. 

Wealth now inci'easitrg oii fiae,' and tincom* 
inon tjucce^^ crowding my- prosperous labour*, 
I might have rested liappy in that middle state 
of life which ray iatlMiir so often Teco'iniMeirded ;

The sUip being fitted out, anfl all tiling 
ready, we' set sail the first of September, 16.5^1. 
We sailed northward upon the cdas^ from 
whence going fagrther into the ocean out of the 
sight of land, we steered as though wb wer« 
bpundl for the island Fcjrnand de "Norenba, 
leaving the island on the east; and then it 
was we met with a terrible tempest, whieh 
continued for twelve days successively, so 
that the winds <;arried us wheresoever they 
pleased. In this perplexity, one of our men 
died, and a man and a boy were washed over- 
board. When the weat-h^r cleared up a little, 
we found ourselves) upon the coast of GKiiana. 
Upon this the captain gave reasons for return- 
ing; which I opposed, counselling him to 
stand away for Barbadoes, which, as I sup- 
posed, might be attained in fifteen days. So 
altering our course, we sailed north-west and 
by we^t, in order to reach the Leeward 
Islands ; but a «eppnd storm succeeding, droye 
us to toe w^tward, so that We were justly 
,^r4id ot falling into the hands of cruel si^- 
vages, or ibe paw^ of devouring Ijeasts of prey*

couM not so mucb as hope, that the ship 
would hold out many minutes, without bt«£(k- 
ing in pieces, unless the wind by a miracle 
sliould ttim about immediately. Whil^ ^® 
stood looking at one another, expecting deaih 
every moment, the mate lays hold of the hp^t, 
and with the help of the rest got her flwpg 
over the ship's side ; into tliis we all got, beipg 
eleven in number and, committed ours^lfes to 
God's mercy, and the wild sea* And now we 
saw that this last effort would not be a snffit 
ci^ht protection from death ; so high did t^e 
sea rise, that it was impossible tiie boat shoiild 
live* As to making a sail we had none, nei- 
ther if we had, could we make use of any. So 
that when we had rowed, or rather were driven 
about a .league and a half, a raging wave, like 
a 10% Inountain, came rolling a-stern of us, 
and took us witli such fury, tbat at oncei it 
overset thd boat. Thus being swallowed up 
in a moment, we had only time to call upon 
the awful name of God, and to implore, in 
' dying ejaculations^ his infinite mercy to re- 
ceive our departing souls. . 

Men are generally counted insensible, when 
struggling in the pangs of death ; but Whil^ I 
was overwhelmed with water, t had the most 
dreadful apprehensions imaginable, for "^he 
thoughts of ev^ery thing which I Jhad <^one 
amiss came crowding to my mind. I had dis- 
obeyed my parents, I had 'slighted their ad- 
vice, I bftd left fhem to folloMP my own way- 
ward inclination, and I was now about to ap- 

B 



pt9Lt before ihtii Being wh^m I bad oSended. 
X wag going I thought I knew not whither, in a 
dismal gulph unknown, and as yet unperceived^ 
never to behold rny friends, nor the light of this 
world any more ! 1 strove however to the lasft 
extrenaity, while all my companions were ovet- • 
powered and entombed in the deep ; and it was 
" with great di^culty I kept my bt^ath till the 
wave spent itself and, retiring back, 1^ me 
on the ^hote half dead with the water I had 
taken in. As sQon as I got on my feet, I ran 
as fast as I could, lest another wave should 
pursue me, and carry me back again. But for 
all the haste T made, 1 could not avoid it, for 
the sea came after me like a high mountain, or 
a ^rious enemy ; so that my business was to 
hold my breath, and by raising myself dn ihe 
' water, to save poyself by swimming. The next 
dreadful wave buried me at once twenly or 
thirty feet deep, but at the same lime, caxried 
me with a mig^y force and swiftness towards 
the shore, when raking myself I, held out aA 
well as possible, till, at length, the water, hav- 
ing spdnt itself, began to return, at which I 
struck forward, and feeling ground again with 
my feet, I took t6 my heels. Thus being 
served twice more, I v((as at last dashed against 
a piece of rock, in such a manner, as left me 
senseless, but recovering a little hehte: the re» 
turn of the wave» which no doubt would then 
overwhelm mc, 1 held fast by the rock till those 
succeeding Waves abated ,* and then fetching 
another run, was overtaken by a «mall wave.

58 

whidh wa» soon conquered. But before a,nj 
more could overtake me, I reached the main* 
land, where clambering up the chfk of the 
shore, tnred and almost spent, I sat down on 
the grass, free from the danger of the foaming 
ocean. 

No tongue can express the transports, that 
my soul felt at this happy deliverance. I was 
wrapt up in. contemplation, and often lifted up 
nky nands, with the profoundest hitmility, to 
the divine power for saving my life ; when the 
rest of my companions were all drowned. And 
now I began to cast my eyes around, and to 
behold what place I was in, and what I had 
next to do. 1 could see no house nor people; 
I was wet, yet had no clothes to shift me ; 
hungry and thirsty, yet had nothing to eat or 
drink, no weapon to destroy any cr^ture for 
iny sustenance, nor defend myself against de«> 
vouring beasts ; in short I had nothbig but a 
knife, a tobacco pipe> and a box half filled 
with tobacco. The darksome night ooniing. 
upon me, increased my fears of being devour- 
ed by wild creatures, my mind was plunged 
in &spair, and having no prospect, as I 
thought of life before me, I prepared for ano- 
ther kind of death' than what I had lately es- 
caped. I walked about a furlong to see if I 
could find any fresh water, which I did to my 
great joy ; and taking a quid of tobacco to 
prevent hunger, I got up into a thick bushy 
ttee, and seating myself so that I could not 
fall, a deep sleep overtook mg^ and lor that 
gbt» buried my sorrows in quiet repose. 



29 

It was broad day, thetiext mc^ping, before I 
awoke,' when I not only perceived the terapest 
was ceased, bnt saw the ship driven almost as 
far as "the rock before mentioned, which was 
about a mile from the place where I was. — 
When I came down from my apartment in the 
tree, i perceived the ship's boat two miles dis- 
tant onjny right hand, lying onshore as the 
waves had cast her. I thought to have got to 
her ; but there being an inlet of water about 
half a mile's breadth between it and me, I re- 
turned again towards the ship, as hoping to 
find sonjething for my more immediate subsist- 
ence. About no(M3, ^when ihe sea v^as so calm 
that I could come within a quarter ot a mile of 
her, it waa to my grief I perceived, that if we 
had kept on boards all our lives would have 
been saved« These thoughts and my solitude 
drew tears from my eyes, though all in vain. 
So resolving to get to the ship, I stripped and 
waded as far as I could find depth ; after which, 
swimming round her, I was afraid I could not 
geit any thing to lay hold )bf; but it was my good 
iortune to espy a small piece of. rope hanging 
down so low, Aat, , by the h«lp of it^ though 
with great difficulty, 1 got into the ship. Herer 
I found thattiie ship was bilged, and had a great 
de^l of water in her, her stern was lifted up 
sfgainst a bank, and her head almost in the 
water. All her quarter, and what w^as there, 
were free aiid dry. The provisions I found in 
good order, and, losing no time, ate while J 
was doing other Ibbgs. I also found some 

B 3 



30 

ru(D, of wLicb 1 took aliti^e ; and now I wanted 
for nothing except a -boat, which indeed was 
a]], to carry awaj what was needful for me. 

Necessity occasions a qiiickness of thougl^t. 
We had several spare yards, a spare top mast 
or two, and two or throe large spars of wood. 
With these I fell to work, and slung as many 
of them over board as I could manage, tying 
every one of them with a rope, that they might 
not drive away. This dpne, .1 went down the 
ship's side, and tied four of them fast together 
at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two 
or three short pieces of plank upon them cross* 
\jirays, I found it would bear ine, bu^ not any 
considerable weight. Upon which J went to 
work again, cutting a spare top*mast into three 
lengths, adding them to m;^raft, with ^ great 
deal of labour and pains. I then, first la>li?g 
upon^t all the planks and boarids I ppuld get, 
next lower^ down, three of the seamen's chests, 
after I had filled them with b^ead, rice, three 
t)utch cheeses, five piec^ of dried goats flenh, * 
and some European cprn, what little the rats 
had spared; and. for liquors, I |biind several 
cases of bottles, in which were some cordial 
waters, and four otr. five gallons of arrack. By 
this timq, the tide beginnings ^ flow^ I per- 
ceived my coat, waistcoat, and shiirt swim 
away, wnich I had left on shore ; ^ for my 
linen, breeches, and stockings, I swam with them 
to the ship; but I soon found clothes enough, 
though I took no more than 1 wanted for the 
priBsept^ My eyes were chiefly on tooh to 



31 

work'\f ith, and after a long fiearcli, I found o\xt 
,the carpenter's chesty whicii I got «afe down 
on my raft. I then looked for arms and ammn- 
nitipn, and in the ^;reat cabin, fpund two good 
fowling pieces^ two pistols, several powder 
horns £iled, a sqkiI) bag of sbot^ and two tu^ty 
«word«. T lijcewis^ found three barreU • of pt^w- 
4et, two pf which were good, but the third 
Jiad taken wat^r, also two or three brojcen oars, 
two saws, an axe, and a bamjner. I ilien put 
to sea, and in g<^UijDg to shore, h^d^thjree ad- 
tan tages in my favour. K A su^outh caloa sea. 

2. The tide rising and setting in to tlie shore. 

3. The yttlje wind thfre was blowing toward* 
land, ^ter I bad sailed abotit a mile, I.founct 
the raft driyijng a Httle dintanpe from the plac^. 
where I first landed^ and tlien 1 p^rc«;ived an 
opening of the land, , with a strong current of 
the tide running iQto it, upon whichl kept the 
middle of the strecun. But great was luy con* 
cem, when oo a suddeq, ttie furepart of my 
raft ran aground. But after some time the. rk > 
iug of tl^e water caused, the rafit to 0t'at again, 
and coming up a little riVer, with land on boih 
sides, I landed in a little cave, a^ near the 
raouth as possible, the better, to dlsqover a sail, 
.if any such providentially passed that way. 

Not far oiT, I espied a hill of stupendous 
height^ surroimded with smaller hills idbout it» 
and thither J was resolved to go and view the 
country, that I might see what|)art was best 
to fix ray hajjitalion in. Accordingly, arming 
myself with a pistol, t^ fowling piece, powder 



32 

ftfid ball, I ascended the ftountain. There I 
perceived I was in an island, encompassed by 
the sea, no distant lands to be seen, but scat- 
tering rocks that lay to the west ; it seemed 
to be a {»arren plade, and as I thought, only 
inhabited by wild beasts. I perceived abund- 
ance of fowls, but was ignorant of what kind, 
or whether good for nourishment. I shot one 
of them at my return, which occasioned, a con- 
fused screaming amotag the other birds, and I 
found it, by its colour and beak, to be a kind of 
hawk, but its iflesh was perfect carrion. 
, Wlien *I canje to my raft, I brought my 
effects on shore, which work spent that day en- 
tirely; and fearing that some cruel beast 
iBight devour me in the night time whilie I slept, 
I made a kind of hut, or barricade, with the 
chests and boards I bad brought on shore* 
That night, I slept very comfortably ; an^ the 
next morning my thoughts were employed to 
make a further attempt to this ship, and bring 
away what necessaries I could find, before ano- 
ther storm should break her in pieces. Accord- 
ingly, I got on board as before, and prepared a 
4socond raft far more nice than ihe firsts upon 
wj)ich, I brought away the carpenter^ stores, 
two or three bags full of nails, a great jack- 
screw, a dozen or two of hatchets; and a ^nd- 
fitone. I also took two or three iron crows, 
two barrels of musket bullets, another fowling* 
piece, a small quantity of powder, and a large 
bag full of small shot. Besides these, I took 
all th« men's doihes I oould ikd^ a spare iore- 



Ro'it'iNsexCitcsuE on hf* Raft. 



34 

/ 

iofi^sailf u hammock, and some becl^^ng ; and 
thus compjetipg my second cargo, I made all 
the haste to shore I could, fearing some wild 
beast might destroy what I had there already. 
But I only found a little wild cat sitting on one 
of th« cnests, who not seeming to fear me, or 
the gun that I presented at her, I threw her a 
piece of bjscuit, which she instantly eat and 
departed. ^ 

' When I had> got these . effects pn shore, I 
went to work iii order to make me a little tent 
with the sail and some poles, which I had cut 
for that purpose, and having finished* it, what 
things might be damaged by the weather, I 
brought in, piling all the emp^ chests and casks 
in a circle, the better to fortify it against any 
sudden attempt ot man ot beast. After this, I 
blocked up the doors with some boards, and an 
4Bmpty chest turned the long way out. I then 
charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed 
on the ground, slept as comfortably till the 
next morning as though t had been in a chris- 
tian country. 

Now though I had enough to subsist me a 
long time, yet despairing of a sudden deliverance, 
and fearing that both ammunition and provision 
might be spent before such a>thing happene^^ 
I saved as much as T could, and so long as the 
ship rehiained in ^at condition, I daily brought 
away one necessary or other : particularly the 
riffging; sails, and cordage : some twine, a bar- 
xel of wet powder, some sugar, a barrel of meal, 
threjs casks of rum, and indeed what was most 
welcome to ftie,a whole hog?5head of bread. 



S6 

Tke next time I went, I cut the cables in 
pieces, carried off a hawser whole, with a great 
deal of iron work, and made another raft ; but 
this being so unwieldy, by the too heavy bur- 
den upon it, and I not being able so dexte- 
rously to guide it as the former, both riiy cargo 
and myself were overturned. For my part, idl 
the damage I sustained was a wet skin : and at 
low water, after much labour in diving, I got 
up most of the cables, and some pieces of I^n. 

» 

, Fifteen days had I now been on the island, 
and eleven times on board, bringing away all 

- ' that was possible. 'As I w'as going the twelitli 
time, the wind began to rise; however I ven- 

^ tyilwi at low water, and rumni6ging tlie caliu, 
in a locker, I found St'veral razois, &ci«sa 9, and 
some dozens of kuivds and forks, and in ano. 
ther, thirty-six pounds in pieces of eight, silvpr 
and gold. I wrapt the money up in a piece of 
canvas, and began to think of making another 
raft ; but I soon perceived the wind beginning 
to rise, a fresh gale blowing from the shore, 
and the sky overcc^t with clpuds and darkness. 
No thinking a raft to be in vain, 1 let myself 
iuto the water ^witb what things I had about 
Die ; and it^was tJvutli great difficulty 1 got 
a<thore, when soon after it blew a fearful storm. 

That night I slept very contentedly In ray 

« little tenti surrounded with all my effects ; but 

, when I looked out in the morning, no luuro shiji 

was to be seen. This much surprised me fur 



iha present ,' yet, when I conj»i(T«r6d iLat 1 htd 
lost no time, ■ abated no pain«, rind liad got 
cvefy thing usefcil outj of tier, I comforted ipy- 
self in the best manner, and entirely submitted 
to Divine Providence. 

My next tlK)oghts were, how I should de- 
fend and soctfrc myself from savages and' wild 
fceftsis, if any sticli were in fho island. 

•When I considered the ground where I was> 
that it was marshy, and had no frfesh water 
near iiy my rcsolijtions were to search for a soil 
healthy and well watered, where 1 might not 
only be sheltered from the sun'^s scorching heat^ 
Imt be more conveniently situated, a» well to be 
secured from wild men, and beasts of prey, a» 
more easily toTliscovcr any distant sail, sKfould 
it ever so happen. 

And indeed it was not kmg before I had my 
desire. 1 found a little plain near a rismg hiil/ 
the front towards which, being as steep as a 
house-side, nothing could .d^^^^x^^ o° ^^ from 
the top. , . 

On the side of this rock wasF a little hollow 
place, resembling the entrance or door of a 
cave. Just befdre this place, on the circle of 
the green, I resolved my tent should stand. 
I'his plain did not much exceed a hundred yards 
broad, and about twice as long, like a delight- 
ful green before my door, with a pleasing, 
though irregular descent every way' to the low 
grounds by the sea side, sheltered from the 
excesdve heat of the sun. After this I drew a 
semicircle, twenty feet itk diaraetiBr, driving 



37 

tiovm two roWs of strong stakes not six idches 
from each other. Then, with the pieces of 
cables which I had cut on board, I regularly laid 
them in a circle between the piles, up to their 
tops, .which were more than tive feet out of the 
earth, and then drove another row of piles look, 
ing within side against them, between two and 
three feet high, which made me conclude it a 
little castle impregnable by men and beasts. 
And for my bettet security, 1 would have no 
door, but entered in and came out by the help 
of a ladder^ which 1 also made. 

Here was my fence and fortress, into which 
I carried all my richesi ammunition, and stores. 
After which) working on the rock, what with 
the dirt and stones I dug out, I not only raised 
my ground two feet, but made a little cellar to 
mv mansion house ; and this cost me many- days 
labour and pains. One day, in particular, a 
shower of rain foiling, thunder ana li^tning, 
ensued, wMch put me in' terror, lest my powder 
should take fire, and not only hinder my neces- 
sary subsistence, by preventing me from killing 
my food, but even blow up me and my habitation. 
To prevent which, 1 fell to making boxes and 
bags, in order! to separate it, having by me near 
l^lbs. weight. And thus being established as 
idng of the island, every day I went out with my 
Ain, to see mba^ I coftld kill ihat was fit to eal.

. iii ^ IbW groiinidS) I happened to skoot a pKe-* 
' goat suokliog a young kid ; which, not think- 
ing its dam slain, stood by her unconcerned ^ 
and when I took the dead creatujre up, the 
young one followed me even to the enclosure. 
I lilted the kid over the pales, and v/ould wH« 
Itngly have kept it alive, bat finding it could 
not be brought to eat, I was forced to slay it 
aloo for my subsistence. 

Thiis, entertid upon a life of solitude, I had 
■liiost melancholy lipprehensioiis concerning my 
deplorable conditbn ; and many times, the teavs . 
wodld |ilenttfaliy run down my face, when I 
considered how I was debarred from all coni- 
munication with human kind. Yet whMe theee 
desponding tiioiights would seem to rtiakse me 
accuse Providence, oUiet good thoi^vts would 
interpose and Tepiov» me alter this manner; 
" Well, supposing you are desolate, is it not

*' sbould you complain, whm not only your 
" life was ftreserved, but the ^p oriven into

c^story out of her for a subsistence?" But 
to proceed : It was, by the account I kept, the 
«M)Ui of S^ptemb^r, when I first landed on thi^ 
island. About twdve dayil^ after, foarn^iittit 
I sUbuldrloose my vockoniiig of time, nay eveib

day I cut a notch with ray knife on the sides of 
the square post, and that on the Sabbath was 
as long again as the rest, and every first day 
of the month, as long again as that long one. 
In this manner, I kept my calendar, weekly, 
monthly, or yearly reckoning of time. But 
had I made a more strict search ( £is I did af- 
terwar Is,) I need not have set up this mark 
For among the parcels belonging to the gun- 
ner, carpenter, and captain's mate, I found 
those very things I wanted ; particularly pens, 
ihk, and paper.; also 1 found two or three 
compasses, some mathematical instruments, 
dials, perspective glasses, books of navigation, 
three Ehiglis^ bibles, and several other good 
books, which I carefdlly put up. Here I can- 
hot but call to mind our having a dog and two 
eats on board, whom I made inhabitants with 
me in my easHe. Though one might think I 
had air the necessaries that were desirable, yet 
sttll I found several things wanting. My ink 
was^ daily wasttng : I wanted needles, pins, and 
thread to mend or keep my clothes together : 
and jparfieularly a spade, pick-axe, or shovel, 
td remove the earth. It was a year before I 
finished: my litHe bulwark ; anct having some 
intervals of relaxation, after my daily wander- 
ing abroad for provision, I drew up this plan 
liternately, as creditor and debtor, to remipd 
ibe of the miseries and blessings of my life, 
under so mauy various circumstances.

no prospect of a wel-

How miserable taa t,

enjoyment or company 
of all mankind. 



like a hermit ( ra- 
ttier should I say a 
lonely anchoret) am 
I foiced from human

My clothes, after

worn out, and then I 
shall have none ta

When my ammuni-

shall I remain without 
any defence against 
wild men and beasts. 

I have no creature, 
no soul to speak to; 
none to beg assistance

But yet I ani pre-

ih the raging sea. 

Yet set ap&i^i U>

And He, who has so 
preserved me, can de- 
liver me from this con* 
dition. 

However, I have 
food to eat, and even 
a happy prospect of 
subsistence whilst life 
endures. 

At present I enjoy 
what is absolutely 
needful; and the cli- 
mate is so hot, that 
had I ever so many, 
I should hardly wear 
them\ 

Yet even thus, I see 
no danger of any to.

JOURNAL. 

SEPTEMBER. 30th, 1650, I, Robinson 
Crusoe, having suffered shipwreck, was diivea 
on this desolate island, which 1 named the 
Desolate Island of Despair, the rest of mj. 
companions being swallowed up in tlie tem« 
pestupus ocean. That day I spent in conside. 
ration of mj unhappy circumstances^ havii^. 
no pcospect but of death, either to be starved 
with hunger, or devoured by wild boasts or 
merciless savages* 

Oct. I. That rooming, with great comfort, I 
beheld the ship driven ashore. Some hopes I 
had, that when the storm was abated, I might 
be able to get some food and necessaries out of 
her; which I conceived were not damaged,, 
because the ship remained upright. At this, 
time, I lamented the loss of my companions, 
and our misfortune in leaving the vesse}. Whea 
I perceived th§ ship, as it were, to lie dry, I 
wa.ded through the sands, as far as I could &n.i 
depth, then swam aboard, the* weather being 
very rainy, and with scarcely any wind. 

Oct. 6, My raft, and all the goods tbtreon 
were overset; yet I recovered woel again at 
low water. . 

To the 14th of this month, my time was em- 
ployed in making vovaffes every tide, trettin 



4S 

wbat 1 could oui of t)i« ship. The wofttbet 
very wet and uncertain. 

Oct 15, It blew hard, and rained ntghiaaftd 
day, when the ship went to pieces^ so that no* 
tiling was seen of her but the ¥^eck at low. 
water. This day 1 secured my goods from tiie 
inclemency of ihc weather. . " 

Oct. 1& I wandered to see where I could 
find a place convenient for my abode : I fixed 
upon a rock in the evening* marked outa hsJf 
woon, intending to ifect jbl waU fortified witk 
piles, lined within witb pieces of cablois^ and 
covered with turL 

Nov. 3. I shot two wild-fowl, r^sembKng 
4acks, which were goq4 to eat, and in the af- 
ternoon began to make mo at8.b]ie« 

Nov. 4* I began to live regular^. In the 
morning* I allowed myself itwo oar three boars 
to walk out with my gun ; i Hxen Woijked till 
near eleven o'clod^.; and afterwards refreshed' 
myself with what- 1 liad to eat From twelve 
to two, I would Ufi down to sleejp. ^xl^me 
sultry weather* In the evening go to work: 
agam. 

Nov. 5. Wenki «at with my gim and dog, 
shot a wild ofti with a soft skm, but her fiesii 
was good for notfung. The A'lm^ of those 
killed I preserved. In my retom I perceived 
many wild i>irds, and > was tenifiod oy some 
seids ^hich made off to sea. 

Nov. 6. Completed my table. 

Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked to ihe> 
}2th, but omitted the 1 1th, which according 
to my calcttlatioo« I supposed to be Sunday. 




44 

Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock^ yet was 
obliged to desist for want of a pick-axe, Shovel 
and wheel-barrow. Iron crows I used to sup. 

Jly the place df tjie first, but with all my art 
could not make a wheel-barrpWt 

Nov. 19. It was a great happiness to me to 
find a tree resembling what tiie Brazilians call 
an Iron tree. I had like to spoil my axe with 
cutting it, it being very hard, and exceedingly 
heavy ; yet with much labour and industry I 
made a sort of spade out 6f it. 

Nov. 23. These tools being made, I daily, 
carried on my business ; eighteen days I allow- 
ed for enlarging my cave, that it mieht serve 
tne, not only for a warehouse, but kitcnen, par- 
lour, and cellar. I commonly lay inthe^nt, 
unless the weather was so rainy that I- could 
not lie dry. So wet wou)d it be at cert^ sea- 
sons, that I was obliged to cover all withiii 
the pale, with long poles, in the form of rafters, 
leaning against the rock, and load them with 
flags and large leaves of tree^ Resembling i^ 
thatch. 

Dec. 10. No sooner did I think my habitar 
tion finished, but suddenly a gr^ deied pf the 
top brpk« in, so that it was a mercy I was not 
buried in the ruins. This occasioned a great 
deal of pidns and trouble to me, beforp 1 cpuld 
make it ^rm and durable. 

Dec. )7. I nailed up some shelyes, and drove 
nails and staples in the wall and po^ts, to han^ 
every thing oiit of the way. 

Dec. 20. I got pvery thing into its pla^^ 
then niade a sort of drpsser, and another table. 



46 

Deo, 27. I chanced to light upon son^e ^oai% 
shot one, wciinded another ; 1 led it hojue in a, 
liiring, bound up its leg, and eg red it ip a little 
time ; at length; it became ao t^rpe and fagailiar 
as to feed before the door, ^qd folloyr me where 
I p}e^ed. This put nie in mind to bring up 
tame creatures, in order to supply i^e with ioo4 
after my ammunition was spent. 

Dec. 28, 29, 30. The wejithqr being ex ces-^ 
lively hot, with Uttle ^r, obliged me ibr the 
inost part, to ke^p \Yithin doors. 

Jan, 3. to 14- Mv employment this time 
wa3 io finish th^ ycsii before described, fLn<i 
search the isl^pdt ( discovered a k^nd of pit 
ge6us, like our hpuse pigeons, in a nest fuiiong 
the rocks. J brought them home, pureed ik^u\ 
fill they Goqjd fiy, and then they left pae. Af-i 
ter this, J shot some, which p.rov0d excellept 
food. Sopae time I spent yfuhlv cpnUiying t€^ 
make a cask, I mpy well say ii yras yi vain^ 
because J could neither jppit t^e stftyes, noif 
fix the heads, so as to ipake it tight ; sp leay. 
ing that, I took some goat's tallow I h^d by- 
in€|, and a little oakum for tb& wick, and pro* 
vided myself with a )ami>, wjhlch ^e^ed ins^ft4 
of candles. 

But now a veyy st^pge evcpt happened. Foi^ 
being in the height of my search, wh^t should 
come into pay hand, but a bag wh\ch yrps used 
to hold cofp (as J suppose^) fo^: the fowls ; so, 
imnaediately resolving to put gunpowder into it, 
I shook all the husks and dirt upon one side. o(

would be. The rain had fallen j)lenti{ull}' A 
few days before ; and about a montli after, to 
my great amazement, something began to look 
out very green and flourishing; and when t 
came to view it more nicely, every day as it 
grew, I found about ten or twelve ears of green 
barley of the very same shape and ma^ke as that 
in England. 

I can scarcely express the agitation of my 
inind at this sight. Hitherto I had been used, 
like too many in the world, to look with in- 
difference upon the marks of God's goodness, 
which are every where visible* Indeed so ig* 
norant was I. that I had even thought health, 
and food, and clothinig to be the mer^ result 
of our own labour and care and foresight, 
without ever reflecting, that the Almighty is 
the bestowcr of eveiy good and perfect gift, 
and that it is his blessing alone upon our 
efforts which makes them to prosper. The ap- 
peairance of the barley flourishing so unexpect- 
edly in a barren soil, and my ignorance of the 
manner in which it came there, led me into a 
singular opinion. 1 concluded that miracles 
were not ceased, and that God had appointed 
the barley to grow there without any seed, 
purely for my, sustenance in this miserable and 
desolate island. And indeed such great effect 
had this upon me, that it often made me melt 
iilto tifars through a grateful sense of God's 
mercies : and the greater still was my thankful-, 
n^ss^ when I perceived about this little field of 
barley,, some rice stalks^ also wonderfully 
flourishing. 



47 

While thus pletised In uAjiA, I conch^ded. 
there must be some more corn in tbe island, 
and therefore niade a diligent search narrowly 
among the rocks ; but not being able to find 
any, on a sudden it came into my mind, how I 
ha4 shaken the husks of com put of the bag, 
a^d then so blind was my understanding, that 
iny admiration ceased, and with it my grati-' 
tude to the Divine Being, as thinking it teas 
hut nctturaL and not to be conceived a mij;Qr. 
cle: thou[,h even the mamaer of its preserva-^ 
tion might have made me own it as a wonder*. 
ful event of God's kind providence* 

It >yas about the latter end of June when thft^ 
ears of this com ripened, which I laid up very 
carefully, together with 20 or 30 stalks of rice, 
expecting one day I should reap the fruit of 
my labpur : yet four years were expired beSoro 
I could allow myself to eat any bsudey bread ; 
and much longer time^ before I had any rice 
After this, with indefatigable pains and industry, 
for three or four mont&, at leust I finished my 
house, having no way to go into it, but by a 
ladder against the wall* 

April 16. I finished ny ladder, and ascend* 
cd it ; afterwards pulled it up, then let it dowa 
on the other side, and descended into my new 
i^abitafion, where I had space enough, and was 
«o fortified, that nothing coidd attack me with* 
<>ut scaling the walls. 

But what does all human art and indpstrj 
avail, if the blessing of God does not crowa 
ijiir labours? Or who can stand before the 
Abuighty^ when he stretcheth forth his am)i 



4« 

for, one time, when I was at the cptrance .of 
tngrcave, there happened sucH a dreadful earth-, 
ifaake, that not onlV the roof of the cave came 
tfimbling about my ears, hutthe po^ts seemed tq 
crack terribly at the same time. Thfe put me 
in a great aitiazement ; and runping to the lad- 
der and gettii^g over the wall, 1 then plainly 
knew it wa§ an earthquake, the place I stood on 
sustaining ^hree terrible shocks ^n less than three 
minutes. But judge of my terror when 1 saw 
the top of a great rock roliintoi the sea : J then 
expected the ^land would be swallowed up 
eveiy monient : and what made the scene still 
niore di^eadful, wa§ to see the sea thrown into 
the most violent agitations and disorders by this 
tremendous convulsion of pature. 

For m^ part, I expected every moment ta 
be swallovved up. At the moving of the earth, 
I was, as it were, sea-sick; and very much 
afiraid lest the rock, under wHich was my fence 
^(lliftbitatibn, should overwhelm me and it It^ 

a lasting tomb. 

It was only the dar after, when a hoiTtble, 
^nipj^st arose, at the skme time attended- with a 
burrigano of vvind. Three hours did this sto^m 
continue^ and in so violent a manner b^ to teai^ 
the very tree^ up by the. roots, which was sue- 
ced&ed^y abundance o^ nun. When the tem- 
pest was over, I went to ray tent ; but the rain 
doming on in a fiirious manner^ 1 was obliged 
to take shelter in the cave, where I was forced 
to cut a channel through my fortification, to let 
the water out. It continued raining all that 



,.i 



49 

ni^t, and some time the next day. T'nese aor 
cidents made me resolve, as soon as the wea- 
ther cleared pp, to build me a little hut in some 
open place, walled round to detenfl me froni 
wild creatures and savages ; not doubting, but, 
at the next earthquake, the mountain would 
iP&ll on my habitation and me, and swallow up 
all in its bowels ; bi|t to resume the thread of 
ray narration which this mention qf the storu^ 
has interrupted, 

April 16 — 50. These days I spent, in con- 
triving how and \n what manner I should iix 
wv place of abode. AH this while, 1 yfas un- 
der the most dreadful apprehensions. When 
1 looked round my habitation, eveiy thing I 
found in its proper place. I had several der 
bates whether T should move or not; but at 
length resolved to stay wh^re I v {^$. till I found 
out a convenient place where 1 might pitch my 
^ont. ' ' "^ ^' ' ■ 

April 2|2. When I began to put ray resolu^ 
tions in practice, I was stopped for want of 
tools and instmraents to work with. Most of 
ray axes and hatchets were u^aless, occasioned 
by cutting the hard tjraber that grew on the 
island. 1^ took rae up a fwll week to make ray 
grindstone of use to me ; but at lost I found 
out A way to turn it about ^ith my foot, by 
help of a wheel and a string. 

April 30. My bread falhng short, I allpwoil 
myself but one biscuit a day. 

May I • As I walked alobg the sea shore, I 
found a barrel of gun powder, and several 
pieces of the wr(;ck which th« |ea had flun^ 



up. Having secured thete, I made to the sliip, 
whose storn was torn off, and washed a great 
distance ashore ; but the rest lay in tlte sands. 
This, I suppose, was occasioned by the earth- 
quake. I now resolved to keep my old place 
oi abode : and also to get to the ship that day» 
but found it impossible. 

May 3. This day I went on board the wfeok, 
which still remained upon its bed of rock, 
though tlije waves had carried away alhits upper 
works and left nothing standing but the parjt 
between decks, and with my saw sawed <^ one 
of the beanis, which kept her quarter deck..— 
1 then cleared tiie sand till flood. 

May 4. I caught some fish, but they were 
not wholesome. The same day, T also caught 
A young dolphin. 

May 5, This day also I repaired to the wreck, 
and sawed another piece of timber; and when 
the flood came» I made a^oat of thr^e great 
planks, which were driven ashore by the tide. 

May 6—9, These days, I brought off th 
iron bolts, opened the declf. with the iron 
crow, and carried two planks to land, having 
made a way into the very middle of the wreck. 

May 10-— 14. All this Ume I spent in bring- 
ing off groat quantities of iron and timber. 

May id. Took with roe two hatchets on 
pnrpiose to cut off some lead from the roll, but 
all in vain, for it lay too low under water. 

May 24, To Ibis day, I worked on the 
wreck, and with great difficulty loosened some 
things so much with the crow, tixat at the first 
blowing tido^ several ca^ks floated but, and se«

Teml of the seamen's cliests ; yet tbal day no- 
thing carae to land but pieces of timber, and a 
hogshead which had some pork in it^ 1 conti. 
ixqed working to the 15th of June, (except 
necessary times for food and rest) and had I 
known how to build a boat, I had timber and 
planks enough ; I had also nearly 100 weight 
ol sheet lead. 

June 16. As I was wandering towards the 
sea-side, I found a large tortoise or turtle, being ^ 
the first 1 had seen on the island, though, , as I 
afterwards found, there were many on the otl^er 
side of it. 

June 17. This day I spent in cooking it, fobnd 
in her three score eg^, and her flesh the most 
savoury and pleasant 1 eier tasted in my life. 

June 18. I staid within this day, there being 
a continual rain ; and it was somewhat more 
chilly .and cold than usual. 

June 19. Exceedingly ill, taken with a trem-* 
bling and shivering. 

June 20. Awake all night,, my head racked 
with pain and feverish* 

June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with 
dismal apprehensions of my condition. Prayed 
to God more frequently, but very confusedly. 

June 22. Something better, but still uneasy 
in my mind. 

June 23. Again relapsed ratich as before. 

June 24. Mended a second time.

pnd broiled some of it ; I would willingly hare 
stewed ii, and made some brotb^ but had no 
pot. 

June 27. All this day I was affiicted with 
an ague ; thirsty, yet could hot help myself to 
water : prayed to God }n these words : Lord 
in pity J look upon me: Lord have mercy upon 
me ! hate mercy upon me / After this I fell 
^leep, which, when 1 awakened^ J foupd had 
^[puch refreshed pie. 

T rose up in a pensive manner* being so 
thoughtiul that I could not go to sleep ; and 
fearing the dreadful returp of my distepiper, it 
caused me to remember, that the firaziliana 
^ise tobacco for almost all diseases. 1 then 
went to my chest, ^n order to find some, where 
it was my happiness to fipd a cure, both for 
soul aiid body ; for there I found (>ne of the 
V Bibles, which till this time, 1 had neither lei-r 
sure nor inclination to looH into ; I took both 
the tobacco and that out of my chest, and lai4 
them on the table. Several experinients did 
I try with the toliacco : First, I took a piece of 
]eat, and chewed it ; but it being very green an4 
strong, almost stupified me [ next, I steeped i% 
in some rqm an hour or two, resolving when 
J Went to bed to take ^ dose of it: and in the 
third place, ( burnt some over a pah of fire^ 
holding my nos^ oyer it so long as I could 
endure it without suffocation. 

In the intervals of this operation, though my 
head was giddy and disturbed by the tobai^co, 
I took up the Bible to read. No sooner did I 
ppen it, but there a{)peared to mc th^ie words.

CtrU on me in ^he day of irouhhj and 1 vfiH 
d^Hvtr thee^ and ihou ihaU glorify me. 

At first, tbis sentence made ^ very deep im- 
pre$$ion on my heart ; but it s^pn wore oiTagkin, 
^yhon I considered that the wofd d^^^iver waij 
foveigp tp me« And as the child ron pf Israel 
said, when they, were promised flesh to eat, 
(Jan God spread d table in t1\e wiidernfitts ? In 
the likp mftnper I b^gan tp say. Can God hinor 
Sislf deliver jne from ihi* desolate igland ? How- 
ever, the words would still return to my mind, 
and after^il^aKls made a greater impression upoq 
me. As it now was very Ifite, and the tobaccq 
had dozed my he^d, I w$is inclined tp sleep ^ 
but before 1 would lie down, I fell on my 
kQoeS; ^nd implpf^d tbe prpn^ise fliat Qod had 
)|iade to me in the holy ScriptureSi that if F 
called on fiim in the 4ay of f rotable, fie would 
deliver me. With much di|iiculty, I afterwards 
drank the rum> wherein I h^d 'steeped the to* 
baccp, which flyipg into my head, threw me 
into 9uch a profpupd sleepj that it W49 three 
o'clock the n^ext d^y befqre J awoke \ or, rathe r^ 
I believp, | slept tw'o days, having certainly lost 
1^ day in my account, a^ I afterwi^rds disco^ 
vered, and I could never tell any other way. — 
"VVheu I got pp, my ^phits were lively and* 
c}ieeriul f ipy stomach much better, being very 
l^nngry ; aiid, in short, np fit returned the next 
day, wbic)i was (he 29th, but I foui^d myself 
much (litered fpr the better. 

July 3. The fit quite left me, but I was very 
weak* In this condition, } often thought of 
t)ic$p wordS| I wi(( delieer l/iee : find whilp ^i 



54 

tames I would tWnk of the impossibaUy of it, 
other thoughts would reprehend me, for disre- 
farding the deliverances I had received; even 
mm the moat forlorn and distressed condition. ' 
I asked myseU; what regard have I had to Gpd 
for his abundant mercies? Have 1 doiiii^iMgr 
part ? Be has delivered me, hut I have nol 
glerified him ; as if I had said, I had npt 
owned and feeon thankful for these as deli- 
verances, and how cpuld 1 expect greater ? So 
much did this sensibly touch my heart, that I 
gave God .thanks for my recovery firom sickness 
in the most humble posture. 

July 4. Tliis morning, I began seriously to 
ponder on what is written in tlie New Testa- 
nrient, resohing to read a chapter every morn- 
ing and night, as long as my tborights wofiid 
engage me. As soon as I set about this work 
seriously, f found my heart deeply affected 
witb the impiety of my past life. After this 
I begged of God to assist me with his holy 
8pirit in returning to my duty. One day in pe- 
rusing the Scripture, I came to Ihese words, 
IJim hntk God exalted m'/h hia right handta 
be a Ptif*c0 and a 8aw%our for to firioe repen^ 
tance and f^rgioenese of sins. Immediately 
1 laid down the book, apd with uplifted ban(is 
to Heaven, loudly cried, .0 blessed Jesus, thm 
AOH of David ! J&sus, thou eicaUed Prince and 
SawQur, give me repentance : Aaid, now in- 
deed, I prayed with a true sense of ray condi- 
tion, and a more certain hope, founded on the 
word of God. Now, f had a different sense of 
these words, iJaU on me, and J wiU delieer thee. 



56 

ihai is, from the dread^l load of guilt, which 
^pressed my, sin&l soul, and not from a soli- 
toy life : in a word, I came td this conclusion, 
' that a deliverance from sin was a much greater 
blessing llwin a deliverance from affliction. 

To tbo l4th July, I walked about with my 
g«n, little and little at a time, having been re- 
duced to the greatest extremity of weakness. 
The OApUcatious and experiments I used were 
perfectly new: neitl^er could I recommend 
them to any one's practice. For though it car- 
ried off the fit, it very much weakened jue ; and 
I <had ffiequently convulsi^^js in ray nerves and 
limbs for some tirae« From benee I learned, 
that ^ing abroad in rainy wealher, especially 
vheo it was attended with itorms ana hurri- 
canes of wind, was most permcious to health. 
I had now beeo above nine months in the 
island ; and as I bad sever seen any of ^e hu- 
ipan kind, I ih»seSore accounted myself as sole 
BKttaidi i aoA as I grew better, having secured 
n^ Aete toti o n to my mind, I resolved to make 
a Umr foimd my kingdom, in order to make 
ijew discoveries. 

The J 5th July, I began ray journey ; I first 
went to the creek where I had brought my 
rafts ouvahore, and travelling farther, found 
the tide went no higher than two miles up, 
where tjhere was a little brook of running wa« 
ter, on the bank of whiek were many pleasant 
savannahs* or meadows, smooth, plain and co- 
vered with gmss. On the n^ing parts, wliere I 
eupposod the water did not reach, I prceived a 
great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong 



66 

««tal1cJ .'Scyer^i other pkftts I lilcewisc foiwiA, 
t^e \irtiie8 of wliich I did not ur)«kr8taiid. I 
«earched a long lime for the C^wsava root, wludi 
1 knew the Indians In that climate uaede their 
brpad of; lint ail in vain. There were several 
jplants of aloes, though at that ti^e I knew not 
what they* were : lifceWise I saw $jeveral sngai- 
,cane!,s, but iyn()!effect for wan4 of cultivation. 
With these jew discoveries, I came back that 
,nigbt,, an4 slept contentedly in nay littte castle. 

The next day, being the 16th, going the 
.same way, but fartlier than the day before, I 
found the country f.iore adorned with wo<^ 
«!nd trees. Here I perceived different fruits in 
great abundance. Melons in plenty lay on the 
ground, aud cliusters of grapes, ripe and very 
rjch spread over the trecs« You may imagine 
1 was gl^ pf this discovery, yet ate very spar- 
ingly? lest I should^throw myself ipto a fliix or 
fever. The grapeg I found of excellent ufee ; 
ior when I dried thejn in the sun, i«biph f>re. 
jierved them as dried raisins are kepf, ip^y 
pj^pve4 y,ery wholesome and iiourishing, and 
served me in those seasons when no g^pcs were 
to be h^d. 

The night drawing on apace, I ascended a 
tree, land slept very comfortably, ihongh it wa$ 
the first tipi(§ 1 hiid slept put of my habitation* 
And when thepapfning came, T proceeded with 
gri'at pleasure on my way, travelling about four 
miles, as I imagined, by the length of the val- 
ley. At the end of tliis valley, I came to ai^ 
ppcfj^ng, where the country seamed to 4e8C^i)4 



b> (h4 vilest ;' (here I foiiVrf a* spring of fiTesft 
water, pr<yceeding out of the side of the hill, 
with ifc* crystal strearasr fubning directly east. — 
And indeed hefe my sensfes were charnled with 
the most beautiful Ifi^dscap^ nature coidd af« 
ford ; for the couri tty Etpii^aVed sa fburishin^/ 
green and delightful, that to mre it seemed lik6 
a planted garden. I theiir descended on the 
side of that delicious vale; \^hen I found abun- 
dance of cocoa, orange, lemon, iCftd citroti treesy 
but very wild and barren at that time. As for 
the Hmes^ they were delightful and wholesome^ 
fl^ juic6 of which I afterwards used to mix in 
water> which made it very cool and refreshing. 
And now I was resolved to carry home and lay 
up a store of gi'apesi limes and lemons, agaiusfc 
the approaching wet season. So layiffg them 
up in separate parcels, and theil takiirg sL few of 
each With me, I jfeturned to my little dastle^ 
after having spent three days in this joUrney. 
Before I got home, the grapes were so bruised 
that they /Were utterly spoiled: the limes in- 
^bed were good, but of those f cduld brings 
only a few. 

July 19. Having pf spared two feags, t return* 
«d thither again, but io my great surprise, found 
ail the grapes spread about, trodden to pieces, 
and abundance eaten^ which made me conclude 
♦here were wild bed^ts therefthouts. To pref- 
vent this happening again, T g3.thered a large 
quantity of the grapes, and hiing them upon 
ihc out branches of the tree, both to keep them 



.58 

uahmi, aai thq^t liiey miglii cnre aud irj. in 
the son : and having well loaded myself with 
limes and lemons, I returned once more to mj 
old place ot residence. 

And now, r^ectlng on the fruitfiilness of 
tLis vailley, the pleasantness of ii« situation, iti 
security from storms, and the delightdtiness of 
the adjacent woods, I concluded I was settled 
in the worst part of -the country, and therefore 
was thinking to remove my habitatioir. 

But when I considered again, that though it 
was pleasant, it was off from the sea-side, wnere 
there was^ a possibility, some time or othe|||ik 
ship might either be driven or sail by : and mat 
to inclose myself among hi*ls and woods must 
certainly put an end to my hopes of deliverance; 
I resolved to let my castle remain wheie Pro- 
vidence had first placed it. Yet, so delighted 
w^ 1 with ttfis place, that t made mo a little 
kind of bower, surrounding it, with a double 
hedge as high as I could reach, well stidced and 
filled with bulrushes : and having spent a great 
part of the month of July, I think it was the 
ist of August, before 1 began to enjoy my 
labour. 

Aug. 3. P^reeiving my grapes to be dry, I 
took them from the trees, and they proved ex^ 
€ellent gCK>d raisins of the sun ; tlie lae^ of 
>^ which 1 carried to my -cave ; and happy for i^ie 
J did so, by which 1 saved, the best part of my 
wiater Ibod. - 

Aug. 14. This day it began io rain; aad 
though I had made me a tent like tho oth^^ 
yet haying no shelter of a hill to keep me from 



6b 

storms, nor a cave behind me to rotioat ity, I 
was obliged to return to my old castfe^ the 
rain continued more or less every day, till the 
middle of October, and sometimes so violently 
that I could not stir out of my cave for several 
days. This season I foupd my family to in- 
crease ; for one of my cats that had run away 
"from me, and which i thought had been dead, 
returned about August^ with three kittens at , 
her heels,.. like herself; from these cats pro- 
ceeded such numbers, Uiat 1 was forced to kill 
and destroy them as i would do wild beasts or 
veunin. 

To the 26th of this month, I could not stir 
out, it rained incessantly : when beginning to 
want food, I was compelled to venture twice, 
the first of which times, 1 shot a goat, and af- 
terwards found a very large tortoise. The 
manner of regulating my food was thus : it 
bunch of raisins served me for my breakfast : 
a piece of goat's fleshy or turtle boiled for my 
dinner, and two or three turtle eggs for my sup- 
per. Whiie the ridn lasted, 1 daily worked two 
or throe hours at enlarging my cave, and by 
degrees worked it on towards one side of tiiie 
hilt, and made a. door w^y out, which came be- 
yond my fence or wall, and so i oarae in and 
out this way. But after i had done this, I was 
, troubled to see myself fhus exposed ; though I 
could not perceive* anything to fear, a goat being 
the biggest creature I had ^en upon this 
Island. 



60 

Se))l. So. Casting up the notches 6n tAf 
)YOst, ^tbey amounted to 365, I concluded ibi)» 
to be the anniversary of my labeling ; and there- 
fore humbly prosti'ating liayself 6ti the ffroundi 
confessing ray sins, ackno\^ledgihg God S tigh- 
teous judgment upon nie, and praying to him 
to have mercy upon me, through Jesus Christy 
I fasted for twelve hours till the going down of 
the sxm ; and then eatihg a biscuit and. & bubch 
of gra[)e8> laid me on & bed) and with gre^t 
comfort took my hight^s repose. Till this tirne^ 
though I had i^lwiays put A largter hotdh than 
brdinaiy for each saj>bath day, to my shaciB, ( 
bonfess it, I h&d sddom observed It In any dthei" 
way. My ink failing sOon after, I omitted in 
my daily memorandum^ things of an indifferent 
iiatufe^ and contented myself tc* Write down 
^ly the most I'emiu^kable events of my life. — 
jThe r&iny and dry seasons appeared now re- 
gular to me> arid exj^erience taught me how to 
provide for them t yet in one thing I am going 
to relate, my experience very much fledled me. 
You may call to mind, what I have mentioned 
of some barley and rice Which 1 had saved*; 
about thirty stalks 6f the fortnerj arid twenty 
of the latter ; and, at that time, the sun being 
in its southeirn position^ .^oing from pie, toge. 
ther with the rains, n^ade me (Jojielude it a very 
proper season to sow iti Accordingly I dug 
up a piece of grOund, with my wooden spade, 
and dividiDg it into Iwd parts, sowed about two 
thirds of my seeds, preserving by jwe a handful 
it>f eaei^. And happy ii w^ I did so; for no 



fains falling^, it Wa:s clioked up, and no^er tsf" 
peared above the earth till the wet season camef 
ctgain, and then part of it grew, as if H bad 
been newly sown. 

I was resolved still to make another trial ; 
and seeking for a raoUter piece of ground near 
my bower, I there sowed the rest of my seed 
in February, which, by having the rainy, 
months of March and April io water it, yielded 
a noble crop, and sprung up very pleasantly. I 
bad still saved part of the seed, not daring to 
tenture all ; and by the time I found out tho 
proper seasons to sow it in, and that I might 
expect every year two seed times and two har- 
vests, my stock amounted \q above half a peck 
of each sort of grain. 

No sooner were the rains over, but the stakes 
which I had cut from the trees, shot out like 
willows, the first year after lopping their heads. 
I was ignorant of the tree 1 cut them from f 
but Uiey grew so regularly beautiful, that they 
made a most lively appearance, and so flou' 
fished in throe years time, that 1 resolved to 
cut more of them; and these soon growing 
made a glorious fence, as afterwards 1 shall 
observe. 

And now I perceived that the seasons of the 
year might generally be divided, not into sum- 
mer and winter, as in Europe, but into wet and 
dry seasons, as in this manner : —

October 15, } Dry, sun running south 
February i^yof the line^ 4 months. 

The wet seasons would continue longer or 
shorter, as the wind continued or ceased to blow. 
But having found the ill consequences of being 
abroad in the rain, 1 took care before hand to 
ftimish myself with provisions : and during the 
^et months, sat within doors as much as pos« 
sible. At this time, I contrived to make many 
handy tilings that I wanted, though it cost me 
much labour and pains, before I could accom- 
plish them* The first I tried was to make a 
basket, but all the^twigs [ could get, proved so 
brittle, that t could not then perform it. It now 
proved of great use to me, that when a boy I 
took great delight in standing at a basket-ma- 
ker's, in the same town where my fothet lived, 
to view them at work : like other boys, being 
curious to see the manner of their working these 
things, and very officious to assist^ 1 perfectly 
learned the method of it, and wanted nothing 
but the tools. And it coming into my mind, 
that the twigs of that tree of whicd I made my 
stakes, might be as tough as a sallow willow, pr 
ctoiers growing in Ihigland, I resolved to mako, 
an experiment, and went the next day to my 
country seat, and Ifound sQOie fit for my turn ; 
and after cutting down a ^pumtity witii my 



63 

batchet, I dried them id my pale, and, when 
fit to work with, carried them to my cave, where 
I employed myself in making several sorts of 
baskets, insomuch that 1 could put in what- 
soever 1 pleased. It is true they^were not cle- 
verly made, yet they served my turn on all oc* 
casions. 

But still I wanted two necessary things. I 
had no cask to hold my liquor, except two, al- 
most full of rum, a few bottles of' an ordinary 
size, and some square case bottles ; neither had 
1 a pot to boil any thing in, only a large kettle 
unfit to roiike broth, or stew a bit of meat : t 
wanted likewise at the beginning of this dry 
season a tobacco-pipe ; but tor this 1 afterwards 
found an expedient. 

I kept myself employed in planting my se- 
cond row of stakes. But remembering that 
when I travelled up to the brook I had a mind 
to see the whole island, I now resumed my in- 
tention, and taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two 
biscuit cakes, a great bunch of raisins, with a 
laiiger quantity of powder and shot than usual, 
i began my journey, / Having passed the vale 
where my bower stood, i came within view of 
the sea lying to the west ; when, it being a 
clear day, 1 fairly descried land, extending from 
the W. to the S. W. about 10 or 15 leagues, 
as I concluded : but could not say whether it 
was an bland or a continent. Neither could I 
tell what this place might be : only thought it 
was part of America, and \Vhere t might have 
been io a miserable condition had I landed.-—

Again » i considered^ that if this was .the Spa^ 
r^ish coasts certainly, one tinae or tjie other, | 
i^hould see some ships pass by, and if it was 
noty then it must be tl>e ravage coa^^ between 
die Spanish country a^d Brazil, whic^ abounds 
with C3i)nib^js or man-ei^ters. 

As 1 proceeded forward, 1 found this side of 
^he island njuch more pleasant tbaQ mine ; the 
fields fr^^nt, ^dpraed with sweet flowers and 
verdaQt gr^'W, togi^tlier with several very ^ne 
woods, Therp were parrots in plenty, which 
made me ^ long for one to be i^y companion ; 
)mt it was with great dii&culty 1 could knock 
one down with my stick; and I )cept him at 
l^ome sQi^e years, before 1 pould g^t mm to pail 
me by my name. 

In the low grounds, I found vi^rious sorts of 
])ares and foxes, as I took them to be, but much 
jdiiTerent fron? those in Ei^gland. Several of 
these I lulled, but nevpr pite them ; neither in* 
deed had 1 ^ny occasion ; for abounding- with 
goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes^ 1 coi^ld defy 
p,ny market to furnish me a better table, in 
this journey, I did not travel above two m^Ies 
, ^ day, because 1 tpok.sever^ tigrns and wind:^ 
ings, to see wjjat dfscoverios I cpuld make, re- 
turning weary enough to the place ^bere I de- 
signed to rest all i4gh^, wbich w^h either in a 
^ tree, qr to a ))lace whi<rh 1 surrounded with 
stfikes, tl^at no wild creature plight suddenly 
surprize me. When 1 canie to the sea -shore, I 
Has amazed to see the splendor of it. its strand 
^as covered with s)iclls of the i^o4 b^£^i|ti(ul 



65 

fish, and constantly abounding witb inniunera* 
ble turtles, and fowls of many kinds, whicb I 
was ignorant of, except those called penguins. 
1 mi^bt bave shot as many as I pleased, but 
was sparing of my ammunition, rather choos-^ 
ing to kill a she- goat, which i did with much 
difficulty^ on accoupt of the flatness of the 
country. 

Now, though this journey produced th^ most 
pleading satisfaction, yet my habitation was so 
much to my liking, tliat 1 did not repine at my 
being seated on the worst part of the island. 
I continued mj journey, gravelling about 12.** 
miles further towards the east, where I set a 
gteat pile on the shore for a mark, concluding 
ibai my next journey should bring me to the 
other side of the island, east from my castle, 
and so round till I came to my post agmn. — 
As I had a constant view of the cotmtry, I 
thought! could not miss my way • but scarcely 
had I travelled three* miles, yrhen 1 descended 
into a very large valley, so surroundecl with 
hiUs covered with wocfd? that having no guide 
but the sun, and to add to my misfortune, the 
weather proving very hazy, 1 was obliged to 
return to my post by the sea side, and so back- 
wards the same way 1 caine. In this journey, 
ray dog surpiifed a kid, and wonld have killed 
ft, bad I npt prevented; him. As I had often 
been thinking w getting, a kid or.tw.e* and so 
raising a bteed of tame goats ix> sup^ me, 
after my amn9;^mtioll. wa^ spent. I't^ok tbls 
egportuBi^ ojf hegiflning.; and having .made 



00 



A collar for this litt^ cFeaturo, witb a siring 
made of rope yarn, I brought it to mv bower, 
and there inclosed aqd left him : and having 
spent a month in this }onmey, at length 1 re^ 
turned to my old habitation. 

Nobodv can doubt of my satis£a,ction, whei^ 
( returned to my little castle, and reposed my^ 
self in n^y hammock. After my journey I 
r^ted myjjelf a weelf, which tjme I euiploye<i 
in mailing a cage for n^y pretty poll. J now 
began to recollect the poor kid { had left ir^ 
the bower, and immediately went to fetch it 
home. When I came there, I found the younc 
(creature almost starved } T gave it siome fopa^ 
and tied it as before; but there was no occa- 
sion, for it followed me like a dog; and as \ 
constantly fed it, it became ^o loving, gentle, 
and fond, that it commenced one of mrdbn^dB.T 
tics, alnd would never leave me. 

The rainy season of the iautuninal equinox 
being now come, I kept tne 80th of §5eptem- 
ber, in the naost solemn nianner, aa usual, it 
being the second year of my abode in the island. 
I spent tike whole dtiy in acknowledging God's 
mercieti, In giving thanks for leaking this soli- 
^y life f^ agreeable, and less sinful, than that 
of hunian society ; and for ih^ communication 
of his ^ce to my soi(l, in supportii^g, comfoi^ 
ing, and eiioouraging me to depend upo^ his 
Providence, and hope for his eternal presence in 
the world tb cotiae. _ ^ ' 

Indeed, I often did consider how hinch more 
\isf^y 1 w^; in this s^te of life, than in that 



76 

m^aoDpr of livlngj I JFormerly used ; sometimes, 
however vhen Jiuating, or viewing the coi|»try, 
%\^e anguish of my soul would break out upon 
me^ and iny very heart would sink withm me, 
to think of the woods, the mountains^ the de- 
serts I was in; apd how I was a prisoner^ 
locked up within t^e eternal bars and bolts of 
the ocean, in an uninhabited country, without 
^ hope of escape. In this condition I would 
often wring my hands, and weep like a chjld ; 
and even sometimes in the middle of my work, 
this fit of melancholy ^ouid often take me; 
find then I would sit down and sigh, looking 
on the ground for e^n hour or two together till 
such time as my grief got vent in a flood ot 
tears. 

One ipomingi as I was fully employed in 
this manner, I ope^^d my Bible, and began to 
read that chapter iu which* God promises to 
Joshua, / will not fail thee nor forsake thee ! 
Surely, if Qod does uot forsake mo, what 
liiatters it, since he \!an luake me more happy 
iq this state of life, than if I enjoyed the great- 
est splepdour in the world ? And whenever I 
opened or shut the Bible, I blest kind Provi- 
dence, that directed my good friend in England 
to send it among my goods without my order,, 
and for^issisting me to save it from tl^e pQWer 
of the raging oceau. 

Aqd now beginning my thii-d year, my so- ' 
vera! daily employnaenis* were these: First, . 
^y duty to Heaven, and diligently reading th^ 
holy Scriptures, which I did twice or thiir 



6S 

«veiyday: Secondly, Seekioff provisions with 
my gun, which commonly took me up, when 
it did not rain, three hours every morning; 
Ihirdfyy The ordering, curing, preserving, and 
<x)oking what I had killed, or catched for my 
supply, which took me up a great part of the 
' day ; for in the middle of the day, the sun 
bemg at its height, it was so hot, that I could 
not stir out : so that I had hut four hours in 
Ae evenine to work in : and then from the want 
of tools, 01 assistance, and skill, spent a great 
deal of time to little purpose : I was no less 
than two and forty days, making a board fit 
for a long shelf, which two sawyers with their 
tools and saw.pit, would have cut out of the 
same tree in half a day. It was of a large tree, 
as my board was to be broad. I was tiiree 
days in cutting it down, and two more in lop- 
ping off the boughs, and reducing it to a piece 
of timber. Thus I hacked and hewed off each 
side, till it became light to move ; then 1 turned 
it^ made one side of it smo6th and l}at as a 
board from end to end, then turned it down- 
wards, cutting the other side, till I brought the 
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth 
on both sides. Any body may judge my great 
laboifr and fatigue in such a piece of work : 
but this I went through with patience, as also 
many other things, that my circumstances made 
Sttcdflsaiy for me to do. 

The harvest mon^s, November and Dccem- 
btr, weie now at han4» in which I had the 
pl#aring prospect of a very good crop. Btti 



«9 

fcere I met w:itii a new misfarttme^ for the gloats 
iBind hares, having tested of the sweetness of 
the blade, kept it so short, that it had no 
strent^h to shoot up into a stalk. To prev«»nt 
(his, I enclosed it with a hedge, and by day 
sliot sotbe of its devourers ; And my dog, which 
I had tied to the Held gate, keeping barking 
all nigLt, so frightened these creatures, that i 
goi^niirely rid of thena^ 

But, a6 sooner did I g€tt rid of these, than 
other enemies appeared, to wit whole flocks of 
sev^rd sorts t)f birds, who only waited till my 
back was turned to ruin me. So much did 
this pravoke me, tha4; I let fly. and killed three 
of the malefeietors.; and afterwards ^rved them 
as they do notorious thieves in England and 
Ireland, hung them up in chains as a terror 
to others. And indeed, so good a^ e0ect had 
this, tbfl^ they not only forsook the com, but 
all that part of the island, so )|iag as these 
crlrainah hung there. 

My com having ripened apace, the latter 
end of December, which Was my second har- 
vest, J reaped it with a scythe made of one of my 
broad swords. I had no fatigue in cutting down 
my first crop, it was so slender,. The cars I 
carried home in ^ basinet, rubbing the grain out 
witii my hands, instead of threshing it; and 
when my harvest was over, found my half.peck 
pi seed had produced nearly two bushels of 
rice, and two buiihels and a half of barley. — 
And now I plainly foresaw, that by God's good- 
ll^*^ I sijiould be furnished with bread ^ b<'^ 






JO 

yet I was concerned because I knew not how 
io grind or make meal, of my com, neither 
1(new I how to bake it into bread. I would 
not, however, taste any of the erop^ but re- 
solved to preserve it against next season, and in 
the mean whitj^, use my best endeavours to 
provide myself with other food* 

vBut where were my labours' to end? the. 
want of a ploug)i to turn up the earUi^ or shovel 
to dig it, I conquered by making mo a wooden 
^ade. l^he want of a harrow I supplied by 
draggbg over the com a great bough of a tre^. 
When it was growing, I was forced to fence it ; 
when ripe, to mow it, carry it home, thresh it, 
part it from the chaff, and save it. And, after 
all, I wanted a mill to grind it,^ & sieve to dress 
it, yea^ and salt to make it into bread,, and an 
oven to bake it. This set my brains to work^ 
to find some expedient for eveiy one of these 
necessaries, a^oinst the next harvest. 

And now having more see4> my first care was 
to prepare me moreMand. I pitched upon two 
large flat pieces of ground, near my castle, for 
that purpose, in which I sowed mj seed, an4 
;£encea it with a good hedg^* This took me up 
three months ; by which time the wet season 
coming on, and the rain keeping me vdthin 
doors, I found several occasions employ my- 
self; and while at work, used to divert myself 
with talking to my parrot, teaching him to 
know and speak his owu Dame PqU : U^e fir^ 
«velcome word I had ever heard spoken in tb^ 



'I 

Uland, I had been a long time contriving Iiovir 
to make earthen vessels, which I wanted e:^- 
tremely ; and when I considered the heat of the 
climate, I did not doubt but, if I could find 
any such clay, 1 might botch up a pot, strong 
enough, when dried in the sun, to bear handling, 
and to hold any thing that was dry, such as 
com, meal, and other things. 

*To be short, the clay, I found ; but it would 
occasion the most serious person to smile, to 
see what awkward ways I took, and what ugly 
misshapen things I made; how many either 
fell out or cracked, by the violent heat of th© 
sun, and fell in pieces when they were removed, 
so that I think it wa$ two months before I 
could perfect any thing ; .and even then, but 
two clum^ things in imitation of earthen jars ! 
These. hoW^ver, I very gently placed in wicket 
baskets, made on purpc»e ibr them, and be- 
tween the pot and the baskets, stuffed it Ml 
qi rice and barley straw; i^d thead I pre- 
sumed would hold my dried com, and per* 
haps the meal, when- the oom was bruised* 
As for the smaller things, I made them with 
better success; such as Uttle round pots, flat 
dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, the sun baking 
them very hard. 

Yet still I wanted one thing absolutely ne- 
cessary, and that was an earthen pot, not only 
to hold myli^d, but also to bear the fire^ 
which none of these could do. It once hap- 
pened, that as I was ptitting out my fire, I 
iouM thecein a broken picce^ of one of my 



tj^h burnt hard as a rook, and ited as a tXcr 
tbis made me think of burning some pots ;• 
and having no notion of a kiln, or of gfazingr 
Ihem- with lead, I fixed three large pipkins, and 
two* or three pots in a pSe one upon- another. 
The tire I piled round the outside, and dry 
wood o» the top, till I saw the pot» in the- 
inside red-hot, and found that tliey did not 
crack at all ; and when I perceived diem per- 
fectly red, I let thera stfend in the fife five or- 
six hours, till the clay melted by the Extremity 
<^ the heat, and would have run to glass hacb 
I suffered It : upon which, I slaclied my fire^ 
by degrees, till uie redness abated y and watch*, 
ing them tUl the morning, 1 found 1 had threes 
verv good pipkins, aud two earthen pots, aa- 
well burnt and fit for my turn as I could desire.- 

The fifst use to which I turned my pipkins^ 
vaa tor make some salt, which I had long 
wanted. For this purpose, I filled them with 
sea-watei^ and kept it slowly boiling overthi^ 
fiup©, till the whole of the water iiad boiled 
away i^ steam,, leaving ut the bottom of the 
Tassel,. » thm^ crust of salt which^ I found 
very good for giving a relish to my foodw 

The next concern I had,- was to get me a- 
stone-mortar to beat some corn in instead of 
a mill to grind it Here, indeed, 1 was at a 
great losa^ aenot being fit for a stone-cutter r- 
and many. days- I spent to find out a great 
stone big enough to cut boUow and. make it^ 
tit. for a mortar, ai^ strong enou^ to bear the. 
•?igh( of a pasite, that would l>reak the foms 



73 

without Gllinv it with sand. But all the stones 
of the island being of a mouldering nature^ 
rendered my search fruitless ; and then I re- 
solved to look out for a great block of hard 
wood ; which having found, I formed it with my 
axe and hammer, and then, with infinite labour, 
made a hollow in it, just as the Indians of 
Brazil make their canoes. When I had finished 
this, I made a great pestle of iron-wood, and 
then laid them up against my succeeding 
harvest. 

My next business was to make ma a sieve, 
to siA my meal and part it from the bran and 
hfisk. Having no fine thin canvass to search 
tho nieal through, I could not tell what to do^ 
What linen I had was reduced to rags : 1 had 
poat's liair enough, but neither tools to work it, 
nor did I know how to spin it. At length, 1 
n^memhercd T had some neck-cloths of calico 
or muslin, of the sailors, which I had brought 
out of tho ship, and with these, I made thSreo 
small sieves proper enough for the work. 

I come now to consider the baking part. — 
The want of an oven I supplied, by making 
jTonie earthen pans, very broad, hut not deep 
^yhen I jiad a mind to bake, I made a great 
fire upon ray hearth, tho tiles of which, 1 had 
made myself, and when the wood was burnt 
into live coals, 1 spread them over it,' till it be- 
came very hot : then sweeping them away,' J 
set down my loaves, and whelmiAg down the 
earthen pots upon them, drew the ashes and 
coaU all round the oirtside of tlie pots i<J 



74 

continue tbe heat ; and in this manner, I baked 
my barley loaves, as well as if I had been a 
complete pastry .cook, and also made of the 
rice^ several cakes and puddings. 

It is no wonder that all these things look me 
up tbe best part of the -year, since what inter- 
mediate time i had, was bestowed in managing 
my new harvest and husbandry ; for hi the 
proper season, I reaped my com, carried it 
Lome and laid it up in the ear, in my large bas« 
kets, till I had time to rub, instead of threshing 
it. And now indeed, my corn encreased so 
much, that it produced me twenty bushels of 
barley, and as ijitrch of rice, so th^t I not only 
began to use it freely, but was thinking how to 
enlarge my barns, and resolved to sow as much 
at a time as would be sufficient for a whole 
year. 

All this while, the prospect of land, which I 
had seen from Die other side of the island, ran 
in my mind. 1 still meditated a deliverance 
from this place, though the fear of greater mis- 
fortunes might have deterred me from it. For, 
allowing that I had attained that place, I ran 
the hazard of being killed and eaten by the de- 
vottfing cannibals; and if they were not so, 
vet I might be slain, as other Europeans had 
been, who fell into their hands. Notwith- 
standing all this, my thoughts ran continually 
upon tliat shore. 1 now wished for the long 
boat with the shoulder of mutton sail. I went 
to the shin's boat, that had been cast a great 
way on the shore in the late storm. She. was 



75 

femovcd but a little ; but h«r bottom bein^ 
tumed up by the impetuosity and surge of the 
waves and wind, I tell to work with all tho 
stt^ngth 1 had, and with levers and rollers 
which I had cut from the wood, to turn her, and 
repair the damages she had sustained* Thi» 
work took' me up three or four weeks, when 
finding my little strength all in vain, I fell to 
undermining it, by digging away the sand, and 
so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood 
to thrust and guide it in the fall. But after 
this was done, I was still unable to slir it up^ 
or to get under it, much less to move it for. 
wards towariis the water, and so i was forced 
to give it over. 

This disappointment, however, ' did not 
frighten roe. J began to think, whether it was 
not possible for me to make a canoe or Perigua, 
such as the Indians make of tlie tmnk of a 
tree. But here I lay under particular inconve' 
nienccs ; want of tools to make it, and want of 
hands to move it into tl>e water when it wa» 
made. However to work I went upon it, stop- 
ping all the inquiries i could make, with this^ 
lery simple answer E made to myself, let's first 
make it, 111 warrant I'll find some way or other 
to get it along when it is done. 

1 first cut down a cedar- tree, which wa^.five^ 
feet ten inches diameter at the lower ^part next 
the stump, and four feet' eleven incites diameter 
at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it 
lessened for a spaee« and then parted into 
blanches. Twenty days was I hacking, axki 



hewing it at flie bottom, fourteen mote in oui- 
ting on the branches and limbs, and -a whole 
month in shaping it like the bottom of a boat J 
As for the inside, I was three weeks withri 
mallet and chisel, clearing it in such a manner 
as that it was big enough to carry 26 men, 
muc)l bigger than any canoo I ever saw ih' my 
life, and consequently sufficient to transport 
me and all my effects to that wished for shore, 
I so ardently desired, . 

Nothing remained now, but, indeed, ihe 
greatest difficulty, to get it into the water, it 
mng about 100 yards from it. To remedy the 
^ first inconvenience, which was a rir^ing hiJl bf ^ 
tween this boat and the creek, with wonderful 
pains and labour I dug into lie surface of tho 
earth, and made a declivity. But when thi« 
Was done, all tho strength i had was as insuf- 
ficient to move it, as it was when t first mado 
the attempt. I then proceeded to measure the 
distance of ground, resolving to make a caaa., 
in order to bring the water to the canoe, »\iice ( 
could not bring the canoe to tlie water. Brt 
as this seemed to be impracticable by n)ysc]f 
alone, under the space of eleven or twt-^lve yenr% 
it brought me into>3orae sort of c^^nsideiv^tion ; ' 
so that 1 concluded this also to be impossibb , 
and the attempt vain. I now saw, and not bt- 
fore, what stupidity it is to' begin work bctW-e- 
we reckon its cost, or judge rightly our ovvu 
abilities to go through with its performance. 
J In the height of this work, my fourth yenr 
e^cptVed from the time 1 was ca^it on this isiaud^ 



77 

At this time ? did not forget ity anniTersarj:, 
but kept it with rather greater devotion than 
before. For now mj hopes being frustrated, 1 
looked upon this world as a thing 1 had nothing 
to do With ; and very well might I say, as fa^ 
tber Abraham said> unto Dives, Between me 
and thee there is a gulph ^fixed. And indeed 
i was separated from its wickedness too, having 
neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the 
eye, nor the pride of life ; I had nothing to co. 
vet, being lord, king and emperor over Xhm 
whole country i had in possession, without dis«. 
pute and without controul ; 1 had loadings of 
com, plenty of turtles, timber in abundance, 
and grapes above n^easure. What was all the 
rest to me? the money I had, lay by me as 
despicable dross, which I would freely have 
given for a gross of tobacco pipes, or a hand- 
mill to grind my com ; in a virc»rd, the nature 
and experience of these things dictated to me 
this just reflection ; that the good things of 
this world are no fiirthcr good to us, than as 
ihey a|e for our use ; and that whatever we 
may heap up,^ we can bat enjoy as mucb ^ we 
use, and no more. 

'J'hese thoughts rendered my mind more easy ' 
than usual. Every time I sat down to meat, I 
did it with thankfulness, admiring the provi- 
dential hand of God, who in this wilderness 
had spread a table to me. And now I consi; 
dered what I enjoyed, rather than what I want- 
ed ; compared my present condition with what 
1 at fiist expected it should be; how I should 

r3 



78 

hme doBe, if 1 had got nothing out of the ship; 
that i must iiave perished before i had caught 
tiiih or turtieh ; or lived, had I found them, like 
a mere savage^ by eating them raw, and pulling 
them to pieces with my claws, like a l)east. — 
{ next compared my station to that which I 
deserved; how undutiful I had been to my pa- 
rents; how destitute of the fear of God; how 
' void of every thing- that was good ; and how 
ungrateful for those &bundA.nt mercies I had 
received from heaven, being fed, as it were, by 
a miracle, even as great Elijah was fed by 
ravens; acid oast on a place where ^ere are no 
venomous creatures to poison or devour me ; ii^ 
abort, making God's tender mercies matter of 
great consolation^ I relin(]^isbed ail sadness, 
and gave way to conientment. 

As long as my ink continued, which with 
water I made last as long as 1 could, 'I used to 
minute dowi) the days of the month on which 
uny remarkable tUng happened* 

The next thing that wasted after my ink, 
was the biscuit, which 1 hcid brought out of 
the ship ; and though J allowed myself Hut one 
cake a day for above a twelvemonth, yet I was 
quite out of bread for nearly a year, befoee I 
got any com of my own. 

iq the next place my clothes began to de- 
cay, and ray linen had bean gone long before. 
However, i had preserved about three dozen 
of the sailors' chequered shirts, which proved 
a great refreshment to me, when the violent 
*^satQs of the sui) vyould not sulfer me to bear 



79 

laxiy^ of the seamen's lieavy watefa-coats ; which 
made me turn tailor, and, alter a luiserablQ 
^>otching nmnner, oonvert them into jackets. To 
preserve my head, I made a, cap of goat-skins, 
vrith the -hair outwards to keep out the rain ; 
which indeed served me so well, that afterwards 
I made a waistcoat and open kneed breeches 
iOf the same^ And then 1 contriv«d a s<Mrtof 
umbrella, covering it with skins, which »<it 
only kept out the heat of the sun, but the rain 
-also. Tnus being easy and settled in my mind« 
my chief happiness was to converse with God, 
In the most heavenly and comfortable ejacula-^ 
tions. 

For five years «fter tlus, I eannot say any- 
extraordinary thing occurred to me* My chief 
employment was to cure ray raisins, and plant 
my barley and rice, of both which I had a 
■y ear's provision before hand. But though I 
. WBS dissappointed in my first canoe, I made it 
at intermediate times, my business to make a 
second of much inferior size ; and it was two 
years before i had finished it. But as I per- 
ceived it would in no wise answer my design of 
sailing to the other shore, my thoughts were 
oon^ned to take a tour round the island, to see 
what further discoveries i could make. To 
this intent, after having moved her to the water , 
aqd tried how she would «sail, I fitted up a 
little ma^t to my boat, and made a sail of the 
»bip*s sails that lay by me, I then made lockers 
or bexes at the end df U, to put in necessaries 

£ 4 



8a 

provBion and amrnunltlon^ which would pre* 
Mfve them dry either from the rain, or the 

?ray ot the«ea ; and in the inside of the boat, 
out me a loBg hollow place to lay my gun, 
and to keep it dry, made a cover for it. My 
umbrella, 1 fixed in a step in the stem, like a 
mast, to keep off the heat of the sun. And 
now resolving to see th6 circumference-of my 
litUe kingdom^ I victualled my ship for the 
▼pyage, putting in two dozen of my barley 
hiread loaves, an earthen pot. foil of parched 
rice, a little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder 
and shqt, and tWo watch-coats, it was the .6th 
of November, in the 6th year of my reign, or 
captivity, that I set out on this voyage ; which 
waa much longer thaaj expected, being obliged 
to put £»rther out, by reason of the rocks uiat 
lay a ffreaiway in the sea. 

And indeed, se much did these rocks sur- 
prise me, thai! was for putting back, fearing 
that if i ventured far&er, it would be out of 
my pow^ to retutn ; in this uncertainty I 'came 
to anchor just off ihe shore, to*which i waded 
with my gun on my shoulder, and then climb- 
ing up a hillr which overlooked that point, I 
saw the foil extent of it, and so resolved to run 
all hazards. . 

Jo this prospect from Uie hiU, I perceived a 
violent current running to the east, coming" very 
eleie to the point ; which 1 the more carefolly 
observed, thinking it dangerous, and that when 
2 Mina id it, I mi|^t be driven into the tea by 



Si 



its ibrce, and not able to return to the idat>d ; 
and certainly it must have been so, bad 1 not 
made tbis observation; for on tbe otber side 
was tbe like current, witb tbi» difference, tbat 
it set off^at a greater distance ; and I perceived 
tbere was a strong eddy under the land : so 
that my chief business was to work out of tbe 
lirst current, and conveniently get into tbe eddy. 
Two days i staid here, the wind blowing very ' 
briskly E. S. E. which being contrary to tlie 
cuxniit, leaves a great breach of the sea upqt} 
tbe ])oint ; so it was neither fit for me to keep 
too near the sbore, on account of the breach ; 
nor stand at too great a distance for fear of the 
Ktxeams. That night the wind abating, it grew 
so calm, tbat i ventured out; and here 1 may 
be a monument to all ^ash and ignorant pilots ; 
lor I was no sooner come to the point, and not 
above the boat's length from shore, but i was 
got into a deep water, with a current like a 
mill-race, which drove my boat along so vio- 
lently, that it was impossible for me to keep 
near the edge of it, being forced more and 
more out from the eddy to the left of me ; and 
all i could do with my paddles was useless, 
there being no wind to help me. 

Now 1 began to look upon myself as quite 
lost, since as the current ran on both sides of 
the island, 1 was very certain they omst join 
again, and then I had no Slopes butjof perish- 
ing for want m the sea, after what provision I 

s S 



83 

^ftd wai spent, or bqforc, if a storm sliould 
happen to arise. 

VVho can conceive the present angpish of my 
mind at this calamity ? with longing eyes did 
1 look upon my little kingdom, and thought the 
isUnd the ^leasantest place in the universe. — 
Happy, thrice happy desert, said I, shall I 
never see tiiee more? Wretched creature I 
whither am I going ? Why did I murmur 
at my lonesome condition, when now I would 
give the whole world to be thither again ? 
While J was thus complaining, I found myself 
to be driven about two leagues into the sea : 
howeyei', J laboured till my strength was far 
spent, to keep my boat as far north as pos- 
sibly I could, to that side of the current, where 
the eddy lay. About nqon I perceived a lit» 
tie breeze of wind spring up from the S. S. E* 
wl^ic)^ overjoyed my heart ; aud was still more 
elated, when ^n about half an hour, it blew 
^ gentle finie gale. Had any thick weather 

sprttn{9 ^P' 1 ^^^ ^^^ '^^ another way ; for 
having ^o compass on board, I should never 
have found the way to' steer tows^rds the island, 
if once it had disappeared ; but it proving, 
^he contrary, I set ]up my mast agaiu> spreaj 
my sail, and stood away northward, as much 
as I could, to get rid of the current. And 
no sooner did the boat begin to stretch away, 
but I perceived, by the clearness of the water,^ 
a change of the current was near ; fo^, wher^ 
it was strong, the water was foul ; and whexQt 
it was qUwc, the current i^boited. 



TkM# ¥^lio %ave been in the like calamities 
vfkih my own, may guess my present excess of 
joy, how heartily 1 ra:^ my boat in the stream 
of this eddy, and how joyfully I spread my 
sail to the refreshing wind, standing cheerfully 
before it, with a smart tide under foot.- By the 
assistance of this eddy, I was cairied above a 
league home again, when being in the wake of 
the island, between the two currents, I found 
the water to be in a sort of stand. About 
four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within 
a league oi the island, and perceived the 
points of the rock, which caused this disaster, 
stretching out, as I observed before, to the 
southward, which throwing off the current 
more southerly, had occasioned aaothei'edd/ 
to the north. But having a fajr brisk gale, 
I stretched across this eddy, and in an hour 
came w;itlun a i^ile of the shore;, where I soon 
landed, to my unspeakable comfort | and af- 
ter laa humble prostration, thanking God for 
my -deliverance, with a resolution to lay all 
thoughts of esci^ing aside, I brought my boat 
safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take 
a welcome repose. When I awoke, I was 
considering how I might get my boat home ; 
and coasting along the shore, I came to a good 
bay, which ran up to a rivulet or brook, where, 
finding a harbour, I stowed her as safe as ' 
if ;ihe had been in a dry dock, made on pur- 
pose for her. 

I now perceived myself not far from the 
^lace, whece before I had travoUed on foot ; so 



l: 



m 

iAiug fiQihwg with me, except my giuMMid am- 
ttelia, I began ray jourDey^ aud in the even- 
ing came to my bower, where I again laid me 
«town to rest. 1 had not slept long before [ 
wakened in great surprize, by'a strange voice 
ikat called me several times, Rodin, Robut^ 
Robinson Cf%coe, poor Robin / Where are 
you, Robinson Crusoe 7 Whete are you f 
Where have you been ? 

80 fast waji T asleep, that at first I d|d not 
wake thoroughly ; hut half asleep and half, 
awake, I thought I dreamed that somebody 
spoke to me. But as the voice repeated, Ro" 
hinson Crusoe, several times, being- terribly 
fti^htcned, I started up in the utmost infusion ; 
and, no 80<)ner were my eyes fully open, but I 
bebeU vaj prulty Poll sitting on the top oi the 
kedge, and soon knew that it was he that called 
ne ; for just in such bewailing language, I 
used to talk and teacl^ him ; which he so exact-

and such like prattle I had . constfintly taught 
him. But even though I knew it tp be the 
parrot, it was a long time before I could>ad- 
just myself; being amazed how the. creature 
got thither, and that he should J^ abo^t that 
place, and no where else. But now, being 
assured it could be no other than my honest 
PoU^ vt^j wonder ceased, and reaching out ray 
hand, and ealling Poll, the creature c^e to 



as 

ta^ femiliarly, and perched uj^on my thutuh, 
as he was woDt, constantly praliug to me with 
Poor Robimon Crusoe, and how did I come 
here] and where had I been ? as if the bird 
was overjoyed to see me ; and so I took him 
home along with me, 1 was now pretty well 
cured of rambling to sea; yet I could wish 
ITiy boat which had cost me so much trouble 
Siid pains, on thisr side of the island once more, 
but this, indeed, was impracticable. I there- 
fore began to lead a very retired life, living 
nearly a twelvemonth in a very contented man- 
ner, M'anting for nothing but conversation. — 
As to mechanic labours, wbich my neces&i* 
ties obliged me to, 1 fancied I could, upon oc« 
ifasion, maJce a tolerable carpenter, were th« 
poor tools I had to work withal, but good.— 
Besides, as I improved in my earthen ware, I 
contrived to make them with a wheel, which I 
found much easier, and better, making my work 
shapely, which beiore was rude arid ugly. — 
But, I think I never wa& »o elevated with my 
own performance or pioject, as when able to 
make a tobacco pipe, which though it proved 
an awkward clumsy thing, yet it was very 
9C^d, and carried the -smoke perfectly well, 
to my great satisfaction. 

I also improved my wicker ware, made me 
abundance of necessary baskets, which, though 
not very handsome, were very handy and con- 
venient to fetch tilings home in, as also for 
holding my storw, barley^ rice, and other pro- 
tisions. 



9w 



My powder beginning to £ftiT, niad« m* 
examine after what manner I should kill the 
^oBiA or birds, to live on, after it was all gone. 
Upon which^ I contrived, many ways to ensnare 
the goats, and see if I could catch them alive, 
particularly a she-goat with young. 

At last I had my desire; for making pit- 
falls and traps, baited with barley and rice, I 
found one morning in one of them, an old he- 
goat, aiid in the pther^ three kids, one male, 
the other two, females. 

So boisterous was the old one, thai I could 
not bring, him away. But I forgot the old 
proverb, Thai hunger will tame a lion : For, 
had I kept him three or four days without pro. 
visions, and then given him some water, with 
a little com, he would have been as tame as a 
young kid. The other creatures I bound with 
strings together; but I had great difficulty be- 
fore Icaiild bring them to my habitation. It 
M^as some -time before they would feed ; but 
throwing them sweet com, it so much tempted 
them, that they began to be tamer. Froei 
hence I concluded, that if I designed to furnish 
myself with goat's ftesh, when my anununitio^ 
was spent, the tamely breeding them up, lik^ 
a flock of sheep, about my settlement, was the 
only meUiod 1 could take. I concluded alsq 
I must separate the wild from the tame, ot 
else they would always run wild as ^ey 
grew up ; and the best way for this, W9^ to 
have 6ome enclosed piece of groMnd, well 
lenced; either with a tkedge or pale, to keep 



«7 

them so eSiectually, tliat those within might 
not l-reak out, nor those without break in. — 
^^uch an undertaking was very great for one 
pair of hands; b«t as there was an absolute 
necessity for doing it, my first care was to find 
a convenient piece of ground, where there was 
hkely to be herbage for them to eat, water to 
drink, and cover to keep them from tlie sun. 

Here again, ] gave another instance of my 
ignorance and inexperience, pitching upon a 
piece of meadow-land so large, that had I 
enclosed it, the hedge or pale must have been 
at least two miles about. This thought came 
iuto my head, after I had carried it on, I be- 
lieve, about fii'ty yards ; 1 therefore altered my 
scheme, and resolved to enclose a piece of 
ground, about 130 yards in length, and 100 in 
breadth, large enough for as many as vrould 
maintain me« till such time as my fiock in- 
creased, and then I could add more ground. 
1 now vigorously prosecuted my vjrork, and it 
X4X>k me About three months in hedging the 
iirst j)ieee ; in which time, I tethered the three 
kids in the best part oi it; feeding them ag 
near me as possible, to make ]them familiar ; 
^nd, indeed, 1 very often would carr^ some 
cars of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed 
ihem out of my hand , by which they grew 
*o tame, that when my enclosure was finished, 
^nd I had let them loose, they would run 
^fter me for a handful of com. This indeed 
i^nswered my end ; and in a year and a hslV($ 
ime, I had a figck of about twelve caats» 



88 

Bds and all ; and in two year* after, ihcy 
amounted to iorty- three, besides what I liad 
killed for my sustenance. 

After which, 1 inclosed fiva several pieces of 
ground to feed them in, with pens to drive them 
into> tliat I might take them a^ 1 had occasion. 

Id this project I likewise found additional 
blessings ; for I not only had plenty of goat's 
flesh, but milk too, which in the beginning, I 
did not so much as tliink of. And, indeeu, 
though I had never milked a cow, much less a 
goat, or soenr butter or cheese made, yet after 
some essays and miscarriages, 1 made me both, 
and never afterwards wanted. 

How metcifully can the Almighty comfort 
Lis crcatuias, even in the midst of their greatest 
calamities ? How can he sweeten the bitterest 
oviis, and give us reason to magnify him in dun- 
geons and prisons ; what a bounteous table wa^ 
here spread in a wilderness for mc, where I ex- 
pected nothing at iirst, but to peri.-di for hunger. 

Certainly any one would have smiled to see 
me «t dinner. There sat my royal majesty, an 
absolute prince and ruler of my kingdom, at- 
tended by my dutiful subjects, whom, if I 
ple&sed, I could either punish or reward, give 
them liberty or take it away. When I dined, 
I seemed a king, eating alone, none daring to 
presume to do so till I had done. Poll, &s if he 
Bad been my principal court favourite, was the 
only person permitted to talk with me. My old 
but faithful dog, now grown exceedingly crazy, 
continually sat on my riglit handj while my 



81) 

two calK sai on each side of the table, expect, 
iiig a bit from my band, as a principal mark of 
my royal favour. These wtr^ not tlje cats I 
had brought from the ship ; they bad been dead 
long before, and interred near my habitatiun by 
mbe own hand. But a couple of their young X 
had n»ade tame ; the rest ran wild into the woods, 
and in time grew so impudent, as to return and 
plunder me of my stores, till sucb time as I sbot 
a great many, and the rest left me witbout troub- 
liiig me any more. In tbis plentiiul manner did 
I live, wanting for nothing but conversation. — 
One thing indeed concerned me, the want ot my 
boat ; 1 knew not which way to get her round tbe 
island. One time 1 resolved to go along the shore 
by land to her; but had any one at home met 
kucb a figure, it would either have affrighted tb^m 
or made them burst into laughter ; nay, I could 
not but smile myself at my habit, which I think 
in this place it wiU be very proper to describe. 
The cap 1 wore upon my head, was great, 
high, and shapeless, made of a goat's skin, with 
a Bap or pent-house hanging down behind, not 
only to keep the sun trom me, but to shoot tbe 
rain off from running into my. neck, nothing 
being more pernicious than the rain falling upon 
the jElcsh m these climates. I had a short jacket 
of goat's skin, whose hair hung down such a 
length on e^ch side, that it reached down to 
the cakes of my legs.- As for shoes and stock- 
ings, I had none, but made a resemblance of 
something, I know not what to call them ; they 
wera made like buskinsi and, Uced on the side 



00 

I 

i 

like gpattcrdaslies; b&rbarously shaped, like ilie 
rest of my habit. I had a broad belt of goat's 
skin dried, girt Vound me with a couple of tbongSM 
instead of buckles ; on each of whieh, to sup. 
ply the deficiency of sword and dagger, hung 
my hatchet and «aw. I had another belt not 
80 broad, yet fastened in the same manner, which 
hung over my shoulder, and at the end of it^ 
under my left arm, hung two pouches made 04. 
goat's skin, to h6ld my powder and shot My , 
basket, I carried on my back, and my gun on 
my shoulder; and over my head, a great clum" 
6y ugly goafs skin umbrella, which, however, 
next to my gun, was the most necessary thing 
about me. As for my face, the colour was not 
so swarthy as the Mulattoes, • or as might have 
been expected from one who took so littie care 
of it, in a climate within nine, or ten degrees of 
the Ldne. At one time, my be^d grew so long 
that it hung down above a quarter of a yard ; 
but as 1 had both razors and scissars in store, I 
cut it all otf, and suffered none to grow, except 
a large pair of whiskers, the like of which I had 
seen worn by some Turks at Salee, not long 
enough indeed to hang a hat upon, but of such 
a monstrous size, as completely to alter my ap* 
pearance. 

But all this was of no eonse4|uenee here, ther« 
being none to observe my behaviour or habit. 
And so, without fear and without controwl, I 
proceeded oti my journey, the prosecution of 
which took me up five or six days. I travelled 
along the sea shore* directly to the place wher» 



91 

I first broiigljt my boat to an anchor, to got 
upon the rockt; but now having no boat to 
take care of, I went over- land, a nearer way to 
the same height that I was before upon ; when 
looking forward to the point of the rock, which 
lay out, and which F was forced to double with 
Vfy boat, I was aniazed to see the sea so smooth 
and quiet, there being no rippling motion, nor 
cunent, any more than in other places. And 
now I was convinced, that by observing the 
ebb and flow of the tide, 1 might easily bring 
my boat round the island again. But when i 
began to think of putting it in practice, the re- 
membrance of the late danger, struck me with 
^such horror, that I took another resolution, 
though more laborious ; and this was to make 
a second canoe, and so have one for one side of 
the island, and one for the other. 

I had now two plantations in the island ; the 
first, my little fortification, fort, or castle, with 
many large and spacious improvements ; for by 
this time I had enlarged the cave behind me 
with several little caves, one within another, to 
hold my baskets, corn and straw. The piles 
with which 1 made my wall were grown so 
lofty ai?d great, as to obscure my habitation. — 
And near this commodious and pleasant settle- 
ment, lay ray well cultivated and improved corn 
fields, which kindly yielded me their fruit in the 
proper season. My second plantation was that 
near my country-seat, or little bow^r, where my 
grapes flourished, and where having planted 
my stakes, I made inclosuros for my goats, so 




S)2 

«tK>Qg}y fortified by labour and time, that it was 
much strooger tlian a wall, an^, coosequeoUj* 
impossible lor tbem to break tkrough. As foir 
my bower itself, 1 iei>t it constantly in repair, 
and cut the trees in such a manner, as made 
lijein grow i^ild, and* form a most delightful 
shade. In the centre of this, stood my tent, 
thus erected. I had driven four piles in the 
ground, spreading over it a piece of the ship** 
ts^iiii :■ beneath which, I made me a sort of couch 
with the skins of the creatures I had slain, and 
other things; and havmg laid thereon one o€ 
tiie sailor^s blaukfts, which I had saved from 
the wreck of the ship, and covering myself with 
a great watch coat, I took up this place for my 
country retreat 

Very frequently, from this settlement, did I 
uso to visit my boiat, £md keep her in very good, 
order, ^nd, sometimes, would 1 venture in her 
A cast or two from shore but no farther. But 
now^ I entreat your attention, whilst I proceed 
to inform ymi of a new, but most surprisin*; 
«cene of life which here hefel me. 

You may easily suppose^ that, after havinij 
been here so long, nothing could bo moro" 
amazing than to see a human creat^e. ^ Cue 
day it happened, that going to my boat, 1 saw 
the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, 
very evident on the sand, as the toes, heels, and 
every part of it Had I seen a monster of th« 
most frightful shape, 1 could not-have been more 
confounded. ^ly willing ears gave the strictest 
attention. I cast m^ eyes uruund^ but could 



ROBfNiWN' Crusor startled at tlie print 
ot a inau'* t<>ot in tbe taiid. 



utttisfy neither the one nor the other. I pro- 
ceeded alternately to every part of the shore^ 
but with equal effect j neither could 1 see any 
other mark, though the sand about it was as 
susceptible to take impression, as that which was 
60 pla-nly stamped. Thus, struck with confu- 
sion and horror, I returned to noy habitation, 
frightened at every bush and tree, talking every 
thing for men ; and possessed with the wildest 
ideas ! That night my eyes never closed. I 
formed notliing but the most dismal imagina- 
tions. In a word, all my religious hopes va- 
nished, as though I thought God would not 
now protect me by his power, who had won- 
derfully preserved me so long. 

What various chains of events are there in 
the life of man ^ I low changeable are our af- 
fections, according to different circumstances? 
We love to day, what we hate to-morrow : we 
shun one hour what we seek the next. This was 
£\4dent in me in the most conspicuous manner ; 
for I, who before had so much lamented my 
condition, in being banished from all human, 
kind, was no\y ready to expire when I con4- 
4ered that a man had set his foot, on this deso* 
late island. But when I considered my station 
of life, that it was allotted to me by the infinitely 
wise and ffood providenjcc of God, that I ought, 
not to dispute my Creator's sovereignty, who 
had an undoubted right to govern and dispose xdC 
his creatures as he thinks convenient ; and that 
his justice and mercy could either punish or de* 
liver me : I say, when I ponsidered 9il ihi$, I 



i^5 



eomfortably foun4 it ray duty to trust Jincerely 
in him, pray ardenlly to him, and humbly re. 
sign myself to his divine will. 

One morning, lying on ray bed, these words 
of the sacred writings came into my mind, Cali 
upon me in the day of trouhle^ and I un/l de- 
liver thee, and thou shalt glorify me* Upon 
this sentence, rising more cheerftiUy from my 
bed, I offered up my prayers in the most devout 
manner : and when I had done, taking up my 
bible to road, these words appeared in my sight; 
Wait on the Lord, and he of good cheer, and 
he shall strengthen thy heart ; iVait, I say, 
on the Lord. Such divine comfort did this give 
me, as to remove all cause of sadness upon that 
occasion. 

Thus, after a world of apprehensions and 
fears, for three days and nights, I at last ven« 
tured out of my castle, and milked my goats, 
one of which was almost spoiled for want of it. 
I next (though in great fear,) visited my bower, 
'and milked my flocks there also ; when, grow- 
ing bolder, I went down to the shore again, and 
measuring the print of the foot to mine, to see 
perhaps whether I myself had not occasioned 
that mark, I found it much superior in large. 
Mess; and so returned home, absolutely con* 
vinced, that either some men had been ashore, 
or that the island must be inhabited ; and, there- 
fore, that I might be surprised before I was 
aware. 

I now began to think of providing for my 
security, and revolved in my mind man/ 



»6 

^fflerctvt schemes for that purpose. I fir^t pro- 
posed to cut down my enclosures, and turn my 
tam^ cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy 
might not fmd them, and frequent the island in 
hopes of killing the same. Secondly^ I was for 
digging up my com fields for the very same 
reason. And^ lastly, I concluded to demolish 
my hower, lest seeing a place of human con- 
trivance, tjhey might come farther, and find out, 
and attack me in my castle. 

Sleep was an utt^r stranger to my eyes that 
night ; yet nature, spent and tired, submitted 
to a silent repose the next morning, and then 
joining reason with fear, I considered, that this 
delightful and pleasant island might not be so 
entirely forsaken as I might think ; but that the 
inhabitants from the other shore might sail, 
either with design, or from necessity, by cro«s 
winds; and, if the latter circumstance, I had 
rea<5on to believe, they would depart the first 
opportunity. However, my f(^ar made me think 
of a place of retreat upon an attack. I now 
repented that I had made my door to come out 
beyond my fortification ; to remedy which, I 
rjesolved to ^ake me a second one ; I fell to 
work, therefore, and drove betwixt that double 
row of trees, which I planted above twelve yea« 
before, several strong piles, thickening it with 
jii^ces of timber and old cables, and strengthen - 
* ing the foot of it with earth which I dug out of 
niy cave ; I also made me seven holes, wherein 
I planted my mu»kcts Jiker cannon, fitting them 



97 

Into frames resombling carriages. T\a» feeing 
finished with indefatigable indpstiy, for tt great 
Way every where, I planted sticks of osier like 
^ wood about twenty thousand of them, leaving 
a large space between them an^ my wall, that 
I might h^ve room to see en enemy, and that 
they might not be sheltered among the young 
trees, if they otfered to approach the outer wAlL 
And indeed, scarcely two years had passed over 
my head, when there appeared a lovely shady 
grove, and in six years^ it became a thick wood, 
perfectly impassable. For my "safety, 1 left no 
avenue to go-in or out ;' instead of which» 1 set 
two ladders, one to a part of the rock which 
was low, and then brote in, leaving room to 
place another ladder upon that ; so that when 
I took those down, it was impossible for any 
man to descend without hurting himself ; and 
if they had, they would still be at the outside 
of my outer wall. But while I took all t^es© 
measures of human prudence for my own pre- 
servation, I was not altogether unmindfiil of 
other affairs. To preserve my stock of tamo 
goats, that the enemy should not take all at 
once, 1 looked out for the most retired part of 
the island, which was the place where 1 had 
lost myself before mentioned, and there find- 
ing a clear piece of land, containing threo 
acres, surrounded with thick woods, I wrought 
80 hard, that in less than a month's time, C 
fenecd it so well round, that ray flocks were 



F 



9g 

vei^ well Aecur^d in it, and I put therein fira 
tie-goats, and ten she ones* 

All this lajbour was occasioned purely bji? 
fearful apprehensions, on €u;count of seeing the 
print of ar man's foot. And not contented yet 
with what I had done, I searched for another 
place towards the west part of the island, where 
I might also retain another flock* Then wan^ 
dering on this errand more to the west of the 
island than ever I had yet done, and casting my 
eyes towards the sea, methought I perceived a 
boat at a great distance : but ck>uld not possibly 
tell what it was for want of my spy-^aes. I 
considered then, it was no- strange thing to see 
the print of a man's foot ; and concluding them 
cannibals, blessed God for being cast on the 
other side of the island, where none of the 
savages, as I thought ever came. But when I 
came down the^ hill to the shore, which was the 
»S. W. point of theisland^ I was soon confirm- 
ed in my opinion ; nor can any one describe 
my horror and amazement, when I saw the 
ground spread with sculls, liands, feet, and 
bones of human bodies ; end particularly, I 
perceived a space like a circle, in the midst of. 
which had been a iire, about which I conjee, 
tared those wretches sat, and unnaturally sa- 
crificed and devoured their fellow creatures. 

The horror and loathsomeness of this dread. 
Ittl apectacle, both confounded my senses, luid 
made me discharge from my stomach in an ex- 
cessive manner. I then returned towards my 



00 

habitailoD ; and in my way thither, ^hediii^ 
floods of tears, and falling down on my bended 
knees, gave God tjianks for making my nature 
contrary to those wretches, and delivering me 
80 long out of their hands. 

Though reason and my long residence here, 
had assured me, that the savages never came 
up to the thick woody part of the country, and 
that I had no reason to be apprehensive of a 
discovery, yet such an abhorrence did I still 
retain, that, for two years after, I confined my. 
self only to my three plantations ; I mean my 
pastle, country seat, and enclosure in the woodSy 
though in process of time, ray dregful appre« 
hensions began to wear away. 

Thus }oay circuiustances for some time re^ 
mained very calm and undisturbed ; though in- 
deed, the terror which the savages hfui put me 
ip, spoiled «ome inventions for wy own convex 
oiepce. One of my projects was to brew me 
Hjome beer ; a very whimsical one indeed, when 
it was considered, that I h0.d neither casks suf* 
Acient, npr could I make any to preserve it in ; 
neither had I hops to luake it keep : veast to 
make it work, nor a copper nor kettle to make 
it boil. Perhaps, indeea, ^iter some years, I 
might bring this to bepir, as I had done other 
things. But now my inventions vfere placed 
anomer way ; find day and night I could think 
of nothing but how I might destroy ^me of 
t))C8e cannibals, when proceeding to their bloody 

eptertainipenls ; ^nd so saving it victim froot

beio^ sacrificed, fliai he might afterwards become 
my dervani Many were my contriTances for 
thi» purpose, and many more objections occur- 
red, after I had hatched them. I once contrived 
to dig a hole under the- place where they made 
their fire, and put therein five or six pounds of 
powder, which would consequently blow up 
all those that were near it ; but then I was loth 
to spend so mtich upon them, lest it should not 
do that certain execution I desired, and only 
ttfiright and not kill them. Having laid this de- 
sign aside, I again proposed to myself to lie priV 
vately in ambush in some convenient place, with 
my three gunb double loaded, and let fly at them 
in the midst of thdr dreadful ceremony : and 
having killed two or three of them at every shot^ 
fall upon the rest suddenly with my three pis* 
tols, and let not one of them escape. This plan 
appeared to me so practicable that I used to 
dream of it in the night time. To put my de- 
sign in execution, I was not l6ng seeking for a 
place convenient for my purpose, where unseen 
I might behold every action of the savages.—^ 
Here 1 placed my twg muskets, each of which 
was loaded with a brace 6f slugs, and four or 
five, smaller bullets about the size of pistol buU 
lets; the fowling piece was charged with nearly 
a handful of the largest swan shot, and in every 
pistol about four bullets. And thus all things 
beifig prepared, no sooner did the welcome light 
Kpread over the element, but I would issue forth 
from my castle, and from a lofty hill, three 
miles distant, try if I ^ould see any invaders 



101 

approach unlawfully to luy kingdom, Bui hav- 
ing waited in vain two or three months, it grew 
very tiresonie to me. 

I now argued with myself, it was better for 
me never to attack, but to remain undbcovered 
as long as I possibly could t thiLt an opposite 
conduct would certfdnly prove destructive ; for 
as it was scarcely to he supposed I could kill 
them all, I might either he overpovfered by th^ 
remaining, or that sopoe escaping might bring 
thousands to my certain destruction. And, in? 
deed, religion took their part so much as to coji« 
vince me ho\^ contrary it was to my duty, to bo 
guilty of shedding human blood, innocent as to 
me in particular, whatever they arc to one ano* 
ther ; th^t I had nothing to do with it, but leave 
it to the God of all power and dominion, as ( 
said^ before, to do therein what seemed conye* 
nient to his heavenly wisdom. And, therefore, 
, on my knees I th^ked the Almighty for deli* 
yering me from blood-guiltiness, and oegged his 
protection that I might i^eve? fall into their 
hands. 

Thus giving over an attempt which f had 
rashly b^n, 1 never ascendea the hill on thi^t 
occasion ffterwards ; I only jfemoved my boat, 
which lay on the QtheT side (yf the islai^d, and 
every thing that belonged to her, towards the 
east, into a little cove, ths^t there might not ba 
the least shadow of any boat near, nor habita- 
^n upon the island. My castle then be<2jU09i

103 

my coU, feee^ng alwftvi retired Iq it, excef% 
when I went out to muk mj she-goats, or tnj 
•little dock in the wood, which was quite out of 
danger; for sure T wasy that these savages ne- 
ver canie here with expectation to find any 
thing, and consequently never wandered front 
the coast ; hoWbver, as they might have several 
times heen on shore, as well beiore as after my 
dreadfiil apprehensions, I looked back with 
horror to think in what state 1 might have beeq 
had I suddenly met them, slenderly armed, with 
one gun only loaded with small shot; and how 
great would have been my amazenient, if, inn 
stead of seeing the print of one man's foot> f 
had peroeived fifteen or twenty savages, who. 
having once set their eye^ upon me, by the 
swiftness of their feet, would have left me na 
possibility of escaping ? These thoughts would 
sink my very soul, so that I would fall into a 
deep melancholy, till such time as the consit 
deration of my gratitude to the divine Being,^ 
n^ved it from ii^y heart I then fbll into a con- 
templation of the secret springs of Providence ; 
aqd how wonderfully we are delivered, when 
insen.'uhle of it ; and when in uncertain mazes 
or labyrinths of doubt or hesitation, what se- 
cret hmt dhrecls us in the right way, when we 
intended to go out of it ; nay, perhaps contrary 
to our busiQess, sense, or inclination. 

Anxieties of mmd, i^nd the c&re of ray pre- 
servation, put a period to all future invefntions 
and contrivances, either for accommodation, or 



108 

•onvealeii0e. I notr owcei not io 4 rive a nail, 
chop a stick, fire a gan, or make a fire, lest 
either the poise should be hoard, or the smoke 
discover me. And (m this account I u^ted to 
burn toy earthen ware privatelyin a cave, whiob 
I found in the wood, and which 1 made conve- 
picnt for that purpose ; the principal cause that 
brought me here was to make charcoal, so that ' 
I might bake and dreas, mj bread and aioeat 
without any danjjer. 

At that time, a curious aoddent happened ta 
pi^e, which I shall now relate. 

While I was cutting down ?ome wood, for 
making my charcoal, I pcjrceived a cavity be- 
hind a very thick branch of underwood. Cu- 
dous to look into it, J attained its mouth, and 
perceived it suiQcient for me to staad upriglit 
in. 

But when I had eqtered, having crept, upon 
jny hands and feet through this strait, I found 
the roof hig^^^r up, I tliink about twenty feet. 
But surely never had i seen such a glorious 
sight before : the roof and walls of this cave 
refieeted a hundred thou<«and lights to me from 
my two candles, as though they were indented 
with tliining gold, preciouf stones, or sparkling 
diamonds. And indeed it was the nK)st delight* 
ful cavity or grotto of its kind that cpuld bo 
desired, though entirely dark. The floor wa« 
dry and level, and had a kind of gravel upo» • 
it ; no nauseous venemous creatures to be se«M 
there, neither any damp or wet about it. I could 
find 90 fault but i^ the entrance, and t b,0gaa 



101 

to think, :hat even Ibis might be very nieGesiaiy 
for my defence, and therefore resolved to make 
it my principal magazine. I brought bither two 
fowling pieces, and three muskets, leaving only 
five pieces at my jcastle, planted in tbe nature 
of cannon. In a barrel of gun-powder, which 
I took out pf the sefi, I brought away about 
sixty pounds of good powder, which was not 
damaged ; and this, with a great qufoitity of 
lead for bullets, I rempved from pay castle to. 
this retreat, now fortified both by oxi and nature, 
I fancied myself pow like one of the'giants 
of old, who were said to live in cayes and hole^ 
fimong the roc]cs, ipficces^ible to any but them- 
selves, or at least, most dangerous to attempt 
And now I defied both the cunning and strength 
of the savages, either to fipd ipe out^ or tp hurt 
roe. 

. 1 think I was now in the twenty-third vear« 
pf my reign, and my thoughts much easier than 
ibrmerly, having contrived several pretty amuses 
luents and diversions to pass away the time in 
a pleasant manner. By this time, my pretty 
Poll had learned to speak English, and pro« 
nounce his words very articulately and plain ; 
so that for many hours we used to chat together 
after a very familiar mapner, and he lived no , 
less than tWenty-six yeays. My dog, which 
was nineteen years ofd, sixteen of which he 
lived with me, had died sopie time ago, of mere 
old age. As for -my cats, they multiplied so fast, 
tliat 1 was forced to Kill or drive them into the 
woods; except two or tlpiree which became m^ 



105 

jiartietilar favourites. Besides tiiese. I conti- 
nually kept two or three household kids about 
me, which I taught to feed out of my hand, 
and two more parrotsr which eould talk indif- 
ferently, and could call Robinson Crusoe, but not 
80 ex6ellently as the first, by my not taking so 
much pains with them. I had also several sea 
fowls which I had wounded ahd cut their wings; 
ihese growing tame, used to breed among tho 
low trees aboui mycdsfle^^alls, all of which 
wade my abode very agrieeable. 

But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy 
!the •tjjoyments of this uncertain state of life, 
whien wo least expect them I It was now th« 
month of December, and the particular tingfli 
jn my harvest, which required my attendance 
in the fields ; when going out pret^ early in 
]the morning, before it was day-l^h^ thero ap« 
peared to md from the sea, shore, a flaming' 
light, about two miles from me at the ea^t ena 
Qt the island, where I had observed some sa- 
vages had been before, QOt on the other side, 
but to mj great aSiction it was on my side of 
the island. 

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual 
Apprehensions, that the savages would perceive 
my improvements, I returne4 directljr to my 
castle, pulled the ladder after me, making all 
things look as wild s^nd natural as i posisibly 
i;ould. In the next place, t put myself in a 
posture of defence, loaded my muskets and pis* 
lols, and committing myself to God's proteo. 
tion, i resolved to defend myiolf ^ mj last 



10(5 

oreath.^ Two hours after, impatient for intelli- 
gence/! set my ladder up to the side of the 
hill, where there was a flat place, find then pul- 
Ibg the ladder after roe, ascended to the top, 
where laying myself on my helly, with my 
perspective glass 1 perceived no less than nine 
naked savages; sitting round d small fire, eatbg 
as 1 supposed, human flesh,'witb their two canoes 
hauled on shore, waiting for the flood to carry 
them off ag^in. The consternation I was ia 
at this sight, especially seeing the^n near roe, 
yras very great; but wheu I perceived their 
coming must be always with tlie current of the 
ebb, f became more easy in my thoughts, be^ 
ing fully convinced, that I might go abroad 
with security all the time of the flood, if they 
were not before landed* And indeed, this proved 
just as I imagined ; for no sooner did they all 
take boat and paddle awfty, but tbe tide made 
N. W. When I saw them- gone^ I took two 
guns qpon my shoulders, apd placing a couple 
of pistols in my belt, with pay gre^t sword hang-r 
ing by my side, I weut to the hill, where at 
first I made a discovery of these cannibals, an4 
then saw there had been three cimoes ^pore of 
the savages on shore at that place, which with 
the rest were making over to me pcii^in l^ud. 

fiut nothing cpuld be ipo^e horrid to me, 
when going to tbe plftce of sacrifice, the blood, 
tbe bones, and oiher paaqgled parts of l^u^ 
man bodies appeared in my sight ; and so fired 
lyas 1 with indignation, that I was fully resolved 
to use my 3re arm» ip cQdcs^voqrin*; to ^hecl^

their cruel practices, though I lost my Bfe in tho 
execution. It then appeared to me, that tho 
visits which they make to this island are not 
very frequent, it being fifteen months before 
they came again; but still I was very uneasy, 
by reason of the dismal apprehensions of their 
surprising mo unawares : nor dared I offer to 
fire a gun on that side of the island, where 
they used to appear, lest taking the alarm,, 
they might return with many hundred canoes,*^ 
and then, God only knows in what manner 
I should have made my end* Thus was I a 
year or more before I saw any of these de- 
vouring cannibals again. 

But, to wave this, the following accident, 
which demands attention, for a while diverted 
my thoughts from these cannibals. 

On the J 6th of May (according to my 
wooden calendar) the wind blew exceedingly 
hard, accompanied with abundance of thunder 
and lightning all day, and succeeded by a very 
stormy night. I had gone to bed at my usual 
time, but finding it impossible to sleep, i arose 
end having stirred up the embers of my fire 
sat down to my Bible. Whilst I was seriouslr 
pondering upon it, I was suddenly alarmed 
With the noise of a gun, which I conjectured 
was fired upon the ocean. Such an unusual 
surprise made me start up in a minute ; when, 
with my ladder ascending the mountain «j| biJ 
fore, that very moment, a flash of fire pre- 
saged the report of another. gun, whi^ ^ pre- 
sently heard, and found it was from the yui ©f 



ili0 s«fi where the cmrent drove me aw c^, I 
oodd not but then A'mk, that ilaA mast be a 
ship in distress, and that these were the melatw 
choty signals for a st>eedy deHverance. Great, 
indeed, was mj sorrow upon thisoccjHion"; but 
my labours to aisslst them must have proved al- 
together vain and fruitless. However, I brought 
together al! the dry wood that was at hand, anci 
laaking a pretty large pile, sot it on fire on the 
hill. I was certam they plainly perceived it, 
by their firing another gun as soon as it beganf 
to^ blaze, and after that,, several more from the 
same quarter. All night long^ I kept up my 
fire } and when the air cleared up, I perceived 
something a great yvay at sea^ directly E. but 
could not distinguish what it was, even with 
my ^ass, the weather being so very foggy out 
at sea. However, keeping my eyes directly 
fixed upon it, and perceiving it did not stir, 1 
presenUy concluded it must be a ship ^ an- 
chor, and so very hasty was I to be satisfied,. 
that, taking my gun, I went to the S. Wr part 
of the island, to the same rocks where I h^d 
been jformerly dxiven away by the current ; in 
which time the weather being perfectly cleared 
up, to my great sorrow, I perceived the wreck 
of a ship cast away- upon those hidden rocks I 
had found when I was out with* niy boat ; and 
wWch, by -making a kind of eddy, ^ere the 
ocpasien^of' my preserviation.

Well,' n(y#, Friday, said f , shtfll We now gd to* 
yotir mudi desired nation? Btii, instead of* 
meeting with that eheerfnlness I expected, het 
looked very dull and melancholy at my* saying 
so ; which indeed at first i^irprised me, till he( 
made me sensible, that his doncern was about' 
the boat*^ being too small to go so far a voy- 
age. Upon whicb, I letbim understand I had 
a much nigger^ and, accordingly the next day 
went to the place,- where the first bodt lay^ 
which f had made. When all tbe airength I 
had, or art I could use,/ failed me in my at-' 
tempt to get it into the water : biutnowit having 
lafii in the sun two and twenty years, and noi 
car^ beii^ taken of it all tkat while, it becamgt 
in a manner rotkn. My man teld me, that 
such a boat would do very weH for the pur-' 
pose, sufficient to carry enough vUtie, dring^ 
bread, for that was his nKmiier of talking. In' 
short, my mind being strongly fixed upon^my 
design of going over wiith him t<» the conti^ 
nenty I very ji^ainly told him, thatt We Would 
both go and make « boitt fulV an bigy and mora 
proportionable tliMtthaf, wherein ho rtight 
safely ifeturfr to his ow» jirttlbn : for it occurr^A 
io me, that inbst probabFy hte- great wiith for a 
iargier -boat was fliHogetheif selfish,' ^d ^bat 



copptry^ he cared but liltje yfhsX Jiecaiiieot xti^.

should have an uncommon coiie^n at so cruel

yer^ soul, f^nd mode him desire jcvcu to die,

After 1 hdik told Friday^ in a very carelo^ 
isioaner, thai ho shp^d be at his ItWrjly as 
soQQfs the hoti was madey tho language ot

us # 

said 1/ vtiiai is it you mean ? What miist t d0 ' 
idth tbis ? Only Mi Fnday, said he, Friday 
care not live long* But what mast I kill yoit 
for, replied I again* A/i, dear mostly what 
iHttde you Friday sai>e from eat ttmetsp, so 

' keep long Friday y make Friday lo^e Ood, and 
Hotb Friday send atOdy, never see Friday more* , 

, And while he spoke thus, the tears ran down 
his cheeks in ^dh a plentiful manner^ that I 
h?id nnieh ado to fefrain from weeping also, 
tvhen I heheld the poor creature's irfiecttoh : so 
that I wfts forced to comfort him in the best 
manner I could, whi«h I did, by telling him^ 
if he tvas content to abide with me> I should be 
ever willing to keep him. 

After Friday's grief was somewhat abated^ 
more fully to convince me ^of his afi^otiou) bd 
said, master <^ me not care to he in- my naiion 
have you here^ me desire nation learn good, 
that's all; meaping thiot his desire was for the 
conversion of that barbatfouis peoples and that 
he wished' me to go with bim^ And' |ndeed> 
I began to desire ia go also, from my late 
discourse With Filday aboi^t these- siventeeii 
white bearded men, that had been driven* upon 
the Barbarian coast; whom I d^signed'to join, 
«sthe only meiEins ^o further our esoape. To 
which intent, my man and 1 went to sectrch for 
a proper tree to fell, whereof we might make 
•a perigua or canoe, to undertake* &e vc^a^e ; 
and, indeed. We were not )ong ih finduig onc^ 
Jit for our purpose,' there heii^ imtofifh ef 
wood in the istaud to have built a fteet of largo 

I 



vessels, but tbe thing we priiicigijly imapte^ 
WBA, iQ get on^ «o near the water.'^iat we migUt 
launch it ^ter it was finished, and not commit 
9e great a mi»tal(e as I bad done once before. 

Well, after a great search for what was besfr 
and most convenient, Friday, at last, whos^- 
judgnaent in such affairs was much superior Iq 
mine, pitches upon a kind ef wood th^ moit^ 
fttliog for iiu But ti^ugh, mj man excfeded> 
mem th^ knowledge of the most pmer tre^,. 
yet I showed him. a much better and cleaner 
way to nvake a canoe iksm ever he knew before r. 
for he was for burning t^e hoUoia ev cavity ol 
the titee, in oi^er to make this boat; but l^thenf 
told him how we might do it with tools, teach,* 
ifog him al the Mmae time how to use them,. 
>whioh iadeed he did v«ry dexterously ; so that 
W a mouth'a time we finished it, mttking it 
very hands^nse, by cutting the outnide in the 
Irup shape ef a boat* After tbis^ it took us at^ 
fhll foitnight before we could get hei into th^ 
^at^^ ifljlsh we did, a^ it were, inch by inch^ 
|>p0n neat rolleni : but when she was in, shp 
woula have carried twenty 'men« with all the- 
ease ima(p^able. 

Aa I was very well pleased, you may hp- 
sure, at the launching of this man of war o£ 
mine, I was np less amazed to behold with whfit 
dexterKar my nian could mana^ her, turn 
hex^ and paddle her alpng. Vyell, Friday,. 
hHI X what do you think of it, now ? Do 
yoMliifakktfaiftwaicftnyuaov^? Yfs^tmtstfr^ 



w 

said h^ we venture over toell, though great How 
wind;, But mv design was yet farther, .which 
be was insensible of; and tliat to make a in&st 
and a $ail^ and provide her with an anchor 
and cable. As to a mast, that was no difficult 
thing at all to procure: so fixing npon a 
straight young cedar tre^, which 1 fomid near 
(he place, great plenty of it abounding in the 
island ; and setting Friday to cut it- down, I 
gave him particular directions how to Ihape 
and order it ; but as to the sail, that I maaaged 
myself. 1 very well knew I had some old one9^ 
or pieces of sails enough, which heul lain six 
and twenty years by me ; but not being careful 
to preserve them, as thinking I should have nd 
occasion to use th^m any more, when I came 
to look over them, I found them almo^t^ all, 
rotten, e2;cept two ; and with these I went to 
work, and after a great deal of pains and awk* 
ward tedious stitching for want of needles, at 
length I finished a three-cornered ugly things 
nke that ive call in England, a shoulder of 
mutton sail,' to go with a boom at bottom, and 
a small sprit at the top, Hke these which our 
long.boats use, and which I very well knew 
bow to manage; especially' since it was like 
that which I had in my patrol's fishing boat» 
when with my boy Xury, I made my escape 
from the barbarian shore. 

It was nearly two monthft, I thinks before I 
completed this work, that is, the, rigsing, and 
fitting my mast and sails ; and indeed tbey 
were nicely done, having (uade a small stay, 



148 

and 'a %h\\, or foresail to it, to as??ii<t," if. ^i^ 

fihouM tnrn to the windward ; and, wLich weir 

still more, I fixed a riidder to the stem of her^ 

to ^teer with ; and though I was hut a very 

indiifbrent shipwright, yet, as I was sensible 

of the great nsefolness and absolute necessity 

of a thing like thM», I applied myself to it with 

§uch a constant application, tbat at la<?t I ac- 

^oxxrplbhod my design ; biit what with the many 

dull fiontrivancos I had about it^ and thcfaiiurd 

of many things, it cost me as much pains in 

ordering, as iu making tire l)oat. >- besides^ 

when ali this was done, I had my man to 

teach what belonged to •' its navigation ; . iot 

though he very well nnder.?tood how to paddle 

a eanoK) alone,, he was an utter strahaiv to a 

^ail and a rudder,- and was amazed when he 

saw me work the boat to and again in Clie sea^ ' 

by them, and how4he sail jibbed -An4 .fiUedl 

this way or that way, as the cours© we' sailed 

phanged. Afler some time, and a little ufie, 

1 made ali tiie9e things very£Eaniliar to him* 

80 .thait he became an expert sailor, except in 

delation to the compass,, ajad tiiat I dould make 

faim understand but little of. Bat as it ha{)w 

ftened, there was ^Idom occasion for it, there 

being but little cloudy leather, and scarcely 

any fog^ in those parts ; the stars were always 

visible in the nighty and the shore by day, tex» 

feeptin.tbe rainy season, which confined evfery 

one to his habitation^ Thus entei^d into the 

9even?and-tweiiticth year of my reign or

c«»4vt€f , wfrleh you, please, (the tm.<H Hm^^ of 
wmcb» Mewed with the eottpaoy of my'rolto 
Friday, ought not to be reckoned ;) I kept tl^ 
aaoifersBiy of my laoditif here with the fAVcm 
Ibaokfiiinets to (Jod ibr Ms lender mercies, as f 
bad doae befbtre; and certainly, a^ 1 bad great 
cause for tbankfol acknowledgment for my 
^livenmce at first, I had much greater now 
for such singular and additional testunonies of 
tbe care of Providence over me, m, all vay di^ 
tresses of both body and mind* and the great 
tiopes I had^of beinc efiectiiaily and speedily 
delivered; for I had a strong hope, that I 
should not be ai^her year in this ii^land. Hu^ 
liowever, 1 sUU continued on with my bus* 
l^andiy, digging, planting, and fencing, an 
usual : gatheriiig and curing my grapes, and 
doing all other things that were neces^taiy. 

And now the rainy season beginning to 
come on» obKeed me to keep the longer within 
doo«^; but betorc this, I brought my new ves* 
sal into the Greek, wl>cre 1 bad landed my 
rafts from the ship, so we waited for tJio months 
di Noyember and Dccoraberr in which I de- 
signed to venture ofrer the ocean. 

M.o sooner did the seusonabie weather begin

with this new designed advcntwo, that 1 daily 
prepared for tbe voyage* The fir^t thing I

did as 1 commanded him, and came back with 
this melandiory story, that they were all about 
their fire, eating the fleeh of one of their pri-

«ure^ Hi at upon hearing this, my soul wa« 
ready to sink within me : when fiscending up 
into a tree, 1 saw plainly, by my glass, a white 
man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, With 
his iiends tied with flags or things resembling 
rushes, beintj covered with clothes, aftd 8oem-

dreadful consternation, at sucb an unexpected 

disaster ; and those who had yet escaped dur 

penetrating shot, immediatejy jumped upon 

their feet^ but were in such a confusion, tbat 

they knew not which way to run or look ; not 

knowing from whence their destruction came. 

^ow, Friday, said I, lay down yo«r piece, and 

take up the musket and follow me. He did 

BO, with great courage, when, showiug our- 

fdelves to the savageft, we gave a great shoo^t, 

and made directly to the poor victim, wlto 

would have been sacrificed, had not our fiist 

fire obliged the butchers, with ail the othcri^, 

whom osur shot had not disabled,' to jimip into

the bottom of their boat; they soon, however, 

with the exception of him whom the ball struck, 

stood up, and used their paddles with such 

effect!, that they were quickly out of our reach* 

In the mean time, I cut the flags that tied the 

hand? and feet of the poor creature, and lifting 

him up, asked him, in the Portuguese ^ngue. 

What he was ? he answered me in Latin, 

Christicuius : but so very weak and faint ^bat 

he could soarsely stand or spcaL And 1 next 

asked him what c^untiytnan he was ? Il»

i^ald Espaniola, ^nd then ut^red all thq^ thapk^ 
fiilne* Imaginable for Ms deliverance. Signicf 
(said I, wim as much Spanish as I was master 
of,) let us talk afterwards, but fight now; here, 
take this sword apd pistol -and do what you 
pan ; for at tliis time I thought the savages 
woidd return. '' I ordered Friday to run for 
ihe guns we had left at the tree, (fortunc^tely, 
however, there was no bccasion to use them,) 
which he brought to me with great swifiness, 
imd then I gave him my musket^ while I loaded 
the rest. 

The savages in the canoe worked very bcurd 
to get out 6f our reach, and Friday wa? ^ 
eager in pursuing them , and, indeed, 1 was 
inb less anxious about their escape, Jest^ after 
ibe ne\^s had beeri carried to their people, 
they, should return in piiultitudes, and* destroy 
" iis. . So being resolved to pursue them; * 
jumped into one of their eanofe, and bid Fri- 
, day follow me ; but no sooner wad I in, thap, 
to tS^ surprise, I found anotliet poor creature, 
|3ound hand and foot for the slaughter, just 
- ' iis the Spaniard had been, with very little life 
in him. Immediately i unbound him, and 
would hav6 helped him up ; but he could nei- 
ther stand nor ^eak, but groaned so piteously, 
lui thinking he^ Was unbound in oracur to bn 
slain. Hereupon I bid Friday speak to hirii, 
^nd tell him of his* deliverance; when pulling 
but nly bottle, I made the poor wrelch drink 
k little, which; with thp joyful news he \ii 



J57 

1f^.ccived, so revived hk heart, that he sat ujf 
in the boat. As soon as Friday began to hear 
jbim speak, and look more fully In his face, it 
would have mpved any one to tears to perceive 
his uncommon transports of joy ; for he kissed, 
embraced him, hugc;ed him/ cried, laughed^ 
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, then 
cried again, wrung his hands, beat has face 
and head, then sung and jumped about tigain, 
like a. distracted creature: so that it wjls a 
great whiile before I 6ould make him speak to 
'me« or tell me what was the matter wiw him ^ 
hut when be oame to the liberty of his speech, 
at last he told me it was his father. 

Here, indeed^ I was infinitely movecl to see 
the dutiful and tefnder affection Which this poor 
savage 'had to his aged parent He would ffli 
down by him in the boat, open his breast^ an3 
hold his father's head close to his bosom, half 
an hour together, to cherish bim; then he 
look bis arms and ankles, which wera stiff ai^d 
numbed, with binding, and chafed a-nd rubbecl 
them with his hands j by vvhiph i^eans, per* 
peiving what the case Was, 1 gave him son^ 
rum, which proved of great benefit to him. 

While we were busy in this action, the 
savages had gotten almost out 6f sight ; an4 
^^ happy it was we did liot pursue them:- lor 
ihere arose from .the north-west, which con- 
tinued all night long, such a violent stotm, that 
I could not suppose otherwise but that they 
^ere all drowned. After this. L called f^d^J

io met aad adkcd h^,%tf b^ had given )m fa* 
thet any bread? He shook hlsl head, and said, 
' None, noi one bit, me eat aim all; so I gave 
Jiim a cake of bread out of a httle pouch 1 car- 
lied for this end. 1 likewise gave hi0 ivro or 
ihree bunches of raisins for his father. 

Avajr be then runs out of the boat as if ho. . 
was bewitched, with such €m extraordinary 
swiflness, that he was out of sight, as it were. 
In an instant; but, at his return, I perceived 
him slacken his pace, because he had son»e- 
thing in his hand. And this I found to be, a^i 
he. approached nearer, an earthen jug with 
some water for his father,, with two more cakes 
of bread, which tie delivered into my hands. 
Being very thirsty myself, I dramk some of the 
water, of which when his father had drunk 
sufficiently, it more revived bis spirits thian all 
(he rum 1 bad given him. 

I then called Friday tq me, and ordered him 
to carry the Spaniara tfne of the cakes, and 
some wate.r, who was reposing himself upon a 
green place under the shade of a tree, but so 
weak, that tliough he exerted himself, be coufd 
i^t stai)4 upon his feet. Upon which. I ordered 
Friday to rub and bathe his ankles with rum, as 
he had done his father's. But es^;^ minute he 
was employed in this, he would cast his eyes 
towards the boat, where he left his father 
sitting; who suddenly disappearing, he flew 
like %Btnjng <p ^^^» ^^d Hnding he only laid 
Umsea dowti to ease lus limbs, he tetumed 



J59 

back lo me presently, and thenl spoke to uie 
Spaniard to let Friday kelp him, and led him 
to the boat jn order 4o be conveyed to my 
dwelling, where I would take care of him^ 
Upon which, Friday took hira upon his back, 

/%uid Po carried him to the canoe, netting him 
close by his father ; and presently stepping oat 
^gain, lauQchi;d the boat off, and paddled it 
along the shore fast^er than I could wftik, though 

, the wind '^hlew very hard too ; and having 
brought them s&fe to the creek, away he rmm 
fo fetch the other canoe, which he brought to 
the creek almost as soon as I ^ot to it by land ; 
then wafting me over, he took otvr new guests 
out of the bo9t y but to weak were they, tl^t 
f was forced to make a kind of ft hand«ba»ow ; 
and when I c^me to my castle, not being wil* 
ling to make ^n entrance into my wall, we 
made them a handsome, tent, covered with old 
sails, and boughs of trees, making ty^o good 
beds of rioo straw, with blankets to lie upon 

. ^nd cover them. Thus, like an absolute king, 
over subjeets >ho owed their lives lo me, I 
thought myself vQry considerable. 

To get provisions for my poor wtak subjects, 

, I ordered Friday to kill me an yearling goal; 

, which when he had done„ I cut off the mnder 
quarteiB, and chonping it inta smair pieces, 
boiled it and stewea it, putting barley and rica 
into the broth* This f carried into their tent, 

^ set a t^ble, di^^d with them no^jpelf,^ and eiW

\i}d father, and in4oed to the Spaniard to^^ 
who spoke the language of the s^hrages pretty 
well. After dinner, I ordered Friday to fetch 
home all our arms fronl the field of batlle, and 
the oe)ct day to bury the dead bodies, which 
he did accibrdingly. 

And now i made Friday inquire of his 
father, whether he thought thoee savages had 
escaped the late storm in their canoe ; and if 
80, whethei^ they would not return with a £orce 
too eceet for us to resist? He ilnswered, that 
he thought it impossible they could outlive the 
atorm : or If they were driven southwardly, 
they would come to a land where they would 
as certainly be devotirod, as U they were 
d^»0«imed in the sea. And suppose they had 
attained their own country, the strangeness of 
their £atd and bloody attack, would make them 
tell their people, that the rest of theda were 
killed by thunder, and lightning, not by the 
band of roan, but ^y two heavenly spirits 
( meaning Friday and me) who were sent from 
above to destroy them. And this, be said, 
he knew, because he heard them say the same 
to one ano^er. And indeed he was in the 
rigbt on't ;* for I have heard sihce, that these 
very men gave out, that whoever went to thfit 
enchanted island; would be destroyed by fim 
from the gods. 

No canoes appearing some time after, as I 
expected,- my apprehensions ceased ; instead 
of which my former thoughts of a voyage took

^ir p\ac^ especiaUy whm Friday's fdiber ai^ 
jiured me t should have gopd usage in hk nattou. 
As to the Spaniard^ he told roe that sixteen mor^ 
pi his conutrymen, and Portuguese, who had 
beep shipwrecked, madethe^ esqape thither^ 
that though they weyp in ^0131 vWitJi thp 
savages, yet they \jrere very mlsers^ble for want

Rid lie la piafd tp the Hanannak; that when 
^e ship was lost, only- five men perched in thp 
pceon J the rest having ^yed themselves in the 
boat, wore now landed on the main continent. 
And what do they intend t<? do ^^ ? said I. 
He replied, they had ooncNerted m^asures^ to 
escape by buUdmg a vessel, but that tthey had 
neither tfools nor provisions, ^ thj^t all the|r

I should make a proposal, ^d invite theqi 
here, would they not carry, m^ prisoneri^tp

them to be such honest men, as would scctrn to 
jftct with such inhuman baseness to their deli- 
verer ; that if I pleased^ he and the old savage 
would go over to them, talk with them about it. 
and bring me an answer : that they should all 
.swear fidelity to me as their leader, upon the 
holy sacrament, and^ for his nart^ he would not 
pnly do the same, but sihna by me to the last

vice isy to k>€tit unother harvest^ and in the 
memn time, culiitute and tinprove some mote 
kuid, whereby we may have plenty of provi* 
Mons, in order to execute our design. , 

This advice of the t^andartts I approved 
<extrenie1j ; and 60 satisfied wa^ I of his ndeli^, 
ihat I esteemed' luin ever aficr. And thiist 
we all four weat to work o^on some more 
land, and against seed-time^ we had gotten so 
much cured, and trimmed up, sufficient to sotir 
22 bushels of barley on, and 16 jars of rice, 
which was in short all tke seed we nad to spare. 
As we were four in number^ and by this timft 
all in good healthy we feared not an hundred 
of Indians^ should tbej venture to attack Ub ; 
and while the com was growing, II pitched 
upon some trees, fit to build us a large vessel, 
JQ case the Spaniards came over : w^hich being 
marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut 
them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was 
oow mj privy counsellor, to oversee and direct 
ibe woik. I likewise eocroased my flocKs of

And thus all of us heing emplqyedf their in

of it so mncb, that firom twenty.two bushels 
of barley, we threshed oat two hundred and 
twenty, and the like i^uantity <tf rice, sirffr' 
dent to victual a ship fit to carry me ftnd bR 
the Spaniarda to any part of Arnica, 

Thus die principal object being answered, 
foy a 8u£9cient slodc of provisions, I sent my 
two itmbassadors over to the main Iand,*with l^ 
regal authority to administ^ the oath of alle- 
Ipance and .Mditv, and have an instrument 
signed under their bands, though I never asked 
whether they had pen, ink, or paper ; wheo 
giving each of them a musket, with eight 
charges of powder and ball, and provisions 
enough for eight days, they sidled away with n>

Scarcely a fortnight had passed over my

iputiny, were so very hardened, that it would 
be dangerous for our small company to attack 

'tljera.- This was a reasonable inference, in-

'immediately put in execution: we therefoie 

heaved the boat upon the b^ach so high that 

^fthe could not shoot off at high water mark, and 

broke a hole in her not easy to be stopped ; so 

tha^ all the signals they gave for, the boat to 

coipe on board were ip vain. Tbi» obliged 

them to send andther boc^t ashore, with teai 

men arnaed, whose , faces the oaptaii) plainly

' ( for I had perceived he was in concern) in the

, whom we took' to our assisstanoe, we thought 
J ourselves able enough to endure a battle. 

When the sailors landed, and beheld their 
'boat in that conditioia, they not only hallooed,

promised to st^d by him 4ill the la£t drop of 

their blood ; and whoever acted treacherously 

should be hanged io chains upon the l)each.^

and then the Captain repaired to the dther 

boat, making his passenger Captain of her^ 

land gave him four men^ well armed; while

other boat. By najdnight, they came within

Compared with the sp«e4 of ltd flight 
The tempest itself lags hehind,

When I think of my own native land, 

In a moment I seem to be there ; 
But, ulas 1 recoHection at hand 
iSoon hurries ihe back to despair.

The beast is laid down in his lair^

And I to my cabin repair. 
There's mercy in every place ; 

And mercy, encouraging thought ! 
Gives even i^ction a grace^ 

And reconciles man to his lot.
