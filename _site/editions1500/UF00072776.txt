THE original name of the author of Robinson Crusoe,
was Daniel Foe , which from caprice, or some other
motive, he lengthened with a prefix, calling himself
De Foe. He was a native of London, born in. the
year 1660, of humble parentage, his father, James 1
Foe, exercising the occupation of a butcher. Daniel .,
De Foe, in the commencement of his career; engaged i I h
in trade: from the business of a hosier he passed to
that of a pantile maker, without any good fortune.
Either from want of prudence, or from dislike to his
occupations, the only reward of his schemes was em-
barrassment and distress.

In the speculations of the literary world he was
more fortunate. In 170 I', when King William, dur-
ing the violence of parties, was censured for his at-
tachment to, and employment of, foreigners, De Foe
espoused the cause of his monarch, and ridiculed his
enemies in a satirical poem, called, " The true-born
Englishman." This production was honoured with an
enormous sale: and he was encouraged to write an-
other satire, entitled, "Reformation of Manners," in
which he attacked the vices of some persons of emi-
nent rank.

A pamphlet, called, "The shortest way with the
Dissenters," was so mistaken, or so misrepresented,
that it was declared, by the House of Commons, to be
of a libellous nature. De Foe, for his ofi'ence, was
subjected to fine, imprisonment, and even the pillory.
He did not give his enemies much reason to exult over

his despondence; for the subject which he took to amuse
his prison hours, was, "A Hymn to the Pillory."
During his confinement he also undertook the "Re-
view," a periodical work of considerable importance,
in the republic of learning, if, as has been imagined,
it suggested the idea of the Tatler and Spectator,
which have enriched our language with essays of in-
comparable beauty.

De Foe was employed in promoting the union of
England and Scotland, of which event he also wrote
the history. Whatever glory he gained from inter-
fering in the bitter differences of politics, he gained
little solid satisfaction. A second imprisonment,
which he suffered, taught him the fate which he wasDANIEL DE r011. vii

to expect from the animosity of political opponents.
1 He began to take a more quiet and useful path of lite-
i rature in 1715, and published a religious work, called
" The Family Instructor." Of the multitude of his
other productions, specific notice is scarcely necessary.
It is sufficient to mention " The History of the Plague
in 1665 ;" a novel entitled," The History of Colonel
Jack " " A new Voyage round the World by a Com-
Spany of Merchants; " "The History of Roxana;

:9 " The Memoirs of a Cavalier; " " The History of Moll
f Flandersg' " and a book entitled," Religious Court-
ship," which has passed through numerous editions.

But De Foe' s reputation, in the present day, rests
chiefly upon his "Robinson Crusoe,

Fernandez, in the South Sea, he brought away Alex-
ander Selkirk, a Scotch seaman, who, having been
left ashore there, had lived upon the island in desolate
solitude, for the space of four years. When Selkirk
returned to England, it is said that he wrote a narra-
tive of his adventures, and put the papers into the
hands of De Foe, to digest for publication; but that
he ungenerously converted the materials into the cele-
brated History of Robinson Crusoe. Part of this story
may be true, and part false. That De Foe might have
had the inspection of Selkirk's journal, is very possi-
ble ; and by his powers of description, and skill in
composition, he might have expanded into an enter-
taining narrative, what, in its original form, was a dull
and awkward composition. But that he was guilty of
any fraud or injustice towards Selkirk, is a suspicion
which his character of general integrity should induce
us to reject. As there is no credible proof against him,
we are bound to give him an acquittal; both because
he is not able to vindicate himself, and one who has
so entertained the rising generation, has more than

an ordinary right not to be condemned upon doubtful
accusation.

Daniel De Foe died at Islington, in the year 1731.
His daughter was respectably settled in life, by marry-
ing Henry Baker, an eminent naturalist.

nation to this led me so strongly against the will, nay,
the commands of my father, and against all the en-
treaties and persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in
that propension of nature, tending directly to the life
of misery which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my
design. He called me one morning into his chamber,
where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated
very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked
me what reasons, more than a wandering inclination,
I had for leaving my father's house, and my native
country; where I might be well introduced, and had
a prospect of rising my fortune by application and
industry, with alife of ease and pleasure. He told me
it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of
aspiring superior fortunes on the other, who went
- abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and
make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature
out of the common road; that these things were all
too far above me, or too far below me; that mine was
the middle state, or what might be . called the upper
station of low life, which he had found, by long ex-

erience, was the best in the world, the most suited to

uman happiness, not exposed to the miseries and
hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic,
and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, and env of
the upper part of mankind He told me, Imightju ge
of the happiness of this state by this one thing, viz., that
this was the state of life which all other people envied;
that kings have frequently lamented the miserable con-
sequences of being born to great things, and wished
they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes,
between the mean and the great; that the Wise man
gave histesti'mony to this, as the just standard of true fe-
licity, when he prayed neither to have poverty norriches.

He bade me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the u};-
per and lower part of mankind; but that the mid e
stations had the fewest disasters, and were not exposed
to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of
mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many dis-
tempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as
those were, who, by vicious living, luxury, and extra-
vagances, on one hand, or by hard labour, want of
necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet, on the
other hand, bring distem ers upon themselves by the
natural consequences of t eir way of living; that the
middle station of life was calculated for all kind of
virtues, and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and

plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that . -'.

temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all
agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were ,

i.)
~31

the blessings attending the middle station of life ; that 33'
this way men went silently and smoothly through thes'fi-t

world, and comfortably out of it; not embarrassed

with the labours of the hands, or of the head; not

sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed-
with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of '

peace, and the body of rest; nor enraged with the. 4h
passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition $5.

for great things: but in easy circumstances, sliding
gently through the world, and sensibl tasting the
sWets of living without the bitter; fee ing that they
are happy, and learning by every day's experience to
know it more sensibly,

After this, be pressed me earnestly, and in the most
afi'ectionate manner, not to precipitate myself
into miseries which nature, and the station of

n 2
life I was born in, seemed to have provided
against; ,that I was under no necessity of seeking my
bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour
to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had
just been recommending to me ; and that if I were not
very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere
fate, or fault, that must hinder it; and that he should
have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his
duty in warning me against measures which he knew
would be to my hurt. In award, that as he would do
very kind things for me, if I would stay and settle at
home as he directed ; so he would not have so much
hand in my misfortunes, as to give me any encourage-
ment to go away : and to close all, he told me, I had
my elder brother for an example, to whom he had
used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from
going into the Low Country wars; but could not pre-
vail, his young desires prompting him to run into the
army, where he was killed : and though he said he
would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture
to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God
would not bless me; and I would have leisure here-
after to reflect upon having neglected his counsel,
when there might be none to assist in my recovery.

I observed in this last part of discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not
know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the tears
run down his face very plentifully, especially when he
spoke of my brother who was killed : and that when
he spoke of my having leisure to repent and none, to
assist me, he was so moved, that he broke off the dis-
course, and told me, his heart was so full, he could say
no more to me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as in-
deed who could be otherwise ? And I resolved not tononm'sox cnuson. -5

think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home
according to my father's desire. But, alas ! a few
days wore it all off ; and in short, to prevent any of
my father's further importunities, in a few weeks I re-
solved to run quite away from him. However, I did
not act so hastily neither, as the first heat of my resolu-
tion prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I
thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, and told
her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing
the world, that 1 should never settle to anything with
resolution enough to go through with it ; and my father
had better give me his consent, than force me to go
without it : that I was now eighteen years old, which
was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an
attorney ; that I was sure, if I did, I should never
serve out my time, but I should certainly run away
from my master before my time was out, and go to
sea: and if she would speak to my father to let me go
one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not-
like it, I would go no more, and I would promise by
a double diligence, to recover the time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion. She teld
me, she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to
my father upon any such subject; that he knew too

well what was my interest, to give his consent to any
thing so much for my hurt; and that she wondered

how I could think of any such thing, after the dis-
course I had with my father, and such kind and ten-
der expressions, as she knew my father had used to
me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there
was no help for me; but I mi ht depend I should
never have their consent to it: t at, for her part, she
would not have so much hand in my destruction ; and
I should never have it to say, that my mother was

willing, when my father was not.
B 3
Though my mother refused to move it to my father,
yet I heard afterward that she reported all the dis-
course to him; and that my father, after showing a
great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, 'That
the boy might be happy, if he would stay at home ,
but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable
wretch that ever was born; I can give no consent
to it.'

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the mean time I continued obstinately
deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and fre-
quently expostulating with my father and mother about
their being so positively determined against what they
knew my inclination prompted me to. But being one
day at Hull, whither I went casually, and without any
purpose of making an elopement that time; but, I
say, being there, and one of my companions being
going by sea to London, in his father's ship, and
prompting me to go with them, with the common al-
lurement of a sea-faring man, that it should cost me
nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor
mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of
it: but leaving them to hear of it as they might, with-
out asking God's blessing, or my father's, without any
consideration of circumstances or consequences, and
in an ill hour, God knows, on the first of September,
165 l , I went on board a ship bound for London.
Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe,
began sooner, or continued, longer, than mine. The
ship was no sooner got out of the Humber, but the wind
began to blow, and the sea to rise, in a most fright-
ful manner; and as I had never been at sea before, I
was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in
mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what
I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the
judgment of Heaven, for my wickedness in leaving
my father's house, and abandoning my duty. All the
good counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my
mother's entreaties, came. now fresh into my mind;
and my conscience, which was not yet come to the
pitch of hardness to which it has been since, reproached
me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of my
duty to God and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went
very high, though nothing like what I have seen many
times since; no, nor .what I saw a few days after.
But it was enough to affect me then, who was but a
young sailor, and have never known any thing of the
matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed
us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I
thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we
should never rise more. In this agony of mind, I
made many vows and resolutions, that if it pleased
God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got
once my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly
home to my father, and never set it into a ship again
while I lived: that I would take his advice and never
run myself into such miseries as these any more.
Now I saw, plainly the goodness of his observations
about the middle station of life, how easy, how com-
fortable, he had lived all his days, and never been ex-

posed to tern ests at sea or troubles on shore : and, in -'

short, I reso ved that I would like a true repenting
prodigal go home to my father,

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time
after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the
sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it.
However I was very grave all that day, being also a
little 4_ sea-sick still: but towards night the weather
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming
fine evening followed: the sun went down perfectly
clear, and rose so the next morning; and having lit.
tle or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining
upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delight-
ful that ever I saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more
sea-sick, but very cheerful ;- looking with wonder
upon the sea, that was so rough and terrible the day
before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so lit-
tle a time after. And now, lest my resolution should
continue, my companion, who indeed had enticed me
away, comes to me: ' Well, Bob,' says he, clapping
me upon the shoulder, 'how do you do after it? I
warrant you were frighted wa'n't you, last night, when
it blew but a capfull of wind ?' ' A capfull d'you call
it?' said I, "twas a terrible storm.' 'A storm you
fool you i ' replies he: ' do you call that a storm ?
Why it was nothing at all; give us but a good shi
and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squa l
of wind as that: but, you're but a fresh-water
sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of bunch, and
we'll forget all that. D'you see what charming
weather 'tis now ?' To make short this sad part of my
story, we went the way of all sailors: the punch was
made, and I was made half drunk with it, and in that
one night's wickedness I drowned all my re-
pentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct,
and all my resolutions for the future. In a word,
as the sea was returned to its smoothness of
surface, and settled calmness, by the abatement of that
storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my
fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the
sea being forgotten, and the current. of former desires
returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises thatnomnsox causoa. . 9

I made in my distress. I found indeed some intervals
of reflection, and the serious thoughts did, as it were,
endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook
then off, and roused myself from them, as it were from
a distemper; and applying myself to drinking and
company, soon mastered the return of those fits (for
so I called them); and I had, in five or six days, got
as complete a victory over conscience, as any young
fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could de-
sire. But I was to have another trial for it still; and
Providence, as in such cases generally it does, re-
solved to leave me entirely without excuse: for if I
would not take this for a deliverance, the next was
to be such a one, as the worst and most hardened
wrelch among us would confess both the danger and
the mercy.

The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into
Yarmouth Roads: the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since' the storm. Here we were obliged to come to
an anchor: and here we lay, the wind continuing con-
trary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight days:
during which time a great many ships from Newcastle
came into the same roads, as the common harbour
where the ships might wait for a wind for the river.

\Ve had not, however, rid here so long, but we
should have tided it up the river, but that the wind
blew too fresh; and, after we had lain four or five
days, blew very hard. However the roads being
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good,
and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were un-
concerned, and not in the least apprehensive of dan-
ger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the

manner of the sea: but the eighth day in the morning .

the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to

'7'!
strike our top-masts, arid make everything snug and

close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible.
' By noon, the sea went very high indeed, and our ship
rode forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought
once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which
our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we
rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables Veered
out to the better end.

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and
now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces
even of the seamen themselves. The master though
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet, as
he went in and out of his cabin b me, I could hear
him, softly to himself, sa severa times, ' Lord, be
merciful to us ! \Ve sha l be all lost: we shall be all
undone ! ' and the like. During these first hurries I
was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the
steerage, and cannot describe my temper. I_could ill
resume my first penitence, which I had so apparently
trampled upon, and hardened myself against.
thought the bitterness of death had been past; and
that this would be nothing too, like the first. But
when the master himself came by me, as I said just
now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully
frighted. I got up out of my cabin, and looked out;
but such a dismal sight I never saw ,- the sea went
mountains high, and broke upon us every three or
four minutes. When I could look about, 1 could
see nothing but distress round us. Two ships that
rid near us, we found had cut their masts by the
board, being deep loaden ; and our men cried out, that
a ship, which rid about a mile ahead of us was
foundered. Two more ships, being driven from their
anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all adven-
tures, and that not with a mast standing. The light
ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the

sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close
by us, running away, with only their sprit-sail out, be-
fore the wind.

Towards the evening, the mate and boatswain beg-
ged the master of our ship to let them cut away the
fore-mast which he was very unwilling to do ; but the
boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the

ship would founder, he consented: and when they ,

had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so
loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged
to cut her away also, and make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in
at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had
been in such a fright before at but a little. But, if I
can express at this distance the thoughts I had-about
me at that time, I was in ten-fold more horror of
mind upon account of my former convictions, and the
having returned from them to the resolutions I had
wickedly taken at first, then I was at death itself;
and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me
into such a condition that I can by no words describe
it. But the worst was not come yet: the storm con-
tinued with such fury, that the seamen themselves
acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had
a good ship, but she was deep loaden, and so swallowed
in the sea, that the seamen every now and then cried
out she would founder. It was my advantage in one
respect, that _ I did not know what they meant by
founder, till I inquired. However, the storm was
so violent, that I saw what is not often seep, the mas-
ter, the lloatswain, and some others more sensible
than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every
moment that the ship would go to the bottom. In
the middle of the night, and under all the rest of
our distresses, one of the men that had been down
on purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a leak;
another said, there were four feet water in the hole.
Then all hands were called to the pump. At that very
word my heart, as I thought, died within me; and I
fell backwards upon the side of the bed where I sat,
into the cabin. However the men roused me, and told
me, that I that was able to do nothing before, was as
well able to pump as another; at which I stirred up,
and went to the punip, and worked very heartily.
\Vhile this was doing, the master who seeing some
light colliers, which not able to ride out the storm,
were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would
come near us, ordered to fire. a gun as a signal of dis-
tress. I, who knew nothing what that meant, was so
surprised, that I thought the ship had broken, or some
dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so sur-
prised that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a
time when every body had his own life to think of, no-
body minded me, or what was become of me : but an-
other man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me
aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been
dead ; and it was a great while before I came
to myself.

We worked on, but the watcrincreasingin the hole,
it was apparent that the ship would founder; and
though the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was
not possible she could swim till we might run into any
port, so the master continued firing guns for help;
and a light_ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us,
ventured a.boat out to help us. It was with the ut-
most hazard the boat came near us; but h was im-
possible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie
near the ship-side, till at last the men rowing very
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our
men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it,
and then veered it out a great length, which they,
after much labour and hazard, took hold of ;' and we
hauled them close under our stern, and got into their
boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after we
were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own
ship: so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull
her in towards shore as much-as we could; and our
master promised them, that if the boat was staved upon
shore, he would make it good to their master. So
partly rowing, and artly driving, our boat went away
to the northward, s oping towards the shore, almost as
far as Wintertonness.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour
out of our ship, but we saw her sink: and then I
understood, for the first time, what was meant by a
ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had
hardly eyes to look up, when the seamen told me she
was sinking; for, from that moment, they rather put
me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in;
my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with
fright, partly with horror, of mind, and the thoughts
of what was yet before me. ' ' '

While we were in this condition, the men yet
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see (when our boat mounting the waves, we
were able to see the shore) a great many people running
along the strand to assist us when we should come
near. But we made but slow wa towards the shore;
nor were we able to reach the s ore, till, being past '
the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the
westward towards Cromer; and so the land broke off
a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in;
and, though not without much difficulty, got all safe
on shore; and walked afterward on foot to Yarmouth, . _ g

c L.

.a- a",
where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great
humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who
assigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants
and owners of ships ; and had money given us sufficient
to carry us either to London, or back to Hull, as we
thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull,
and have gone home, I had been happy, and my
father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's parable,
had even killed the fatted calf for me; for, hearing
the ship I went away in was cast. away in Yarmouth
roads, it was a great while before he had any assurances
that I was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy
that nothing could resist; and though I had several
times loud calls from my reason, and my more com-
posed judgment, to go home, yet I had no power to do
it. I know not what to call this; nor will I urge,
that it is a secret overruling decree, that hurries us on
to be the instruments of our own destruction, even
though it be before us, and that we push upon it with
our eyes open, Certainly, nothing but some such
decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it
was im ossible for me to escape, could have pushed me
forwar against the calm reasonings and persuasions of
my most retired thoughts, and against two such visible
instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.

' My comrade, who had helped to harden me before,
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
- than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for
we were separated in the town to several quarters; I
say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone was
altered; and, looking very melancholy, and shaking

his head, asked me how I did: and telling his fatherROBINSON 0311503. 15

who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for
a trial, in order to go farther abroad ; his father turning
to me with a very grave and concerned tone, ' Young
man,' says he, ' you ought never to go to sea any
more; you ought to take this for a plain and visible
token, that you are not to be a seafaring man.' ' Why,
sir,' said I, 'will you go to sea no more?' ' That is
another case,' said he; 'it is my calling, and therefore
my duty; but, as you made this voyage for a trial,
you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what
you are to expect if you persist: perhaps all this has
befallen us on your account, like J ouah in the ship of
Tarshish. Pray,' continued he, 'what are you ? and
on what account did you go to sea ?' Upon that I told
him some of my story; at the end of which he burst
out with a strange kind of passion. ' What had I done,'
says he, 'that such an unhappy wretch should come
into my ship ? I would not set my foot in the same
ship with thee again for a thousand pounds !' This
indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which
were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was
farther than he could have authority to go. However,
he afterward talked very gravely to me, exhorting me
to go back to my father, and not tempt Providence to
.my ruin ; told me I might see the visible hand of
Heaven against me : ' And, young man,' said he, -
' depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you
go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and dis-
appointments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon
you.'

We parted soon after; for I made him little answer,
and I saw him no more : which way he went, I know
not. As for me, having some money in my pocket, I
travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on
the road, had many struggles with myself, what course

0 2
of life I'should take, and whether I should go home,
or go to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions
that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately oc-
curred to me how I should be laughed at among the
neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my
father and mother only, but even every body else.
From whence I have since often observed how incon-
gruous and irrational the common temper of mankind
is, especially of - youth, to that reason that ought to
guide them in such cases; viz. that they are not as-
hamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not
ashamed of the action, for which they ought justly to
be esteemed fools; but are ashamed of thereturning,
which only can make them esteemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time,
uncertain what measures to take, and what course of
life to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to
going home; and, as I stayed awhile, the remembrance
of the distress I had been in wore off: and as that
abated, the little motion I had in my desires wore off
with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it,
and looked out for a voyage.

That evil influence which carried me first away from
my father's house, which hurried me into the wild and
indigested notion of raising my fortune, and that im-
pressed those conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make
me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties, and
even the commands, of my father: I say, the same
influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfor-
tunate of all enterprises to my View; and I went on
board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa, or, as our
sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune, that, in all these ad-
ventures, I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned the
duty and office of a fore-mast man and in time might
have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for
a master. But as it was always my fate to choose for
the worse, so I did here; for, having money in my
pocket, and good clothes on my back, I would always
go on board in the habit of a gentleman; and so I
neither had any business in the ship, nor learned to do
an .

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen to
such loose and unguided yqung fellows as 1 then was ;
the devil, not omitting to lay some snare for them very
early: but it was not so with me. I first fell ac-
quainted with the master of the ship who had been on
the coast of Guinea, and who, having had very good
success there, was resolved to go again. This captain,
taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not
disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I had a mind
to see the world, told me, if I would go the voyage
with him, I should be at no expense; I should be his

messmate, and his companion; and if I could carry
any thing with me, I should have all the advantage of

it that the trade would admit; and perhaps I might
meet with some encouragement.

I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest plain-
dealing man, went the voyage with him ; and carried
a small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested
honesty of my friend the captain, I increased very
considerably; for I carried about 40!. in such trifles as
the captain directed, me to buy. This 40!. I had
mustered together by the assistance of some of my
relations whom I corresponded with, and who, I

C 3
believe, got my father, or at least my mother, to con-
tribute so much as that to my first adventure.

This was the only voyage which I ma say was suc-
cessful in all my adventures, and which I owe to the
integrity and honesty of my friend the captain: under
whom I also got a competent knowledge of the ma-
thematics, and the rules of navigation; learned how
to keep an account of the ship's course, take an ob-
servation, and, in short, to understand some things
that were needful to be understood by a sailor: for,
as he took delight to instruct me, I took deli ht to
learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me 0th a
sailor and a merchant: for I broughthome five pounds
nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which
yielded me in London, at my return, almost 300i. ;
and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which
have since so com leted my ruin.

Yet, even in t is voyage, I had my misfortunes
too; particularly that I was continually sick, being
thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive heat
, of the climate, our principal trading being upon the
coast, from the latitude of 15 degrees N, even to the
line itself.

I was now set up for 3 Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again: and
I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his
mate in the former voyage, and had now got the com-
mand of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage
that ever man made; for though I did not carry quite
1001. of my new-gained wealth, so that I had 200i.
left, and which I lodged with my friend's widow, who
was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes
in this voyage; and the first was this; viz. our ship,
making her course towards the Canary islands, or
rather between those islands and the African shore,
was surprised in the gray of the morning by a Moorish
rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail
she could make. \Ve crowded also as much canvas as
our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have
got clear; but, finding the pirate gained upon us, and
would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we
prepared to fight; our ship having twelve guns, and
the rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he
came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as
he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on .
that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire, and
pouring in also his small shot from near two hundred
men which he had on board. However, we had not a
man touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared
to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but,
laying us on board the next time upon the other quar~
ter, he entered ninety men upon our decks, who im-
mediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and
riggino. We plied them with small shot, half-pikes,
powder- chests, and such like, and cleared our decks of
them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy
part of our story, our ship being disabled, and three
of our men killed, and eight wounded, we were ob-
liged to yield ; and were carried all prisoners into
Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors. ---
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended; nor was I carried up the country,
to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men were,
but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper
prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble,
and fit for his business. At this surprising change of
my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable
slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I looked
back upon my father's prophetic discourse to me, that
I should be miserable, and have none to relieve me,
which I thought was now so effectually brought to
pass, that I could not be worse; that now the hand of
Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone without
redemption. But, alas! this was but a taste of the
misery I was to go through, as will appear in the sequel
of this story.

As my new patron or master had taken me home to
his house, so I was in hopes that he would take me
with him when he went to sea again, believing that it
would be some time or other his fate to be taken by a
Spanish or Portugal man of war; and that then I
should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was
soon taken away ;' for when he went to sea, he left
me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house; and
when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered
me to lie in the cabin, to look after the ship.

We were frequently out with this boat a fishing;
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he
never went without me. It happened one day, after
I had been with him about two years, that he had ap-
pointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or
for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction,
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and
had therefore sent on, board the boat over night a
larger store of provisions than usual; and had ordered
me to get ready three fusils with powder and shot,
which were on board his ship; for that they designed
some sport of fowling as well as fishing.

I got all things ready, as he had directed; and
waited the next morning with the boat washed clean,
her ancient and pendants out, and every thing to ac,--
commodate his guests; when, by and by, my patron
came on board alone, and told me his guests had put
oii' going, upon some business that fell out, and or-
dered me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out
with the boat, and catch them some fish, for that his
friends were to sup at his house. He commanded me
too, that as seen as I :had got some fish, I should
bring it. All which I prepared to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I-was like
to have a little ship at my command; and my master
being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fish-
ing, but for a voyage: though I knew not, neither
did I so much as consider, whither I would steer; for
any where to get out of that place was my way.

My first" contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our subsist-
ence on board; for I told him we must not presume
to eat of our patron's bread. He said, that was true;
so he broughta large basket of rusk or biscuit, of their
kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the boat.
I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which,
it was evident by the make, were taken out of some
English prize, and I conveyed them into the boat,
while the Moor was on shore, as if they had been
there before for our master. I conveyed also a great
lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed abOut
half a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of ,which
were of great use to us afterwards: especially the wax
to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him,
which he innocently came into also. His name was
Ismael, whom they called Muley, or Moley; so I
called to him: ' Moley,' said I, our patron's guns are
all on board the boat: can you not get a little powder
and shot? it may be we may kill some alcomies (a
fowl like our curlews) for ourselves ; for I know he
keeps the gunner's stores in the ship.' ' Yes,' says he,
'I'll bring some.' Accordingly he brought a great
leather pouch, which held about a pound and a half of
powder, or rather more; and another with shot, that
had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all
into the boat. At the same time I had found some
powder of my master's in the great cabin, with which
I filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was
almost empty, pouring what was in it into another;
and thus furnished with every thing needful, we sailed
out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the
entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no
notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the
port, before we hauled in our sail, and sat us down to
fish. The wind blew from the N. N. E. which was
contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly, I
had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and
at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolu-
tions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone
from that horrid place where I was, and leave the rest
to fate.

After we had fished some time, and catched nothing
(for when I had fish on my hook, I would not pull
them up, that he might not see them), I said to the
Moor, ' This will not do : our master will not be thus
served. We must stand farther ofi'.' He, thinking
no harm, agreed; and being in the head of the boat,
set the sails, and, as I had the helm, I run the boat
out near a league farther, and then brought her to,
as if I would fish; when, giving the boy the helm, I
stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making
as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him
by surprise with my arm under his twist, and tossed
him clear overboard into the sea. He rose imme-
diately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me,
begged to be taken in, told me he would go all over
the world with me. He swam so strong after the
boat, that he would have reached me very quickly,
there being but little wind ; upon which I stepped
into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling pieces,
I presented it at him, and told him I had done him
no hurt, and if he would be quiet, I would' do him
none: ' But,' said I, ' you swim well enough to reach
the shore, and the sea is calm; make the best of your
way to shore, and I will do you no harm; but if you
come near the boat, I'll shoot you through the head,
for I am resolved to have my liberty.' So he turned
himself about, and swam for the shore, and I make
no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an
excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was no
venturing to trust him. When he was gone, I turned
to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him.
' Xury, if you will be faithful to me, I'll make you a
great man ; but if you will not stroke your face to be
true to me,' that is, swear by Mahomet, and his fa-
ther's heard, I must throw you into the sea too.' The
boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that
I could not mistrust him ; and swore to be faithful to
me, and go all over the world with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swim:
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me
gone towards the Strait's mouth (as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been supposed
to do) ; for who would have supposed we were sailed
on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian coast,
where whole nations of Negroes were sure to Surround
us with their canoes, and destroy us ; where we could
never once go on shore, but we should be devoured by
savage beasts, or more merciless savages of human
kind ?

But, as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I
changed my course, and steered directly south and by
east, bending my course a little towards the east, that
I might keep in with the shore; and, having a fair
fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I made.
such sail, that I believe, by the next day at three
o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land I
could not be less than 150 miles south of Sallee, quite
beyond the emperor of Morocco's dominions, or in-
deed of any other king thereabouts, for we saw no
people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into
their hands, that I would not stop, or go on shore, or
come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till 1 had
sailed in that manner five days; and then the wtnd
shifting to the southward, I concluded also, that if any
of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would
now give over; so I ventured to make to the coast,
and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river,
1 knew not what or where, neither what latitude, what
country, what nation, or what river. I neither saw
nor desired to see any people: the principal thing I
wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in
the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it
was dark, and discover the country ; but as soon as it
was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the
barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of
we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready
to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore
till day. ' Well, Xury,' said I, ' then I won't; but it
may be we may see men by day, who will be as bad
to us as those lions.' ' Then we may give them the
shoot gun,' says Xury, laughing, 'make them run
way.' Such English Xury spoke, by conversing
among us slaves. However, I was glad to see the boy
so cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out of our pa-
tron's case of bottles) to cheer him up. After all,
~Xur 's advice was good, and I took it: we dro ped
our ittle anchor, and lay still all night; I say still: for
we slept none ; for in two or three hours we saw vast
great creatures, we knew not what to call them, of
many sorts, come down to the sea-shore, and run into
the water, wallowing and washing themselves for the
pleasure of cooling themselves; and they made such
{lideous howlings and yellings, that 1 never heard the
ike.

Xury was dreadfull frighted, and indeed so was I
too; but we were bot worse frighted- when we heard
one of the might creatures come swimming towards
our boat: we cou d not see him, but we might hear
him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and fu-
rious beast. Xury said it was a lion. and that it might
be for aught I know. Poor Xury cried out to me to
weigh the anchor, and row away. 'No,' says I,
'Xury, we can slip our cable with a buoy to it, and
go to sea; they cannot follow us far.' I had no sooner
said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it was)
within two cars length, which something surprised
me: however I immediately stepped to the cabin door,
and taking up my gun, fired at him, upon which he
immediately turned about, and swam towards the
shore again.

But it was not possible to describe the horrible
noises and hideous cries and- howlings that were

1)
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as higher
within the country, upon the noise or report of a gun;
a thing, I have some reason to believe, these crea-
tures had never heard before. This convinced me
that there was no going on shore for us in the night
Upon that coast, and how to venture on shore in the
day, was another question too; for, to have fallen into
the hands of any of the savages, had been as bad as to
have fallen into the paws of lions and tigers; at least
we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore
somewhere or other for water, for we had not a pint
in the boat: when or where to get it, was the point.
Xury said if I would let him go on shore with one of
the jars, he would find if there was any water, and
bring some to me. I asked him why he would go,
why I should not go, and he stay in the boat. The
boy answered with so much affection that made me
love him ever after. Says he, ' If wild mans come,
they eat me; you go way.' ' Well, Xury,' said I, ' we
will both go; and if the wild mans come, we will kill
them : they shall eat neither of us.' So I gave Xury
a piece of rush-bread to eat, and a dram out of our
patron's case of bottles, which I mentioned before, and
we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we thought
was proper, and waded on shore, carrying nothing but
our arms, and two jars for water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing
the coming of canoes with savages down the river:
but the boy seeing a low place. about a mile up the
country, rambled to it, and by and by I saw him come
running towards me. I thought he was pursued by
some savage, or frighted with some wild beast, and I
ran forward towards him to help him; but when I
came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his
shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like
a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs. How-
ever, we were very glad of it, and it was very good
meat; but the great joy that poor Xury came with,
was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no
wild mans.

But we found afterward that we need not take such
pains for water, for a little higher up the creek where
we were, we found the water fresh when the tide was
out, which flows but a little way up: so we filled our
jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed, and pre-
pared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of
any human creature in that part of the country.

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I
knew very well that the islands of the Canaries, and
the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off from the
coast. But as I had no instruments to take an obser-
vation to know what latitude we were in, and did not
exactly know, or at least not remember what latitude
they were in, I knew not where to look for them, or
when to stand off to sea towards them, otherwise I
might now easily have found some of these islands.
But my hope was, that if I stood along this coast till
I came to that part, where the English traded, I
should find some of their vessels upon their usual de-
sign of trade, that would relieve and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where I
now was must be that country which, lying between
the emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes,
lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts, the
Negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther south,
for fear of the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it
worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness, and in-
deed both forsaking it because of the prodigious num-
bers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious crea-

D 3
tures which harbour there, so that the Moors use it
for their hunting only, where they go like an army,
two or three thousand men at a time; and indeed for
near a hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw
nothing but a waste uninhabited country by day, and
heard nothing but howlin gs and roarings of wild beasts
by night.

Once or twice in the day-time, I thought I saw the
Pico of Tenerifi'e, being the high top of the mountain
Tenerilfe in the Canaries, and had a great mind to
venture out in hopes of reaching thither; but, having
tried twice, I was forced in again b contrary winds,
the sea also going too high for my ittle vessel; so I
risolved to pursue my first design, and keep along the
s ore.

Several times we were obliged to land for fresh
water, after we had left this place; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the morning, we came to an an-
chor under a little point of water, which was pretty
high,"'and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him
than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells
me that we had best go farther off the shore, 'For,'
says he, 'look, yonder lies a dreadful monster on the
side of that hillock, fast asleep.' I looked where he
pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed; for it
was a terrible great lion, that lay on the side of the
shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill, that hung
asit were a little over him. 'Xury,' said I, 'you
shall go on shore, and kill him.' Xury looked
frighted, and said, ' Me kill ! He eat me at one
mouth!' one mouthful he meant. However, Ifsaid
no more to the boy, but bade him be still, and took
our biggest gun, which was almost musket-bore, and
loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with two
'slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun
with two bullets, and the third (for we had three
pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the
best aim I could with the first piece, to have shot him
into the head; but he lay so with his leg raised a lit-
tle above his nose, that the slug hit his leg about the
knee, and broke the bone. He started up growling
at first, but finding his leg broke,.fell down again, and
then got upon three legs, and gave the most hideous
roar that ever I heard. I was a little surprised that I'
had not hit him on the head : however, I took up the
second iece immediately; and, though he began to
move 0 , fired again, and shot him into the head, and
had the pleasure to see him drop, and making but lit-
tle noise, he lay struggling for life. Then Xury took
heart, and would let me have him go on shore.
' Well, go,' said I. So the boy jumped into the water,
and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore
with the other hand, and coming close to the creature,
put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him
into the head again, which dispatched him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food ;
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
and shot, upon a creature that was good for nothing
to us. However, Xury said he would have some of
him: so he comes on board, and asked me to give
him the hatchet. 'For what, Xury ?' said I. 'Me
cut off his head,' said be. However, Xury could not
cut off his head; but he cut ofl" a foot, and brought it
with him, and it was a monstrous great one.

I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin
of him might one way or other he of some value to us ;
and I resolved to take off his skin if I could. So Xur
and I went to work with him: but Xury was muc
the better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to

I) 3
do it. Indeed it took us up the whole day: but at
last we got off the hide of him, and, spreading it on
the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two
days' time, and it afterward served me to lie upon.

After this stop, we made on to the southward con-
tinually, for ten or twelve days, living very sparingly
on our provisions, which began to abate very much,
and going no. oftener into the shore than we were
obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was to
make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any
where about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes
to meet with some European ship, and if I did not,
I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for
the islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this cape or those islands, and, in a
word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this single
point, either that I must meet with some ship or must
perish. '

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I have said, I began to see that the land
was inhabited; and in two or three places, as we
sailed by, we saw eople stand upon the shore to look
at us: we could a so perceive they were quite black,
and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone
on shore to them, but Xur was my better counsellor,
and said to me, ' No go, 0 go.' However, I hauled
in nearer the shore, that I might talk to them, and I
found they ran along the shore by me a good way. I
observed the had no weapons in their hands, except
one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said
was a lance, and that they would throw them a great
way with good aim: so I kept at a distance, but talked
with them by signs as well as I could, and particularly
made signs for semething to eat. They beckoned to
me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some
meat.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing
to make them amends; but an opportunity offered that
instant to oblige them wonderfully; for while we
were lying by the shore, came two mighty creatures,
one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury,
from the mountains towards the sea: at last one of
them began to come nearer our boat than at first I
expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury
load both the others. As soon as he came fairly within
my reach, I fired, and shot him directly into the head.
Immediately he sunk down into the water, but he
rose instantly, and plunged up and down as if he was
struggling for life; and so indeed he was. He im-
mediately made to the shore; but, between the wound,
which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the
water, he died just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these
poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun: some
of them were ready even to die for fear, and fell down
as dead with the very terror. But when they saw the
creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made
signs to them to come to the shore, they took heart
and came to the shore, and began to search for the
creature. I found him by his blood staining the water,
and by the help of a rope, which I flung round him,
and gave the negroes to haul, they dragged him on
shore, and found that it was a most curious leopard,
spotted and fine to an admirable degree; and the ne-
groes held up their hands with admiration, to think

what it was I killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire,
and the noise of the gun, swam to the shore, and ran
up directly to the mountains from whence they came ;
nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. I
found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh of
this creature, so I was willing to have them take it as
a favour from me, which, when I made signs to them
that they might take him, they were very thankful for.
Immediately they fell to work with him ; and though
they had no knife, yet, with a sharpened piece of
wood, they took off his skin as readily--nay, much
more readily--than we would have done with a knife.
They offered me some of the flesh, which I declined,
making as if I would give it them; but made signs for
the skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought
me a great deal more of their provision, which, though
I did not understand, yet I accepted. Then I made
signs to them for some water, and held out one of my
jars to them, turning its bottom upward, to show that
it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They
called immediately to some of their friends, and there
came two women, and brought a great vessel, made of
earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun: this they
set down for me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore
with my jars, and filled them all three. The women
were as stark naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it
was, and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes, I
made forward for about eleven days more, without of-
fering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out
a great length into the sea, at about the distance of
four or five leagues before me, and, the sea being very
calm, I kept a large ofl'ing to make this point: at
length, doubling the point at about two leagues from
the land, I saw plainly land on the other side, to sea-
ward; then I concluded--as it was most certain, in-
deed--that this was the Cape de Verd, and those the
islands, called from thence Cape de Verd Islands.
However, they were at a great distance, and I could
not well tell what I had best to do ; for if I should be
taken with a fresh wind, I might neither reach one nor
other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped
into the cabin, and sat me down, kury having the
helm, when, on a sudden, the boy cried out, " Master,
master, a ship was a sail! " and the foolish boy was
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs besome
of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I knew
we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I
jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not
only the ship, but what she was; viz., that it was a
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the
Coast of Guinea for Negroes. But, when I observed
the course she steered, l was soon convinced they were
bound some other way, and did not design to go any
nearer to the shore, upon which I stretched out to sea
as much as I could, resolving to speak with them, if
possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they would
be gone by before I could make any signal to them;
but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to
despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their
perspective glasses, and that it was some European

cat, which they supposed must belong to some ship
that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come
up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had my pa-
tron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to them
for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which
they saw ; for they told me they saw the smoke, though
they did not hear the gun. Upon these-signals, they
very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in
about three hours' time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French; but I understood none of
them: but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was
an Englishman; that I had made my escape out of
slavery from the Moors, at Sallee. Then they bade
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.

It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one will
believe, that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it,
from such a miserable and almost be eless condition
as I was in. I immediately offered al I had to the
captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance;
but he generously told me he would take nothing from
me, but that all I had should be delivered safe to me
when I came to the Brazils. ' For,' says he, ' I have
saved your life on no other terms than as I would be
glad to be saved myself; and it may, one time or
other, be my lot to be taken up in the same condition.
Besides,' says he, ' when I carry you to the Brazils,
so great a way from your own country, if I should
take from you what little you have, you will be starved
there, and then I only take away that life Ihave given.
No, no,' says he, ' Signor Inglese (Mr. Englishman),
I will carry you thither in charity, and these things
will help you to buy your subsistence there, and your
passage home again.'

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle ;. for he ordered the
seamen that none should offer to touch anything I
had: then he took everything into his aim possession,
and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I
might have them again, even so much as my three
earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he
saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's
use, and asked me what I would have for it. I told
him he had been so generous to me in everything, that
I could not offer to make any price of the boat, but
left it entirely to him; upon which he told me he
would give me a note of his hand to pay me 80 pieces
of eight for it at Brazil, and when it came there, if
any one offered to give more, he would make it up.
He offered me also 60 pieces of eight more for my
boy, Xury, which I was loath to take; not that I was
not willing to let the captain have him, but I was very
loath to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted
me so faithfully in procuring my own. However, when
I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and
offered me this medium, that he would give the boy
an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned
Christian. Upon this, Xury saying he was willing to
go to him, I let the ca tain have him.

We. had a very goo voyage to the Brazils, and ar-
rived in the Bay te Todos los Santos, or All Saints
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I was
once more delivered from the most miserable of all
conditions of life; and what to do next with myself, I
was to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me I can
never enough remember: he would take nothing of
me for my passage, gave me 20 ducats for the leo-
pard's skin, and 40 for the lion's skin, which I had in
the boat, and caused everything I had in the ship to
be punctually delivered to me; and what I was willing
to sell he bought, such as the'case of bottles, two~ of
my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees'-wax, for I
had made candles of the rest: in a word, I made about
220 pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this
stock I went on shore in the Brazils.

I had not been long here, but, being recommended
to the house of a good, honest man, like himself, who
had an ingenio, as they call it--that is, a plantation
and a sugar-house--I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself, by that means, with the manner of
their planting and making of sugar; and, seeing how
well the planters lived, and how they grew rich sud-
denly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle there,
1 would turn planter among'them; resolving, in the
meantime, to find out some way to get my money
which I had left in London remitted to me. To this
purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalization, I
purchased as much land that was uncured as my money
would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and
settlement, and such a one as might be suitable to the
stock which 1 proposed to myself to receive from Eng-
land.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born
of English parents, whose name was Wells, and in
much such circumstances as I was. I call him neigh-
bour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and we-
went on very sociably together; my stock was but
low, as well as his, and we rather planted for food than
anything else, for about two years. However, we be-
gan to increase, and our land began to come into order,

'so that the third year we planted some tobacco, and
made each of us a large piece of ground ready for
planting canes in the year to come : but we both wanted
help; and now I found, more than before, I had done
wrong in parting with my boy, Xury.

But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right,
was no great wonder. I had no remedy but to go on.
1 was gotten into an employment quite remote to my
genius, and directly contrary to.the life I delighted in,
and for which I forsook my father's house, and broke
through all his good advice; nay, I was coming into
the very middle station, or upper degree of low life,
which my father advised me to before, and which, if I
resolved to go on with, 1 might as well have. sraid at
home, and never fatigued myself in the world, as l
have done: and 1 used often to say to myself, I could
have done this as well in England, among my friends,
as have gone 5,000 miles off to do it, among strangers
and savages in a wilderness, and at such a distance as
never to hear from any part of the world that had the
least knowledge of me.

In this manner 1 used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbour; no work to be
done, but by the labour of my hands; and 1 used to
say, I lived just like a man cast away upon some deso-
late island, that had nobody there but himself. But
how just has it been, and how should all men reflect,
that, when they compare their present condition with
others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to
make the exchange, and be convinced of their former
felicity, by their experience! I say, how just has it'
been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in an
island of mere desolation should be my lot, who had so...--
often unjustly compared it with the life which I then
led, in which, had 1 continued, l had, in all probabi-
lity, been exceedingly prosperous and rich!

I was in some degree settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend, the
captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went back;

E .
for the ship remained there, in providing her loading,
and preparing for her voyage, near three months;
when, telling him what little stock I had left behind
me in London, he gave me this friendly and sincere
advice :--' Signor lnglese,' says he (for so he always
called me), 'if you will give me letters, and a procu-
ration here in form to me, with orders to the person
who has your money in London, to send your effects
to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in
such goods as are proper for this country, I will bring

on the produce of them, God willing, at my return ;
but, since human affairs are all subject to changes and
disasters, I would have you give orders for 1001. ster-
ling, which, you sa , is half your stock, and let the
hazard be run for e first, so that if it come safe, you
may order the rest the same way, and if it miscarry,
you may have the other half to have recourse to for
your supply.'

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the
best course I could take; so I accordingly prepared
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my
money, and a procuration to the Portuguese captain,
as he desired. '

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account
of all my adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I
had met with the Portugal captain at sea, the huma-
nity of his behaviour, and what condition I was now
in, with all other necessary directions for my supply;
and when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he found
means, by some of the English merchants there, to
send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story, to a merchant in London, who resented it
effectually to her; whereupon she not on y delivered
the money, but, out of her own pocket, sent the Por-
tugal captain a very handsome present for his huma-
nity and charity to me.

The merchant in London vested this 1001. in Eng-
lish goods, such as the captain had written for, sent
them directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them
all safe to me to the Brazils; among which, without
my direction for I was too young in my business to
think of them , he had taken care to have all sorts of
tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my planta- '
tion, and which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprised with the joy of it; and m
good steward, the captain, had laid out the 51. whic
my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to
purchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for
six years' service, and would not accept of any consi-
deration, except a little" tobacco, which I would have
him accept, being of my own produce.

Neither was this all; but my goods being all Eng-
lish manufactures, such as cloth, stuff, baize, and
things particularly valuable and desirable in the coun-
try, I found means to sell them to a great advantage;
so that I may say, I had more than four times the
value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond
my poor neighbour--I mean in the advancement of
my plantation ; for the first thing I did, I bought me
a Negro slave, and a European servant also: I mean
another besides that which the captain brought me

from Lisbon.

But, as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with
me. I went on the next year with great success in my
plantation; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my

own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessa-
' E 2
ries among my neighbours; and these fifty rolls being
each of above lOOlbs. weight, were well cured, and
laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon.
And now, increasing in business and wealth, my head
began to be full of projects and undertakings beyond
my reach--such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the
best heads in business. _

Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me,
for which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet,
retired life, and which he had so sensibly described
the middle station of life. to be full of; but other things
attended me, and l was still to be the wilful agent of
all my own miseries : and particularly to increase my
fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which,
in my future sorrows, I should have leisure to make.
All these miscarriages were procured by my apparent
obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wander-
ing abroad. and pursuing that inclination, in contra-
diction to the clearest views of doing myself good in a
fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and those
measures of life, which Nature and Providence con-
curred to present me with, and to make my duty.

As I had once done thus in breaking away from my
parents, so 1 could not be content now; but I must go
and leave the happy view I had of being a rich and
thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a
rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the
nature of the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself
down again into the deepest gulf of human . misery
that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent
with life, and a state of health in the world.

To come, then, by just degrees to the particulars of
this part of my story :--You may suppose that, having
now lived almost four years in the Brazils, and begin,-
ning to thrive and prosper very well upon my planta-
tion, I had not only learned the language, but had .
contracted acquaintance and friendship among my fel-
low-planters, as well as among the merchants of St.
Salvadore, which was our port, and that, in my dis-
course among them, I had frequently given them an
account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the
manner of trading with the Negroes there, and how
easy it was to purchase upon the coast, for trifles, such
as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass,
and the like, not only gold-dust, Guinea grains, ele-
phants' teeth, &c., but Negroes for the service of the
Brazils, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying Negroes, which was a
trade, at that time, not only not far entered into, but,
as far as it was, had been carried on by the assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and
engrossed in the public stock, so that few Negroes
were bought, and those excessively dear. .

It happened, being in company one day with some .
merchants and planters of my acquaintance, and talk-
ing of those things very earnestly, three of them came -
' to me the next morning, and told me they had been
musing very much upon what I had discoursed of with
them the last night, and they came to make a secret
proposal to me; and, after enjoining on me secrecy, they
told me that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to
Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as I, and
were straitened for nothing so much as servants ; that
as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because
they could not ublicly sell the Negroes when they
came home, so they desired to make but one voyage,
to "bring the Negroes on shore privately, and divide

E 3
them among their own plantations; and, in a word,
the question was, whether I would go their supercargo
in the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast
of Guinea; and they offered me that I should have
my "equal share of the Negroes, without providing any
part of the stock.

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had '
it been made to any one that had not had a settlement
and plantation of his own to look after, which was in
a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and with
a good stock upon it. But for me that was thus esta-
blished, and had nothing to do but. go on as I had be-
gun for three or four years more, and to have sent for
the other 1001. from England, and who, in that time,
and with that little addition, could scarce have failed
of being worth 3,0001. or 4,0001. sterling, and that
increasing too ; for me to think of such a voyage, was
the most preposterous thing that ever man, in such
circumstances, could be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could
no more resist the offer, than I could restrain my first
rambling designs, when my father's good counsel was
lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go
with all my heart, if they would undertake to look
after my plantation in my absence, and would dispose
of it to such as I should direct, if I miscarried. This
they all engaged to do, and entered into writings, or
covenants, to do so; and I made a formal will, dis-
posing of my plantation and effects, in case of my
death--making the captain of the ship that had saved
my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliging him
to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will ;
one-half of the produce being to himself, and the
other to be shipped to England.

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my
effects, and to keep up my plantation. Had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own
interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought
to have done, and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking;
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum-
stance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with
all its common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons
I had to expect particular misfortunes to myself.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the die-
tates of my fancy, rather than my reason; and, ac-
cordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo fur-
nished, and all things done as by agreement by my
partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil
hour again, the 1st of September, 1659, being the
same day eight years that I went from my father and
mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their au-
thority, and the fool to my own interest.

Our ship was about 120 tons burden, carried six
guns, and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy,
and myself. We had on board no large cargo of goods,
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the
Negroes; such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd
trifles--especially little looking-glasses, knives, scis-
sors, hatchets, and the like.

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing
away to the northward u n our own coast, with de-
sign to stretch over for t e African coast, when they
came into about ten or twelve degrees of northern la-
titude, which, it seems, was the manner of their course
in those days. We had very good weather, only ex-
cessively hot all the way upon our own coast, till we
came to the height of Cape St. Augustino, from
whence, keeping farther ofi~ at sea, we lost sight of
land, and steered as if we were bound for the Isle of

a
Fernand de N orouba; holding our course N.E. by N .,
and leaving those isles on the east. In this course we
passed the line in about twelve days' time, and were,

y our last observation, in 7 degrees, 2'2 minutes,
northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurri-
cane, took us quite out of our knowledge; it began
from the south-east, came about to the north-west, and
then settled into the north-east--from whence it blew
in such a terrible manner, that, for twelve days toge-
ther, we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding
away before it, let it carry us wherever fate, and the
fury of the winds, directed: and during these twelve
days, I need not say that I expected every day to be
swallowed up; nor did any in the ship expect to save
their lives.

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and one
man and the boy washed overboard. About the twelfth
day, the weather abating a little, the master made an
observation as well as he could, and found that he was
in about 11 degrees of north latitude, but that he was
22 degrees of longitude difference west from Cape St.
Augustino; so that he found he was gotten upon the
coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond
the river Amazones, towards that of the river Oro-
noque, commonly called the Great River: and now he
began to consult with me what course he should take;
for the ship was leaky, and very much disabled, and
he was for going directly back to the coast of Brazil.

I was positively against that; and, looking over the
charts of the sea-coast of America with him, we con-
cluded there was no inhabited country for us to have
recourse to, till we came within the circle of the Ca-
ribee Islands; and, therefore, resolved to stand away
for Barbadoes, which, by keeping ofi' at sea, to avoid
the indraught of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might
easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days'
sail; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage
to the coast of Africa, without some assistance, both to
our ship, and to ourselves.

With this design, we changed our course, and steered
away NJV. by W., in order to reach some of our
English islands, where I hoped for relief; but our
voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in the
latitude of 12 degrees, 18 minutes, a second storm
came upon us, which carried us away with the same
impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very
way of all human commerce, that, had all our lives
been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of
being devoured by savages, than ever returning to
our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men, early one morning, cried out, ' Land 1'
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out,
in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were,
but the ship struck upon a sand, and, in a moment,
her motion being so stopped. the sea broke over her in
such a manner, that we expected we should all have
perished immediately; and we were even driven into
our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam
and spray of the sea.

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the
like condition, to describe or conceive the consterna--
tion of men in such circumstances. We knew nothing
where we were, or u on what land it was we were
driven--whether an is and or the main, whether inha-
bited or not inhabited; and as the rage of the wind
was still great, though rather less than at first, we
.could not so much as hope to have the ship bold many
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind
by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately about.
In a word, we sat looking one upon another, and ex-
pecting death every moment, and every man acting
accordingly, as preparing for another world; for there
was little or nothing more for us to do in this: that
which was our present comfort, and all the comfort we
had, was, that, contrary to our expectation, the ship

did not break yet, and that the master said the wind
began to abate.

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship, having thus struck upon the sand,
and sticking too fast for as to expect her getting off,
we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had no-
thing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as
we could. We had a boat at our stern just before the
storm; but she was first staved by dashing against
the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she broke
away, and either sunk, or was driven off to sea; so
there was no hope from her. We had another boat
on board; but how to get her off into the sea, was a
doubtful thing. However, there was no room to de-
bate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces

every minute; and some told us she was actually
broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of
the boat, and, with the help of the rest of the men,
they got her flung over the ship's side; and getting
all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being
eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea:
for though the storm was abated considerably, yet the
sea went dreadfufly high upon the shore, and might
well be called, ' Den wild zee,' as the Dutch call the

sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we
all saw plainly that the sea went so high, that the boat
could not escape, and that we should be inevitably
drowned. As to making sail, we had none; nor, if
we had, could we have done anything with it; so we
worked at the oar towards the land, though with heavy
hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew,
that when the boat came near the shore, she would be ,
dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea.
However, we committed our souls to God in the most
earnest manner; and the wind driving us towards the
shore, we hastened our destruction with our own
hands, pulling, as well as we could, towards land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether
steep or shoal, we knew not: the only hope that could
rationally give us the least shadow of expectation, was,
if we might happen to get into some bay or gulf, or the
mouth of some river, where, by great chance, we might
have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the land,
and perhaps made smooth water. But there was no-
thing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and

nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful than
the sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and plainl
bade us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it too
us with such a fury, that it overset the boat at once,
and, separating us as well from the boat as from one
another, gave us not time hardly to say, '0 God 1' for
we were all swallowed up in a moment. ,

Nothing can describe the confusion of thou ht which.
I felt when I sunk into the water; for thoug I swam
very well, yet I could not deliver myself from the
waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having
driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on to-
wards the shore, and, having spent itself, went back,
and left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead
with the water I took in. I had so much presence of
mind, as well as breath left, that, seeing myself nearer
the main land than I expected, I got upon my feet,
and endeavoured to make on towards the land, as fast
. as I could, before another wave should return, and
take me up again. But I soon found it was impossible
to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as high
as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I
had no means or strength to contend with : my busi-
ness was, to hold my breath, and raise myself upon
the water, if I could, and so, by swimming, 'to preo
serve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the
shore, if possible; my greatest concern now being,
that the wave, as it would carry me a great way to-
wards the shore when it came on, might not carry me
back again with it, when it gave back towards the sea.

The 'wave that came upon me again buried me at
once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own body, and I
could feel myself carried, with a mighty force and
swiftness, towards the shore a very great way; but I
held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still for-
ward with all my might. I was ready to burst with
holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up,
so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands
shoot out above the surface of the water; and though
it was not two seconds of time that I could keep my-
self so, yet it relieved me greatly--gave me breath
and new courage. I was covered again with water a
good while, but not so long but I held it out; and
finding the water had spent itself, and began to return,
I struck forward against the return of the waves, and
felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few
moments to recover breath, and till the water went
from me, and then I took to my heels, and ran with
what strength I had, farther towards the shore. But
neither would this deliver me from the fury of the
sea, which came pouring in after me again; and twice
more I was lifted up by the waves, and carried for-
wards as before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well near been fatal
to me ; for the sea having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or rather dashed me, against a piece of
a rock, and that with such force as it left me senseless,
and, indeed, helpless, as to my own deliverance; for
the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath,
as it were, quite out of my body ; and had it returned
again immediately, I must have been strangled in the
water; but I recovered a little before the return of
the waves, and, seeing I should be covered again with
the water, I resolved to hold fast by a iece of the .
rock, and so to hold my breath, if possi le, till the
wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so high
as at first, being near land, I held my hold till the
wave abated, and then fetched another run, which
brought me so near the shore, that the next wave,
though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up
as to carry me away; and the next run I took, I got
to the main land, where, to my great comfort, I'clam-
bered up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon '
the grass, free from danger, and quite out of the reach
of the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to
look u and thank God that my life was saved, in a
case w erein there was, some minutes before, scarce
any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to ex-
press to the life, what the ecstasies and transports of
the soul are when it is so saved, as _I may say, out of
the grave: and I do not wonder now at that custom,
viz. , that when a malefactor, who has the halter about

1?
his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off,
and has a reprieve brought to him; I say, I do not
wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him
blood that very moment they tell him of it, that the
surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the
heart, and overwhelm him :--

1"or sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands,
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe--reflect-
ing upon all my comrades that were drowned, and
that there should not be one soul saved but myself;
for, as for them, I never saw them afterward, or any
sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and
two shoes that were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly
see it--it lay so far off; and considered, Lord! how
was it possible 1 could get on shore ?

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to see
' what kind of place I was in, and what was next to be
done, and I soon found my comforts abate, and that,
'in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet,
' had no clothes to shift me, nor anything, either to eat
or drink, to comfort me ; neither did I see any pros-

ect before me, but that of perishing with hunger, or
eing devoured by wild beasts: and that which was
particularly afflicting to me was, that I had no weapon
, either to hunt and kill any creature, for my sustenance,
or to defend myself against any other creature that
might desire to kill me for their's. In a word, I had
nothing about me but a knife, 3 tobacco-pipe, and a
little tobacco in a box; this was all my provision, and
this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that, for a
while, I ran about like a madman. Night coming upon
me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what
would be my lot, if there were any ravenous beasts in

that country, seeing at night they always come abroad
for their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that
time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir,
but thorny, which grew near me, and where I re-
solved to sit all night, and consider the next day what
death I should die; for, as yet, I saw no prospect of
life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see
if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did,
to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little
tobacco in my mouth, to prevent hunger, I went to
the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place
myself so as that, if I should sleep, 1 might not fall;
and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for
my defence, I took up my lodging; and-shaving been
excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as
comfortably as I believe few could have done in my
condition; and found myself the most refreshed wit
it that I think I ever was on such an occasion.

When [ waked, it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and
_ swell as before; but that which surprised me most
was, that the ship was lifted off, in the night, from the
sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and
was driven up' almost as far as the rock which 1 first
mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dash-V g
ing me against it. This being within about a mile-
from the shore where l was, and the ship seeming to
Stand upright still, I wished myself on board, that,

r 2
at least, I might save some necessary things for my
use.

When I came down from my apartment in the tree,
I looked about me again ; and the first thing I found
was the boat, which lay as the wind and the sea had
tossed her upon the land, about two miles on my
right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore,
to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of water
between me and the boat, which was about half a mile
broad ; so I came back for the present, being more in-
tent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find
something for my present subsistence.

A little after noon 1 found the sea very calm ; and
the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come within a
quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I found a fresh
renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that if we
had kept on board we had been all safe, that is to say,
we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so
miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort
and company, as I now was. This forced tears from
my eyes again ; but as there was little relief in that,
I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled
off my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity,
and took the water; but when I came to the ship, my
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board;
for as she lay aground, and high out of the water,
there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I
swam round her twice, and the second time I espied
a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see
at first, hang down by the fore chains, so low as that
with great difficulty I got hold of it, and, by the help
of that rope, got up in the forecastle of the ship. Here
I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal
of water in her bold, but that she lay so on the side of
a bank of hard sand or rather earth, that her stern
lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost
to the water; by this means all her quarter was free,
and all that was in that part was dry; for you may be
sure my first work was to search and to see what was
spoiled, and what was free; and first I found that all
the ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the
water; and being very well disposed to eat, I went to
the bread-room, and filled my pockets with biscuit, and
ate it as I went about other things, for 1 had no time
to lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of
which I took a large dram, and which I had indeed
need enough 0f, to spirit me for what was before me.
Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself
with many things which I foresaw would be necessary
to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not
to be had; and this extremity roused my application.
We had several Spare yards, and two large squares of
wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the ship; I re-
solved to fall to work with these, and flung as many of
them overboard as I could manage for their weight:
tying every one with a rope, that they might not
drive away. When this was done, I went down the
ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them
fast together at both ends, as well as I could, in the
form of a raft; and laying two or three short pieces
of plank cross ways, I found I could walk upon it very
well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight,
the pieces being toolight: so I went to work with a
carpenter's saw, I cut a spare top-mast into three
lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal
of labour and pains; but the hope of furnishing my-
self with necessaries encouraged me to go beyond
What I should have been able to have done upon

another occasion.
r 3
My raft was now strong enough to bear any rea-
sonable weight. My next care was what to load it
with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from
the surface of the sea: but I was not long considering
this; I first laid all the planks or boards upon it I
could get, and having considered well what I most
wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests, which I
had broken open and emptied, and lowered them down
upon my raft. The first of these I filled with pro-
visions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five
pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much
u on, and a little remainder of European corn,
which had been laid by for some fowls which we
had brought to sea with us: but the fowls were
killed: there had been some barley and wheat
together, but to my great disappointment, I found
afterward that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all.
As for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belong-
ing to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters,
and in all above five or six gallons of arrack : these I
stowed by themselves, there being no need to put
them into the chest, nor an room for them. While
'I was doing this, I foun the tide began to flow,
though very calm, and I had the mortification to see
my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore
upon the sand. swim away; as for my breeches, which
were only linen and open-knee'd, I swam on board in
them and my stockings. However, this put me upon
rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but
took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had
other things which my eye was more upon: as first,
tools to work with on shore, and it was after long
searching I found out the carpenter's chest, which
was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much more
valuable than a ship-loading of gold would have been
at that time. I got it down to my raft, even whole as
it was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew
in general what it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good fowling-pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols ; these I secured first, with some
powder-horns, a small bag of shot, and two old rusty
swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in
the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed
them, but with much search I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken water: those two I
got to my raft, with the arms. And now I thought
myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I
should get to shore with them, having neither sail,
oar, or rudder, and the least capful of wind would-
have overset all my navigation.

I had three encouragements. First, a smooth, and
calm sea. Secondly, the tide rising and setting
into the shore. Thirdly, what little wind there was,
blew me towards the land. And thus, having found
two or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and'
besides the tools which were in the chest, I found two
saws, an ax and a hammer, and with this cargo I put
to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very
well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the
place where I had landed before, by which I perceived
there was some indraught of the water, and conse-
quently I hoped to find some creek or river there,
which I might make use of as a port to get to land
with my cargo. _

As I imagined so it was; there appeared before me
a little opening of the land. I found a strong current
of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as well as I
could, to keep in the middle of the stream, But here
I had liked to have suffered a second shipwreck, which
if I had, I think verily would have broken my heart;
for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft run aground,
at one end of it, upon a shoal, not being aground at the
other end, it wanted but a little that my cargo had
slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so
fallen into the water: I did my utmost by setting
my back against the chests, to keep them in their
places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my
strength; neither durst I stir from the posture I
was in, but, holding up the chests with all my might,
stood in that manner near half an hour, in which time
the rising of the water brought me a little more. upon
a level; and a little after, the water still rising, my
raft floated again, and l thrust her off with the oar I
had, into the channel, and then driving up higher, I at
length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with
land on both sides, and a strong current of tide running
up. i looked on both sides for a proper place to get
to shore, for l was not willing to be driven too high up
the river, hoping in time to see some ship at sea, and
therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast as
.1 could. '

At length l spied a little cove on the right shore of
the creek, to whichwith great pain and difficulty 1
guided my raft, and at last got so near, as that, reach-
ing ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in ;
but here 1 had liked to have dipped all my cargo in the
sea again; for that shore lying pretty steep, that is to
say, sloping, there was no place to land, but where
one end 0f the float, it ran on shore, would lie so high,
and the other sink lower, as before, that it would en-
danger my cargo again. All that I could do, was to
wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft
with my oar, like an anchor, to hold the side of it
fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which 1384'" -
.mr

Mr. F
_ 'nonmsorz 01113303.. 57

expected the water would flow over; and so it did.
As soon as I found water enough (for my raft drew
about a foot of water), I thrust her upon that flat
piece of ground, and there fastened and moored her,
by sticking my two broken oars into the ground, one
on one side near one end, and one on the other
side near the other end; and thus I ebbed away, and
left all my cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek a
paper place for my habitation, and where to stow my
goods, to secure them from whatever might happen.
Where I was, 1 yet knew not; whether on the con-
tinent or on an island; whether inhabited or not in-
habited; whether in danger of wild beasts or not.
There was a hill not above a mile from me, which
rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to
overtop some other hills, which lay as in a ridge from
it, northward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces,
and one of the istols, and a horn of powder, and, thus
armed, I trave led for discovery up to the top of that
hill, where, after lhad with great labour and difficulty
got up, I immediately saw 11) fate, to my great
affliction : viz. thatI was in an island, environed every
way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some
rocks, which lay a great way off, and two small islands,
less than this, which lay about three leagues to the
west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren,
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, ex-
cept by wild beasts, of which, however, I saw none : @
yet I saw abundance 'offowls, but knew not their kinds,
neither, when I killed them, could I tell what was
fit for food, and what not. At my coming back, I
shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree,
on the side of a large wood. I believe it was the first
gun that had been fired there, since the creation of
the world. I had no sooner fired, but from all the
parts of the wood there arose an extraordinary number
of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming

' and crying, every one according to his usual note;
but not one of them of any kind that I knew. As for
the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of hawk,
its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no talons
or claws more than common; its flesh was carrion,
and fit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on shore,
which took me up the rest of the day. What to do
with myself at night, I knew not, nor indeed where to
rest ; for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not
knowing but what some wild beast might devour me,
though I afterward found there was really no need
of those fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of a but for that night's
lodging : as for food, I yet saw not which way to sup-
ply myself, except that I had seen two or three crea-
tures, like hares, run out of the wood where I shot
the fowl.

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great
many things out of the ship, which would be useful to
me, and particularly some of the rigging and sails, and
such other things as might come to hand, and I re-
solved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if
possible ; and as I knew the first storm that blew
must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to
set all other things apart, till I got every thing out of
the ship that I could get: then I called a council, that
is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should take backnomnsos c'iwsorz. 59

the raft. but this appeared impracticable, so I resolved
to go as before, when the tide was down, and I did-'30,
only that I stripped before I went from my but.
having nothing on but a checkered shirt, a pair of
linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a
second raft ; and having had experience of the first, I
neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard;
but yet I brought away several things very useful to
me; as first, in the carpenter's store I found two or
three bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw jack,
a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above all, that most
useful thing called a grindstone: all these I secured,
together with several things belonging to the gunner
particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels
of musket bullets, seven muskets and another fowling-
piece, with some small quantity of powder more: a
large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet
lead: but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it
up to get it over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes
that I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, hammock,
and some bedding; and with this I loaded my second
raft, and brought them also safe on shore, to my very
great comfort. _ ' '

I was under some apprehensions during my absence
from the land, that at least my provisions might be '
devoured on shore; but when I came back, I found
no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like a
wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came
toward it, ran away, to a little distance, and then stood
still. She sat very composed and unconcerned, and
looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to be ac-
quainted with me. I presented my gun at her; but
as she did not understand it, she was perfectly uncon-
cerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon
which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by
the way I'was not very free of it, for my store was
not great. However I spared her a bit, I say, and
she went to it, smelled it, and eat it, and looked (as
pleased) for more; but I thanked her, and could
spare no more; so she marched of.

Having got my second cargo on shore (though I was
fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring them
by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
casks), I went to work to make a little tent with the
sail and some poles which I cut for the purpose; and
into this tent 1 brought every thing that i knew would
spoil, either with rain or sun: and I piled all the
empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent,
to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from man
or beast.

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with some boards within, and an empty chest set
up on end without, and spreading one of the beds upon
the ground, laying my two pistols, just at my head,
and my gun at length by me, 1 went to bed, for the
first time, and slept very quietly all night, being very
weary and heavy; for the night before 1 had slept
little, and laboured very hard all day, as well to
fetch those things from the ship, as to get them on
Shore.

1 had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that
ever was laid up, I believe, for one man ; but I was
not satisfied still, for while the ship sat upright in
that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing out
of her that 1 could: so every day at low water, I went
on board, and brought away something or other. But
particularly the third time I went, I brought away so
much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small
ropes, and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of
spare canvas, which was to mend the sails upon oc-
casion, and the barrel of wet gun-powder. In a word,
I brought away all the sails first and last, only that I
was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at
a time as I could; for they were no more useful to me
for sails, but as mere canvas only.

But that which comforted me more still, was, that
at last of all, after 1 had made five or six such voy-
ages as these, and thought I had nothing more to ex-
pect from the ship that was worth my meddling with,
I say, after all this, I founda great hogshead of bread,
three large runlets of rum or spirits, a box of sugar.
and a barrel of fine flour: this was surprising to me,
because I had given over expecting any more pro-
visions, except what was spoiled by the water. I
soon emptied the hogshead, of that bread, and wrapt it
up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the Sails, which [cut
out, and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore also,
though at several times.

The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable, and
fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and cutting
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I
got two cables and a haulser on shore, with all the
iron-work I could get; and having cut down the sprit-
sail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and eVery thing I
could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those
heavy goods and came away. But'my good luck be-
gan to leave me, for this raft was so unwieldy, and so
overladen, that after 1 was entered the little cove,
where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being
able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset,
and threw me and all my cargo into the water. As for
myself it was no great harm, for I was near the shore ;

G

A:
but as to my cargo it was a great part of it lost, es-
pecially the iron, which I expected would have been of
great use to me. However, when the tide was out,
1 got most of the pieces of cable ashore. and some of
the iron, though with infinite labour, for l was fain
to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me
very much. After this l went every day on board,
and brought away what 1 could get.

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been
eleven times on board the ship, in which time I had
brought away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed capable to bring, though I believe
verily, had the calm weather held, 1 should have
brought away the old ship, piece by piece. But pre-
paring the twelfth time to go on board, 1 found the
wind began to rise: however, at low water, 1 went
on board ; and though I thought 1 had rummaged the
cabin so effectually, as that nothing more could
be found, yet 1 discovered a locker, with drawers in it,
in one of which I found two or three razors, and one.
pair of large scissors, with ten or a dozen good knives
and forks : in another, 1 found about thirty-six pounds
value in money, some European coin, some Brazil,
some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.

\Vhen I was gotten home to my little tent, I lay
with all my wealth about me very secure: it blew
very hard all that night; and in the morning, when I
looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen ! I
was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this
satisfactory reflection ; viz. that I had lost no time, nor
abated any diligence, to get every thing out of her
that could be useful to me ; and that indeed there was
little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had
had more time. I now gave over any more thongbt
of the ship, or of any thing of her, except what might
drive on shore from her wreck, as indeed divers
pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of
small use to me.

Some days after this, after I had been on board the
ship, and had got all I could out of her, I could not
forbear getting up to the top of a little mountain, and
looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship: then
fancy, at a vast distance, I spied a sail; please my-
self with the hopes of it; and then, after looking
steadilv, till [was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit '
down and weep like a child, and thus increase my
misery by my folly.

But having gotten over these things, in some mea-
sure, and having settled my household stuff and habi-
tation, made me a table and a chair, and all as hand-
some about me as I could, I began, I say, to keep a
journal, of which 1 shall here give you the copy
(though in it will be told all these particularsover
again), as long as it lasted; for at last having no more
ink, I was forced to leave it off.

THE JOURNAL.

SEPTEMBER 30, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson
Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm in
the offing, came on shore on this dismal unfortunate
island, which I called the Island of Despair, all the
rest of the ship's company being drowned, and myself
almost dead.

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at
the dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had
neither food, house, clothes, weapon, or place to fl.
to, and in despair of any relief, saw nothing but deat

G 2'
before me, either that I should be devoured by wild
beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death for
want of food. At the approach of night, I slept in a
tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept soundly,
though it rained all night.

October 1. In the morning I saw, to my great sur-
prise, the ship had floated with the high tide, and was
driven on shore again much nearer the island, which,
as it was some comfort on one hand (for seeing her sit
upright, and not. broken in pieces, I hoped, if the
wind abated, I might get on board, and get some food
and necessaries out of her for my relief), so, on the
other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my
comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all stayed on
board, might have saved the ship, or at least that they
would not have been all drowned, as they were; and
that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have
built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have
carried us to some other part of the world. I spent
great part of this day in perplexing myself on these
things; but at length seeing the ship almost dry, I
went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam
on board. This day also continued raining, though
with no wind at all.

From the lst of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in making several voyages to get
all I could out of the ship, which I brought on shore
every tide of flood upon rafts. Much rain also in
these days, though with some intervals of fair wea-
ther; but, it seems, this was the rainy season.

October 24. I overset my raft, and all the goods I
had got upon it; but being in shoal water, and the
things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them
when the tide was out.

October 25. It rained all night, and all day, with

.3

f"; E
some gusts of wind, during which time the ship broke
in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder than before,
and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her,
and that only at low water. I spent this day in cover-
ing and securing the goods which I saved, that the.
rain might not spoil them.

October 26. I walked about the shore almost all
day to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly
concerned to secure m self from any attack, in the
night, either from wild easts or men. Towards night
I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and marked
out a semicircle for my encampment, which I resolved
to strengthen 'with a work, or wall, or fortification,

made of double. piles, lined within with cable, and
without with turf. '

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceedingly hard.

The Slst, in the morning, I went out into the is-
land with my gun, to see for some food, and discover
the country; when I killed a she-goat, and her kid
followed me home, which I afterward killed also, be-
cause it would not feed. '

November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and
lay there for the first night, making it as large as I
could, with stakes driven in to swing my hammock
upon.

November 2. I set up all my chests and boards,
and the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and
with them formed a fence round me, a little within
the place I had marked out for my fortification.

' November 3. I went out with my gun, and killed
two fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In
the afternoon, went to work to make me a table.

November 4.. This morning I began to order my

G 3
times of work, of going out with my gun, time of
sleep, and time of diversion; viz. every morning I
walked out with my gun, for two or three hours, if it
did not rain ; then employed myself to work till about
eleven o'clock; then eat what I had to live on: and
from twelve to two, I lay down to sleep, the weather
being excessively hot, and then in the evening to work
again. The working part of this day and the next
were wholly employed in making my table, for I was
yet but a very sorry workman, though time and ne-
cessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon
after, as I believe it would do anyone else.

November .5. This day I went abroad with my gun
and my dog, and killed a wild cat; her skin pretty
soft, but her flesh good for nothing. Every creature
I killed, I took off the skins and preserved them.
Coming back, by the seashore, I saw many sorts of
sea-fowls which I did not understand; but was sur-
prised, and almost frighted, with two or three seals,
which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what
they were, got into the sea, and escaped me for that
time.

November 6. After my morning' walk, I went to
work with my table again, and finished it, though not
to my liking; nor was it long before I learned to
mend it.

November 7. Now it began to be settled fair wea-
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th
(for the 11th was Sunday, according to my <<reckon-
ing), I took wholly up to make me a chair, and, with
much ado, brought it to a tolerable shape, but never
to please me; and even in the making I pulled it to
pieces several times. Note, I soon neglected keeping
my Sundays; for, omitting my mark for them on my
post, I forgot which was which. A

- if;
November 13. This day it rained, which refreshed
me exceedingly, and cooled the earth ; but it was ac-
companied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As
soon as it was over, I resolved to separate m stock of
powder into as many little parcels as possib e, that it
might not be in danger.

November H, 15, 16. These three days I spent in
making little square chests or boxes, which might hold
about a pound, or two pounds at most, of powder;
and so putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as
secure and remote from one another as possible. On
one of these three days I killed a large bird that was
good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.

November 17. This day I began to dig behind my'
tent into the rock, to make room for my farther con-
veniency. Note, three things I wanted exceedingly
for this work; viz. a pick-axe, a shovel, and a wheel-
barrow or basket: so I desisted from my work, and
began to consider how to supply that want, and make
me some tools. As for the pick-axe, I made use of
the iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy; but the next thing was a shovel or spade;
this was so absolute] necessary, that indeed I could
do nothing effectual y without it; but what kind of
one to make I knew not.

November 18. The next day, in searching the
woods, I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which,
in the Brazils, they call the iron-tree, for its exceed-
ing hardness: of this, with great labour, and almost _
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home
too with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no
other way, made me a long while upon this machine;
for I worked it effectually, by little and little, into the

r -~.

'1
form of a shovel or spade, the handle exactly shaped

like ours in England, only that the broad part having.

no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me
so long: however, it served well enough for the uses
which I had occasion to put it to: but never was a
shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so long
3 making.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or a
wheel-barrow : a basket 1 could not make by any
means, having no such thing as twigs that would bend
to make wicker-ware, or at least none yet found out;
and, as to the wheel-barrow, 1 fancied 1 could make
all but the wheel ; but that 1 had no notion of, neither
did l know how to go about it: besides, thad no
possible way to make iron gudgeons, for the spindle

or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave it over: and
' so, for carrying away the earth which I dug out of the
cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the labour-
ers carry mortar in, when they serve the bricklayers.

This was not so difficult to me as the making the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt
which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took
me up no less than four days : 1 mean, always except-
ing my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom
failed, and very seldom failed also of bringing home
something fit to eat.

November '23. My other work having stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were
finished 1 went on ; and, working every day as much
as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen
days entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that
it might hold my goods commodiously.

Note, during all this time I worked to make this
room, or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as
a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room,Page 69.
and a cellar; as for a lodging, I kept to the tent, ex-
cept that sometimes in the wet season of the year it
rained so hard, that I could not keep myself dry;
which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
within my pale, with long poles, in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and load them with flags,
and large leaves of trees, like a thatch.

December 10. I began now to think my cave or
vault finished, when, on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large), a great quantity of earth fell down
from the top and one side, so much that, in short, it
frighted me, and not without reason too ; for if I had
been under it, I had never wanted a grave-digger.
Upon this disaster, I had a great deal of work to do
over again: for I had the loose earth to carry out, .
and, which was of more importance, 1 had the ceiling
to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would
come down.

December 11. This day I went to work with it ac-
cordingly, and got two shores or posts, pitched upright
to the top, with two pieces of boards across overeach
post. This I finished the next day ; and setting more
posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the
roof secured; and the posts, standing in rows, served
me for partitions to part ofl" my house.

December 17. From this day to the 20th, I placed
shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts, to hang
every thing up that could be hung up; apd now I he-
gan to he in some order within doors.

December 20. Now I carried every thing into the
cave, and began to furnish my house, and set up some
pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my victuals
upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me.
Also I made me another table.
December 24. Much rain all night and all day:
no stirring out.

December 25. Rain all day.

December 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler
than before, and pleasamer.

December 2?. Killed a young goat, and lamed an-
other, so that I catched it, and led it home in a string;
when I had it home I bound and Splintered up its leg,
which was broke. N. B. I took such care of it, that
it lived, and the leg grew well, and as strong as ever;
but by nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon
the little green at my door, and would not go away.
This was the first time that I entertained a thought of
breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have
food when my powder and shot were all spent.

December 28, 29, 30. Great beats and no breeze;
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the
evening for food. This time I Spent in putting all my
things in order within doors.

January 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad early
and late, with my gun, and lay still in the middle of
the day. This evening, going farther into the valleys,
which lay to the centre of the island, I found there
were plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard
to come at: however, I resolved to try if I could not
bring my dog to hunt them down.

January 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out
with my dog, and set him upon the goats ; but I was
mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog, and
he knew his danger too well, for he would not come '
near them.

January 3. I began my fence or wall, which, being
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I re-
solved to make very thick and strong. I was no less
time than from the 3d of January to the 14th of April,
working, finishing, and perfecting this wall, though it
was no more than about twenty-four yards in length,
being a half circle, from one place in the rock, to an-
other place about eight yards from it, the door of the
cave being in the centre behind it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hinder-
ing me many days, nay, sometimes, weeks together;
but I thought I never should be perfectly secure till
this wall was finished: and it is scarcely credible what
inexpressible labour everything was done with, espe-
cially the bringing .piles out of the woods, and driving
tnem into the ground; for I made them much bigger
than I needed to have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double
fenced, with a turf-wall raised u close to it, I per-
suaded myself, that if any peop e were to come on
shore there, they would not perceive anything like a
habitation: and it was very well I did so. as may be
observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable occasion.

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain admitted me, and
made frequent discoveries in these walks of something
or other to my advantage; particularly I found a kind
of wild pigeon which build not as wood- igeons in a
tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in the oles of the
rocks: and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them 11 tame, and did so; but when they grew
older, they al flew away, which erhaps was at first
for want of feeding them, for I ad nothing to give
them: however, I frequently found their nests, and
got their young ones, which were very good meat.

And now, in the managing my household afi'airs, I
found myself wanting in many things, which I thought
at first it was impossible for me to make, as indeed as
to some of them it was: for instance, I could never

I
make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or
two, as I observed before, but I could never arrive to
the capacity of making one by them, though I spent.
many weeks about it ; I could neither put in the heads,
or join the staves so true to one another, as to make
them hold water; so I gave that also over.

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles;
so that as soon as it was dark, which was generally by
seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remem-
bered the lump of bees-wax, with which I made can-
dles in my African adventure; but I had none of that
now: the only remedy I had, was, that when I had
killed a goat, I saved the tallow, and with a little dish
made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I
added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp: and
this gave me light, though not a clear steady light,
like a candle. In the middle of all my labours it hap-
pened, that, rummaging m things, I found a little
bag, which, as I hinted be ore, had been filled with
corn, for the feeding of poultry, not for this voyage,
but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from
Lisbon : what little remainder of corn had been in the
bag, was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing
in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to
have the bag for some other use (I think it was to put
powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning,
or some such use), I shook the husks of corn out of
it, on one side of my fortification, under the rock.

It was a little before the great rains, just now men-
tioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no notice
of anything, and not so much as remembering that I
had thrown anything there; when, about a month
after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of some-
thing green shooting upon the ground, which I fan-
cied might be some plant I had not seen; but I was
surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a
little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come
out, which were perfect green barley, of the same
kind as our Euro ean, nay, as our English barley.

It is impossib e to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion: 1 had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all; in-
deed I had very few notions of religion in m head,
nor had entertained any sense of anything that ad be-
fallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as we lightly
say, what pleases God; but now I thought these the
pure productions of Providence for my support.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you ma be
sure, in their season, which was about the en of
June; and laying up every corn, I resolved to sow
them all again, hoping in time to have some quantity
sufficient to supply me with bread: but it was not till
the fourth year that I would allow myself the least
grain of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or
thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same
care, and whose use was of the same kind, or to the
same urpose; viz. to make me bread, or rather food;
for l ound ways to cook it up without baking, though
I did that also, after some time. But to return to my
journal.

I worked excessively hard these three or four months,
to get my wall done; and, the 14th of April, I closed
it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door, but over
the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on
theoutside of my habitation.

April 16. I finished the ladder: so I went up with
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me,
and let it down on the inside. This was a complete
enclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and

nothing could come at me from without, unless it
could first mount my wall.

May I. In the morning, looking towards the sea-
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on the
shore, bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a cask;
when I came to it I found a small barrel, and two or
three pieces of the wreck of the shi , which were
driven on shore by an hurricane; and Fooking towards
the wreck itself, I thou ht it seemed to lie higher out
of the water than it use to do. I examined the bar-
rel which was driven on shore, and soon found it was
a barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken water, and
the powder was caked as hard as a stone; however, I
rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went on
upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the
ship, to look for more.

\Vhen I came down to the ship, I found it strangely
removed: the forecastle, which lay before buried in
the sand, was heaved up at least six feet; and the
stern, which was broken to pieces, and parted from
the rest by the force of the sea, soon after I had left
rummaging of her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast
on one side; and the sand was thrown so' high on that
side mm the stern, that whereas there was a great place
of water before, so that I could not come within a
quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, 1
could now walk quite u to her when the tide was out.
I was surprised with t is at first, but soon concluded
it must be done by the earthquake, a violent shock of
which I had felt some days previously; and as by this
violence the ship was more broken upon than formerly,
so many things came daily on shore, which the" sea
had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled

by degrees to the land.
Having resolved to pull every thing to pieces that I
could of the ship, concluding that every thing I could
get from her would be of some use or other to me,

May 3. _I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a
beam through, which I thought held some of the upper
part, or quarter-deck, together: and when I had cut
it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could,
from the side which lay highest: but the tide coming
in I was obliged to give over for that time.

I continued this work every day to the 15th of. June,
except the time necessary to get food, which I alwa s
appointed, during this part of my employment. to e
when the tide was 11 , that I might be ready when it
was ebbed out: and, y this time, I had gotten timber
and plank, and iron work enough to have built a good
boat, if I had known how ; and also I got at several
pieces, near one hundred weight of the sheet-lead.

June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a
large tortoise or turtle; this was the first I had seen,
which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any '
defect of the place, or scarcity; for, bad I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I might have had.
hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards;
but, perhaps, had paid dear enough for them.

June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in
her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at that
time the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted
in my life, having had no flesh but of goats and fowls,
since I landed in this horrible place. '

June 18. Rained all the day, and I staid within.
I thought at this time, the rain felt cold, and I was
fpmetlhing chilly, which I knew was not usual in that

titu e. '

June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather
had been cold.

n2
June 20. N 0 rest all night, violent pains in the head,
and feverish.

June 21. Very ill, frightened almost to death with
the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be sick, and
no help. Prayad to God, for the first time since the
storm ofi' Hull ; but scarce knew what I said, or why:
my thoughts being all confused.

June 22. A little better; but under dreadful ap-
prehensions of sickness.

June 23. Very had again, cold and shivering, and
then a violent head-ach.

June 24. Much better.

June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.

June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak: however
I killed a she-goat, and, with much difliculty, got it
home, and broiled some of it, and eat: I would fain
have stewed it, and made some broth, but had no ot.

June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay a- ed
all day, and neither eat nor drank. I was ready to
perish for thirst; but so weak, I had not strength to
stand up, or to get myself any water to drink ; prayed
to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was
not, I was so ignorant, that I knew not what to say ?
only I lay, and cried, ' Lord, look upon me. ! Lord,
pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!' I suppose
I did nothing else for two or three hours, till the fit
wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not awake till far in
the night. When I awaked, I found myself much re-
freshed, but weak. and exceedingly thirsty: however.
as I had no water in my whole habitation, I was
forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again.

The good advice of my father now came to my
mind, and presently his prediction, which I mentioned
at the beginning of this story; via. That, if I did,
take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I
should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel, when there might be none to
assist me in my recovery. ' Now,' said I, aloud, ' my
dear father's words are come to pass: God's justice
has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me.
I rejected the voice of Providence, which had mer-
cifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein
I might have been happ and easy; but I would
neither see it myself, nor earn to know the blessing
of it from my parents: I left them to mourn over my
folly, and now I am left to mourn under the conse-
quences of it. I refused their help and assistance,
who would have lifted me into the world, and would
have made every thing easy to me: and now I have
difficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature
itself to sipport, and no assistance, no help, no com-
fort, no vice.' Then I cried out, ' Lord, be my-
hel , for I am in great distress !'

his was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But I return to my
journal. .

June 9.8. Having been somewhat refreshed with the
sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got
up; and the first thing I did, I filled a large square
case bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in
reach of my bed; and to take off the chill or agueish
disposition of the water, I put about a uarter of a
pint of rum into it, and mixed them toge er; then I
got me a piece of goat's flesh, and broiled it on the
coals, but could eat very little; I walked about, but
was very weak, and withal, very sad and heavy-hearted
in the sense of my miserable condition, dreading the
return of my distemper the next day: at night I

n 3
made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I
roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the
shell; and this was the first bit of meat 1 had ever
asked God's blessing to, even, as I could remember,
in my whole life.

After I had eaten, I tried to walk ; but found my-
self so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun (for I
never went out without that) : so I went but a little way,
and sat down upon the ground, looking out u on the
sea, which was just before me, and very ca m and
smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these
occurred to me.

What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen so
much? V'Vhence is it produced? And what am I,
and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human and
brutal, whence are we ?

Sure we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky: and who
is that ? .

Then it followed most naturally : it is God that has
made it all. Well, but then it came on strongly : If
God has made all these things, he guides and governs
- them all, and all things that concern them; for the
Being that could make all things, must certainly have
power to guide and direct them.

If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his
works, either without his knowledge or appointment.

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he
knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful con-
dition; and if nothing happens without his appoint-
ment, he has appointed all this to befal me. -

.Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any
of these conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me
with the greater force, that it must needs be, that God
has appointed all this to' befal me; that l was broughtnonmson 03115015. 79

to this miserable circumstance by his direction, be

having the sole power, not of me only, but of every

thing that happened in the world. Immediately it
followed,

Why has God done this to me ? What have I done
to be thus used ?

My conscience presently checked me in that in-
quiry, as if I had blasphemed; and, methought, it
spoke to me like a voice, Wretch! dost thou ask what
thou hast-done! Look back upon a dreadful mispent
life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done ? Ask, why
is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed; Why wert
thou not drowned in Yarmouth roads I" killed in the
fight, when the ship was taken by the Sallee man of
war? devoured by wild beasts on the coasts of Africa ?

or, drowned here, when all the crew perished but
thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I done ?

I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one
astonished, and had not a word to say, no, not to an-
swer to myself; but rose up, pensive and sad, walked
back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I
had been going to bed: but my thoughts were sadly
disturbed, and l had no inclination to sleep; so I sat
down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began
to be dark. Now, as the apprehensions of the return
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred
to my thought that the Brazilians take no ph sic but
their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and had a
piece of roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which-
was quite cured, and some also that was green, and
not quite cured. .fi'ffi;

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt; for in thie"
chest I found a cure both for soul and body. I opened
the chest, and found what I looked for, viz. the to-

bacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there wk"
- ' "1&3":
I took out one of the Bibles which I had mentioned be-
fore, and which to this time, I had not found leisure,
or so much as inclination, to look into: I say I took it
out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to
the table. --

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to
my distemper, or whether it was good for me or not;
but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was re-
solved it should hit one way or other. I first took a
piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which
indeed, at first, almost stupified my brain; the tobacco
being green and strong, and that I had not been much
used to it: then I took some, and steeped it an hour
or two in rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when
I lay down; and lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of
coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it, as
long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as the
virtue of it, and I held it almost to suffocation.

In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bi-
ble, and began to read; but my head was too much
disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at
that time: only, having opened the book casually, the
first words that occurred to me were these, ' Call on
me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me.'

The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
. reading them, though not so much as they did after-
451': ward; for, as for being delivered, the word had no
sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote,
so impossible in my a prehension of things, that I
began to say as the children of Israel did, when they
were promised flesh to eat, ' Can God spread a table
in the wilderness ?' So I began to say, Can God
himself deliver me from this place ? And as it was
not for many years that any hope appeared, this pre-
vailed very often upon my thoughts. But, however,
the words made a great impression upon me, and I
mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and
the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much,
that I inclined to sleep; so I left my lamp burning in
the cave, lest I should want an thing in the night,
and went to bed: but before I lay down, I did what
I never had done in all my life, I kneeled down, and
prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that, if.I
called upon him in the day of trouble, he would de-
liver me. After my broken and imperfect prayer
was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the
tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco,
that indeed I could scarce get it down. Immediately
upon this I went to bed, and I found presently it flew
up into my head violently; but I fell into a sound
sleep, and waked no more, till by the sun, it must ne-
cessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon, the
next day : nay, to this hour, I am partly of the opinion
that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day after; for otherwise I knew not how I
should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of
the week, as it appeared some years after I had done 3
for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the line,
I should have lost more than one day; but certainly,
I lost a day in my account, and I never knew which
way. .
Be, that, however, one way or other, when l awaked
I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits
lively and cheerful. When I got up I was stronger
than I was the day before, and my stomach better;
for l was hungry, and in short, I had no fit the next
day, but continued much altered for the better. This. '

was the 29th.82 nonmson 030303.

The 80th was my well day, of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too far.
I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a brand-
goose, and brought them home, but was not very
forward to eat them; so I eat some more of the tur-
tlc's eggs, which were very good. This evening I
renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me
good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum,
only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew
any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke.
However, I was not so well the next day, which was
the lst of July, as I hoped I should have been; for I
had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dosed myself with it as at first, and doubled the
quantity which I drank.

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I
did notrecover my full strength for some weeks after.
While I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts
ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, ' I will deliver
thee ;' and the impossibility of my deliverance lay
much upon m mind, in bar of my ever expecting it.
But as I was iscouraging myself with such thoughts,
it occurred to m mind, that I pored so much upon
my deliverance mm the main affliction, that I disre-
garded the deliverance I had received; and I was, as
it- were, made to ask m self such questions as these:
viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too,
from sickness; from the most distressed condition
that could be, and that was so frightful to me '1' And
what notice had 1 taken of it ? Had I done my art ?
God had delivered me: but I had not glorified 'm;
that is to sa , I had not owned and been thankful for

that as a de verance: and how could I expect greater
deliverance.
This touched my heart very much, and immediately
I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud, for my
recovery from sickness.

July 4. 1n the morning, I took the Bible; and,
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously to
read it, and imposed upon myself to read every mom-
ing and every night, not tying myself to a number of
chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage
me. It was not long after I set seriously to this work,
but I found my heart more deeply and sincerely
affected with the wickedness of my past life. The
impression of a dream revived, and the words ' All
these things have not brought thee torepentance,' ran
seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of
God to give me repentance, when it happened provi-
dentially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I
came to these words, ' He is exalted a Prince, and a
Saviour, to give repentance, and to give remission.'
I threw down the book, and, with m heart as well as
my hands lifted up to Heaven, in a 'nd of ecstasy of
joy, I cried out aloud, ' Jesus, thou Son of David,
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me re-
pentance 1'

This was the first time that I could say, in the true
sense of the word, that I prayed in all my life; for
now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and with
a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the en-
couragement of the word of God ; and from this
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God would
hear me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above,
' Call on me, and I will deliver ou,' in a different
sense from what I had ever done fore; for then I
had no notion of any thing being called deliverance,
but my being delivered from the captivity I was in;
for though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the
island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the
worst sense in the world; but now I learned to take
it in another sense. Now, I looked back upon my
past life with such horror, and my sins appeared so
dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but de-
liverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my
comfort. As for my solitary life it was nothing; I did
not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or think
of it: it was all of no consideration in comparison of
this; and I add this part here, to hint to whoever '
shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense
of things, they will find deliverance from sin a much
greater blessing, than deliverance from affliction.

But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.

My condition began now to be, though not less
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier to
my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a con-
stant reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to
things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort
within, which till now I knew nothing of. Also, as
my health and strength returned, I bestirred myself
to furnish myself with every thing that I wanted, and
make my way of living as regular as I could.

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefl
employed in walking about with my gun in my ban ,
a little and a little at a time, as a man that was gather-
ing up his strength after a fit of sickness: for it is
hardly to be imagined, how low I was, and to what
weakness 1 was reduced. The a plication which I
made use of was perfectly new, an perhaps what had
never cured an ague before ; neither can I recommend
it to any one to practice, by this ex eriment; and
though it did carry off the fit, yet it rat er contributed
to weaken me: for I had frequent convulsions in my
nerves and limbs for some time. '
I had been now in this unhappy island above ten
months: all possibility of deliverance from this condi-
tion seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I
firmly believed that no human shape had ever set foot
upon that place. Having now secured my habitation,
as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire to
make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to
see what other productions I might find, which yet I
knew nothing of.

It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. I went up the
creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on
shore. I found, after I came about two miles up,
that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was
no more than a little brook of running water, and ,
very fresh and good; but this being the dry season,
there was hardly any water in some parts of it, at least
not enough to run in any perceptible stream.

On the bank of this brook, 1 found many pleasant
savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with
grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the
higher grounds, where the water, as it might be sup-
posed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of
tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong
stalk. There were divers other plants, which I had
no notion of, or understanding about; and might,
perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not
find out.

I searched for the Cassava root, which the Indians,
in all that climate, make their bread of; but I could
find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not
then understand them. I saw several sugar-canes,
but wild, and, for want of cultivation, im erfect.

The next day, the 16th, I went up t e same way
again: and, after going something farther than I had
I
gone the day before, I found the brook and the savan-
nas began to cease, and the country became more
woody than before. In this part I found different
fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the
ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon the
trees: the vines had spread indeed over the trees, and
the clusters of grapes were just now in their prime,
very ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery,
and I was exceedingly glad of them ; but I was warned
by my experience, to eat sparingly of them, remem-
bering that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating
of grapes killed several of our Englishmen, who were
slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers:
but I found an excellent use for these grapes; and
that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep
them as dried raisins are kept, which I thought would
be, as indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agree-
able to eat, when no grapes might be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to
my habitation, which, by the way, was the first night,
as I might say, I had lain from home. In the night I
took my first contrivance, and got up into a tree,
where I slept well, and the next morning proceeded
upon my discovery, travelling near four miles, as I
might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still
due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north
side of me.

At the end of this march, I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west;
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of
the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is,
due east: and the country appeared so fresh, so green,
so flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure,
or flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted
garden.

I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts), to think
that this was all my own; that I was king and lord of
all this country indefeasibly, and I had a right of pos-
session; and, if i could convey it, I might have it in
inheritance, as completely as any lord of a manor in
England. I saw here abundance of cocoa-trees;
orange, and lemon, and citron trees; but all wild, and
few bearing any fruit, at least not then. However,
the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant
to eat; but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice
afterward with water, which made it very wholesome,
and very cool and refreshing.

I found now 1 bad business enough to gather and
carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well
of grapes as limes and lemons,- to furnish myself for
the wet season, which I knew was approaching.

In order to do this, I- gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, and a lesser heap in another
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in ano-
ther place; and, taking a few of each with me, I tra-
velled homeward, and resolved to come again, and
bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry
the rest home.

Accordingly, having spent three days in my journey,
I came home (so I must now call my tent and my
cave); but, before I got thither, the grapes were
s oiled; the richness of the fruit, and the weight of
t e juice, having broken them and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they
were good, but I could bring but a few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home my harvest;
but I was surprised, when coming to m heap of
grapes, which were so rich and fine when gathered

I 2
them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces,
and dragged about,- some here, some there, and

abundance eaten and devoured. By this, I concluded
there were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had

done this ; but what they were, I knew not.

However, as I found there was no laying them up
on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack; but
that one way they would be destroyed, and the other
way they would be crushed with their own weight, I
took another course; for I gathered a large quantity of
the grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of
the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and as for the limes, and lemons, I carried as many
back as I could well stand under.

When 1 came home from this journey, I contem-
plated, with great pleasure, the fruitfulness of that
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation, the se-
curity from storms on that side of the water, and the
wood; and concluded that I had pitched upon a place
to fix my abode, which was, by far, the worst part of
the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of
removing my habitation, and to look out for a lace
equall safe as where I now was situate, if possib e, in
that p easant fruitful part of the island.

This thought run long in my head, and I was ex-
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness of
_ the place tempting me; but when I came toa nearer

view of it, and to consider that I was now by the sea-
side, where it was at least possible that something
might happen to my advantage, and that the same ill
fate which brought me hither, might bring some other
unhappy wretches to the gime place; and though it
was scarce probable that any such thing should ever
happen, yet, to enclose myself among the hills and
woods, and to render such an affair not only impro-
bable, but impossible; and that therefore I ought not,
by any means, to remove.

However, I was so enamourcd with this place, that
I spent much of my time there, for the whole remain-
ing part of the month of July; and though, upon
second thoughts, I resolved as above, not to remove,
yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded
it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and filled
between with brushwood; and here I lay very secure,
sometimes two or three nights together, always going
over it with a ladder, as before, so that I fancied now
I had my country house, and my sea-coast house; and
this work took me up to the beginning of August.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, when the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my first habitation; for though I
had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of
a sail, and spread it'very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave
, behind me to retreat into, when the rains were exrra-
ordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself. The
3rd of August, I found the grapes 1 had hung up
were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good
raisins of the sun; so I began to take them down from
the trees; and it was very hap y that I did so, for
the rains which followed would, have spoiled them,
and I had lost the best part of my winter food; for I
had above two hundred large bunches of them. No
sooner had I taken them all down, and carried most of
them home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from
hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained more
or less every day till the middle of October; and some-

- 1 3 '
times so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave
for several days.

In this season, I was much surprised with the in-
crease of my family. I had been concerned for the
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as
I thought, had been dead; and I heard no more tale
or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she came
home about the end of August with three kittens.
This was the more strange to me, because, though I
had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun,

et I thought it was quite a different kind from our

uropean cats; yet the young cats were the same kind
of house-bred, like the old one; and both my cats
being females, I thought it very strange. But from
these three cats I afterwards came to be so pestered
with cats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin,
or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as
much as possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26, incessant rain,
so that 1 could not stir, and was now very careful not
to be much wet. In this confinement I began to be
straitened for food ; but venturing out twice, I one day
killed a goat; and the last day, which was the 26th,
found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to me ;
and my food was regulated thus: I eat a bunch of
raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat's flesh,
or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for, to my
great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew any
thing); and two or three of the turtle's eggs for
supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I
worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave;
and, by degrees, worked it on towards one side, till I
came to the outside of the hill, and made a door or way
out, which came beyond my fence or wall, and so I
came in and out this way. But I was not perfectly
eals'y at laying so open; for, as I had managed my-
se before, I was in a perfect enclosure, whereas
now I thought I lay exposed; and yet I could not er-
ceive that there'was any living thing to fear, the ig-
gest creature that I had yet seen upon the island
being a goat.

September the 30th. I was now come to the un-
happy anniversary of my landing. I cast up the
notches on my post, and found I had been on shore
three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to religious exercise,
prostrating myself on the ground with the most serious

umiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging
his righteous judgments upon me, and praying to him
to have mercy on me, through Jesus Christ; and not
having tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours,
even till the going down of the sun, I then eata biscuit
cake. and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finish-
ing the day as I began it.

I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for as
at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I
had after some time omitted to distinguish the
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the
Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what any of
the days were: but now having cast up the days as
above, I found I had been there a year, so I divided it
into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a
Sabbath; though I found at the end of my account, I
lost a day or two in my reckoning.

A little after this my ink began 'to fail me, and so I
contented m self to use it more sparingly, and to write
down only the most remarkable events of my life,
without continuing a daily memorandum of other
things.
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see
the whole island, and that I had travelled up the
brook, and so on to where I had built my bower, and
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite across to the sea-shore on that side ; so taking my
gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of
powder and shot than 'usual, with two biscuit cakes,
and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my
store, I began my journey. When I had passed the
vale where my bower stood, as above, I came in view
of the sea, to the west; and it being a very clear day,
I fairly descried land, whether an island or a continent,
I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from
the west, to the 'W. S. W. at a very great distance:
by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty
leagues off.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be,
otherwise than that I knew that it must be a part of
America; and, as I concluded, by all my observations,
must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was
all inhabited by savages, where, if I should have
landed, I had been in a worse condition than I was
now; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of
Providence, which I began now to own, and to be-
lieve, ordered everything for the best: I say, I quieted
my mind with this, and left afflicting my mind with
fruitless wishes of being there.

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con-
sidered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, I
should some time or other see some vessels pass or
repass one way or other; but if not, then it was the
savage coast between the Spanish country and
Brazils, which were indeed the worst of savages, for
they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to
murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into
their hands.

With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island where 1 now
was much pleasanter than mine, the 0 en or
savannah fields sweet, adorned with flowers an grass,
and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of par-
rots, and fain would I have caught one, if possible,
to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to
me. I did after some pains-taking, catch a young
parrot; for I knocked it down with astick, and having
recovered it, I brought it home, but it was some years
before I could make him speak. However, at last I
taught him to call me by my name very, familiarly.
But the accident that followed, though it be a trifle,
will be very diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I
found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but the differed greatly from all
other kinds I had met wit ; nor could I :satisfy my-
self to eat them, though 1 killed severaL, But I had
no need to be venturous, for I had no want of food,
and of that which was very good too ; especially these
three sorts, viz. goats, pigeon, and turtle or tortoise,
which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could
not have furnished a table better than I, in pro ortion
to the company. And though my case was dep orable
enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness, that I
was not driven to any extremities for food, but had
rather plenty, even to danties.

I never travelled in this journe above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; ut I took so many
turns and returns, to see what discoveries I could
make, that I came weary enough to the place where I
libsolvied to sit down for all night; and then I either re- --
posed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a
row of stakes set upright in the ground, either from
one tree to another, so as no wild creature could
come at me, without waking me.

As soon as I Came to the sea-shore, I was surprised
to see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of
the island; for here indeed the shore was covered with
innumerable turtles; whereas on the other side I had
found but three in a year and a half. Here was al-
so an infinite number of fowls, of many kinds, some of
which I had seen, and some of which I had not seen
before, and many of them very good meat; but such
as I knew not the names of, except those called pen-

ms.
guI could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of m powder and shot; and therefore
had more mind to ill a she--goat, if I could, which I
could better feed on. And though there were many
goats here more than on my side of the island, yet it
was with much more difficulty that I could come near
them, the country being flat and even, and they saw
me much sooner than when l was on the hills.

I confess this side of the countr much pleasanter
than mine, but et I had not the least inclination to
remove; for as was fixed in my habitation, it he-
came natural to me; and I seemed all the while I was
here, to be, as is were, upon a journey, and from
home. However, I travelled along the shore of the
sea, towards the east, I suppose, about twelve miles ;
and then setting up a great pole upon the shore, for a
mark, I concluded I would go home again ; and that
the next journey I took, should be on the other side
of the island, east from my dwelling, and so round,
till I came to my post again: of which in its place... .

I took another way to come back than that Iwent,
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much in
my view, that I could not miss finding my first dwel-
ling, by viewing the country: but I found myself
mistaken: for being come about two or three miles, I
found myself descended into a very large valley, but
so surrounded with hills, and those bills covered with
woods, that I could not see which was my way
by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then,
unless I knew very well the position of the sun at that
time of the day.

It happened to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while I
was in t is valley; and not being able to see the sun,
I wandered about very uncomfortable, and at last
was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for my post,
and come back the same way I went; and then, by
easy journeys, I turned homeward, the weather being
exceedingly hot; and my gun, ammunition, hatchet,
and other things, very heavy.

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running in to take hold of it,
caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. 'I had a!
great mind to bring it home, if I could; for I had
often been musing whether it might not be possible to
get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats.
which might supply me when my powder and shot
should be all s ent.

I made a co ar to this little creature, and with a
string, which I made of some ro -yarn, which I
always carried about me, I led him ong, though with
some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there I
enclosed him, and left him; for I was very impatient
to be at home, from whence I had been absent above

a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to
come into my old hutch, and lie down in my ham-
mock-bed. This little wandering journey, without
any settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant
to me, that m own house, as I called it to myself, was
a perfect sett ement to me, compared to that; and it
rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I
resolved I would never go a great way from it again,
while it should be my lot to stay on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale my-
self after my long journey, during which, most of the
time was taken up in the weighty affair of making a
cage for my poll, who began now to be a mere
domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted with me.
Then I began to think of the poor kid, which I had
pent in within my little circle, and resolved to go and
fetch it home, or give it some food : accordingly I
went, and found it where I left it, for indeed it could
not get out, but was almost starved for want of food.
I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over; and having
fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it away; but it
was so tame with being hungry, that 1 had no need
to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog: and as I
continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so
gentle, and so fond, that it became from that time,
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me
afterward.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now
come, and I kept the 30th of September in the
same solemn manner as before, being the anniversary
of my landing on the island, having now been there
two years, and no more prospect of being delivered
than the first day I came there. I spent the whole
dav in humble and thankful acknowledgments 6f the
many wonderful mercies which my solitary-condition
was attended with, and without which it might have
been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and
hearty thanks, that God had been pleased to discover to
me, even that it was possible I might be more happy
in this solitary condition, than I should have been in a
liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of the world;
that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies of
my solitary state, and the want of human society, by
his presence, and the communications of his grace to
my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me
to depend upon his providence here, and hope for his
eternal presence hereafter.

[t was now that I began sensibly to feel how
much more happy the life I now led was, with all its
miserable circumstances, than the wicked, cursed,
abominable life I led all the past part of my days;
and now having changed both :3}! sorrows and m joys,
my very desires altered, my ections change their
gusts, and my delights were perfectly new, from what
they were at my first coming, or indeed for the two
years past.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or
for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my
condition would break out upon me on a sudden, and
my ver heart would die within me, to think of the
woods, t e mountains, the deserts I was in; and how
I was a risoner locked up with the eternal" bars and
bolts of t e ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, with-
out redemption. In the midst of the greatest com-
posures of my mind, this would break out upon me,
ike a storm, and make me wring m hands, and weep
like a child. Sometimes it woul take me in the
middle of my work, and I would immediately sit down
and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two

together, and this was still worse to me; for if I could
it
burst out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would
go off, and the grief, having exhausted itself, would
abate.

But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts. I daily read the word of God, and applied
all comforts of it to my present state. One morning,
being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words,
' I will never, never leave thee , nor forsake thee 1'
immediately it occurred, that these words were to me ;
why else should they be directed in such a manner,
just at the moment when I was mourning over m
condition, as one forsaken of God and man! ' Wel ,
then,' said I, 'if God does not forsake me, of what ill
consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the
world should all forsake me, seeing, on the other hand,
if I had all the world, and should lose the favour and
plessgng of God, there would be no comparison in the
ass '

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind,
that it was possible for me to be more happy in this
forsaken, solitary condition, than it was probable I
should have ever been in any other particular state in
the world ; and with this thought, I was going to
give thanks to God for bringing me to this place.

I was now in the months of November and Decem-
ber, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground [had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for my seed of each was not above the quantity
of half a peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sow-
ing in the dry season, but now my crop promised very
well, when, on a sudden, I found I was in danger of
losing it all again, by enemies of several sorts, which
it was scarce] possible to keep from it; as first, the
goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, who,
tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and
day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it
could get no time to shoot up into stalk.

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an en-
closure about it with a hedge, which 1 did with a great
deal of toil, and the more because it required speed,
the creatures daily spoiling my corn. However, as
my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I
got it totally well fenced in about three weeks' time;
and shooting some of the creatures in the day-time, I
set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to
a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all
night long; so, in a little time, the enemies forsook
the place, and the corn grew very strong and well,
and began to ripen apace.

But, as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn
was in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin
me now, when it was in the ear; for going along by
the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop
surrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts,
who stood, as it were, watching till I should be gone.
I immediately let fly among them (for I always had
my gun with me). 1 had no sooner shot, but there
rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at
all, from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw that, in a
few days, they would devour all my hopes; that I
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop at
all; and what to do I could not tell. However, I re-
solved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I
should watch it night and day. In the first place,
I went among it to see what damage was already done,
and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that,
as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so
great, but that the remainder was like to be a good
crop, if it could be saved. 2

K
l staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away,
I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees
about me, as if they only waited till 1 was gone away,
and the event proved it to be so; for as I walked off
as if I were gone, I was no sooner out of their sight,
but they dropped down, one by one, into the corn again.
I was so provoked, that I could not have patience to
stay till more came on, knowing that every grain that
they eat now, was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to
me in the consequence; but, coming up to the hedge,
I fired again, and killed three of them. This was
what I wished for; so I took them up, and served
them as we serve notorious thieves in England, viz.
hanging them in chains for a terror to others. It is
almost im ossible to imagine that this should have
such an e ect as it had; for' the fowls would not onl
not come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook al
that part of the island, and I could never see a bird
near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there.

This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and,
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I rea ed my cro . .

I was sadly put to it for a scythe, or a sickle, to cut
it down, and all I could do was to make one as well as
I could, out of one of the broad-swords, or cutlasses,
which I saved among the arms out of the ship. How-
ever, as my cro was but small, I had no great diffi-
culty to cut it own. In short, I reaped it my way;
for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it away
in a great basket which I had made, and so rubbed it
out with my hands. And at the end of all my harvest-
ing, I found that out of m half peek of seed, I had
near two bushels of rice, an above two bushels and a
half of barley ; that is to say, by my guess, for 1 had
no measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me;
and I foresaw that, in time, it would please God to
supply me with bread. And yet here I was perplexed
again, for I neither knew how to grind or make meal
of my corn, or indeed how to clean it, and art it;
nor, if made into meal, how to make bread 0 it, yet
I knew not how to bake it. These things being added.
to my desire of having a good quantity for store, and
to secure a constant supply, 1 resolved not to taste any
of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the
next season, and, in the mean time, to employ all my
study and hours of working to accomplish this great
work of providing myself with corn and bread.

When my corn was growing and grown, I have
observed how many things I wanted, to fence it, se-
cure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thresh,
part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a
mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, east and salt to
make it into bread, and an oven to ake it in; and
yet all these things I did without, as shall be observed;
and the corn was an inestimable comfort and ad-
vantage to me too. All this, as I said, made every
thing laborious and tedious to me, but that there was
no help for: neither was my time so much loss to me,
because as I had divided it, a certain part of it was
every day appointed to these works; and, as i re-
solved to use none of the corn for bread, till I had a
greater quantity by me, l had the next six months to
apply myself wholly by labour and invention to furnish
myself with utensils proper for the performing all the
operations necessary for the making the corn, when I
had it fit for my use.

But first, I was to repare more land, for I had now
seed enough to sow a ove an acre of ground. Before
I did this, I had a week's work at least to make me a

K 3
spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry one
indeed, and very heavy, and required double labour to
work with it. However, I went through that, and
sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as
near my house as I could find them to my mind, and
fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which
were all cut of that wood which I had set before,
which I knew would grow; so that, in one year's
time, I knew I should have a quick or living hedge,
that would want but little repair. This work was not
so little as to take me up less than three months, be-
cause great part of that time was of the wet seasons
when I could not go abroad.

Within-doors, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following oc-
casions; always observing, that all the while I was at
work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and
teaching him to speak; and I quickly taught him to
know his own name, at last to speak it out pretty loud,
' Poll ;' which was the first word I ever heard spoken
in the island by any month but my own. This, there-
fore, was not my work, but an assistant to my work;
for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my
hands, as follows, viz., I had long studied, by some
means or other, to make m self some earthen vessels,
which indeed I wanted sore y, but knew not where to
come at them. However, considering the heat of the
climate, I did not doubt but, if I could find out any
such clay, I might botch up some such pot, as might,
being dried in the sun, be hard enough, and strong
enough, to bear handling, and to hold any thing that
was dry, and required to be kept so; and as this was
necessary in preparing corn, meal, 4&c. which was the
thing I was upon, I resolved to make some as large as
I could, and fit only to stand like jars to hold what
should be put into them.
It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh
at me, to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise
this paste; what odd, mishapen, ugly things I made;
how many of them, fell in, and how many fell out,
the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own weight;
how many cracked by the over-violent heat of the sun,
being set out too hastily: and how many fell to pieces
with only removing, as well before as after the were
dried: and, in a word, how, after having la oured
hard to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring
it home, and work it, I could not make above two
large, earthen, ugly things, I cannot call them jars, in
about two months' labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I lifted them ver gently up, and set them down
again in two great wic er-baskets, which I had made .
on pu ose for them, that they might not break;
and as etween the pot and the basket there was a lit-
tle room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and bar-
ley straw; and these two ots, being to stand always
dry, I thought would hol my dry corn, and perhaps
the meal when the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with bet-
ter success; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and anything my hand turned to ;
and the heat of the sun baked them extremely hard.

But all this would not answer my end, which
was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and
bear the fire, which none of these could do. It hap-
pened after some time, making a pretty large fire for
cooking my meat, when I went to put it out, after I
had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of my
earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a
stone, and red as a tile. 1 was agreeably surprised to
see it, and said to myself, that certainly they might be
made to burn whole, if they would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire. so as to
make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a
kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I
placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots, in a
pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood all
round it with a great heap of embers under them. I
piled the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed they did not crack at all.
When I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that
heat about five or six hours, till I found one of them,
though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the sand
which was mixed with the clay melted with the
violence of the heat, and would have run into glass, if I
had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually, till the
pots began to abate of the red colour, and watching
them all night, that I might not let the fire abate too
fast, in the morning I had three very good, I will not
say handsome, pipkins, and two other earthenpots, as
hard burnt as could he desired ; and one of them per-
fectly glazed with the running of the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted
no sort of earthenware for 'my use; but I must needs
say, as to the shapes of them, they were very indifi'e-
rent, as anyone may suppose, when I had no way of
making them, but as the children make dirt-pies, or
as a woman would make pies that never learnt to raise
paste.

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthe'n
pot that would hear the fire; and I had hardly pa-
tience to stay till they were cold, before I set one upon
the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me some
meat, which it did admirably well; and, with a piece
of kid, I made some ver good broth, though I
wanted oatmeal, and severa other ingredients requi-
site to make it as good as I would have. had it.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to
stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art
with one pairof hands. .To supply this want I was
at a great loss; for, of all trades in the world, I was
as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for any
whatever: neither had I any tools to go about it with.
I spent many a day to find out a great stone big
enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and

could find none at all, except what was in the solid .- l.

rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor
indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness suffi-
cient, but were of a sandy crumbling stone, which
would neither bear the weight of a heav pestle, nor
would break the corn without filling it with sand. So,
after a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone,
I gave it over, and resolved to look for a great block
of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier; and
getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded
it, and formed it on the outside with my axe and
hatchet; and then,- with the help of fire, and infinite
labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in
Brazil make their canoes. After this, 1 made a great
heav pestle or heater, of the wood called the iron-
woody,' and this I prepared and laid by against 1 had
my next cro of corn, when I proposed to myself to
grind, or ra er pound, my corn into meal, to make
my bread.

My next difliculty was to make a sieve, or scarce,
to dress my meal, and to part it from the bran and the
husk, without which I did not see it possible I could
have any bread. This was a most difficult thing, so
much as but to think on; for, to be sure, I had ne'-
thing like the necessary thing to make it with, I mean
fine thin canvass. or stuff to scarce the meal through.
And here I was at a full stop for many months; nor
did I really know what to do: linen I had none left,
but what was mere rags. I had goat's hair, but nei-
ther knew 1 how to weave or spin it; and had I
known how, here were no tools to work it with: all
the remedy that lfound for this, was, that at last I
did remember I had, among the seamen's clothes,
which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of
calico or muslin; and with some pieces of these I
made three small sieves, but proper enough for the
work : and thus I made shift for some years. How I
did afterward, I shall show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered,
and how I should make bread when I came to have
corn; for, first, I had no yeast. As to that part, as
there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern
myself much about it; but for an oven, I was indeed
in great pain. At length I found out an expedient
for that also, which was this: I made some earthen
vessels very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about
two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep:
these I burnt in the fire, as I had done the other, and
laid them by, and when [wanted to bake, I made a
great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with
some square tiles, of my own making and burning
also: but I should not call them square.

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward 11 on this
hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I et them

lie, till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping away
all the embers, I set down my loaf of loaves, and,
whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the
embers all round the outside of the ot, to keep in,
and add to the heat; and thus, as we] as in the best
oven in the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and be:
came, in a little time, a mere pastry-cook into the
bargain; for I made myself several cakes of the rice,
and puddings: indeed I made no pies, neither had I
any thing to put into them, supposing I had, except
the flesh either of fowls or goats.

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took
me up most part of the third year of my abode here:
for it is to be observed, that, in the intervals of these
things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to man-
age, for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it
home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear, in
my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; for I
had no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh it
with.

And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, I
really wanted to build my barns bigger. I wanted a
place to lay it up in; for the increase of the corn now
yielded me so much, that I had of barley about twent
bushels, and of the rice as much, or more; insomuc
that now I resolved to begin to use it freely, for my
bread had been quite gone a great while; also I re-
solved to see what quantit would be sufficient for me
a whole year, and to sow ut once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could consume
in a year; so I resolved to sow just the same quantity
every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a
quantity would fully provide me with bread, &c.

All the while these things were doing you may be
sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect
- of land, which I had seen from the other side of the
island; and I was not without secret wishes that I
were on shore there, fancying that seeing the main
land, and an inhabited country, I might find some
way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at
last find some means of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the dan-
gers of such a condition, and how I'might fall into the
hands of savages, and perhaps Such as I might have
reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of
Africa: that if I once came into their power, I should
run a hazard more than a thousand to one of being
killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard,
that the people of the Carribean coast were cannibals,
or men-eaters: and I knew. by the latitude, that I
could not be far off from that shore; that, suppose
they were not cannibals, yet they might kill .me, as
many Euro eans who had fallen into their hands had
been serve , even when they had been ten or twenty
together; much more I that was but one, and could
make little or no defence. All these things, I say, -
which I ought to have considered well of, and did cast
up in my thoughts afterward, yet took up none of my
apprehensions at first; and my head ran mightily
upon the thought of getting over to that shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat,
with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa; but
this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and
look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was
blown up upon the shore, a great way, in the storm,
when we were first cast away. She ay almost where
she did at first, but not quite; and was turned, by the
force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom up-
wards, against a high ridge of beachy rough sand, but
no water about her, as before.

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have
launched her into the water, the boat would have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the
Brazils with her easily enough: but I might have
easily foreseen that I could no more turn her, and set
her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove the
island. However, I went to the woods, and cut levers
and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolved to
try what 1 could do, suggesting to myself, that if I
could but turn her down, I might easily repair the
damage she had received, and she would be a very
good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.

I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it;
at last, finding it impossible to' heave it up with my
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand to un-
dermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up
again, or to get under it, much less to move it forwar
towards the water; so I was forced to give it over:-
and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my
desire to venture over for the main increased, rather"; ' A"
than decreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.

This at length set me upon thinking, whether it was
not ossible to make myse f a canoe, or periagua, such- mm":
as t e natives of those climates make; even without ~~_ '
tools, or, as I might say, without hands 5 viz., of the 'f
trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought possis

f

     
  
 

ble, but easy; and pleased myself extremely with meg;

thoughts of making it, and with my having much more 1..

convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians,
1.
but not at all considering the particular inconveniences
which I lay under more than the Indians did, viz.
want of hands to move it into the water, when it was
made: a difficulty much harder for me to surmount.
than all the consequences of want of tools could be to
them ; for what was it to me, that when I had chosen
a vast tree in the woods, I might with great trouble
cut it down, if after I might be able with my tools to
hew and dub the outside into the proper shape of a
boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow,
so to make a boat of it, if, after all this, I must leave it
just where I found it, and was not able to launch it into
the water ?

'One would have thought, I could not have had the
least reflection upon my mind of my circumstances,
while I was making this boat, but I should have im-
mediately thought how I should get it into the sea;
but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over
the sea in it, that I never once considered how I
should get it off the land; and it was really, in its own
nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five
miles of sea, than about forty-five fathom of land, where
it lay, to set it afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool
that ever man did who had any of his senses awake.
I pleased myself with the design, without determining
whether I was ever able to undertake it: not but that
the difliculty of launching my boat came often into my
head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it, by
this foolish answer, which I gave myself; ' Let me first
make it, I'll warrant I'll find some way or other to get
it along, when it is done.'

This was a most preposterous method ; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went,
and felled a cedar-tree. I question much whethernonmson CRUSOE. l 11

Solomon ever had such a one for the building the tem-
ple at Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter,
at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven
inches diameter, at the end of twenty-two feet; after
which, it lessened for a while, and then parted into
branches. It was not without infinite labour that I
felled this tree. I was twenty days hacking and hew-
ing at it at the bottom: I was fourteen more getting
the branches, and limbs, and the vastspreading head of it
cut off, which 1 hacked and hewed through with, my
axe and hatchet, and inexpressible labour. Aim?"
it cost me a month to shape it, and dub it ton. f'
tion, and to something like the bottom of a boat? i"
it might swim upright as it ought to do. ltetisl'.
near three months more to clear the inside, and work"
it out so as to make an exact boat of it. This I did-'
indeed without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by
the dint of hard labour, till 1 had brought it to be a very
handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried
six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough to
have carried me and all my cargo.

When 1 had gone through this work, I was ex--
tremely delighted with it. The boat was real] much
bigger than I ever saw a canoe, or periagua, at was
made of one tree, in my life; many a weary stroke it
had cost, you may be sure, and there remained no- ,
thing but to get it into the water; and had I gotten it -
into the water, I make no question but I should have z '
begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to
be performed, that ever was undertaken. -. . .-_." __ 3

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, 8' .~
though they cost me infinite labour too: it lay about '.
one hundred yards from the water, and not more; '5' -
but the first inconvenience was, it was uphill towards
the creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, i.

L 2 . .
I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so
make a deelivity. This I began, and it cost me a pro-
digious deal of pains; but who grudge pains that have
their deliverance in view? But when this was worked
through, and this difficulty managed, it was still much
at one; for I could no more stir the canoe, than I
could the other heat.

Then I measured the distance of ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to
the canoe, seeing that I could not bring the canoe
down to the water. Well, I began this work, and
when I began to enter into it, and calculated how deep
it? as to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be
t own out, I found that, by the number of hands I
had, being none but my own, it must have been ten
or twelve years before I should have gone through
with it; for the shore lay high, so that at the upper
end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so at
length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this at-
tempt over also.

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though too
late, the folly of beginning a work before we count the
cost, and before we judge rightly of our own strength
to go through with it.

In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the
same devotion, and with as much comfort, as ever be-
fore; for by a constant study, and a serious applica-
tion of the word of God, and by the assistance of his

3' - grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had

before. I entertained different notions of things. I
looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which
I had nothing to do with, no expectation from, and in-
deed no desire about; in a word, I had nothing indeed
to do with it, nor was ever like to have, so I thought
it looked, as we perhaps may look upon it hereafter,
viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it;
and well might I say as father Abraham to Dives,
' Between me and thee isa great gulf fixed.'

In the first place, I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here. I had neither the 'lust
of the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride of life.'
I had nothing to covet; for I had all] was capable of
enjoying: l was lord of the whole manor, or, if I
pleased, I might.call myself king or emperor over the
whole country which I had possession of. There were
no rivals. I had no competitor; none to dis ute
sovereignty or command with me. I might ave
raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it, so
I let as little grow as I thought enough for my oc-
casion. I had tortoises or turtles enough ; but now
and then one was as much as I could put to any use.
I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships. I
had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have

cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they

had been built.

But all that I could make use of, was all that was
valuable. I had enough to eat, and to sup ly my
wants, and what was all the rest to me ? If killed
more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or
the vermin ? if I sowed more corn than I could eat,
it must be spoiled. The trees that I cut down were
lying to rot on the ground, I could make no more use
of them than for fuel: and that I had no occasion for,
but to dress my food.

These reflections made me very sensible of the

goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful-for ,

my present condition, with all its hardships and mis-
fortunes. .
Thus I lived mighty congortably, my mind being
L

. "'3" .l'
entirely composed, by resigning to the will of God,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of his
providence. This made my life better than sociable;
for when I began to regret the want of conversation,
I would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutually
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may say, with
even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions, was
not better than the utmost enjoyment of human
society in the world ?

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any ex-
traordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on in the
posture and place just as before. The chief thing I
was employed in, besides my yearly labour of planting
my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both
which 1 always kept up just enough to have
sufficient stock of one year's provisions before-hand;
I say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily labour
of going out with my gun, I had one labour to make
me a canoe, which at last I finished. So that by dig-
ging a canal to it six feet wide, and four feet deep, I
brought it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for
the first, that was so vastly big, as I made it without
considering before-hand as I ought to do, how I
should be able to launch it, so never being able to bring
it to the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged
to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach
me to be wiser next time. Indeed the next time,
though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in
a place where i could not get the water to it, at any
less distance than, as I have said, of nearly half a mile,
yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it
over; and though I was near two years about it, yet I
never grudgcd' my labour, in hopes of having a boat
to go of? to sea in at last.

However, though my little periagua was finished,
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the de-
sign which I had in view, when I made the first; I
mean of venturing over to the terra firma, where it was
above forty miles broad: accordingly, the smallness of
my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and now
I thought no more of it. But as I had a boat, my
next design was to make a tour round the island; for

as I had been on the other side in one place, crossing

as I have already described it, over the land, so the
discoveries! made in that journey made me very eager
to see other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat
I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, and that I might do evel'y thing
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and made a sail to it 'out of some of
the pieces of the ship's sail, which lay in store, and of
which I had a great stock by me.

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
I found she would sail very well. ' Then I made little
lockers or boxes at either end of my boat, to put pro-
visions, necessaries, and ammunition, 8m. into, to be
kept dr , either from rain or the spray of the sea, and

a little ong hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat, '

where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang over
it to keep it dry.

I fixed an umbrella of my own manufacture also
in a step of the stern, like a mast, to stand over my- -

head, and to keep the heat of the sun off me, like an
awning; and thus I every now and then took a little
voyage u on the sea, but never went far out, nor far
from the ittle creek.

I was something impatient, to have the use of my
boat, though very loath to run any hazards; and
therefore sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her
about the island, and at other times I sat myself down

"51-. ~
contented enough without her. But I had a strange
uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the
island, where, as I have said, in my last ramble, I
went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the
current sat, that I might see what I had to do. This
inclination increased upon me every day, and at length
I resolved to travel thither by land; and, following
the edge of the shore, I did so: but had any one in
England been to meet such a man as I was, it must
either have frightened him, or raised a great deal of
laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look at
myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my
travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage,
and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of
my figure as follows:

I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat's
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep
the sun from me, as to shoot the rain off from running
into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these cli-
mates, as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of my thighs ; and a pair of
open-knee'd breeches of the same: the breeches were
made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung
down such a length on either side, that, like pantaloons,
it reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings and
shoes I had none ; but I had made me a pair of some-
thing, I scarce knew what to call them, like buskins,
to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spat-
terdashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed
were all the rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the same, instead of
buckles; and, in a kind of a frog, on either side of
this, instead of a sword and a dagger, hung a little
saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one on the other.
I had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the
same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at
the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,
both made of goat's skin too: in one of which hung
my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I
carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over
my head a great, clumsy, ugly, goat's-skin umbrella,
but which, after all was the most necessary thing l had
about me, next to my gun. As for my face, the
colour of it was really not so Mulatto-like as one might
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard
I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter
of a yard long; but as I had both scissors and razors
sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew
on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large
pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn
by some Turks, whom I saw at Sallee; for the Moors
did not wear such, though thedTurks did. Of these
mustachios, or whiskers, I will not sa the were long
enough to hang my hat upon them; ut t. ey were of
a length and shape monstrous enough, and such as in
England would have passed for frightful.

:' But all this is by the bye: for as to my figure, I
had so few to observe me, that it was of no manner of
consequence; so I say no more to that part. In this
kind of figure I went my new journey, and was out
five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore,
directly to the place where I first brought my boat to
anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and, having no boat
now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way,
to the same height that I was upon before, when look-
ing forward to the point of the rocks which lay out,
and which I was to double with my boat, as I said
above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth and
quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any more
there than in other places.

I was at a strange loss to understand this, and re-
solved to spend some time in observing it, to see if
nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it.
But I was presently convinced how it was, viz. that
the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining with
the current of waters from some great river on the
shore, must be the occasion of this current ; and that,
according as the wind blew more forcibly from the
west, or from the north, this current came near, or
went farther from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts
till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then the
tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current
again as before, only that it ran farther off, being near
half a league from the shore; whereas, in my case, it
set close upon the shore, and hurried me in my canoe,
along with it, which at another time it would not have
done. '

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing
to do but to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the
tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about the
island again; but when l began to think of putting it
into practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits at
the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I
could not think of it again with any atience; but, on
the contrary, I took up another reso ution, which was
more safe, though more labourous, and this was, that
I would build, or rather make me another periagua,
or canoe, and so have one for one side of the island,
and one for the other.

You are to understand that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one, my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under the
rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time I
had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one
within another. One of these, which was the driest
and largest, and had a door out beyond my-wall or
fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall
joined to the rock, was all filled up with large earthern
pots, of which I have given an account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold
five or six bUShels each, where I laid up my stores of
provision, especially my corn, some in the ear cut off
short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with
my hand.

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and spread so very much, that
there was not the least appearance, to any one's view,
of any habitation behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two
pieces of corn ground, which I' kept dul cultivated
and sowed, and which duly yielded met eir harvest
in its seasons; and whenever I had occasion for more
corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now
a tolerable plantation there also. For, first, I had my
little bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair;
that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled it in,
constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder
standing always in the inside. I ke t the trees, which
at first were no more than my sta es, but were now
grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut,
that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and
make the more agreeable shade, which they did efi'ec-
tually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my
tent always standing, being a piece of a sale spread
over poles set up for that purpose, and which never
wanted any repair or renewing; and under this I had
made me a squab or couch, with the skins .of the
creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and
a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-
bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to
cover me: and here, whenever I had occasion to be
absent from my chief seat, I took up my country
habitation.

Adjoining to this, I had m enclosures for my cattle,
that is to say, my goats : an as I had taken an incon-
ceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this ground,
I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the goats
should break through, that I never left off, till,
with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of the
hedges so full of small stakes, and so n'ear to one an-
other, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and
there was scarce room to put a hand through between
them; which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as
they all did in the next rainy season, made the inclo-
sure stron , like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.

This wi l testify for me that I was not idle, and that
I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared
necessary for my comfortable support; for I consi-
dered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus
at my hand, would be a living magazine. of flesh, milk,
butter, and cheese for me, as long as I lived in the
place, if it were to be forty years; and that keeping
them within my reach, depended entirely upon my
' crfecting my enclosures to such a degree that 1 might

be sure of keeping them together; which by this
method indeed I so effectually secured, that when
these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them
so very thick I was forced to pull some of them up
again. ' '
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter-store of
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my
whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable only,
but ph sical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing
to the ast degree.

As this was also about half wa between my other
habitation and the place where I ad laid up my boat,
I generally staid and lay here in my way thither; for
I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all things
about or belonging to her in very good order. Some-
times I went out in her to divert myself; but not any
hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above
a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so appree
hensive of being,hurried out of my knowledge by
the currents, or winds, or any other accident. But
now I come to a new scene of my life.

it happened one day about noon, going towards my

boat, 1 was exceedingly surprised with the print of a jg?
man's naked foot on the shore, which was very plain
to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, '-'" f:
or as if I had seen an apparition. I listened, I looked ' ';
round me; I could hear nothing, nor see any thing. as. '
I went u to the rising ground to look farther. -- Iai- '

went up t e shore, and down the shore, but it was all"

 

one; I could see no other impression but that one.

' I went to it again to see if there were any more, andg; _. ' i

to observe'if it might not be my fancy; but there was 2-
no room for that, for there was exactly the very print, ' "-

of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it
came thither, I knew not, nor could in the least im-

. 5

agine. But after innumerable fluttering thoughts, .

like-a man perfectly confused and out of myself, i

the ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree,
looking behind me at every two or three steps, mis-
taking every bush and tree, and fancying every stump
at a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to de-
scribe how many various shapes an affrighted im-
agination represented things to me in ; how many
wild ideas were formed every moment in my fancy,
and what strange unaccountable whimsies came into my
thoughts by the way.

When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued:
whether I went over by the ladder, as. first contrived,
or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a
door, I cannot remember; for never frighted hare
fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind
than I to this retreat.

I had no sleep that night. The farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary to the nature
of such things, and especially to the usual practice of
all creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed with
my own frightful ideas of the thing, that 1 formed
nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even though
I was now a great way of it.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue
me, that it must be some of the savages of the main
land over against me, who had wandered out to sea in
their canoes, and, either driven by the currents, or by
contrary winds, had made the island; and had been
on shore, but gone away again to sea, being as loath,
perhaps, to have staid in this desolate island; as I
would have been to have had them.

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind,
I was very thankful in my thoughts, that I was so
happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that
they did not see my boat, by which they would have
concluded, that some inhabitants had been in the place,
and perhaps have searched farther for me. Then
terrible thoughts racked my imaginations about their
having found my boat, and that there were people here;
and that, if so, I should certainly have them come
in greater numbers, and devour me; that if it should
happen so that they should not find me, yet they
would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carr
away all my flock of tame goats, and I should peris
at last for mere Want.

In the middle of my cogitations, apprehensions, and
reflections, it came into my thoughts one day, that all
this might be a mere chimera of my own, and this foot
might be the print of my own foot, when I came on
shore from my boat. This cheered me u a little too,
and I began to persuade myself it was a a delusion;
that it was nothing else but my own foot; and why '
might not I come that way from the boat, as well as l
was going that way to the boat ? Again, I considered
also, that I could by no means tell for certain where I
had trod, and where I had not; and that if at last
this was only the print of my own foot, [had played
the part of those fools, who strive to make stories of
spectres and apparitions, and then are themselves
frighted at them more than any body else.

Now I began to take courage, and to pee abroad
again: for I had not stirred out of my castle or three
days and nights, so that I began to starve for provision,
for I had little or nothing within doors, but some
barley cakes and water. Then I knew my goats
wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening diversion.

Haartening m self therefore with the belief, that
this was nothing at the print of one of my own feet

. M 2
(and so I might be truly said to start at my own
shadow,) I began to go abroad again, and went to my
country house to milk my flock; but to see with what
fear I went forward, how often I looked behind me,
how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down
my basket, and run for my life, it would have made
any one have thought I was haunted with an evil con-
science, or that I had been lately most terribly fright-
ed; and so indeed I had.

However, as I went on thus two or three days, and
had seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to
think there was really nothing in it but my own im-
agination; but I could not persuade myself fully of
this, till I should go down to the shore again, and see
this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and
- see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might
beassured it was my own foot. But when I came to
the place first, it appeared evidently to me, that when
I laid up my boat, I could not possibl be on shore
any where thereabouts. Secondly, w en I came to
measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot
not so large by a great deal: both these things filled
my head with new imaginations, and gave me the
vapours again to the highest degree, so that I shook
with cold, like one in an ague, and I went home again,
filled with the belief that some man or men had been
on shore there; or, in short, that the island was in-
habited, and I might be surprised before] was aware;
and what course to take for my security, I knew not.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all
night; but, in the morning I fell asleep, and having,
by the amusement of my mind, been as it were, tired,
and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and
awoke much better composed than I had ever been
before. And now I began to think sedately ; and
upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded, that
this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful,
and no further from the main land than as I had seen,
was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine;
that although there were no stated inhabitants who
lived on this spot, yet there might sometimes come
boats of? from the shore, who either with design, or
perhaps never but when they were driven by cross
winds, might come to this place : that I had lived
fifteen years now, and had not met with the least
shadow or figure of any people before ; and that if at
any time they should be driven here, it was probable
they went away again as soon as ever they could, see-
ing they had never thought fit to fix there, upon any
occasion, to this time; that the most I could suggest
any danger from, was, from any such casual ac-
cidental landing of straggling people from the main;
who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were
here against their wills, so the made no stay here, but
went 01? again with all possib e speed, seldom staging
one night on shore, lest they should not have the elp
of the tides and daylight back again : and that there-
fore 1 had nothing to do but to consider of some safe
retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon
the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug m
cave so large as to bring a door throu h again, whic
door as I said, came out beyond whe fortification
joined to the rock. Upon maturel .5 idering this,
therefore, I resolved to draw me a' second fortification,
in the same manner of a semicircle, at a distance from
my wall, just where I had planted a double row of trees,
about twelve years before, of which I made mention.
These trees having been planted so thick before, there
wanted but a few piles to be driven between them,

M3
that they should be thicker and stronger, and my wall
would be soon finished.

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and every thing I could think of to make it strong;
having in it seven little holes about as big as I might
put my arm out at. In the inside of this I thickened
my wall to about ten feet thick, continually bringing
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the
wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven
holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I
took notice that I got seven on shore out of the ship ;
these, I say, I planted like my cannon, and fitted them
into frames that held them like a carriage, that so I
could fire all the guns in two minutes' time. This wall
I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never
thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was. done, I stuck all the ground with-
out my wall,-for a great way every way, as full with
stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I found
so apt to grow, as they could well stand ; insomuch that
I might set in twenty thousand of them, leaving a

pretty large space between them and my wall, that
' I might have room to see an enemy, and they might
have no shelter from the young treesif they approach-
ed my outer wall.

Thus, in two years' time, I had- a thick grove; and,
in five or sixfiyears' time, 1 had a wood before my
dwelling grown so monstrous thick and strong that it
was indeed perfectl impassable; and no man, of what
kind soever, woul ever imagine that there was an -
thing beyond it, much less a habitation. As for t e
way [ proposed to myself to go in and out (for I left
no avenue), it was by setting two ladders; one to a
part of the rock which was low, and then broke in,nomrtsox cansda'? 127

and left room to place another ladder upon that: so
' that when the two ladders were taken down, no man
living could come down to me without mischiefing
himself ; and if they had come down, they were still
on the outside of my outer wall. , '

Thus I took 'all the measures human prudence
could suggest for my own preservation; and it will be
seen, at length, that there were not altogether with just
reason, though I foresaw nothing at that time, more
than fear suggested to me.

\Vhile this was doing, I was not altogether careless
of my other afl'airs; for I had a great concern upon me
for my little herd of goats: they were not only a pre-
sent supply to me upon every occasion, and began to
be sufficient to me without the expense of powder and
shot. but also abated the fatigue of my hunting after
the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the advantage
of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
think of but two ways to preserve them: one was to
find another convenient place to dig a cave under

ground, and to drive them into it every night; and
the other was to enclose two or three little bits of land,

remote from one another, and as much concealed as I
could, where I might keep about half a dozen young
goats in each place, so that if any disaster happened to
the flock in general, I might be able to raise them again
with little trouble and time: and this, though it would
require a great deal of time and labour, I thought was
the most rational design. '

Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most
retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon one
which was private indeed as my heart could wish ; for
it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I al-
most lost myself once before, endeavouring to come
back that way from the eastern part of the island.
Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres,
so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an en-
closure by nature; at least it did not want "near so
much labour to make it so, as the other pieces of
ground I had worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground; and, in less than a month's time, I had so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first
they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it. So, without any further delay, I re-
moved ten she-goats and two he-goats to this piece;
and when they were there, I continued to perfect the
fence, till I made it as secure as the other, which
however I did at more leisure, and it took me up more
time by a great deal.

All this labour I was at the expense of, purely
from my apprehensions on the account of the print
of a man's foot which I had seen; for as yet I never
saw any human creature come near the island; and I
had now lived two years under these uneasinesses,
which indeed made my life much less comfortable
than it was before, as may well be imagined by any
who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the
fear of man: and this I must observe with grief too,
that the discomposure of my mind had too great im-
pressions also upon the religious part of my thoughts;
for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of
savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I
seldom found. myself in a due temper for application
to my Maker, at least not with the sedate calmness
and resignation of soul which I was wont to do.

But to go on. After I had thus secured one part
of my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place, to make such ano-
ther deposit; when, wandering more to the west point
of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out
to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great
distance. 1 had found a pers ective glass or two, in
one of the seamen's chests w ich I saved out of our
ship; but I had it not about me, and this was so re-
mote, that I could not tell what to make of it, though
I looked at it till m eyes were not able to hold 'to look
any longer. VVhet er it was a boat or not, I do not
know; but as I descended from the hill, I could see
no more of it, so I gave it over: only I resolved to go
no more without a perspective glass in my pocket.

When I was come down the hill, to the end of the
island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was
presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man's
foot was not such a strange thing in the island as I
imagined; and, but that it was a special providence
that I was cast upon the side of the island where the
savages never came, 1 should easily have known that
nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from
the main, when they happened to be a little too far
out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for
harbour; likewise, as they often met, and fought in
their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners,
would bring them over to this shore, where, according
to their dreadful customs, being- all cannibals, they
would kill and eat them: of which, hereafter.

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as "I
said above, being the south-west point of the island, I
was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it pos-
sible .for me to express the horror of my mind, at see-
ing the shore s read with skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human odies, and particularly] observed aplace
where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in
the earth, like a cockpit, where, it is supposed. the sa--
vage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings
upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myself
from it for a long while. All my apprehensions were
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of
human nature, which, though I had heard of often,
yet I never had so near a view of before ; in short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle, my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of
fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from
my stomach; and, having vomited with an uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to
stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the hill
again, with all the speed 1 could, and walked on to-
wards my own habitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the island,
I stood still awhile, as amazed; and then recovering
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection of my
soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God
thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the
world where I was distinguished from such dreadful
creatures as these, and that, though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given
me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to
give thanks for than to complain of; and this, above
all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the
hope of his blessing, which was a felicity more than
sufficiently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer.

in this frame of thankfulness I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before;
for 1 observed that these wretches never came to this
island in search of what they could get; perhaps not
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting anything here;
and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered
woody part of it, without finding anything to their
purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eighteen
years, and never saw the least footste s of human
creature there before; and might be ere eighteen
more as entirely concealed as l was now, if I did not
discover myself to them, which I had no manner of
occasion to do--it being my only business to keep my-
self entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a
better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself
known to.

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage
wretches that l have been 5 eaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman custom of t eir devouring and eat-
ing one another up, that I continued pensive and sad,
and kept close within my own circle for almost two
years after this. When I say my own circle, I mean

y it my three plantations--viz., my castle, my coun-
try seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure
in the woods; nor did I look after this for any other
use than as an enclosure for my goats: for the aver-
sion which nature gave me to these hellish wretches
was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of
seeing the devil himself. Nor did I so much as go to
look after my boat in all this time, but began rather to
think of making me another; for I could not think of
ever making any more attempts to bring the other
boat round the island to me, lest 1 should meet with
some'of those creatures at sea, in which, if I had hap-i
pened to have fallen into their hands, [knew what
would have been my lot. _

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was
in no danger of being discovered by these people, be-
gan to wear off my uneasiness about them; and 1 be-
gan to live just in the same composed manner as
before--only with this difl'erence, that I used more cau-
tion, and kept my eyes more about me than I did be-
fore, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them;
and particularly 1 was more cautious in firing my gun,
lest any of them being on the island should happen to
hear it; and it was, therefore, a very good providence
to me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed
of goats, that I needed not hunt any more about the
woods, or shoot at them: and if I did catch any of
them after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had
done before ; so that for two years after this, I believe
I never fired my gun once ofi', though I never went
out without it; and, which was more, as I had saved
three pistols out of the shi , I always carried them out
with me, or at least two 0 them, sticking them in my
goat-skin belt. I likewise furbished up one of the
great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me
a belt to put it on also ; so that I was now a most for-
' midable fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you
add to the former description of myself the particular
of two pistols, and a great broadsword, hanging at my
side in a belt, but without a scabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time,
I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be reduced to
my former calm, sedate way of living. All these
things tended to showing me, more and more, how tar
my condition was from being miserable, compared to
some others, nay, to many other particulars of life, .
which it might have pleased God to have. made my
lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining
there would be among mankind, at any condition of
life, if people would rather compare their conditions
with those that are worse, in order to be thankful,
than be always comparing them with those which are
better, to assist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own
preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention
for my own conveniences; and I had dropped a good
design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and
that was, to try if I could not make some of my barley
into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer.
This was really a whimsical thought, and I reproved
myself often for the simplicity of it; for l presently
saw there would be the want of several things neces-
sary to the making my beer that it would be impos-
sible for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it
in, which was a thing that, as.I have observed already,
I could never compass ; no, though I spent not many
days, but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to
no purpose. In the next place I had no hops to make
it kee , no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle
to ma e it boil; and yet had not all these things in-
tervened, I mean the frights and terrors I was in about
the savages, [had undertaken it, and perhaps brought
it to pass too; for I seldom gave an thing over with-
out accomplishing it, when once I ad it in my head
enough to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way; for
night and day I could think of nothing but how I
' might destroy some of these monsters in their .cruel
N
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim
they should bring hither to destroy. It would take up
a larger volume than this whole work is intended to
be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or
rather brooded upon, in many thoughts, for the
destroying these creatures, or at least frightening them,
so as to prevent their coming hither any more ; but all
was abortive; nothing could be possible to take ef-
fect, unless I was to be there to do it myself: and
what could one man do among them, when perhaps
there might be twenty or thirty of them together,
with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which
they could shoot as true to a mark, as I could with my
n.
guSometimes I contrived to dig a whole under the
place where they made their fire, and put in five or six
pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled
their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all
that was near it. But as, in the first place, I should be
loath to spend so much powder upon them, my store
being now within the quantity of one barrel, so neither
could I be sure of its going off, at any certain time,
when it might surprise them, and at best it would do
little more than just blow the fire about their ears and
fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake the
lace; so I laid it aside, and then proposed 1 would
ay myself in ambush, in some convenient place, with
my three guns, alli double loaded, and, in the middle
of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I
should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at
every shot, and then falling in upon them with my
three pistols and sword, I made no doubt but that if
there were twenty, I should kill them all. This fancy
pleased my thoughts- for some weeks, and I was so full
that I often dreamed of it, and sometimes, that I
was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.

I went so far with it in my imagination that I em-
ployed myself several days to find out proper places to
put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them ;
and I went frequently to the place itself, which was
now grown more familiar to me, and es ecially while
my mind was thus filled with thoughts 0 revenge, and
of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the
sword, as I will call it; but the horror lhad at the
place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches de-
vouring one another, abated my malice.

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill
where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw
any of their boats coming, and might then, even before
they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself
unseen into the thickest of the trees, in one of which
there was ahollow large enough to conceal me entirel ,
and where I might sit, and observe all their blo y
doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they
were so close together as that it would be next to im-
possible that I should miss my shot, or that I could fail
wounding three or four of them at the first fire.

In this place then I resolved to fix my design, and
accordingly I prepared two muskets, and my ordinary
fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded with abrace
of slugs each, and four or five small bullets; about the
size of pistol bullets, and the fowling- iece I loaded
with near a handful of swan shot, of the argest size. I
also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each:
and in this posture, provided with ammunition for a
second and third charge, I prepared myself for my ex-
pedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and, in my imagination, "put it in practice, I con-

N ..
tinually made my tour every morning up to the top of
the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it,
about three miles, or more, to see if 1 could observe
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or
standing over towards it ; but I began to tire of this
hard duty, after I had for two or three months con--
stantly kept my watch and come always back without
any discovery, there having not in all that time been
the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but
not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses
could reach every way.

As long as i kept up the daily tour to the hill to
look out, so long also 1 kept up the vigour of my de-
sign ; and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a
suitable frame, for so an outrageous an execution as
the killing of twenty or thirty naked savages.

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange
if I confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers
i lived in, and the concern that was now upon me, put
an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances that
I had laid for my future accommodations and con-
veniences. i had the care of my safety more now
upon my hands, than that of my food. I cared not to
drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the
noise I should make should be heard, much less would
I fire a gun for the same reason; and, above all, I
was very uneasy at making any fire, least the smoke
which is visible at a great distance in the day, should
betray me ; and for this reason I removed that part of
my business, which required fire, such as burning
of pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in the
woods. where after I had been some time, I found to ~
my unspeakable consolation, a mere natural cave in
the earth, which went in a vast way, and where
I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth
of it, would be so hard as to venture in; nor 'indeed

would any man else, but one who, like me, wanted
nothing so much as a safe retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where by mere accident I would say, (if I
dip not see abundant reason to ascribe all such things
now to Providence), l was cutting down some thick
branches of trees, to make charcoal.

I was afraid of makinga smoke about my habitation,
as I said before: and yet, I could not live there with-
out baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c. ; so I
contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen done
in England under turf, till it became chark, or dry
coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved the
coal to carry home, and performed the other services
which fire was wanting for at home, without danger of
smoke. '

But this by the bye. While I was cutting down
some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very thick
branch of low brush wood or under wood, there was a
kind of a hollow place. I was curious to look into it,
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found
it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to
stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me; but
I must confess to you, I made more haste out than I
did in, when looking farther into the place, which
was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of
some creature, which twinkled like two stars; the
dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly in,
and making the reflection.

However after some pause, I recovered myself, and
plucking up courage, I took up a great firebrand, and
in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand.
I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost as
much frightedas I was, before; for I heard a very

. N 3
loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was
followed by a broken noise, as if of words half ex-
pressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped
back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise, that
it put me into a cold sweat; and if I had had had a
hat on my head, I would not answer for it, that my
hair had not lifted it off. But still plucking up my
spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a
little, with considering that the power and presence of
God was every where, and was able to protect me, I
stepped forward again, and by the light of the fire-
brand, holding it a little over my head, I saw, lying on
the ground, a most monstrous frightful old he-goat,
just making his will, as we say, gasping for life, and
dying indeed of mere old age.

I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him out,
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise
himself: and I thought with myself he might even
lie there; for if he had frighted me so, be we :Id

. certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them

should be so hardy as to come in there, while he had
any life in him. - '

- I was now recovered from my surprise, and began
to look round me, when I found the cave was but very
small; that is to say, it might be about twelve feet
over, but in no manner of shape, either round or square,
no hands having ever been employed in making it, but
those of mere nature. 1 observed also that there was
a place at the further side of it, that went in farther,
but was so low that it required me to creep upon my
hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I
knew not: so having no candle, I gave it over for
some time, but resolved to come again the next day.
provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had
made of the lock of one of the muskets, with some
wildfire in the pan. . V-
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with
six large candles of my own making, for I made very
good candles now of goat's tallow: and going into this
low place I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I
have said, almost ten yards, which by the way, I
thought was a venture bold enough, considering that I
knew not how far it might go, or what was beyond it.
When I was got through the strait, I found the roof
rose higher up, I believe near twenty feet; but never
was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say,
as it was, to look round the sides and roof of this vault
or cave. The walls reflected a hundred thousand
lights'to me from my two candles; what it was in the
rock, whether diamonds, or any other precious stones,
or gold, which I supposed it to be, I knew not. '

The place I was in, was a most delightful cavity, or
grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though per-
fectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a
sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no
nauseous or venomous creature to be seen; neither
was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof. The
only difficulty in it was the entrance which however,
as it was a lace of security, and such a retreat as I
wanted, I t ought that was a convenience; so that I
really rejoiced at the discover , and resolved, without
any delay, to bring some of t ose things which I was
most anxious about to this place; particularly I re-
solved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all
my spare arms, viz. two fowling-pieces (for 1 had three
in all), and three muskets (for of them I had eight in
all) ; so I kept at my castle only five, which stood
ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost
fence, and were already to take out upon any ex-
pedition. -'
~ Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition. I
was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I took
up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and I
found that the water had penetrated about three or
four inches into the powder on every side, which cak-
ing and growing hard, had preserved the inside like
a kernel in a shell, so that I had sixty pounds of very
good powder in the centre of the cask, and this was
an agreeable discovery to me at that time: so I car-
ried all away thither, never keeping above two or
three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for fear
of a surprise of any kind. I also carried thither all
the lead I had left for bullets. '

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants,
which were said to live in caves and holes in the rocks,
where none could come at them; for I persuaded my-
self, while I was here, if five hundred savages were to
hunt me, they could never find me out; or if they did
they would never venture to attack me here. '

The old goat, whom I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave, the next day after I made this dis-
covery; and I found it much easier to dig a great
hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with
earth, than to drag him out: so I interred him there,
to prevent offence to my nose.

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in
this island, and was so naturalized to the place, that I
began to be very well contented with the life I led, if
it might but have been secured from the dread of the
savages.

But it was otherwise directed ; and it may not be
amiss for all people who shall meet with my story to
make this deg just observation from it; viz. how fre-
quently, in the course of our lives, the evil, which in
itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are
fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes
the very door of our deliverance, by which alone we
can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen-..

into. I could give many examples of this in the: a

course of my unaccountable life; but in nothing was
it more particularly remarkable than in the circum.
stances of the last years of my solitary residence in
this island.

It was now the month of December, as I said above,
in my twenty-third year ; and this being the southern
solstice, for winter 1 cannot call it, was the particular
time of my harvest, and required my being pretty
much abroad in the fields; when going out prett
early in the morning, even before it was thorough
daylight, t was surprised with seeing a light of some
fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about
two miles, towards the end of the island where 1 had
observed some savages had been as before; but not on
the other side, but, to my great affliction, it was on
my side of the island. -

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go out,
lest I might be surprised; and yet 1 had no more
peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if
these savages, in rambling over the island, should find
my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works or im-p
provements, they would immediately conclude that
there were people in the place, and would then never
give over till they found me out. in this extremity I
went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder
after me, having made all things without look as wild
and natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a
posture of defence. .l loaded all my cannon as I called
them, that is to say, my muskets, which were mounted
upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and re-
solved to defend myself to the last gasp; not forget-
ting seriously to commend myself to the Divine pro-
tection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me
out of the hands of the barbarians: and in this pos-
ture I continued about two hours, but began to be
mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no
spies to send out.

After sitting awhile longer, and musing what I.
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting in
ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder to the side
of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I observed -
before, and then pulling the ladder up after me, I set
it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill; and
pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken
on purpose, I laid me down flat on my belly on the
ground, and began to look for the place. I resently
found there were no less than nine nakedp savages
sitting round a small fire they had made; not to warm
them, for they had no need of that, the weather being
extreme hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of
their barbarous diet, of human flesh, which they had
brought with them, whether alive or dead, I could not

know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had

hauled up upon the shore; and as it was then tide of
ebb, they seemed to wait the return of the flood to go
away again. It is not easy to imagine what confusion
this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on
my side the island, and so near me too; but when I
observed their coming must be always with the cur-
rent of the ebb, I began afterward to be sedate in my
mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with
safety, all the time of tide of flood, if they were not
on shore before; and having made this observation I
went abroad about my harvest-work with the more
composure.

As I expected so it proved; for as soon as the tide
made to the westward, I saw them all take boat, and
row (or paddle, as we call it) all away. I should
have observed, that for an hour and more before they
went off, they went to dancing, and I could easily dis-
cern their postures and gestures by my glasses: I
could not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that
they were stark naked, and had not the least covering
upon them; but whether they were men or women,
that I could not distinguish. -

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two
guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, ,_
and my great sword by my side, without a scabbard,
and with all the speed I was able to make, I went
away to the hill, where I had discovered the first ap-
pearance of all. As soon as I got thither, which was
not less than two hours (for I could not go apace,
being so loaden with arms as I was), 1 perceived there
had been three canoes more of savages on that place;
and looking out farther, I saw they were at sea to-
gether, making over for the main.

This was a dreadful sight to me; especially when
going down to the shore, I could see the marks of
horror which the dismal work they had been about
had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and art
of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoure by
those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so
filled with indignation at the sight, that I began now
to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
there, let them be who or how many soever. '

It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they
thus made to this island, were not very frequent; for
it was above fifteen months before any more of them
came on shore there again; that is to say, 1 never saw
them, or any footsteps or signals of them, in all that
time : for, as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure
not to come abroad, at least not so far; yet all this
while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant
apprehensions I was in of their coming upon me
by surprise ; from whence I observe. that the expec-
tation of evil is more bitter than the suffering, espe-
cially if there is no room to shake of? that expectation,
or those apprehensions.

During all this time, I was in the murdering hu-
mour; and took up most of my hours, which should
have been better employed, in contriving how to cir-
cumvent and fall upon them the very next time I
should see them, eSpecially if they should be divided.
as they were at the last time, into two parties: nor
did I consider at all, that if i killed one party, suppose
ten or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or
month, to kill another, and so another, even ad ire-
finitum, till I should be no less a murderer than they
were in being man-eaters, and perhaps much more so.

I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety
of mind, expecting that I should (one day or other fall
into the hands of these merciless creatures. I f I did at
any time venture abroad, it was not without the
greatest care and caution imaginable; and now I
found to my greatest comfort, how hap y it was that
I had provided a tame flock or a herd of goats ; for l
durst not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially
near that side of the island,' where they usually came,
lest I should alarm the savages ? and if they had fled
from me now, I was sure to have them come back
again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes with
them, in a few days, and-then I knew what to expect.
However I wore out a year and three months more,
before I ever saw any more of the savages; and then
I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is
true, they might have been there once or twice; but
either they made. no stay, or at least I didanot hear
them; but in the month of May, as near as I could
calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had'a
very strange encounter with them, of which in its
p ace. -

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or
sixteen months' interval, was very great. l slept un-
quiet, dreaming always frightful dreams, and often
started out of my sleep in the night; in the day great
troubles overwhelmed my mind; in the night l
dreamed often of killing savages,.and the reasons why
I might justify the doing of it. But, to wave all this
for a while, it was in the middle of May, on the six-
teenth day, as well as my poor wooden calendar would
reckon ; for l marked all upon the post still: I say, it
was on the sixteenth of May, that it blew a very great
storm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightnin
and thunder, and a very foul night was after it.' '
know not what was the particular occasion of it; but
as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with
serious thoughts about my present cOndition, I was
surprised with the noise of a gun, as i thought, fired at
sea.

This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different
nature from any I had met with before; for the notions
this put into my thoughts were quite of another kind.
I started up in the greatest. haste imaginable; and, in
a trice, clapped up my ladder to the middle placeo'f
."the rock, and pulled it after me, and, mounting it '*
thggggcond time, got to the top of the hill; that very

w'e'ng'gash of fire had: me listen for a second gun,

   
 

.3 ..
f.
which accordingly in about half a minute, I heard;
and by the sound knew that it was from that part of
the sea where I was driven out with the current in my

boat.
I immediately considered, that this must be some

ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and fired these guns for
signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had the
presence of mind at that minute, as to think, that
though I could not help them, it may be they might
help me; so I brought together all the dry wood 1
cou (1 get at hand, and making a good handsome pile,
I set it on fire 11 on the hill, the wood was dry, and
blazed freely; an though the wind blew very hard,
yet it burnt fairly out, so that I was certain, if there
was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it,
and no doubt they did ; for as soon as my fire blazed
up, I heard another gun, and after that several others,
all from the same quarter. I plied m fire all night
long, till day broke; and when it was broad day, and
the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance
at sea, full east of the island, whether a sail, or a hull,
I could not distinguish, no not with my glasses, the
distance was so great, and the weather still something
hazy also : at least it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon per-
ceived that it did not move; so I resently concluded
that it was a ship at anchor; and) being eager, you
may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in m
hand, and ran towards the south-east side of the'islan ,
to the rocks, where I had been formerly carried away
with the current; and getting up there, the Weather
by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly_see,
to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship cast in fl};
found when out in my boat: and which rocks, as they
checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind
of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my

recovering then from the most desperate, hopeless
condition that ever 1 had been in, all my life.

Thus, what is one man's safety, is another man's
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon them
in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E. N.
E. Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily
suppose the did not, they must, as I thought, have
endeavoure to have saved themselves on shore by the
help of their boat; but their firing of their guns for
help, especially when they saw, as I imagained, m
fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined
that, upon seein my light, they might have ut
themselves into t eir boat, and have endeavoured) to
make the shore, but that the sea going very high, they 5.
might have been cast away. Other times I imagined?
that they might have lost their boat before, as might
be the case many ways; as particularly by the break-
ing _of the sea upon their ship, which many times
obliged men to stave, or take in pieces their boat, and
sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands.
Other times I imagined they had some other ship or
ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress
they had made, had taken them up, and carried them
ofi'. Other w'hiles I fancied they were all gone off to
sea in their boat, and, being hurried away by the cur-
rent that I had been formerly in, were carried out:
into the great ocean, where there was nothing but
misery and perishing; and that perha 3, they might,
by this time, think of starving, and of sing in a con-
ditipg, to eat one another.

 

d".
It was not however till the last year of my being in
this island, that I ever knew whether any were saved
out of that ship or no; and had only the affliction.
some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy
come on shore, at the end of the island, which was
next the shipwreck. He had on no clothes but a
seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-knee'd linen drawers,
and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to direct me so
much as to guess what nation he was of. He had no-
thing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a
tobacco-pipe; the last was to me of ten times more
value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture
out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might
find something on board that might be useful to me;
but that did not altogether press me so much, as the
possibility that there might be yet some living crea-
ture on board, whose life l might not only save, but
might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last
degree; and this thought clung so to my heart, that
I could not be quiet, night or day, but I must venture
out on board this wreck; and committing the rest to
God's providence, I thought the impression was so
strong upon my mind, that it could not. be resisted,
that it must come. from some invisible direction, and
that I should be wanting to myself, if I did not go.

Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared everything for my voy-
age, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for fresh
water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for i
had still a great deal of that left) and a basket full of
raisins: and thus loading myself with everything ne-
cessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of
her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, \
and then went home again for more. My second car'-

go was a great bag full of rice, the umbrella to set up
over my head for shade, another lar e pot full of fres
water, and about two dozen of sma l loaves, or barley
cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk,
and a cheese; all which, with great labour and sweat,
I brought to my boat, and praying to God to direct
my voyage, I put out; and rowing or paddling the
canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost
point of the island, on that side, viz. N .E. And now
I was to launch out into the ocean; and eitherQ'o ven-
ture, or not to venture. I looked on the rapid cur-
rents which ran constantly on both sides of the island,
at a distance, and which were very terrible to me,
from the remembrance of an hazard I had been in
before, and my heart began to fail me; for I foresaw,
that, if I were driven into either of those currents, I
should be carried a vast way out to sea, and perhaps
out of my reach, or sight of the island again ; and
that then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale
of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began
to give over my enterprise, and, having hauled my
boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and
sat me down upon a little spot of rising ground, very
pensive and anxious, between fear and desire about my
voyage; when, as I was musing, I could perceive,
that the tide was turned, and the flood came on, u n
which my going was for so many hours impractica le.
Upon this, it presently occurre to me, that I should
go up to the highest piece of ground I could find, and
observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents
lay, when the flood came in, thatl might judge whe-
ther, if I were driven one way out, I might not expect to
be driven another way home, with the same rapidness
of the currents. This thought was no sooner in my
0 3
head, but I cast my eye upon a little hill, which suffi-
ciently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence
I had a clear view of the currents, or sets of the tide,
and which way I was to guide myself in my return.
Here. I found, that as the current of the ebb set out
close by the south point of the island, so the. current of
the flood set in close by the shore of the north side;
and that I had nothing to do, but to keep to the north

of the island in my return, and I should do well
enouglfi

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the
next morning, to set out with the first of the tide;
and reposing myself for that night, under the great
watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I made first
a little way out to sea, full north, till I began to feel
the benefit of the current which set eastward, and
which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not so
much hurry me as the southern side current had done
before, and so as to take from me all government of
the boat; but, having a strong steerage with my pad-
dle, I went, I say, at a great rate, directlyfor the
wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it.

It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, Which by
the building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in be-
tween two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her
were beaten to pieces by the sea; and as her forc-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short 01?;
but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow
appeared firm. When I came close to her, a dog ap-
peared upon her, who, seeing me coming, yelped and
cried; and as soon as I called him, jumped into the
sea, to come to me; and I took him into the boat, but
found him almost dead for hunger and thirst. I ge've
him a cake of my bread, and he eat like a ravenous
wolf that had been starving a fortnight in the snow.
I then gave the poor creature some fresh water ; with
which, if I would have let him, he would have burst
himself.

After this I went on board. The first sight I met
with, was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one
another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that,
when the ship struck, it being a storm, the sea broke
so high, that the men were not able to bear it, and
were strangled with the constant rushing in of the
water, as much as if they had been under water. Be-
sides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that
had life; nor any goods that I could see, but what

. were spoiled by the water. There were some casks
of liquor, whether wine or brandy, I knew not, which 2
lay in the lower hold, and which, the water being "
ebbed out, I could see; but they were too big to med-
dle with. I saw several chests, which, 1 believed,
belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of
them into the boat, without examining what was in

em. 0

Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore

part broken off, I am persuaded I might have made'a
good voyage; for, by what I found in these two chests,

I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of

wealth on board: and, if I may guess by the course
she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos

Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of

America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havannah, in the

Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps, to Spain. She had,

'no dodbt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at

that time, to anybody ; and what became of the rest of
her people, I knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons; which I got into my
boat with much difficulty. There were several
muskets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with
about four pounds of powder in it: as for the muskets
I had no occasion for them ; so I left them, but took
the owder-horn. I took a fire shovel and tongs, .
whic I wanted extremely; as also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a grid-
iron : and with this cargo, and the dog, I came away,
the tide beginning to make home again: and the same
evening, about an hour within night, I reached the
island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree.

I reposed that night in the boat; and in the morn-
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new
cave, not to carry it home to my castle. After re-
freshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and be- '
gan to examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I
found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at
the Brazils; and, in a word, not at all good. But
when I came to open the chests. I found several
things which I wanted: for example, I found in one
a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and
filled with cordial waters, fine, and very good: the
bottles held about three pints each, and were tip (1
with silver. I found two ots of very good succa es,
or sweetmeats, so fastened) also on top, that the salt
water had not hurt them ; and two more of the same,
which the water had spoiled. I found some ver good
shirts, which were very welcome to me, and 9. out a
dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and
coloured neckcloths; the former were also very wel-
come, being exceedingl refreshing to wipe my face
in a hot day. Besides t is, when I came to the till in
the chest, I found there three great bags of pieces of
eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all;
and in one of them, wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons
of gold, and some small bars of wedges of gold; I
suppose they might all weigh near a pound.

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but
of little value ; but by the circumstances it must have
belonged to the gunner's mate, though there was no
powder in it, but abs ut two pounds of glazed powder,
in three small flasks, kept,I suppose, for charging
their fowling-pieees on occasion. Upon the whole, I
got very little by this voyage, that was of much use
me; for, as to the money, I had no manner of ocea- 3';
sion for it, it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and
I would have given it all for three or four airs of
English shoes and stockings; which were t ings I
greatly wanted, but had not had on my feet now for
many years. I had, indeed, gotten two pairs of shoes
now, which I took of? the feet of the two drowned men
whom I saw in the wreck; and I found two pair
more in one of the chests, which were very welcome
to me, but they were not like our English shoes,
either for ease or service, being rather what we call
pumps than shoes. I found in this seaman's .chest
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no .gold; I
suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the other,
which-seemed to belong to some oflicer.

NVell, however, I lugged this money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before. which
1 had brought from our own ship ; but it was a eat
pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship ha not
come to my share, for I am satisfied I might have
loaded my canoe several times over with money;
which, if I had ever escaped to England, would have
laid here. safe enough, till I might have come again
and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on shore, and
secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or
paddled her along the shore to her old harbour, where
I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old
habitation, where I found every thing safe and quiet;
so I began to repose myself, live after my old fashion,
and take care of my family affairs ;, and for a while I
lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than
I used to be, looked out oftener, and-did not go abroad
so much ; andif at any time I did stir with any freedom,
it was always to the east part of the island, where I
was pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and
where I could go without so many precautions, and
such a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried
with me if 1 went the other way.

I lived in this condition near two years more; but
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know
it was born to make my body miserable, was all those
two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it
were possible, I might get away from this island; for
sometime I was making another voyage to the wreck,
though my reason told me, that there was nothing
left there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes
for a ramble one way, sometimes another; and I be-
lieve verily, if I had had the boat that I went from
Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea bound any
where, I know not whither.

I am now to be supposed to be retired into my castle,
after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up,
and secured under water as usual, and my condition re-
stored to what it was before. I had more wealth, in-
deed, than 1 had before, but was not at all the richer;
for I had no more use for it than than the Indians of
Peru had before the Spaniards came thither.

About a year and a half after I was surprised one
morning early, with seeing no less than five canoes, all
on shore together, on my side the island, and the peo 1e
who belonged to them all landed and out of my sig t.
The number of them broke all my measures; for
seeing so many, and knowing they always came four
or six, or sometimes, more, in a boat I could not tell
what to think of it, or how to take my measures to at-
tack twenty or thirty men single handed ; so I lay
still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted. How-
ever I put myself into all the same postures for an
attack thatl had formerly provided, and was just ready
for action, if any thing had presented. Having waited
a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise,
at length being very im atient, I set m guns at the
foot of my ladder, and c ambered up to t e top of the
bill by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however,
that my head did not appear above the hill; so that _
they could not perceive me, by any means. Here I
observed by the help of my perspective glass that there
were no less than thirty in number; that they had a
fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed: how they
cooked it, that I know not, or what it was; but they
were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous
gestures and figures, their own way, round the fire.
While l was thus looking on them, I rceived. by
my perspective, two miserable wretches ragged from
the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and
were now brought out for the slaughter. I rceived
one of them immediately fell, being knocke down, I
suppose, with a club, or wooden sword, for that was
their way; and two or three others were at work im-
mediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while
the other victim was left standing by himself, till they
should be ready for him. In that very moment this
. poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, nature
inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away
from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the
sands, directly towards me, i mean towards that part
of the coast where my habitation was.

' I was dreadfully frighted (that 1 must acknowledge),
when I perceived him to run my way; and espe-
cially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the
whole body, However I kept my present station,
and my spirits began to recoVer, when I found that
there were not above three men that followed him;
and still more was I encouraged, when I found that
he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and
gained ground of them, so that if he could but hold '
it out about half an hour, I saw easily he would get '
away from them all.

There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the first. part of my story,
when I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this
I knew he must necessarily swim over, or the poor
wretch would be taken there: but. when the savage
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though
the tide was then up; but, plunging in, swam
through in about thirty strokes or thereabouts, landed,
and ran on with exceeding strength and swiftness.
When the three pursuers came to the creek, I found
that two of them could swim, but the third could not,
and that be standing on the other side, looked at the
others, but went no farther; and soon after went softly
back again, which as it happened, was very well for him
in the main. .

I observed that the two who swam, were yet more
than twice as long swimming over the creek, as the
fellowwas that fled from them. It came now veryage 157.

warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly,
that now was my time to get me a servant, and per-
haps a companion or assistant, and that l was called
plainly by'Provizlence, to save this poor creature's
life. I immediately got down the ladders, with all
possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they
were both at the foot of the ladders. as I observed
above; and getting up again with the same haste to
the top of the hill, [crossed towards the sea: and,

the smoke 'too they would not easily know what to
make of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the
other who pursued him stopped, as 'if he_ had been
frightened, and I advanced apace towards him; but
as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow
and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me ; so I was
then necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, and
killed him at the first shot. The r savage who
fled, but had stopped, though he saw 0th his enemies
fallen and killed as he thought), yet was so frighted
with the fire an noise of my piece, that he stood
stock-still, and neither came forward, nor went back-
ward, though he seemed rather inclined .to fly still,
"than to come on. i hallooed again to him, and made
signs to come forward, which he easily understood, .
P
and came a little way, then stopped again, and then a
little farther, and stopped again; and I could then
perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been
taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his
two enemies were. I beckoned him again to come to
me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement I
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of
acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at
him and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to
come- still nearer. At length he came close to me,
and then he kneeled down again. kissed the ground and
laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the
foot, set my foot upon his head; this, it seems, was
in token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I
took him up, and made much-of him, and encouraged
him all I could. But there was more work to do yet ;
for l perceived the savage whom I knocked down was
not killed but stunned with the blow, and began to
come to himself. So I pointed to him, and showing
him the savage, that he was not dead; upon this he
spoke some words to me, and though I could not un-
derstand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to
hear, for they were the first sound of a man's voice
that I had heard, my own excepted, for above five-
and-twenty years. But there was no time for such
reflections now. The savage who was knocked down
recovered himself so far as to sit upon the ground:
and I perceived my savage began to be afraid: but
when he saw that I presented my other piece at the
man, as if I would shoot him; upon this my savage,
for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend
him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my
side; so I did. He no sooner had it, but he runs to
his enemy, and, at one blow, cut of? his head as
cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done
it sooner or better ; which I thought very strange for

one. who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword
in his life before, except their own wooden swords.
However, it seems, as I learned afterward, they
make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and
the wood is so hard, they will cut off heads even with
them, aye, and arms, and that at one blow too. When
he had done this, he comes laughing at me in signs of
triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with
abundance of gestures, which I did not understand,
laid it down, with the head of the savage that he
had killed, just before me.

But that which astonished him most was to know
how I had killed the other Indian so far off; so
pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him go to 1
him ; so I bade him go, as well as I could. When 52?
he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at 4??
him ; turnedhim first on one side, then on the other; 5 .'
looked at the wound the bullet had made, which, it'i' -:
seems, was just in his breast, where it had made a fig?
hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed, but '
he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. Then
he took up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I
turned to go away, and beckoned to him to follow me,
making signs to him that more might come after them.

Upon this, he signed to me, that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by the
rest, if they followed; and so I made signs again to
him to do so: he fell to work, and in an instant he
scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough :55
to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and -
covered him; and did so also by the other. I' believe
he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour;
then calling him away, I carried him, not to my castle,

but quite away to my cave, on the farther part of
the island; soI did not let my dream come to pass
in that part. viz. that he came into my grove for
shelter.

Here I gave him bread. and a bunch of raisins to
eat, and a (lraught of water, which I found he was in-
deed in great distress for, by his running: and having
refreshed him. I made signs for him to go lie down
and sleep, pointing to a place where I had laid a great
parcel of rice straw, and a blanket upon it, which I
used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor crea-
ture lay down, and went to sleep.

He was a comely, handsome fellow; perfectly well
made, with straight, long limbs, not too large; tall,
and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a
fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something
very manly in his face, and yet he had all the sweet-
ness and softness of an European in his countenance
too, especially when he smiled. His hair was long
and black, not curled like wool; his forehead very
high, and large, and a great vivacity and sparkling
sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not
quite black, but very tawny, and yet not of an ugly,
yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians, and Vir-
ginians, and other natives of America are, but of a
bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it some-
thing very agreeable. though not very easy to describe.
His face was round and plump, his nose small, not
flat like the Negroes, a very good mouth, thin lips,
and his teeth fine, well set, and white as ivory. After
he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an
hour, he. waked again, and comes out of the cave to
me, for I had been milking m goats, which I had in
the enclosurejust by. When re espied me he came
running to me, laying himself down again upon the
ground, with all the possible signs of an humble,
thankful disposition, making many antic gestures to
show it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground,
close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his
head, as he had done before ; and after this, made all
the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submis-
sion imaginable, to let me know how much he would
serve me as long as he lived. I understood him in
many things, and let him know I was very well pleased
with him. In a little time I began to speak to him,
and teach him to speak to me ; and first, I made him
understand his name should be Friday, which was the
day I saved his life ; and I called him so for the me-
mory of the time: I likewise taught him to say,
' Master,' and let him know that was to be my name.
I likewise taught him to say, 'Yes,' and 'No,' and to
know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in
an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before .
him, and sop my bread in it; and I gave him a cake _.
of bread to do the like, which he quickly complied with, _
and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as
it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, and
let him know I would give him some clothes; at
which he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked.

   
  

As we went by the place where we had buried th 't Jo ,:

eat them; at this I appeared very aju' ', xpresse'd

my abhorrence of it, made as if I won : v'o'mit at the

thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him to

come away, which he did immediately with great sub-

mission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to
r 3
see if his enemies were gone, and pulling out my
glass, I looked, and saw plainly the p ace where they
had been, but no appearance of them, or of their canoes;
so that it was plain that they were gone, and had left
their two comrades behind them, without any search
after them.

But I was not content with this discovery; but
having now more courage, and consequently more
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, givmg him
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his
back, which I found he could use very dexterously,
making him carry one gun for me, and l two for my-
self, and away we marched to the place where these
creatures had been; for l had a mind now to get some
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the
place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my

cart sunk within me at the horror of the spectacle.
Indeed it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so tome,
though Friday made nothing of it: the place was
covered with human bones, the ground dyed with the
blood, great ieces of flesh left here and there, half
eaten, mang ed, and scorched; and, in short, all the
tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making
there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw three
skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four legs
and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies:
and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that
they brought over four prisoners to feast upon; that
three of them were eaten up, and that be, pointing to
himself, was the fourth ; that there had been a great
battle between them and their next king, whose sub-
jects, it seems he had been one of ; and that they had
taken a great number of prisoners, all which were car-
ried to several places by those that had taken them in
the. fight, in order to feast upon them, as was done,
hherc by these wretches upon those they brought hi-
t er.

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones,
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them together
on a heap, and make a fire upon it and burn them all
to ashes. I found Frida had still a hankering sto-
mach after some of the esh, and was still a cannibal
in his nature; but I discovered so much abhorrence
at the very thoughts of it, and at the least a pearance
of it, that he durst not discover it; for I ha , by some
means, let him know, that I would kill him if he of-
fered it.

When he had done this, we came back to our castle,
and there I fell to work for m man Friday. And -
first of all, I gave him a pair 0 linen drawers, which
I had out of the gunner's chest 1 had mentioned, and
which I found in the wreck; and which with a little
alteration, fitted him very well: then I made him a
jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my skill would allow,
and I was now grown a tolerably good tailor; and I
gave him a cap, which i had made of a hare-skin, very
convenient, and fashionable enough : and thus he
was dressed, for the present, tolerahl well ; and
mightily was he pleased to see himself a most as well
clothed as his master. It is true, he went awkwardly
in these things at first; wearing the drawers were
very awkward to him; and the sleeves of the waist-
coat galled his shoulders, and the inside of his arms;
but a little easing them where he complained the
hurt him, and using himself to them, at length he too
to them very well.

The next day after I came home to my hutch with
him, I. began to consider where I should lodgehim :
and that I- might do well for him, and yet be perfectly
easy myself, I made a little tent for him, in the vacant
place between my two fortifications, in the inside of
the last, and in the outside of the first: and as there
was a door of entrance there into my cave, I made a
formal framed door-case, and a door to it of boards,
and set it up in the passage, a little within the entrance;
and, causing the door to open on the inside, I barred
it up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so that
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my
innermost wall, without making so much noise in get-
ting over, that it must needs awaken me; for my first
wall had now a complete roof over it of long poles,
covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the
hill, which was again laid cross with small sticks instead
of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with
the rice straw, which was strong like reeds; and at
the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the
ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it
had been attempted on the outside, would not have
opened at all, but would have fallen down, and made
a great noise : and as to weapons, 1 took them all in to
my side every night.

But I needed none of all this precaution ; for never
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than
Friday was to me ; without passions, sullenness, or
designs ; perfectly obliged and engaged; his very
affections were tied to me, like those of a child to a
father; and I dare say, he would have sacrificed his
life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever.
The many testimonies he gave me of this, put it out
of doubt ; and soon convinced me, that I needed to use
no precautions as to my safety on his account.

I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my
business to teach him all that was proper to make
him useful, handy, and helpful ; but especially to
make him speak, and understand me when I spake;
and he was the aptest scholar that ever was, and par-
ticularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so
pleased when he could but understand me, or make
me understand him, that it was very pleasant for me
to talk to him. And now my life began to be so easy,
that I began to say to myself, that could I but have
been safe from more savages, I cared not if I was
never to remove from the place While I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought, that in order to bring Friday of?
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of
-a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other
flesh. So I. took him out with me one morning to the
woods; I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of
my own flock, and bring it home and dress it: but, as .
l was going, I saw a she-goat, lying down in the
shade, and two young kids sitting by her. I catched
hold of Friday : ' Hold,' said I: 'stand still ;'-and
made signs to him not to stir: immediately I presented
my piece, shot and killed one of the kids. The poor
creature who had, at a distance, indeed seen me kill
the savage, his enemy, but did not know nor could
imagine, how it was done, was sensibly surprised,
trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed, that I
thought he would have sunk down. He did not see
the kid I had shot at, nor perceive I had killed it, but
ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was nor. wounded;
and, as 1 found presently, thought I was resolved to
kill him ; for he came and kneeled down to me, and
embracing my knees, said a great many things I did
not understand ; but I could easily see, that his mean-
ing was to pray me not to kill him. ,. .
I soon found a way to convince him, that I Would

do him no harm; and, taking him up by the hand, '
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he
did ; and while he was wondering and looking to see
how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again,
and by-and-by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit
upon a tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand
a little what 1 would do, 1 called him to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though
I thought it had been a hawk; I say, pointing to the
parrot and to my gun, and to the ground under the
parrot, to let him see I would make him fall, 1 made
im understand that I would shoot and kill that bird:
accordingly I fired, and bade him look, and immediately
he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened
again, notwithstanding all that I had said to him ; and
I found he was the more amazed, because he did not
see me put anything into the gun ; but thought there
must be some wonderful fund of death and destruction
in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any
thing near or far off; for the astonishment this created
in him was such as could not wear off for a long time;
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have
worshipped me and my gun : as for the gun itself, he
would not so much as touch it for several days after;
but would 'speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
swered him, when he was by himself, which, as I after-
wards learned of him, was to desire it not to kill him.
\Vell, after his astonishment was a little over at this,

I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot,
which he did, but staid some time; for the parrot, not
being quite dead, was fluttered a good way off from
the place where she fell. However, he found her,
took her up, and brought her to me ; and as I had
perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took
this advantage to charge the un again, and not let
him see me do it, that I might e ready for any other
mark that might present ; but nothing more offered at
that time. So I brought home the kid, and the same
evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I
could ; and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or
stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good
broth : after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to
my man, who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very
well; but that which was strangest to him was to see
me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me, that the
salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into his
own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit
and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water
after it; on the other hand, I took some meat in my
mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter
for want of salt, as fast as he had done at the salt: but
it would not do; he would never care for salt with
meat, or in his broth, at least, not for a great while,
and then but a very little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I
was resolved to feast him the next day with roasting
a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it before the
fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in Eng-
land, setting two poles up, one on each side the fire,
and one cross on the top, and tying the string to the
cross stick, letting the meat turn continually. This
Friday admired very much; but when he came to _

taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how
well he liked it, that I could not but understand him:
and at last, he told me he would never eat man's flesh

any more, which I was very glad to hear. _
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do, as
I observed before; and he soon understood how to do
it as well as l, especiall after he had seen what the
meaning of it was, and t at it was to make bread of ;
for after that I let him see me make my bread, and
bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to do
all the work for me, as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider, that, having two mouths to
feed instead of one, l must provide more. ground for
my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn than I
used to do, so I marked outa larger piece of land, and
began the fence in the same manner as before, in
which Friday not only worked very willingly, and
very hard, but did it very cheerfully; and I told him
what. it was for, that it was for corn to make more
bread, because he was now with me, and that I might
have enough for him and myself too. He appeared
very sensible of that part, and let me know that he
thought I had much more labour upon me on his ac-
count, than I had for myself, and that he would work
the harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in
this place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and
understand the names of almost every thing I had oc-
casion to call for, and of every place I, had to send him
to, and talk a great deal to me; so that in short I be-
gan now to have some use for my tongue again, which
indeed I had very little occasion for before ; that is to
say, about speech. Besides the pleasure of talking'to
him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself .-
his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to be more and
more every day, and I began reall to love the crea-
ture; and on- his side, I believe he oved me more than
it was possible for him ever to love any thing before

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again ; and having
learned him English so well, that he could answer me
almost any questions, I asked whether the nation that
he belonged to never conquered in battle. At which he
smiled, and said, ' Yes, yes: we always fight the
better,' that is, he meant, always get the better in
fight: and so we began the following discourse. ' You
always fight the better!' said I': ' How came you to
be taken prisoner then, Friday ?'

Friday. My nation beat much for all that.

Master. How beat? If your nation beat them, how
' came you to be taken ?

Friday. They more than my nation in the place
where me was: they take one, two, three, and me.
My nation over-beat them in the yonder place, where
me no was: there my nation take one, two great
thousand. '

Master. But why did not your side recover you
from the hands of your enemies then ?

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe: my nation have no canoe that
time.

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away, and eat them as these did ?

Friday. Yes, my nation eats mans too, eat all up.

Master. \Vhere do they carry them?

Friday. Go to other place where they think.

Master. Do they come hither ?

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither: come other
else place.

Master. Have on been here with them ?

Friday. Yes, been here. (Points to the N.W.
side of the island, which it seems was their side.)

B this I understood that my man Friday had for-
mer y been among" the savages who used to come on
shore, on the farther parts of the island, on the said
man--eating occasions-that he was now brought for:
and some time after, when I took courage to-carry

Q

\
him to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned,
he presently knew the place, and told me he was there
once, when they eat up twenty men, two women, and
one child: he could not tell twenty in English, but he
numbered them by laying so many stones in a row, ~
and pointing to me to tell them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what
follows: that, after I had had this discourse with him,
Iasked him how far it was from our island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost. He
told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost; but
that, after a little way out to sea, there was a current,
and a wind always one way in the morning. the other
in the afternoon.

This I understand to be no more than the sets of
the tide, as going out or coming in ; but I afterwards
understood it was occasioned by the great draught and
reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque; in the mouth
of which river, as l thought afterward, our island lay ;
and that this land, which I perceived to the IV. and
N.VV. was the great island Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river. Iasked Friday a
thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants,
the sea, the coast, and what nations were near : he told
me all he. knew, with the greatest openness imagina-
ble. I asked him the names of the several nations of
his sort of pe0ple, but could get no other name than
Caribs; from whence I easily understood, that these
were the Caribbees which our maps place on that part
of America which reaches from the mouth of the river
Oroonoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha.
He told me, that up a great way beyond the moon,
that was, beyond the setting of the moon, which must
be west from their country, there dwelt white, bearded
men. like me, and pointed to my great whiskers,
which I mentioned before; and that they had killed
'much mans.' that was his word. By all which, I
understood he meant the Spaniards; whose cruelties
in America had been spread over the whole countries,
and were remembered by all the nations from father
to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men; he
told me yes, yes, I might go in 'two canoe.' I could
not understand what he meant by 'two canoe :' till at
last, with great difficulty, I found he meanththat it,
must be in a large, great big canoe, as big as two
canoes.

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with
me very well: and from this time I entertained some
hopes, that, one time or other, I might find an oppor-
tunity to make my escape from this place, and that
this poor savage might be a means to help me to do it.

During the long time that Friday had now been
with me,' and that he began to speak to me, and un-
derstand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation of
religious knowledge in his mind ; particularly I asked
him one time, who made. him. The poor creature did
not understand me at all, but thought I had asked
who was his father. But I took it by another handle,
and asked him who made the sea, the ground he:
walked on, and the hills and woods. He told me, it
was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all. He
could describe nothing of this great person, but that
he was very old; much older, he said, than the sea
or the land, than the moon or the stars. I asked him
then, if .this old person had made all things, why did
not all things worship him. He looked very grave,
and with a perfect look of innocence, said, ' All

Q 2
things said O! to him.' I asked him if the people
who die in his country, went anywhere. He said,
yes, they all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked
him, whether those they eat up went thither too: he
said, ' Yes.'

From these things I began to instruct him in the
knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the great
Maker of all things lived up there, pointing up to-
wards heaven : that he governs the world by the same
power and providence by which he had made it . that.
he was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give
every thing to us, take every thing from us: and,
thus by degrees I opened his eyes. He listened with

'great attention, and received with pleasure the notion
of Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the
manner of making our prayers to God, and his being
able to hear us, even in heaven. He told me one day
that if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he
must needs bea greater God than their Benamuckee,
who lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear,
till they went up to the great mountains where he
dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him if ever he went
thither to speak to him; he, said, no; they never
went that were young men ; none went thither but the
old men, whom he called their Oowokee, that is, as I
made him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy ;
and that they went to say 0 (so he called saying

rayers), and then came back, and told them 'what

enamuckec said. By this I observed, that there is a

riestcraft even amongst the most blinded ignorant
agans in the World ; and the policy of making a secret
religion, in order to preserve the veneration of the
pteople to the clergy, is not only to be found in the
oman, but perhaps among all religions in themmrxsos CRUSOE. 173

world, even among the most brutisli and barbarous
savages.

l endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man

Friday, and told him, that the pretence of their old
men going up to the mountains to say 0 to their god
Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing word
from thence what he said, was much more so; that if
they met with any answer, or spoke with any one there,
it must be with an evil spirit: and then I entered into
a long discourse with him about the devil, the original
of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man,
the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark
' parts of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and
as God, and the many stratagems he made use of, to de-
lude mankind to their ruin: how he had a. secret ac-
cess to our passions, and to our afi'ections, to adapt
his snares so to our inclinations, as to cause us to be -
our tempters, and to run upon our own destruction,
:by our own choice.
<< 'I always applied myself to reading the Scriptures,
and to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning
of what I read; and he again by his serious inquiries
and questions, made me a much better scholar, in the
Scripture knowledge than I should ever have been
by my own mere private reading.

After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almost all I
said to him, and speak fluently, though in broken
English, to me, I acquainted him with my own story,
or at least so much of it as related to my coming into
the place, how I had lived there, and how long. I let
him into the mystery (for such it was to him) of gun-
powder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I
gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted
with, and I made him a belt with a frog hanging to it,

Q 3
such as in England we wear hangers in ; and, in the
frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which
was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but
much more useful upon many occasions.

I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of
the world. I gave him an account of the wreck which
I had been on board of, and showed him as near as I
could, the place where she lay ; but she was beaten in
pieces long before, and quite gone.

I showed him the ruins of our boat, which was -
lost when I escaped, and which I could not stir with
my whole strength then. but was now fallen almost
all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood
musing a great while, and said nothing. I asked him
what it was he studied upon; at last, says he, ' Me see
such boat like come to place at my nation.'

I did not understand him a good while ; but at last,
when I examined further into it, I understood by him,
that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon
the country where he lived; that is, as he explained
it, was driven there by stress of weather. I presently
imagined, that some European ship must have been
cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose
and drive ashore; but was so dull that I never once
thought of men making escape from a wreck thither,
much less whence they might come; so I only in-
quired after a description of the boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him when he added,
with some warmth, ' We save the white mans from
drown.' Then I resentl asked him if there were
any white mans, as xe calle them, in the boat: ' Yes,'
he said, 'the boat full of white mans.' I asked him,
' How many ?' He told me upon his fingers seventeen.
I asked him then, ' What became of them ?' He told
me, ' They live, they dwell at my nation.'

This put new thoughts again into my head; for I
presently imagined, that these might be the men he-
longing to the ship that was cast away in sight of my

. island, as I now call it; and who, after the ship was
struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost,
.had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed
upon that wild shore among the savages. '

Upon this I inquired of him more critically, what
was become of them: he assured me they lived still
there; that they had been there about four years; that
the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to
live. I asked 'him, how it came to ass they did not kill
them, and eat them. He said, ' 0, they make bro-
ther with them ;' that is, as I understood him, a truce:
and then he added, ' They no eat mans, but when
make the war fight ;' that is to say, they never eat
any men, but such as come to fight with them, and are
taken in battle. '

It was after this, some considerable time, that being
on the top of the hill, at the east side of the island,
from whence I had, in a clear day, discovered the main -
or continent of America; Frida , the weather being
very serene, looks very earnes y towards the main
land, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and
dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some distance
from him: I 'IS'K'VSI him i'hat was the matter. ' 0
joy 1' says he, ' O glad ! There see my country !
there my nation!'

' I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure ap-

pear in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his coun-
tenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had
a mind to be in his own country again: and this ob-
servation of mine put a great many thoughts into me,
which made me at first not so easy about my new man
Friday, as I was before; and I made no doubt, but
that if Friday could get back to his own nation again
he would not only forget all his religion, but all his
obligation to me; and would be forward enough to
give his countrymen an account of me, and come
back perhaps, with a hundred or two of them, and
make a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry
as they used to be with those of his enemies when
they were taken in war.

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much,
for which i was very sorry afterward : however as my
jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, I was a
little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind
to him as before : in which I was certainly in the wrong
too, the honest grateful creature having no thought
about it, but what consisted of the best principles, both
as a religious Christian, and as a grateful friend, as
appeared afterward to my full satisfaction.

'Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure
I was every day pumping him to see if he would dis-
cover any of the new thoughts which I suspected were
in him ; but I found every thing he said was honest, and
so innocent that I could find nothing to nourish my
suspicion ; and, in spite of all my uneasiness, he made
me at last entirely his own again; nor did he in the.
least perceive, that I was uneasy; and therefore I
could not suspect. him of deceit.

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con-
tinent, I called to him, and said, ' Friday, do not you
wish yourself in your own country, your own nation 2'
' Yes,' he said, ' 1 be much 0 glad to be at my own _
nation.' ' \Vhat would you do there ?' said I: ' would
you turn wild again, eat man's flesh again, and be
savage as you were before ?' He looked full of concern,
and shaking his head, said, ' No, no ; Friday tell them
to live good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat
corn-bread" cattle-flesh, milk : no eat man again.'

' Why then,' said Ito him, 'they will kill you.'
He looked grave at that, and then said, ' No, they no
kill me 3 they willing love learn.' He meant by this,
they would be willing to learn : he added, they learned
much of the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then
I asked him if he would go back to them. He smiled
at that, and said he could not swim so far. I told him
I would make a canoe for him, he told me he would
go, if I would go with him. ' I go ! ' said I, ' why they
will eat me, if I come there.' ' No, no,' said he, ' me
make them not eat on : me make they much love ou.'
He meant he won (1 tell them how I had kille his
enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make
them love me. Then he told me, as well as well as
he could, how kind they were to seventeen white men,
or bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore
there in distress.

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture
over, and see if I 'could possibly join with these
bearded men. who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards
or Portuguese ; not doubting, but, if I could, we
might find some method to escape from thence, being
upon the continent, and a good company together,
better than I could from an island, forty miles off the
shore, and alone without he] . So, after some days,
I took Friday to work again, By way of discourse; and
told him, I would give him a boat to go back to his
empation; and accordingly carried him to my fri-
gate, which lay on the other side of the island; and

k
having cleared it of 'water (for I always kept it sunk in
the water), 1 brought it out, and showed it him, and
we both went into it.

- I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing
it, would make it go almost as fast again as 1 could;
so when he was in it, I said to him, ' Well, now, Fri-
day, shall we go to your nation ?' He looked very
dull at my'saying so; which, it seems, was because he
thought the boat too small to go so far. I told him
then I had a bigger; so the next day I went to the
place where the first boat lay which I had made, but
which I could not get into the water. He said that
was big enough; but-then as I had taken no care of
it, and it had lain two or threeuand-twenty years
there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was in a
manner rotten. Friday told me, that such a boat
would do very well, and would carry ' much enough
vittle, drink, bread ;' that was his way of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon
my design of going over with him to the continent,
that I told him we would go and make one as big as
that, and he should go home in it. He answered not
one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked
him what was the matter with him. He asked me
again thus, ' \Vhy you angry mad with Friday ?
What me done?' I asked him what he meant: I told
him I was not angry with him at all. 'No angry!
No angry!' says he, repeating the words several
times: ' why send Friday home away to my nation ?'
'Why,' said I, 'Friday, did you not say you wished
you were there ?' ' Yes, yes,' says he, ' wish we both
there; no wish Friday there, no master there.' In a
word, he would not think of going there without me.
' I go there, Friday!' said I; 'what should I do
there ?' He turned very quickly upon me at this":
' You do great deal much good,' says he ;, ' you teach
wild mans be good, sober, tame mans : you tell them
know God, pray God, and live new life.' ' Alas l Fri-
day,'. said I, ' thou knowest not what thou sayest: I
am not but an ignorant man myself.' ' Yes, yes,'
says he, ' you teachee me good, you teachee them good.'
' No, no, Friday,' said I, ' you shall go without me;
leave me here to live by myself, as I did before.' He

looked confused again at that word; and, running to -

one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it
up hastily, and gives it me. ' \Vhat must I do with
this ?' said I to him. ' You take kill Friday,' says he.
' What must I kill you for ?' .said I again. He re-
turns very quickly, ' What you send Friday away for ?
Take kill Friday: no send Friday away.' ' This he
spoke. so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes-
In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affec-
tion in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that
I told him then, and often after, that I would never
Send him away from me, if he were .willing to stay
with me.

Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, a
settled affection to me, and that nothing should part
him from me, so I found all the foundation of his
desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent
affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them
good; a thing, which as I had no notion of myself, so
I had not the least thought, or intention, or desire of
undertaking it. But still I found a strong inclination
to my attempting an escape, as above, founded on the
supposition gathered. from the former discourse; viz.
that there 'were seventeen bearded men there; and
therefore, without any more delay, I went to work
With Friday, to find out a great tree proper to fell,

1'30 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

Voyage. There were trees enough in the island to
have built a little fleet, not of periaguas and canoes
only, but even of good large vessels: but the main
thing I looked at, was to get one so near the water,
that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid
the mistake I committed at first.

At last Friday pitched u on a tree; for I found he
knew much better than I-w at kind of wood was fittest
for it; nor can I tell, to this day, what wood to call
the tree we cut down, except that it was very like the
tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua
wood, for it was much of the same colour and smell.
Friday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this
tree out, to make it into a boat: but I showed him
how rather to cut it out with tools, which after I
showed him how to use, he did it very handily; and
in about a month's hard labour, we finished it, and
made it very handsome, 68pecially when with our axes,
which I showed him how to handle, we c'ifi alid'itewed
the outside into the true shape of a boatvmiflfler this,
however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her
along, as'it were, ineh' by inch, upon great rollers, into
the water: but when she was in, she would have car-
ried twenty men with great case.

When she was in the water, and though she was so
big, it amazed me to see with what dexterity and how
swift my man Friday would manage her, turn her,
and paddle her along. So I asked him, if, he would,
and if we might venture over in her; ' Yes,' he said,
' me venture over in her very well, though great blow
wind.' However, I had a farther design that he knew
nothing of, and that was to make a mast and a sail,
and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast,
that was easy enough to get; so I pitched upon a
straight young cedar-tree, which I found near the
place, and which there was great plenty of in the is-
land; and 1 set Friday to work to cut it down, and
gave him directions how to shape and order it: but as
to the sale, that was my particular care. Iknew I had
old sails, or rather pieces of old sails enough, but as I
had had them now twenty-six years by me, and not
been very careful to preserve them, not imagining
that I should ever have this kind of, use for them, I
did not doubt but they were all rotten; and indeed
most of them were so. However, I found two pieces
which appeared pretty good, and with these I went to
work; and with a great deal of pains, and awkward
tedious stitching (you may be sure), for want of
needles, 1 at length made a "three-cornered ugly thing,
like what we call in England, a shouldenof-mutton
sail, to go with a boom at the bottom, and a little short
sprit at the top, such as usually our ships' long-boats _
sail with, and such as' I best knew how to manage,

because it was such a one as I used in the boat in

which Ixmade my escape from Barbary, as related in
the first part of my. story. '

I was near two months performing this last work;
viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails; for I fin-
ished them very complete, making a small stay, and a
sail, or fore-sale to it, to assist, if we should turn to
windward; and, which was more than all, I fixed a
rudder to the stern of her, to steer with: and though
I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the
usefulness and even necessity of such a thing, 1 applied
myself with so much pains to do it, that at last I
brought it to. ass; though, considering the many dull
contrivances had for it that failed, I think it cost me
almost as much labour as making the boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach. as to what belonged to the navigation of my

a
boat: for though he knew very well how to paddle the
canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a
rudder, and was the most amazed when he saw me
work the boat to-and-again in the sea, by the rudder,
and how the sail gibbed, and filled this way or that
way, as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he
saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed.
However, with a little use, i made all these things
familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, ex-
cept that as to the compass, I could make him under-
stand very little of that: on the other hand, as there
was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never
any fogs in those parts, there was the less occasion for
a compass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by
night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy sea-
.sons ; and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by

had or sea.
I was now entered on the seven-and twentieth year
of my captivity in this place; though'fiiei4 ' '
ears that I had this creature with meenghm ,

      
   

left out of the account, my habitation'ibjefng*'quite
of another kind, than in all the rest ofthe time. I
kept the anniversary of my landing'here, with the
same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first;
and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I
had much more so now, having such additional testi-
monies of the care of Providence over me, and the
great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily de-
livered: or I had an invincible impression upon my
thoughts, that my deliverance was at hand, and that I
should not be another ear in this place. However,
I went on with my usbandry, digging, planting,
fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my grapes,
and did every necessary thing, as before.

The rainy season was in the mean time upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times;
so I had stowed our newvessel as secure as we could,
bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the
beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship; and
hauling her up to the shore at high-water mark, 1
made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough
to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water
enough to float in; and that when the tide was out,
we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the
water out; and so she lay dry, as to the tide from the
sea; and to keep the rain of, we laid a great many
boughs of trees so thick, that she was as well thatched
as a house; and thus we waited for the months of
November and December, in which I designed to
make my adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the
thought of my design returned with the fair weather,
I was repairing daily for the voyage; and the first
thing .did-was to lay by a certain quantit of pro-
visions, being the stores for'our voyage; an intended
in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and
launch out our boat._ I was _y one morning upon
something of this kind, when 'called to Friday, and
bade him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find
a turtle, or tortoise, a thing which we generally got
once a week, for the sake of the eggs, as well as the
flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came
running back, and flew over my outward wall, or fence,
like one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set
his feet on; and before I had time to speak to him, he
cried out to me, ' 0 master! 0 master! 0 sorrow!
0 bad !' ' What's the matter, Friday ?' said I. ' O
yonder there,' says he, ' one, two, three canoe! one,
two, three!' By this way of speaking, I concluded
there were six; but, on inquiry, I found there were

a 2
but three. ' Well, Friday,' said I, ' do not be frigh-
tened :' so I heartened him up as well as I could.
However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly
scared ; for nothing ran in his head but that they were
come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces
and eat him; and the poor fellow trembled so, that I
scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted him
as well as I could. and told him I was in as much dan-
ger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him.
' But,' said I, ' Friday, we must resolve to fight them.
Can you fight, Friday?' ' Me shoot,' says he; 'but
there come many great number.' ' N o matter for that,'
said I again, ' our guns will fright them that we do not
kill.' So I asked him, whether, if I resolved to defend
him. he would defend me, and stand by me, and do
just as I bade him. He said, ' Me die, when you bid
die. master.' So I went and fetched a good dram of
rum, and gave him; for I had been so good a husband
of my rum, that I had a great deal left. \Vhen he
had drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces,
which we always carried, and loaded them with swan-
shot, as big as smallpistol-bullets: then I took four
mnskets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five
small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with
a brace of bullets each. I hung my great sword, as
usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my er-
spective glass, and went up to the side of the hi , to
see what I could discover; and I found quickly, by my
glass, that there were one-and-twenty savages, three
prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole
business seemed to be the triumphant banquet over
these three human bodies (a barbarous feast indeed!) :
but nothing more than as I had observed was usual
with them. -
I observed also. that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to the
sea. This with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand
these wretches came about, so filled me with indigna-
tion, that I came down again to Friday, and'told him
I was resolved to go down to them, andxkilluthem all ;
and asked him if he would stand by me. ' He had now
gotten over his fright, and his spirits being a little
raised with the dram I had given him, he was very
cheerful; and told me, as before, ' he would die, when
I bid die.'

In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms
which I had charged, as before, between us: I gave
Frida one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol and the other
three myself; and in this posture we marched out. I
took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave
Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets; and
as t ' Aders, I charged him to keep close behind me,
antho stiry. or shoot, or do any thing till I bade
him ; and, in the mean time, not to speak a word. In:-
this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of
near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into
the wood; so that I might come within shot of them,
before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my
glass it was easy to do.

I now entered the wood, and with all possible wari-
ness and silence (Friday following close at my heels), I
marched till I came to the skirt of it, on theside which
was next to them; onl that one corner, of the wood
lay between me and t em. Here I called softly to
Friday, and showing him a great tree, which was just
at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree,

It 3
and bring me word if he could see there plainly'what
they were doing. He did so, and came immediately
back and said, they might be plainly viewed there; that
they were all about the fire, eating the flesh of one of
their prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the.
sand, a little from them, whom, he said, they would
kill next, and which fired the very soul within me.
He told me it was not one of their nation. but one of
the bearded men whom he had told me of, that came
to their country in the boat. I was filled with horror
at the very naming the white, bearded man ; and,
going to the tree, i saw plainly, by my glass, 3 white
man, who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hands
and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes; and
that he was a European, and had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the place
where l was, which by going a little way about, I saw
I might come at undiscovered, and that then 1 should
be within half-shot of them. So I withheld my passion,
though I was indeed enraged to the highest dfiee;
and, going back about twenty paces, I got behind ome
bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other
tree, and then I came to a little rising ground, which
gave me a full view of them, at the distance of about
eighty yards.-

lhad now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of
the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all close
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to
butcher the oor Christian, and bring him, perhaps,
limb by limh, to their fire; and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. 1 turned to Fri-
day: 'Now, Friday,' said I, ' do as I bid thee.' Fri-
day said he would. 'Then, Friday,' said I, 'do ex-
actly as you see me do; fail in hothing.' So I set
"down one of the muskets, and the fowling-piece,
upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and
with the other musket I took my aim at the savages,
bidding him to do the like: then asking him if he was
ready, he said, ' Yes.' ' Then fire at them,' said 1 ;
and the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on
the side that he shot, he killed two of them, and
wounded three more; and, on my side, I killed one,
and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a
dreadful consternation; and all of them who were not
hurt, jumped up upon their feet immediately, but did
not know which way to run, or which way to look;
for they knew not from whence their destruction came'.
Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid
him, he might observe what I did: so, as soon as the
first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took
up the fowling-picce, and Friday did the like : he
sees me cock and present; he did the same again. '
' Are you ready, Friday ?' said I. ' Yes,' said he.
'Let fly, then,' said I, 'in the name of God ;' and
with that I fired again among the amazed wretches,
and so did Friday -, and as our pieces were now loaded
with what I call swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we
found only two drop: but so many were wounded that
they ran about yelling and screaming like mad crea- .
tures, all bloody and miserably wounded, most of them ;
E'helreof three more fell quickly after, though not quite

ea . " i

' Now, Friday,' said I, laying down the discharged
pieces and taking up the musket, which was yet leaded,
' follow me,' said I ; which he did, with a deal ~ of
courage: upon which i rushed out of the wood, and '
showed myself, and Friday close at my foot. . As soon .
as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I
188 ROBINSON cnusoa.

could, and bade Friday do so too; and runningas fast
as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, being
loaded with arms as I was, I made directly toWards the
poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the beach
or shore, between the place where they sat, and the
sea. The two butchers who were just going to work
with him, had left him, at the surprise of our first
fire, and fled in a terrible fright, to the sea-side, and
had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest
had made the same way. 1 turned to Friday, and bade
him step forwards, and fire at them: he understood
me immediately, and, running about forty yards to be
near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had
killed them all; for I saw them all fall on a heap in
the boat; though I saw two of them up again quickl :
however, he killed two of them, and wounded t e
third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat,
as if he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out
my knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor vic-
tim ; and, loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up,
and asked him, in the Portuguese tongue, what he was.
He answered, in Latin, ' Christianus :' but was so
weak and faint, that he could scarcely stand, or speak.
' I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him,
making signs that he should drink, which he did; and
I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat. Then I
asked him what countryman he was; and he said,
' Espagnole :' and being a little recovered, let me
know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how
much he was in my debt for his deliverance. ' Seig-
nor,' said I, with as much Spanish as I could make
up, ' we will talk afterward, but we must fight now;
if you have any strength left, take this pistol and
sword, and lay about you.' He took them very thank-
fully, and no sooner had he the arms in his hands,
but, as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew
upon his murderers, like a fury, and had cut two of
them in pieces in an instant; f0r the truth is, as the
whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures
were so much frighted with the noise of our pieces,
that they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and
had no more power to attempt their 'own escape, than
their flesh had to.resist our shot; and that was the
case of those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for
as three of them fell with the hurt they received, so
the other two fell with the fright. _.'-'s_
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firingglfi
being willing to keep my charge ready, because 1 badge

to Friday, and bade him run 11 to the tree from.
whence we first fired, and fetch t e arms which'la g

sat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade

fore I, who was running to help, could come near him.
--Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his
hatchet; and with that be dispatched those three who,
as I said before, were wounded at first and fallen, and
all the rest he could come up with; and the Spaniard
coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowl-
ing--pieces, with which he pursued two of the savages,
and wounded them both; but as he was not able to
run, they both got from him into the wood, where
Friday pursued them, and killed one of them ; but the
other was too nimble for him; and though he was
wounded, yet had plunged into the sea, and swam,
with all his might, of? to those who were left in the
canoe, which three in the canoe, with one wounded, we
know not whether he died or no, were all that escaped

our hands, of one-and-twenty. The account of the
rest is as follows :--

3 Killed at our shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat.

2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.

I Killed by ditto, in the wood.

4 Killed, eing found dro ped here and there, of

4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not
dead.

----~

21 In all.

Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to get
out of gun-shot; and thoughFriday made two or three
shot at them, I did not find that he hit any of them.
Friday would fain have had me take one of their ca.
noes, and pursue them, and indeed I was very anxious
about their escape, lest, carrying the news home to
their people, they should come back, perhaps with two

or three hundred of their canoes, and devour us by
mere- multitude: so- 1 consented to pursue them by
sea; and running to one of their canoes, I jumped in,
and bade. Friday follow us; but when I was in the
canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature
lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard
was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not
knowing what the matter was, for he had not been able

to look up over the side of the boat; he was tied so
hard, neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that 7 "
he had really little life in him.

I immediate] cut the twisted flags, or rushes, which
they had boun him with, and would have helped him
up; but he could not stand, or speak, but groaned most
piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was only
unbound in order to be killed.

When Friday came to him, I bade him s eak to him,
and tell him of his deliverance; and pul ing out my
bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram, which,- .
with the news of his being delivered, revived him, and ' "L
he sat up in the boat; but when Friday came to hear ' -;'
him speak, and looked in his face, it would have moved {-3}
any one to tears, to have seen how Friday kissed him,
embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed,
jumped about, danced, sung, then cried again, wrung
his hands, beat his own face and head, and then sung
and jumped about again, like adistracted creature. It

was a good while before I could make him s ak tag"

came a little to himself, he told me that it was his fa-v

It is not easy for me to ex ress how it moved me,
to see what ecstacy and filia affection had worked in
this poor savage, at the sight of his father, and of his
being delivered from death; nor indeed can 1 describe
half the extravagances of his affection after this; for
he went into the boat, and out of the boatagreat many
times. When he went in to him, he would sit down
by him, open his breast, and hold his father's head
close to his bosom, half an hour together, to nourish it;
then he took his arms and ancles, which were numbed
and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them
'with his hands: and I, perceiving what the case was,
gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with,
which did them a great deal of good.

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe
with the other savages, who were now gotten almost out
of sight; and it was happy for us that we did not, for
it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they
could be gotten a quarter of their way, and continued
blowing so hard all night, and that from the north
west, which was against them, that I could not suppose
their boat could live, or that they ever reached their
own coast.

But to return to Friday, he was so busy about his.
' father, that I could not find in my heart to take him
off, for some time: but after I thought he could leave
him a little, 1 called him to me, and he came jumping
and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme.
Then I asked him, if he had given his father any
bread. He shook his head, and said, ' None: ugly
. dog eat all up self.' So 1 gave him a cake of bread
out of a little pouch I carried on pur se ; I also gave
him a dram for himself, but he woul not taste it"; but _
carried it to his father. I had in my pocket also two
or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave him a hand-
ful of them for his father. He had no sooner given
his father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the
boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitched. He
ran at such a rate (for he was the swiftest fellow of
his foot that ever I saw), I say, he ran at such arate,
that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant;
and though I called and hallooed too after him, it was
all one: away he went, and in a quarter of an hour,
I saw him come back again, though not so fast as he
went; and as he came nearer, I found his pace was
slacker, because he had something in his hand.

When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his
father some fresh water; and that he had got two
more. cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave
me, but the water he carried to his father: however,
as I was very thirsty too, I took a little su of it.
This water revived his father more than all t 'e rum
or spirits I had given him: for he was just fainting
with thirst.

When his father had drunk, I called to him toknow
if there was any water left: he said, ' Yes,' and I
bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as
much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the
cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who
was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon
a green place, under the shade of a tree, and whose
limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled with
the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw
that upon Friday's coming up to him with the water,
he sat up, and drank, and took the bread, and began to
eat, I went to him, and gave him a handful of raisins.

He looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude

and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance;
but "was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
' s
himself in the fight, that he could not stand up upon
his feet: he tried to do it two-'or three times, but was
really not able, his ancles were so swelled, and so
painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused
Friday to rub his ancles, and bathe them with rum,
as he had done his father's.

I observed the poor affectionate creature every two
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here,
turned his head about, to see if his father was in the
same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at
last he found he was not to be seen, at which he
started up, and without speaking a word, flew with that
swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his feet
to touch the ground as he went: but when he
came he only found he had laid himself down to ease
his limbs. So Friday came back to me presently;
and I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him
up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he
should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take
care of him; but Friday, a lusty young fellow, took
the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried him
away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the side
or gunwale of the canoe, with his feet in the inside
of it, and then lifted him quite in, and set him close to
his father, and presently stepping out again, launched
the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than
I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too;
so he brought them both safe into our creek, and
leaving them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other
canoe. As he passed me, I s oke to him, and asked
him whither he went. He to (1 me, ' Go fetch more
boat.' So away he went, like the wind ; for sure
never man or horse ran like him: and he had the
other canoe in the creek, almost as soon as I got to
it by land: so, he wafted me over, and then went to
help our new guests out of the boat, which he did;
but they were neither of them able to walk; so that
poor Friday knew not what to do.

To remedy this. I went to work in my thoughts, and
calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank
while he came to me, I soon made a kind of hand-
barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them
up both together upon it between us. But when we
got them to the outside of our wall, or fortification,
we were at a worse loss than before, for it was impos-
sible to get them over; and I was resolved not to
break it down. So I set to work again; and Friday-
and I, in about two hours' time, made a very hand-
some tent, covered with old sails, and above that with
boughs of trees, being in the space without our out-
ward fence, and between that and the grove of young
wood which I had planted: and here we made them
two beds of such things as I had; viz. of good rice'
straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another
to cover them on each bed. .

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself
very rich in subjects; and it was a merry reflection
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked.
First of all, the whole country was my own mere pro-
perty, so that 1 had an undoubted right of dominion.
Secondly, my people were perfectly subjected: I was
the absolute lord and lawgiver: they all owed their
lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if
there had been occasion of it, for me. It was remark-
able too, I had but three subjects, and they were of
three different religions: my man Friday was a pro- '
testant; his father was a pagan and a cannibal: and
the Spaniard was a papist-z However, I allowed liberty
of conscience throughout my dominions. But this is
by the way. 0

s
As soon as I had secured my two weak, rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to rest
them upon, I began to think of making some provision
for them ; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday
to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out
of my particular flock, to be killed. Then I cutoff the
hinder quarter, and chopping it into small pieces, I set
Friday to work to boiling and stewing, and made them
a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth,
having put some barley and rice also into the broth ;
and as I cooked it without doors, for I made no fire
within In inner wall, so I carried it all into the new
tent: an having set a table there for them, I sat down
and eat my dinner also with them: and, as well as I
could, cheered them and encouraged them, Friday
being my interpreter, especially to his father, and in-
deed to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the
language of the savages pretty well; "

After we had dined, or rather supped, 'I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our
muskets and other fire-arms, which, for want of time,
we had left upon the place of battle: and the next
day I ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of
the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would pre-
sently be offensive; and I also ordered him tobury the
horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which i knew
were pretty much, and which I could not think of
doing myself; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I
went that way. All which he punctually performed,
and defaced the very alppearance of the savages being
there ; so that when Went again, 1 could scarcely
know where it was, otherwise than by the corner of
the wood, pointing to the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with
my two new subjects ; and first I set Friday to inquire

. f. ,
a

I. 9.!" _' .
of his father what he thought of the escape of the
savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect a
return of them with a power too great for us to resist.
His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat
never could live out the storm which blew that night
they went ofl", but must of necessity be drowned or
driven south to those other shores, where they were
as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned, if
they were cast away; but as to what they would do, if
they came safe on shore, he said he knew not: but it
was his opinion that they were so dreadfully frighted
with the manner of their being attacked, the noise and
the fire, that he believed they would tell their people
they were all killed by thunder and lightning, and not
by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared
(viz. Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits or furies
come down to destroy them, and not men with weas
pons. This, he said, he knew, because he heardthetn g
all cry out so in their language to one another; for it
was impossible to them ' to conceive that a man could -
dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance", ,
without lifting up the hand, as was done now. Ant;
this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood"
since by other bands, the savages of that part never
attempted to go over to the island afterward. They
were so terrified with the accounts given b those four
men (for it seems they did escape the sea , that they
believed, whosoever went to that enchanted island,
would be destroyed with fire from the gods.

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under
continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept
always upon my guard, I and all my army; for as we .
were now four of us, I would have ventured upon a
hundred of them fairly, in the open field, at any time.

in a little time, however, no more canoes appearing,

s 3
the fear of their coming wore off, and I began to take
my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into con-
sideration, being likewise assured by Friday's father,
that I might depend upon good usage from their na-
tion, on his account, if I would go. _

But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I
had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I
understood that there were sixteen more of his country-
men and Portuguese, who having been cast away, and
made their escape to that side, lived there at peace
indeed with the savages, but we're very sore put to it
for necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all
the particulars of their voyage, and found they were a
Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Plata, to the
Havannah, being directed to leave their loading there,
which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back
what European goods they could 'meet with there;
that they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom
they took out of another wreck ; that five of their own
' men were drowned when first their ship was lost; and
that these escaped through infinite danger and hazards,
and arrived almost starved on the cannibal coast,
where they expected to have been devoured every
moment.

He told me, they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither
powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled
all their powder, but a little which they used at their
first landing to provide themselves some food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them
there; and if they had formed no design of making
any escape. He said, they had many consultations
about it: but that having neither vessel, nor tools to
build one, nor provisions of any kind, their counsels
always ended in tears and despair.
I asked him how he thought they would receive a
proposal from me, which might tend towards an escape;
and whether, if they were all here it might not be .
done. I told him, with freedom, I feared mostly their
treachery and ill usuage of me, if [put my life into
their hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue
in the nature of man; nor did men always square their
dealings by the obligations they had received, so much
as they'did by the advantages they expected. 1 told
him it would be very hard, that i should be thedna
strument of their deliverance, and that they should
afterwards make me their prisoner 'in New Spain,
where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacri-
fice, what necessity or what accident soever, brought
him thither: and that I had rather be delivered up to
the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the
merciless 'claws of the priests, and be carried into the
Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded,
if they were all here, we might, with so many hands,
build a bark large enough to carry 'us all away, either
to the 'Brasils southward, or to the islands, or Spanish
coast. northward : but that if, in requital, they should,
when l-h-ad-put weapons into their hands, carry me,
by force, among their own people, I might be ill-used
for my kindness to them, and make my case worse than

it was before.
He answered with a great deal of candour and in-

genuity, that their condition was so miserable, and
they were so sensible of it, that they would abhor the
thought of using any man unkindly, that should con-
tribute to their deliverance: and that, if I pleased, he
would go to them with the old man, and discourse
with them about it, and return again, and'bring me
their answer: that he would make conditions with

them, upon their solemn oath, that they should be
absolutely under my leading, as their commander and
captain; and they should swear upon the holy sacra-
ments and the Gospel, to be true to me, and to go to
such Christian country, as I should agree to, and no
other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my
orders, till they were landed safely in such country as
I intended; and that he would bring a contract from
them, under their hands, for that purpose.

Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself,
that he would never stir from me as long as he lived,
till I gave him orders; and that he would take my
side to the last drop of blood, if there should happen
the least breach of faith among his countrymen.

He told me they were all of them very civil, honest
men, and they were under the greatest distress ima-
ginable, having neither weapons nor clothes, nor any
food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages,
out of all hopes of ever returning to their own coun-
try ; .and that he was sure, if I would undertake their
relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to re-
lieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage and
the Spaniard over to them to treat. But when he
had gotten all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard
himself started an objection, which had so much pru-
dence in it on the one hand, and so much sincerity on
the other hand, that I could not but be very well
satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliver-
ance of his comrades for at least half-a-year. The
case was thus :-- .

He had been with us now about a month, during
which time I had let him see in what manner I had
provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my
support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and
rice I had laid up, which, as it was more than suffi-
cient for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least with-
out good husbandry, for my family, now it was in-
creased to number four: but much less would it be.
sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one,
for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of Ame-_
rica. So he told me, he thought it would be more
advisable to let him, and the two others, dig and cul-
tivate some more land, as much as I could spare seed
to sow ; and that we should wait another harvest, that
we might have a supply of corn for his countrymen,
when they should come; for want might be a temp-
tation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves -
delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into
another. " You know,' says he, ' the children of Israel,
though they rejoiced at first at their being delivered
out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God himself,
that delivered them, when they came to want bread
in the wilderness.'

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with
his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fidelity.

So we fell to digging all four of us, as well as the
wooden tools we were furnished 'with permitted; and
in about'a month's time, by the end of which it was
seed-time, we had gotten as much land cured and
trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels of bar-
ley on, and sixteen jars of rice, which was, infishort,
all the seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave
ourselves barley sufficient for our own food, for the
six months that we had to expect our crop, that is to
say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for
sowing, for it is not to be supposed it is six months
in the ground in that country '

Having now society enough, and our number being
sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they
had come, unless their number had been very great,
we went freely all over the island, wherever we found
occasion; and as here we had our escape or deliver-
ance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for
me, to have the means of it out of mine. To this
purpose, I marked out several trees, which I thought
fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to
cutting them down: and then I caused the Spaniard,
to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to
oversee and direct their work. I showed them with
what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into
single planks, and I caused them to do the like, till
they had made about a dozen large planks of good
oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and
from two inches to four inches thick. What pro-
digious labour it took up, anyone may imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little
flock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one
day, and myself with Friday the next day; for we
took our turns: and, by this means, we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock. But, above all, the season
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a pro-
digious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that I be-
lieve, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the
sun are cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty
barrels; and these, with our bread, were'a great part
of our food, and very good living too, I assure you;
for it is an exceeding nourishing food.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order. It
was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the
island, but, however, it was enough to answer our end ;
for from our twenty-two bushels of barley, we brought
in and threshed out above two hundred and twenty
bushels of barley, and the like in proportion'uf
the rice, which was store enough for our food to the
next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had
been on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for
a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our
ship, to have carried us to any part of the world, that
is to say, of America. \Vhen we had thus housed and
secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make
more wicker-work; viz. great baskets, in which we
kept it: and the Spaniard was very handy and dex-
terous at this part, and often blamed me, that I did
not make some things for defence, of this kind of
work ; but I saw no need of it.

And now having a full supply of food for all the
guests 1 expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main, to see what he could do with those
he had left behind him there. I gave him a strict
charge in writing not to bring any man with him, who
wouldnot first swear in the presence of himself, and
the old sa'vage, that he would no wa injure, fight
with, or attack the person he should flu in the island,
who was so kind as to send for them, in order to their
deliverance; but that they would stand by and defend
him against all such attempts; and, wherever they
went, would be entirely under, and subjected to, his
command; and that this should be put in writing, and
signed with their hands. How we were to have this
done, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, that
indeed was a question which we never asked.

Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the
old savage (the father of Friday), went away in one of
the canoes, which they might be said to come in, or
rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners
to be devoured by the savages. '
I gave each of them a musket with a firelock on it,
and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging
them to be very good husbands of both, and not to use
either of them but upon urgent occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures
used by me, in view of my deliverance, for now twen-
ty-seven years and some days. I gave them provisions
of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves
for many days, and sufficient for all their countrymen
for about eight days time ; and wishing them a good
voyage, I let them go, agreeing with them abouta sig-
na they should hang out at their return, by which I
should know them again, when they came back, at a
distance, before they came on shore.

They went away, with a fair gale, on the day that
the moon was at the full; by my account, in the
month of October: but as to the exact reckoning of
days, after I had once lost it, I could never recover it
again; nor had I even kept the number of years so
punctually as to be sure that I was right, though, as
it proved, when I afterward examined my account, I_
found I had kept a true reckoning of years.

It was no less than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange and unforseen accident intervened, of
which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in his-
tory. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning,
when my man Friday came running in to me, and
called aloud, ' Master, master, they are come, they
are come !'

I jumped up, and regardless of danger, I went out,
as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little
grove, which (by the way) was by this time grown to
be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of danger, I
went without my arms. which it was not my custom to
do; but I was surprised, when, turning my eyes to the
sea, I presently saw a boat, at about a league and a
half's distance, standing in for the. shore, with a
shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind
blowing pretty fair to bring them in. Also I observed
presently, that they did not come from that side which
the shore lay on, but from the southermost end of the
island. Upon this, I called Friday in, and bade him
lie close, for these were not the people we looked for,

and that we did not know yet whether they were
friends or enemies.

In the next place, I went in to fetch my pers ective
glass, to see what 1 could make of them; and aving
taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the
hill, as I used to do, when l was apprehensive of any-
thing. and to take my view the plainer, without being
discovered.

I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye
plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about
two leagues and a half's distance from me, S S.E., but
not above a league and a half from the ,shore. By my
observation, it appeared plainly to be an English ship,
and the boat appeared to be an English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the
joy of seeing a ship, and one, which, I had reason to
believe, was manned by my own countrymen, and
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep
upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to me
to consider what business an English ship could have
in that part of the world, since it was not the way to
or from any part of the world where the English had
any traffic ;' and I knew there had been no storms to p
drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they._'
were English really, it was most probable that they

'1' '.
were here upon no good design, and that I had better
continue as l was, than fall into the hands of thieves
and murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of
danger, which sometimes are given him, wnen he may
think there is no possibility of its being real. That
such hints and notices are given us, I believe few, that
have made any observations of things, can deny; that
they are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and
a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the ten-
dency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why
should we not suppose they are from some friendly
agent (whether supreme, or inferior and subordinate,
is not the question), and that they are given for our
good ?

The present question abundantly confirms me in the
justice of this reasoning; for bad I not been made
cautious by this secret admonition, come it from
whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in
a far worse condition than before, as you will see pre-
sently.

I had not'kept myself long in this posture, when I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a
creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of landing:
however, as they did not come quite far enough, they
did not see the little inlet where l formerly landed my
rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the beach, at
about half a mile from me, which was very happy for
me; for otherwise they would have landed just, as I
may say, at my door, and would soon have beaten me

out of my castle, and, perhaps, have plundered me of
all I bad.

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they
were Englishmen, at least, most of them : one or two
I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so. There
were in all eleven men, whereof three I found were
unarmed, and (as I thought) bound: and when the
first four or five of them were jumped on shore, they
took those three out of the boat as prisoners. One of
the three I could perceive using the most passionate
gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a
kind of extravagance ; the other two I could perceive
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared con-
cerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. ,

I was perfectly confounded at the sight,'and knew
not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called
out to me, in English, as well as he could, ' 0 master,
you see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage
mans.' 'Why,' said I, ' Friday, do you think they
are going to eat them then ?' ' Yes,' says Friday,
' they will eat them.' ' No, no,' said I, ' Friday; I
am afraid they will murder them indeed; but you
may be sure they will not eat them.'

All this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but stood trembling with the horror of the
sight, expecting every moment, when the three pri-
soners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the
villains lift up his arm, with a great cutlass (as the
seamen call it) or sword, to strike one of the poor
men ; and I expected to see him fall every moment,
at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill
in my veins. ' ,

I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the
savage that was gone with him; or that I had any way '_

to have come undiscovered within shot of them, that '

I might have rescued the three men; for I saw no
fire-arms they had among them : but it fell out to m
mind another way. ' ' ..
After I had observed the outrageous usage of the
three men, by the insolent seamen, I observed the
'r 2
fellows ran scattering about the land, as if they wanted
' to see the country. 1 observed also, that the three
other men had liberty to go where they pleased; but
they sat down all three upon the ground very pensive,
and looked like men in despair.

This put me in mind of the first time when I came
on shore, and began to look about me: how I gave
myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round me,
what dreadful apprehensions I had, and how I lodged
in the tree all night, for fear of being devoured by
wild beasts.

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was
to receive, by the providential driving of the ship
nearer the land, by the storms and tide, by which I
have since been so long nourished and supported; so
these three poor, desolate men, knew nothing how
certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near
it was to them, and how efi'ectually and really they
were in a condition of safety, at the same time as they
thought themselves lost, and their case desperate.

So little do we see before us in the world, and so
much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the
great Maker of the world, that he does not leave his
creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in the worst
circumstances they have always something to be
thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deliver-
ance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to
their deliverance by the means by which they seem
to be brought to their destruction. '

It was justat the top of high-water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
par eying with the prisoners they brought, and partly
while they rambled about to see what kind of place
they were in', they had carelessly stayed till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away,
leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found
afterward, having drunk a little too much brandy, fell
asleep. However, one of them waking sooner than
the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for
him to stir it, hallooed for the rest, who were strag-
gling about, upon which they all soon came to the
boat; but it was past all their strength to launch her,
the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side
being a soft, oozy sand, almost like a quicksand.

In this condition, like true seamen, who are, per-
haps, the least of all mankind given to forethought,
they gave it over, and away they strolled about the
country again; and I heard one say aloud to another
(calling them off from the boat), ' Why, let her alone,
Jack, can't ye ? She'll float next tide.' By which I
was fully confirmed in the main inquiry, of what
countrymen they were.

All this while, I kept myself close, not once daring
to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place
of observation, near the top of the bill; and very glad -.
l was to think how well it was fortified. I knew it
was no less than ten hours before the boat could be
afloat again, and by that time it would be dark, and I
might be more at liberty to see their motions, and to
hear their discourse, if they had anfy.

In the mean time, I fitted mysel up for a battle, as
before, though with more caution, knowing I had to
do with another kind of enemy than I had at first. I
ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent

'marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms. I
took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three
muskets. My figure indeed was very fierce: I had
my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I
mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in
my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.

1' 3
It was my design, as I said above, not to have made
any attempt till it was dark, ; but about two o'clock,
being the heat of the day, I found, that, in short,_they
were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I
thought, were all laid down to sleep. The three poor
distressed men, too. angg'gps for their condition to get
any sleep, were, liowever,'Set down under the shelter
of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me,
and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest.

Upon this, I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immediately
I marched, in the figure above ; my man Friday at a
good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms
as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like
figure as I did.

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to
them, in Spanish, ' What are ye, gentlemen ?'

They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure that I made. They made no answer at all, but
I thought I perceived them just going to fly from me,
when I Spoke to them in English ; ' Gentlemen,' said
I, ' do not be surprised at me: perhaps you may have
a friend near you, when you do not expect it." ' He
must be sent directly from heaven then,' said one of
them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at
the same time ; 'for our condition is past the help of
man. 'All help is from heaven, sir,' said I. 'But
can you put a stranger in the way how to help you ;
for you seem to me to be in some great distress ? 1
saw you when you landed; and when you seemed to
make application to the brutes that came with you, I
saw one of zhem lift up his sword to kill you.'

The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one'astonished, returned,
' Am I talking to God or man ? Is it a real. man, or
an angel?' ' Be in no fear about that, sir,' said I. ' If
God had sent an angel to relieve you,--he would have
come better clothed, and armed after another manner,
than you see me. Pray lay aside your fears; I am a
man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you, you
see. 1 have one servant only: we have arms and
ammunition. Tell us freely : can we serve you ?
What is your case ?'

' Our case, sir,' said he, 'is too long to 'tell you,
while our murderers are so near; but, in short, sir, I
was commander of that ship; my men having muti-
nied against me, they have been hardly prevailed on
not to murder me, and, at last, have set me on shore
in this desolate lace, with these two men with me,
one my mate, t e other a passenger, where we ex-
pected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited,
and know not yet what to think of it.'

' W here are those brutes, your enemies?' said I. '
' Do you know where they are gone ?' ' There they
are, sir,' said he, pointing to a thicket of trees. ' My
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard
youlspeak; if they have, they will certainly murder
us a l.'

' Have they any fire-arms ?' said 1. He answered
they had only two pieces, and one which they left in
the boat. ' Well, then,' said I, leave the rest to me.
I see they are all asleep. It is an easy thing to kill
them all: but shall we rather take them prisoners ?'
He told me there were two desperate villains among
them, that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to;
but if they were secured, he believed all the rest,
would return to their duty. I asked him which they'
were; He told me he could not at that distance ded
scribe them; but he would obey my orders in any-
thing I would direct. ' Well,' said I, 'let us retreat
out of their view or hearing, lest they awake ; and we
will resolve farther.' So they willingly went back
with me, till the woods covered us from them.

' Look you, sir,' said I, 'if I venture upon your de-
liverance, are you willing to make two conditions with
me ?' He anticipated my proposals, by telling me,
that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be.
wholly directed and commanded by me in everything;
and if the ship was not recovered, he would live and
die with me, in what part of the world soever I would
send him; and the two other men said the same.

' Well.' said I, ' my conditions are but two: first,
That while you stay on this island with me, you will not
pretend to any authority here ; and if I put arms into
your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up
to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine, upon this
island: and, in the mean time, be governed by my
orders.

Secondly, that if the ship is or may be recovered,
you will carry me and my man to England passage-free.'

He gave me all the assurances that the invention and
faith of a man could devise, that he would comply with
these most reasonable demands; and, besides, would
owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all oc-
casions as long as he lived.

'Well, then,' said I, 'here are three muskets for
you. with powder and ball. Tell me next what you
think is proper to be done.' He showed all the testi-
mony of his gratitude that he was able; but offered
to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it
was hard venturing anything, but the best method I
could think of, was to fire upon them at once, as they
lay ; and if any were not killed at the first volley, and.. -'._,.

offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it
wholly upon God's providence to direct the shot.

He said ver modestly, that he was loath to kill them,
if he could he p it; but that those two were incorrigi-
ble villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny
in the ship; and if thev escaped, we should be undone
still; for they would go on board and bring the whole
ship's company, and destroy us all. ' Well then,' said
I, ' necessity legitimates my advice; for it is the only
way to save our lives. However, seeing him still
cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go
themselves, and manage as they found convenient.

In the middle of this discourse, we heard some of
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them on
their feet. I asked him if either of them were the
men who, he had said, were the heads of the mutiny.
He said, ' No.' ' iVell then,' said I, ' you may let
them escape; and Providence seems to have wakened
them on purpose to save themselves Now,' said I.
'if the rest escape you, it is your fault.'

Animated with this, he took the musket I had given
him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two
comrades with him, with each man a piece in his hand.
The two men, who were with him, going first, made
some noise, at which one of the seamen, who was-
awake, turned about, and, seeingr them coming, cried
out to the rest; but it was two late then. for the mo-
ment he cried out, they fired, I mean the two men, the
captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so
well aimed their shot at the men they'knew, that one
of them was killed on the spot, and the other very
much wounded ; but not being dead, he started up upon
his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other: but

the captain, stepping to him, told him it was too late
to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive
his villany, and, with that word, knocked him down,
with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke
more. There were three more in the company, and
one of them was also slightly wounded. By this time
I was come; and when they saw their danger, and
that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy.
The captain told them, he would spare their lives, if
they would give him any assurance of their abhorrence
of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would
swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and
afterward in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came. They gave him all the protesta-
tions of their sincerity that could be desired, and he
was willing to believe them, and spare there lives,
which I was not against; only I obliged him to keep
thlem bound, hand and foot, while they were upon the
is and.

While this was doing, I sent Friday, with the cap-
tain's mate, to the boat, with orders to secure her, and
bring away the oars and sail, which they did; and,
by-and-by, three straggling men, that were (happily
for them) parted from the rest, came back, upon hear-
ing the guns fired; and seeing their captain, who was
before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they sub-
mitted to be bound also; and so our victory was com-

plete.
It now remained that the captain and I should in-

quire into one another's circumstances. I began first,
and told him my whole history, which he heard with
an attention even to amazement, and particularly at
the wonderful manner of my being furnished with
provisions and ammunition ; and indeed, as my story
is a whole collection of Wonders, it affected him deep-
ly; but when be reflected from thenCe upon himself,
and how I seemed to have been preserved there on
purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face,
and he could not speak a word more.

' After this communication was at an end, I carried
him, and his two men, into my apartment, leading
them in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the
house, where I refreshed them with such provisions
as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had
made, during my long, long inhabiting that place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my for-
tification, and how perfectly I had concealed my re-
treat with a grove of trees, which having been now
planted near twenty years, and the trees growing
much faster than in England, was become a little
wood, and so thick that it was impassable in any part
of it, but at that one side where I had reserved my
little winding passage into it. This I told him was
my castle, and my residence; but that I had a seat in
the country, as most princes have, whither I could
retreat upon occasion, and I'would show him that too -
another time; but at present our business was to con-
sider, how to recover the ship. He agreed with me .
as to that; but told me, he was perfectly at a loss
what measures to take, for that there were still six-
and-twenty hands on board, who, having entered into
a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited
their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by
desperation, and would carry it on, knowing that if
they were reduced, they should be brought to the ,
gallows as soon as they came to England, or to any of
the English colonies; and that therefore there would
be no attacking them with so small a number as we
were. '

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it was a very rational conclusion; and that
therefore something was to be resolved on very speedi-
ly, as well to draw the men on board into some snare
for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us,
and destroying us. Upon this it presently occurred
to me, that, in a little while, the ship's crew, wonder-
ing what was become of their comrades, and of the
boat, would certainly come on shore in their other
boat, to see for them; and that then, perhaps, they
might come armed, and be too strong for us: this. he
allowed, was rational.

Upon this I told him the first thing we had to do
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so
that they might not carry her off ; and taking eyery
thing out of her, leave he so far useless as not to be fit
to swim. Accordingly we went on board, took the
arms which were left on board out of her, and what.-
eVer else we found there, which was a bottle of brandy
another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, ahorn of powder,
and a great lump of sugar, in a piece of canvass; the,
sugar was five or six pounds: all which was very
welcome to me, especially the brandy and sugar, of
which I had had none left for man years.

When we had carried all these t ings on shore (the
oars, mast, sail, and rudders of the boat, were carried
away before), we knocked a great hole in her bottom,
that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet
they could not carry off the boat.

Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we
could be capable to recover the ship: but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did not
much question to make her fit again to carry us away
to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends, the
Spaniards, in my way; for I had them still in my

thoughts. .
While we were thus preparing our desrgns, and had
first, by main strength, heaved the boat upon the
beach, so, high that the tide would not float her off at
high-water mark; and besides had broken a hole in
her bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were

sat down musing what we should do, we heard the ship ,

fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her ancient,
as a signal for the boat to come on board: but no heat
stirred, and they fired several times, making other
signals for the boat. .

At last, when all the signals and firings proved fruit-
less, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them
(by the help of my glasses) hoist another boat out, and
row towards the shore: and we found, as they ap-

proached, that there were no less than ten men in her,
and that they had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore,
we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain
sight of the men, even of their faces; because the tide
having set them a little to the east of the other boat,
they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place
where the other had landed, and where the boat lay.

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the persons and characters of all
the men in the boat, of whom he said that there were
three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led

into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered
and frightened.

But that as for the boatswain, who. it seems, was

the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they _

were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew; and
were, no doubt, made desperate in their new enter-
prise; and terribly apprehensive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him that men in our cir-
cumstances were past the operations of fear: that

seeing almost every condition that could be, was better
than that which we were supposed to be in, we ought
to expect that the consequence, whether death or life,
would be sure to be a deliverance, I asked him what
he thought of the circumstances of my life: and
whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for.
' And where, sir,' said I, 'is your belief of my being
preserved here on purpose to save Your life, which
elevated you a little while ago ? For my part,' said I,
' there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the pros-
pect of it.' ' What's that?' said he. ' \Vhy,' said I,
' ' tis that, as you say, there are three or four honest
fellows among them, which should be spared; had
they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I should
have thought God's providence had singled them out,
to deliver them into your hands; for, depend upon it,
every man of them that comes ashore is our own, and
.shall die or live, as he behaves to us.'

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him ; so we
set vigorously to our business. We had, upon the first
appearance of the boat's coming from the ship, con-
sidered of separating our prisoners, and had indeed
secured them effectually.

Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured
than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three
delivered men to my cave, where they were remote
enough, and out of danger of being heard or discovered,
or of finding their way out of the woods, if they could
have delivered themselves. Here they left them
bound, but gave them provisions, and promised them,
if they continued there quietly, to give them their
liberty in a day, or two; but that if they attempted
their escape, they should be put to death without
mercy. They promised faithfully to bear their con-
finement with patience, and were very thankful that
they had such good usage, as to have provisions and
a light left them ; for Friday gave them candles (such
as we made ourselves) for their comfort: and they

did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at
the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them
were pinioned indeed, because the captain was not- free
to trust them ; but the other two were taken into my
service, upon their captain's recommendation, and
upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us;
so, with them and the three honest men, we were
seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt we
should be able to deal well enough with the ten that
were a coming, considering that the captain had said
there were three or four honest men among themalso.

As soon as they got to the place Where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came
all on shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I
was glad to see; for I was afraid they would rather
have left the boat at an anchor, some distance from
the shore, with some hands in her to guard her; and
so we should not be able to seize the boat.

Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran
all to the other boat; and it was easy to see they were
under a great surprise, to find her stripped, as above,
of all that was in her, and a hole in her bottom.

After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up
two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions
hear; but it was all to no urpose: then they came
all close in a ring, and fire a volley of their small
arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made
the woods ring: but it was all one ; those in the cave
we were sure could not hear, and those in our keeping,

u 2
though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no
answer to them.

They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that, as they told us afterward, they resolved to go all
on board again to their ship, and let. them know there,
that the men were all murdered, and the long-- boat
staved: accordingly, they immediately launched their
boat again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board the
ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades up for
lost. and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in
hopes we should have recovered: but he was quickly
as much frightened the other way.

They had not been long put of? with the boat, but
we perceived them all coming on shore again; but
with this new measure in their conduct, which, it
seems, they consulted together upon; viz. to leave
three men in the boat, and the rest to go on shore,
and go up into the country, to look for their fellows.

This was a great disappointment to us; for now we
were at a loss to know what to do; for our seizing
these seven men on shore would be no advantage to
us, if we let the boat escape, because they would then ,
- row away to the ship; and then the rest of them would
he sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our hope of re-
covering the ship would be lost.

However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present. The seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained in
the boat, put her oil to a good distance from the shore"
and came to an anchor to wait for them, so that it was
impossible for us to come at them in the boat.

Those that came on shore kept close- together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under which
my habitation lay; and we could see them plainly,
though they could not perceive us. We could have
been very glad they would have come nearer to us,
so that we might have fired at them; or that they
would have gone farther off, that we might have come
abroad.

But when they were come to the brow of the hill,
where they could see a great way into the valleys and
woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed
till they were weary ; and not caring, it seems, to
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another,
they sat down together under a tree, to consider of it.
Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as
the other party of them had done, they had done the
job for us: but they were too full of apprehensions of
danger, to venture to go to sleep, though they could
not tell what the danger was they had to fear neither.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon
this consultation of theirs, viz. that perhaps they would
all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make their
fellows hear, and that we. should all sally upon them,
just at the juncture when their pieces were all dis-
charged, and they would certainly yield, and we should
have. them without bloodshed. I liked the proposal,
provided it were done while we were near enough to
come up to them, before they could load their pieces
aoam.

aBut this event did not happen, and we lay still along
time, very irresolute what course to take: at length
I told him there would be nothing to be done in my
.opinion till night; and then, if they did not return to
the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between
them and the shore, and so might use some stratagem
with them in the boat, to get them on shore.

U 3222 nonmson CR1] soE.

We waited a great while, though very impatient for
their removing, and were very uneasy; when, after
long consultations, we saw them all start up, and
march down towards the sea. It seems, they had
such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the danger
of the place, that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go
on with their intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined it to be as 'it reall'y was, that they had
given over their search, and were for going back
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it:
but i presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them
hack again ; and which answered my end to a tittle.

I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go over
the little creek westward, towards the place where the
savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and
as soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about
half a mile's distance, I bade them halloo as loud as
they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard
them ; that as soon as they heard the seamen answer
them, they should return it again, and then keeping
out of sight, take a round, always answering when the
other hallooed, to draw them as far into the island
and among the woods as possible; and then wheel
about again to me, by such ways as I directed.

They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard them,
and answering, run along the shore westward, towards
the voice they heard, when they were presently stopped
by the creek, where the water being up, they could
' not get over, and called for the boat to come up, and
set them over, as indeed I expected.

When they had set themselves over, I observed thatnoerxsoN cnosos. 223

the boat being gone up a good way into the creek,
and, as it were, in a harbour within the land, the
took one of the three men out of her to go along wit
them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened
her to the stump of a little tree on the shore.

This was what I wished for; and immediately leav-
ing Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I
took the rest with me, and crossing the creek out of
their sight, we surprised the two men before they
were aware, one of them lying on shore, and the other
being in the boat: the fellow on shore was between
sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the captain,
who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked
him down, and then called out to him in the boat to
yield, or he was a dead man.

There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him,
and his comrade knocked down: besides, this was it
seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the
mutuny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterward to
join very sincerely with us.

I n the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate so
well managed their business with the rest, that the
drew them, by hallooing and answering, from one hi I
to another, and from one wood to another, till they
not only heartily tired them, but left them where they
were very sure they could not reach back before it was
dark: and indeed they were heartily tired themselves
also by the time they came back to us.

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure
work with them.

It was several hours after Friday came back to me,
before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came up,
calling to those behind to come along, and could also
hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired
they were, and not able to come any faster, which was
very welcome news to us.

At length they came up to the boat; but it is im-
possible to express their confusion when they found
the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out,
and their two men gone: we could hear them call to
one another, in the most lamentable manner, telling
one another they were gotten into an enchanted
island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and
they should all be murdered, or else there were devils
or spirits in it, and they should be all carried away and
devoured.

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades
by their names a great many times, but no answer.
After some time, we could see them, by the little
light there was, running about wringing their hands,
like men in despair; and that sometimes they would
go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then
come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the
same thing over again.

My men would fain have had me given them leave
to fall upon them at once in the dark ; but I was will-
ing to take them at some advantage, so to spare them,
and kill as few of them as I could: and especially as
I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our men,
knowing the others were very well armed. I resolved
to wait to see if they did not separate ; and therefore,
to make sure of them, 1 drew my ambuscade nearer,
and ordered Friday and the captain to creep u on
their hands and feet, as close to the ground as t ey
could, that they might not be discovered, and get as
neair them as they possibly could, before they ofl'ered
to re.
They had not been long in that posture, when the .
hoatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the Inn-
tiny, and had now shown himself the most dejected,
and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards
them, with two more of their crew. The captain was
so eager, at having the principal rogue so much in his
power, that he could hardly have patience to let him
come. so near as to be sure of him; for he only heard
his tongue before: but when they came nearer, the
captain and Friday starting up on their feet, let fly at
them.

The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next
man was shot into the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after; and
the. third ran for it.

At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men, viz.
in self, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-gene-
ra ; the captain, and his two men, and the three pri-
soners of war, whom we had trusted with arms.

We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the man
they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to
call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a
parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to terms,
which fell out just as we desired: for indeed it was
easy to think, as their condition then was, they would
be very willing to capitulate. So he called out, as
loud as he could, to one of them, ' Tom Smith ! Tom
Smith !' Tom Smith answered immediately, ' Who's
that? Robinson ?' for it seems he knew his voice.
The other answered, 'Aye, aye; for God's sake,
Tom Smith, throw down your arms, and yield: or
you are all dead men this moment !'

' ' Whom must we yield to ? Where are they ?' says
Smith again. ' Here they are,' says he. ' Here is
our captain, and fifty men with him, have been hunt-
ing you this two hours. The boatswain is killed, Will
Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you do
not yieid, you are all lost.'

' Will they give us quarter then ?' says Tom Smith,
' and we will yield.' ' I'll go and ask, if you promise
to yield,' says Robinson. So he asked the captain,
and the captain himself then calls out, ' You, Smith,
you know my voice; if you lay down your arms im-
mediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all
but Will Atkins.'

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, ' For God's sake,
captain, give me quarter ! What have I done ?
They have been all as bad as I l' which, by the way,
was not true, neither,- for it seems this Will Atkins
was the first man that laid hold of the captain, when
they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in ty-
ing his hands, and giving him injurious language.
However, the captain told him he must lay down his
arms at discretion, and trust to the Governor's mercy:
for they all called me Governor.

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and beg-
ged their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed
with them, and two more, who bound them all; and
then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly
with those three, were all but eight, came up and
seized upon them all, and upon their boat, only that I
kept myself, and one more out of sight, for reasons of
state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he
had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated with
them upon the villany of their practices with him, and
at length, upon the farther wickedness of their design;
and how certainly it must bring them to misery and
distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives. As for that, he told them they were
none of his prisoners, but the commander's of the
island; that they thought that they had set him on
shore in a barren, uninhabited island, but it had
pleased God so to direct them, that the island was in-
habited, and that the governor was an Englishman;
that he might hang them all there, if be pleased; but
as he had given them all quarter, he supposed he
would send them to England, to be dealt with there
as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was com-
manded by the govenor to advise to prepare for death;
for that he would be hanged in the morning. .

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had
its desired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees to beg
the captain to intercede With the governor for his life ;
and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake, that
they might not be sent to England.

It now occurred to me that the time of our delive-
rance was come, and that it would be amost easy thing
to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting pos-
session of the ship. So I retired in the dark from
them, that the might not see what kind of a governor
they had, an called the captain to me. When 1
called, as at a good distance, one of the men was or-
dered to speak again, and say to the captain, 'Ca -
tain, the commander calls for on ;' and presently t e
captain replied, ' Tell his exce ency I am just a-com-
ing.' This most perfectly surprised them; and they
all believed that the commander was just by, with his
fifty men.

Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonders
fully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next
morning.

But in order to execute it with more art, and to be
secure of success, I told him we must divide the pri-
soners, and that he should go and take Atkins and two
more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to
the cave where the others lay. This was committed
to Friday, and the two men who came on shore with
the captain.

They conveyed them to the cave. as to a prison;
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men in
their condition.

The other I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of
which I have given a full description ; and as it was
fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was secure
enough, considering they were upon their behaviour.

To these, in the morning, I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to
try them, and tell me whether he thought he might
be trusted or no, to go on board, and surprise the
ship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of
the condition they were brought to; and that though
the governor had given them quarter for their lives,
_ as to the present action, yet if they were sent to Eng-
land, they would all be hanged in chains to be sure;
but that if they would join so just an attempt, as to
recover the ship, he would have the governor's en-
gagement for their pardon.

Anyone may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised
with, the deepest imprecations, that they would be.
faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all over
the world; that they would own him for a father to
them as-long as they lived.
' Well,' says the captain, ' I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and sce'what I can do to bring
him to consent to it.' So he brought me an account of
the tern er he found them in ; and that he verily be;
lieved t ey would be faithful.

However, that we might be very secure, I told him,
he should go back again, and choose out five of them,
and tell them that they should see that they did not
want men; but we would take out those five to be his '
assistants, and that the governor would keep the other
two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the eas-
tle (my cave), as hostages, for the fidelity of those
five; and that if they proved unfaithful in the execu-
tion, the five hostages should be hanged in chains alive
upon the shore.

This looked severe, and convinced them, that the
governor was in earnest. However, they had no way
left them but to accept it; and it was now the business
of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to persuade
the other five to do their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedi-
tion; First, the captain, his mate, and passenger. Se-
cond, Then the two prisoners of the first gang, to
whom, having their characters from the captain, I had _
given their libert , and trusted them with arms. Third,
The other two, w om I had kept till now in my bower
pinioned ; but, upon the captain's motion, had now
released. Fourth, these five released at last: so that
there were twelve in all, beside five we kept prisoners
in the cave for hostages. -

I asked the captain, if he was willing to venture
with these hands on board the ship ; for, as for me and
my man Friday, I did not think it was pro r for us to
stir, having seven men left behind ; an it was cm-

x
plqyment enough for us to keep them asunder, and
supply them with victuals.

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them
fast; but Friday went twice a hay to them, to supply
them with necessaries; and I made the other two
carry provisions to a certain distance, where Friday
was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was
with the captain, who told them I was the person the
governor had ordered to look after them, and that it
was the governor's pleasure they should not stir any
where, but by my direction; that if they did, they
should be fetched in the_castle and be laid in irons; so
that as we never suffered them to see me as governor,
I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the
governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon
all occasions.

The captain had now no difficulty before him, but
to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and
man them. He made his passenger captain of one,
with four other men; and himself, his mate, and five
more, went in the other. And they contrived their
business very well; for they came up to the ship about
midnight. As soon as they came within call of the
ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them he
had brought off the men and the boat, but that it was
a long time before they had found them, and the like;
holding them in a chat till they came to the ship's
side: when the captain and the mate, entering first
with their arms, immediately knocked down the se-
cond mate and carpenter with the butt-end of their
muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men.
They secured all the rest that were upon the main and
quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches to keep
them down who were below, when the other boat, and
their men entering at the fore-chains, secured the fore-
castle of the ship, and the shuttle which went down
into the cook-room, making three men they found
there prisoners.

When this was done, and all safe upon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate, with three men, to break
into the round-house, where the new rebel captafii
lay, and, having taken the alarm, was gotten up, and
with two men and a boy, were gotten fire-arms in their
hands; and when the mate, with a crow, split open
the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket-
ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of
the men, but killed nobody.

The mate calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his
pistol, shot the new captain in the head, the bullet en-
tering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of
his ears; so that he never spoke a word : upon which
the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually,
without any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal
agreed upon by me, to give me notice of his success,
which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, hav-
ing sat watching upon the shore for it, till near two of
the clock in the morning.

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it'1 having been a day of great fatigue to
me, I slept very sound, till I was something surprised
with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I
heard a man call me by the name of ' Governor, go-
vernor ;' and presently I knew the captain's voice,
when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood,

x '2.
and pointing to the ship, be embraced me in his arms.
' My dear friend and deliverer,' says he, ' there's your
ship; for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that
belong to her.' I cast my eyes to the ship, and there
she rode within little more than half aemile of the
shore ; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they
were masters of her, and the weather being fair, had
brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of a
little creek; and the tide being up, the captain had
brought the pinnace in near the place where I first
landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.

1 was, at first, ready to sink down with the surprise;
for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put into my
hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready to
carry me away, whither I pleased to go. At first, for
some time, I was not able to answer one word; but as
he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I
should have fallen to the ground.

He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a
bottle out of his pocket and gave me a dram of cor-
dial, which he had brought on purpose for me. After
I drank it, I sat down upon the ground, and though it
brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I
could speak a word to him.

All this while, the poor man was in as great an
ecstacy as I, only not under an surprise, as l was;
and he said a thousand kind, ten er things to me, to
compose and bring me to myself; but such was the
flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into
confusion: at last, it broke out into tears, and a little
while after I recovered my s ecch.

Then I took my turn, an embraced him as my dc-
liverer; and we rejoiced tog *ther. I told him, I looked
upon him as a man sent from heaven to deliver me, and
that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of
wonders ; that such things as these were the testimo-
nies we had of a secret hand of Providence governing
the world, and an evidence that the eyes of an infinite
Power could search into the remotest corner of the
world, and send help to the miserable whenever he
pleased. "

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to
Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless Him,
who had not only, in a miraculous manner, provided
for one in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate
condition, but from whom every deliverance must
always be acknowledged to roceed ?

When we had talked a w ile, the captain told me he
had brought me some little refreshment, such as the
ship afforded, and such as the wretches, who had been
so long his masters, had not plundered him of. Upon
this he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men
bring the things ashore, that were for the governor;
and indeed it was a present, as if I had been one, not
that was to be carried away along with them, but as if
I had been to dwell upon the island still, and they
were to go without me.

First, he had brought me a case of bottles full of
excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira
wine, the bottles held two quarts a piece, two pounds
of excellent tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's
beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of pease,
and about a hundred weight of biscuit. .

He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour,
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice, and
abundance of other things. But, besides these, and,
what was a thousand times more useful to me, he
brought me six clean, new shirts, six very good neck-
cloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and
one pair of stockings, and a very good suit of clothes

3: 3
of his own, which had been worn but very little: in a

word, he clothed me from head to foot.

It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any
one may imagine, to one in m circumstances ; but
never was anything in the worl of that kind so un-
pleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to wear
such clothes at their first putting on.

_ After these ceremonies past, and after all his good
things were brought into In little apartment, we be-
gan to consult what was to he done with the prisoners

we had ; for it was worth considering, whether we

might venture to take them away with us or no, espe-
cially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible
and refractory, to the last degree; and the captain said
he knew that they were such rogues, that there was no
obliging them; and if he did carry them away, it must
be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to jus-
tice, at the first English colony he could come at; and

I found the captain himself was very anxious about it.

Upon this, I told him, that if he desired it, I durst
undertake to bring the two men he spoke of, to make
it their own request that he should leave them upon
the island. ' I should be very glad of that,' says the
captain, ' with all my heart.'

' Well,' said I, ' I will send for them, and talk with
them for you.' So I caused Friday and the two hos-
tages, for they were now discharged, their comrades
having performed their promise; i say, I caused them
to go to the cave, and bring up the five men pinioned
as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I
came.

After some time, I came thither, dressed in my new
habit, and now I was called governor again. Being
all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to
be brought before me, and I told them i had had a
full account of their villanous behaviour to the cap-
tain, and how they had run away with the ship, and
were preparing to commit further robberies; but that
Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and

that they had fallen into the pit which they had digged
for others.

I let them know that, by my direction, the ship had
been seized; that she lay now in the road; and they
might see by-and-by that their new captain had re-
ceived the reward of his villany ; for that they might
see him hanging at the yard-arm.

That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to
say, why I should not execute them as pirates, taken
in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt
I had authority to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that
they had nothing to say but this, that when m were
taken, the captain had promised them their , and
they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I
knew not what mercy to show them : for, as for my-
self, I had resolved to quit the island with all my men,
and had taken passage with the captain to go for Eng-
land: and as for the captain he could not carry them
to England, other than as prisoners in irons, to be
tried for mutiny and running away with the ship; the
consequence of which, they must needs know, would
be the gallows: so that I could not tell which was best
for them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in
the island; if they desired that I did not care, as 1 had
libert to leave it. I had some inclination to give them
their ives, if they could shift on shore. They seemed
very thankful for it; said they would much rather
venture to stay there, than to be carried to England to
be hanged : so I left it on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difli-
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there. Upon
this I seemed a little angry with the captain, and told
him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that
if he did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them
at liberty as I found them ; and if he did not like that,
he might take them again, if he could catch them.

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I ac--
cordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire
into the woods, to the. place whence they came, and I
would leave them some fire-arms, some ammunition,
and some directions how they should live very well, if
they thought fit.

Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship; but
told the captain that I would stay that nightto prepare
my things, and desired him to go on board in the mean
time, and keep all right in the ship, and send the boat
on shor the next day for me; ordering him in the
mean ti to cause the new captain who was killed, to
be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see
him. .

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up

to me in my apartment, and entered seriously into dis-
' course with them of their circumstances. I told them,
I thought they had made a right choice; that if the
captain carried them away, they would certainly be
hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging at
the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had no-
thing less to expect.

\Vhen they had all declared their willingness to
stay, I then told them, 1 would let them into the story
of my living there, and put them into the way of mak-
ing it easy to them. Accordingly I gave them the
whole history of the place, and of my coming to it:
showed them my fortifications, the way I made my
bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and, in a
word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I
told them the story also of the sixteen Spaniards that
were to be expected; for whom I left a letter, and
made them promise to treat them in common with
themselves.

I left them my fire-arms; viz., five muskets, three
fowling-pieces, and three swords. I had about a bar-
rel and a half of powder left; for after the first year or
two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a
description of the way I managed the goats, and direc-
tions to milk and fatten them, to make both butter
and cheese.

In a word, I gave them every part of my own story;
and I told them I would prevail with the captain to
leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some
garden-seeds, which I told them I would have been
very glad of : also I gave them the bag of pease which
the captain had brought me to eat, and bade them be
sure to sow and increase them.

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and
went on board the ship. We prepared immediately to
sail, but did not weigh that night. The next morn-
ing early, two of the five men came swimming to the
ship's side, and making a most lamentable complaint
of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship,
for God's sake, for they should be. murdered; and
begged the captain to take them on board, though he
hanged them immediately.

' Upon this, the captain pretended to have no power
without me; but after some difficulty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on
board, and were some time after soundly whipped and
pickled ; after which they proved very honest and quiet
fellows.

Some time after this, I went with the boat on shore,
the tide being up, with the things promised to the
men, to which the captain at my intercession, caused
their chests and clothes to be added, which they took,
and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them,
by telling them, that. if it lay in my power to send any
vessel to take them in, I would not forget them.

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board,
for relics, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my
umbrella, and one of my parrots ; also I forgot not to
take the money 1 formerly mentioned, which had lien
by me so long useless, that it was grown rusty, or tar-
nished, and could hardly pass for silver, till it had
been a little rubbed and handled; and also the money
I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.

And thus I left the island, the 19th of December,
as I found, by the ship's account, in the year 1686,
after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two
months, and nineteen days; being delivered from the
second captivity the same day of the month that I first
made my escape in the barco-longo, from among the

Moors of Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in

England the llth of June, in the year 1687, having
been thirty and five years absent.

When I came to England, I was as perfect a stran-
ger to all the world, as if I had never been known
there. My benefactor and faithful steward, whom I
left in trust with my money, was alive, but had 'had
great misfortunes in the world, was become a widow
the second time, and very low in the world. I made
her easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude
to her former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved
her as my little stock would afford, which at that time
would indeed allow me to do but little for her; but I
assured her I would never forget her former kindness
to me: nor did I forget her, when I had sufficient to
help her, as shall be observed in its place.

I went down afterward into Yorkshire; but my fa-
ther was dead, and my mother, and all the family ex-
tinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the
children of one of my brothers; and as I had been
long ago given over for dead, there had been no pro-
vision made for me, so that, in a word, I found no-
thing to relieve or assist me; and that the little mo-
ney I had, would not do much for me, as to settling in
the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I
did not expect; and this was, that the master of the
ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and, by the
same means, saved the ship and cargo, having given a
very handsome account to the owners of the manner
how I had saved the lives of the men and the ship,
they invited me to meet them, and some other mer-
chants concerned, and all together made me a very
handsome compliment upon the subject, and a present
of almost two hundred pounds sterling.

But, after making several reflections upon the cir-
cumstances of my life, and how little way this would
go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to go
to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some infor-
mation of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and
of what was become of my partner, who, I had reason
(tic (siuppose, had some years now given me over for

ea .

With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where I
arrived in April following: my man Friday accom-
panying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and
proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions.

When I came to Lisbon, 1 found out by inquiry,
and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend, the
captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea, off the
shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left
off the sea, having put his son, who was far from a
young man, into his ship, and who still used the
Brazil trade. The old man did not know me, and in-
deed I hardly knew him ; but I soon brought myself
to his remembrance, when I told him who I was.
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
lantation and m partner. The old man told me he
ad not been in t e Brazils for about nine years ; but
that he could assure me, that when he came away my
partner was living, but the. trustees whom I had joined
with him to take cognizance of my part, were both
dead; that, however, he believed that I would have
a very good account of the improvement of the plan-
tation, for that, in the general belief of my being cast
away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account
of the produce of my part of the plantation to the pro-
curator fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never
came to claim it, one-third to the king, and two-thirds
to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for
the benefit of the cor, and for the conversion of the
Indians to the Cat olic faith; but that if I appeared,
or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would
be restored; only that the improvement, or annual
production, being distributed to charitable uses. could
not be restored: but he assured me, that the steward
of the king's revenue (from lands), and the provedore,
or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all
along, and the incumbent, that is to say, my partner,
gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of
which they received duly my moiety.
I asked him if he knew to what height of improve-
mcnt he had brought the plantation ; and whether he
thought it might be worth looking after; or whether,-
on my going thither, 1 should meet with no obstruc-
tion to my possessing my just right in the moiety.

_ ' He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree
the plantation was improved; but this he knew, that
my partner was grown exceeding rich u on the enjoy-
ing but one half of it: and that, to the best of his re-
membrance, he had heard that the king's third of my
part, which was, it seems, granted away to some other
monastery, or religious house, amounted to abbve two
hundred moidores a year; that, as to my being re-
stored to a quiet possession of it, there was no question
to be made of that, my partner being alive to witness
my title, and my name being also enrolled in the re-
gister of the country. Also he told me, that the sur-
vivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest peo-
ple, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not
only have their assistance for putting me in possession,
but would find a very considerable sum of money in
their hands, for my account, being the produce of the
farm, while their fathers held the trust, and before it
was given up, as above, which, as he remembered, was
for about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at .
this account, and inquired of the old captain how it
came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose of
my effects, when he knew that I had made my will,
and had made him, the Portuguese captain, my uni-
versal heir, &c.

He told me that was true, but as there was no proof
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until
some certain account should come of my death; and
that, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a
thing so remote; that it was true, he. had registered

2

v}
my will, and put in his claim; and could he have given
any account of my being dead or alive, he would have
acted by procuration, and taken possession of the in.
genio (so they called the sugar-house), and had given
his son, who was now at the Brazils, order to do it.

' But,' says the old man, ' I have one piece of news
to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to

on as the rest; and that is, that, believxng you were
ost, and all the world believing so also, your partner
and trustees did offer to account to me, in your name,
for six or eight of the first years of profits, which I
received; but there being at that time,' says he,
' great disbursements for increasing the works, build-
ing an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount
to near so much as afterward it produced. However,'
says the old man, ' I shall give you a true account of
what I have received in all, and how I have disposed
of it.'

After a few days farther conference with this an-
cient friend, he brought me an account of the first six
years' income of my plantation, signed by my partner,
and the merchants' trustees, being always delivered in
goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, be-
sides rum, molasses, &c. which is the consequence of
a sugar-work; and I found, by this account, that
every year the income considerably increased. But,
as above, the disbursement being large, the sum at
first was small. However, the old man let me see
that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy
moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and
fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his
ship, he having been shipwrecked coming home to
Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the place.

The good man then began to complain of his mis-
fortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of

1
my money to recover his~ losses, and buy him a share
in a new ship. ' However, my old friend,' says he,
' you shall not want a supply in your necessity; ard
as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully satisfied.'

Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me
one hundred-and-sixty Portugal moidores in gold;
and giving me the writings of his title to the ship
which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he
was a quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts
them both into my hands for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kind-
ness of the poor man, to be able to bear this; and re-
membering what he had done for me, how he had
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used
me on all occasions, and particularly how sincere a
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weep-
ing at what he said to me. Therefore, first I asked
him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so
much money at that time, and if it would not straiten
him. He told me he could not say but it might
straiten him a little : but, however, it. was my money,
and I might want it more than he.

Everything the good man said was flill of affection,
and I could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke.
In short, I took one hundred of the moidores, and
called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them;
then I returned him the rest, and told him, if ever I
had possession of the plantation, I would return the
other to him also, as indeed I afterward did; and that,
as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship, I
would not take it by any means ; but that, if I wanted
the money, I found he was honest enough to pay me;
and if I did not, but came to receive what he gave me
reason to expect, I would never have a penny more
from him.

Y 2
When this was passed, the old man began to ask me
if he should put me in a method to make my claim to
my plantation. I told him, I thought to go over to it
myself. He said, I might do so, if [ pleased; but
that if I did not, there were ways enough to secure
my right, and immediately to appropriate the. profits
to my use: and as there were ships in the river of
Lisbon, just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me
enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit,
affirming, upon oath, that l was alive, and that l was
the same person, who took up the land for the plant-
ing the said plantation at first.

This being regularly attested by a notary, and a
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with a
letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance
at the place; and then proposed my staying with him
till an account came of the return.

Never anything was more honourable than the pro-
ceedings upon this procuration ; for in less than seven
months I received alarge packet from the survivors of
my trustees, the merchants for whose account I went
to sea, in which were the following particular letters
and papers enclosed:

First, There was the account current of the produce
of my farm, or plantation, from the year when their
fathers had balanced with my old Portugal captain,
being for six years; the balance appeared to be one
thousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in
my favour.

Second] , There was the account of four years
more, whi e they kept the effects in their hands, before
the government claimed the administration, as being
the effects of a person not to be found, which they call
civil death; and the balance of this, the value of the
plantation increasing, was to an amount in crusadoes,
which make three thousand two hundred and forty-
onc moidores.

Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustine's
account, who had received the profits for above four-
teen years ; but not being able to account for what was
disposed to the hospital, very honestly declared he had
eight hundred and seventy-two moidores not distri-
buted, which he acknowledged to my account. As to
the king's part, that refunded nothing.

There was also a letter of my partner's congratulat-
ing me very affectionate" upon my being alive, giving
me an account how the estate was improved, and what
it produced a year. with a particular of the number of
squares or acres that it contained: how planted; how
many slaves there were upon it; and, making two~
and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said
so many ' Ave Marias,' to thank the Blessed Virgin
that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to
come over and take possession of my own; and, in
the mean time, to give him orders to whom he should
deliver my effects, if I should not come myself ; con-
cluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and
that of his family; and sent me, as a present, seven
fine leopards' skins, which he had, it seems, received
from Africa, by some other ship, which he had sent
thither, and who, it seems, had made a better voyage
than 1. He sent me also five chests of excellent sweet-
meats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not
quite so large as moidores.

By the same fleet. my two merchant trustees ship-
ped me twelve hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred
rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole account in

old.
g I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of
Job was bettergthan the beginning. It is impossible
' r 3
to express the flutterings of my ver heart, when I
looked over these letters, and especial y when I found
all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships come
all in fleets,' the same ships which brought my letters
brought my goods; and the effects were safe in the
Tagus before the letters came to my hand. In a word,
I turned pale, and grew sick; and had not the old
man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sud-
den surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had died
upon the spot.

Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so
some hours, till a physician being sent for, and some-
thing of the real cause of my illness bein known, he
ordered me to be let blood: after which had relief,
and grew well; but I verily believe, if it had not been
eased by the vent given in that manner to the spirits,
I should have died.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five
thousand pounds sterling in money, and had an estate,
as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of above a thou-
sand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in
England; and, in a word, I was in a condition which
I scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose
myself for the enjoyment of.

The first thing I did, was to recompense m original
benefactor, my good old captain, who had can first
charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in the be-
ginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed him
all that was. sent to me. I told him that, next to the
providence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it
was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to re-
ward him, which I would do a hundredfold. So I
first returned to him the hundred moidores I had re-
ceived of him; then I sent "for a notar , and caused
him to draw up a general release, or disc arge, for the
four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had ac-
knowledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmest
manner possible : after which, I caused a procuration
to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the
annual profits of my. plantation, and appointing mg,
partner to account to him, and make the returns by
the usual fleets to him, in my name. And a clause in
the end, being a grant of one hundred moidores a year
to him, during his life, out of the effects; and fifty
moidores a year to his son after him, for his life ; and
thus I requited my old man. _

I was now to consider which way to steer my course
next, and what to do with the estate that Providence
had thus put into myhands; and, indeed, I had more
care upon my head now, than I had in my silent state
of life in the island, where I wanted nothing but what
I had, and had nothing but what I wanted; whereas
I had now a great charge upon me, and my business
was how to secure it. I had never a cave now to hide
my money in, or a place where it might lie without
lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished before
anybody would meddle with it; on the contrary, I
knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it;
my old patron the captain indeed was honest, and that
was the only refuge I had. .

In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed
to summon me thither: but now 1 could not tell how . '
to think of going thither till I had settled my afi'airs,
and left my effects in some safe hands behind me. At
first, I thought of my old friend the widow, who I
knew was honest, and would be just to me; but then
she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew,
might be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way
but to go back to England myself, and take my effects

with me.
I was some months, however, before ,I resolved
upon this ;. and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been my
former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor
widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor,
and she, while it was in her power, my faithful
steward and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got
a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in
London, not only to pay a hill, but to go find her out,
and carry her in money a hundred pounds from me,
and to talk with her and comfort her in her poverty,
by telling her, she should, if I lived, have. a farther
supply. At the same time, I sent my two sisters in
the country, each of them, a hundred pounds, they
being, though not in want, yet not in very good cir--
cumstances ; one having been married, and left a
widow, and the other having a husband, not so kind
to her as he should be.

But among all my relations or acquaintances I could
not yet pitch upon one, to whom I durst commit the
gross of my stock, that I might go away to the Brazils,
and leave. things safe behind me ; and this greatly per-
plexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and
have settled myself there; for I was, as it were,
naturalized to the place; but I had some little scruple
in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me
back, of which I shall say more presently. However,
it was not religion that kept me from going thither for
the present; and as 1 had made no scruple of being
openly of the religion of the country all the while I
was among them, so neither did I yet; only that now
and then having of late thought more of it than for-
merly, when l began to think of living and dying among
them, I began to regret my having professed myself a
papist, and thought it might not be the best religion to
die with.

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to the Brazils, but that really
i did not know with whom to leave my effects behind
me; so I resolved at last to go to England with them,
where if I arrived, I concluded I should make some
acquaintance, or find some relations that would be
faithful to me: and accordingly I prepared to go to
England with all my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I
first (the Brazil fleet being just going away) resolved to
give answers suitable to the just and faithful account of
things I had from thence. And first to the prior of
St. Augustinel wrote a letter full of thanks for his just
dealings, and the offer of the eight hundred and
seventy-two moidores, which were undisposed of,
which I desired might be given, five hundred to the
monastery, and three hundred and seventy~two to the
poor, as the prior should direct; desiring the good
padre's prayers for me, and the like.

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees,
with all the acknowledgment that so much justice and
honesty called for : as for sending them any present,
they were far above having any occasion for It.

Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his
industry in the improving the plantation, and his in-
tegrity in increasing the stock of the works, giving him
instructions for his future government of my part, ac-
cording to the powers I had left with my old patron,
to whom [desired him to send whateyer became due to
me, till he should hear from me more particularly; as-
suring him that it was my intention not only to come
to him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of
my life: to this I added a very handsome present of
some Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for
such the captain's son informed me he had; with two
pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I could get
in Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders
lace of a good value.

I-laving thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my
next difficulty was, which way to go to England. I
had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had
a strange aversion to go to England by sea at that time;
and though I could give no reason for it, yet the dif--
ficulty increased upon me so much, that though I had
once shipped my baggage in order to go, yetl altered
my mind, and that not once, but two or three times.

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons: but let no man strike
the strong impulse of his own thoughts in case of such
moment. Two of the ships which I had singled out
to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than
any other, that is to say, so as in one of them to put
my things on board, and in the other to have agreed
with the captain ; 1 say two of these ships miscarried,
viz. one was taken by the Algerincs, and the other was
cast away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the. people
drowned except three : so that in either of those ves-
sels I had been made miserable, and in which most, it
was hard to say.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old
pilot to whom I communicated every thing, pressed me
earnestly not to go by sea: but either to go by land
to the. Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to
Rochelle, from whence it was an easy and safe journey
by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go
up to Madrid, and so all the way by land through
France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going
by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I re-
solved to travel all the way by land, which, as I was
not in haste, and did not value the. charge, was by
much the pleasanter way ; and to make it more so, my
old captain brought an English gentleman, the son of
a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with
me: after which, we. picked up two more, who were
English, and merchants also, and two young Perm.-
guese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only ; so that
we were in all six of us. and five servants: the two
merchants, and the two Portuguese, contenting them-
selves with one servant between two, to save the
charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor to
travel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday,
who was too much a stranger to be tapable of supply-
ing the place of a servant. on the. road.

In this manner I set out from Lisbon: and our
company being all very well mounted and armed, we
made a little tr00p, whereof they did me the honour to
call me Captain, . 3 well because I was the oldest man,
as because Ihad two servants, and, indeed, was the
original of the whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none. of my sea journals,
so shall I trouble you with ntme of my land journals:
but some adventures that happened to us in this
tedious and difficult journey, I must not omit.

W'hen we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time to
see the court of Spain, and to see what was worth ob-
serving; but it being the latter part of the summer,
we hastened away, and set out from Madrid about the
middle of October. But when we came to the edge
of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns on the

way, with an account that so much snow was fell on
the French side of the mountains. that. several travel-
lers were obliged to come back to l'ampelnna, after
having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on.

\'Vhen we came to l'ampeluna itself. we found it so
indeed; and to me, that. had been always used to a hot
climate, and indeed to countries where we could scarce
bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable. Nor
indeed was it more painful than it was surprising, to
come but ten days before. out of the Old Castile, where
the weather was not oul warm, but very hot; and
immediately to feel a wim from the l'yrenean moun-
tains, so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intole -a~
ble, and to endanger benumbjng and perishing of our
fingers and toes.

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather,
which he had never seen or felt before in his life.

To mend the matter, after we came to l'ampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence, and so
long, that the people said winter was come before its
time, and the roads, which were ditiicult before, were
now quite impassable; in a word, the snow lay in
some places too thick for us to travel; and being not
hard frozen, as is the casein the northern countries,
there was no going without being in danger of being'
buried alive every step. We stayed no less than
twenty days at Pampeluna, when (seeing the winter
coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it
was the severest winter all over Europe that had been
known in many years) I proposed that we should all
go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for
Bourdeaux, which was a very little voyage.

But while we were considering this, there came in
four French gentlemen, who, having been stopped on
the French side of the passes as we were on theno ntxsos onesott. 2.33

Spanish. had found out a guide. who traversing the
country near the head of Languedoe. had brought
thetn over the mountains by such ways. thatthey were
not tnueh ineommoded with the snow; and where
they met with snow in any quantity. they said it was
frozen hard enough to hear them. and their horses.

We sent. for this guide. who told us. he would nu-
dertake to carry us the same way. with no hazard from
the snow provided we were armed sulliciently to protect
us from wild b \asts; for he said. ttpott these great
snows, it was frequent for some wolves to show them-
selves at the foot. of the mountains. being made raven-
otts for want of food. the ground being covered with
snow. "'e told him we. were well enottgb prepared for
such creatures as they were. if he would ensure. us

we were in most. danger from, especially on the French
side of the. mountains.

lle. satisfied as there was no danger of that kind in
the way that We. were to go. So we readily agreed to
follow him ; as did also twelve other gentlemen, with
their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I
said, had attempted to go, and were. obliged to come
back again.

Accordingly we all set out. from l'ampeluna, with
our guide, on the fifteenth of November; and indeed,
I was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with tts, on the. same. road that we
came from Madrid, above twenty miles; when having
passed two rivers, and come into the plain country, we
found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the
country was pleasant. and no snow to be seen; but on
'a. sudden, turning to the left, he approached the
mountains another way; and though it is true, the
hills and the precipices looked dreadful, yet he made

so many tours. such meanders, and led us by such
winding ways, we were insensibly passed the height of
the mountains without being much encumbered with
the snow; and, all on a sudden, he showed us the
pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gaseoigne,
all green and flourishing; though indeed they wer; at

a great distance, and we had some rough way to pass

Yet. ' " - " '

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it
snowed one whole day, and at night so fast that we
could not travel; but he bade. us be easy, we should
soon be past it all. \Ve found, indeed, that we began
to descend every day, and to come more north than be--
fore ; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on.

It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being something before us, and not just in sight,
'out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them a
bear, out of a hollow way, adjoining to a thick wood.
Two of the wolves flew upon the guide, and had he
been half a mile before us he would have been devoured
indeed, before we could have helped him. One of
them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked
the man with that violence, that he had not time, or
not presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but
hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man
Friday being next to me, I bade him ride up, and see
what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in
sight of the man, he halloocd as loud as the other, ' 0
master! 0 master!' but, like a bold fellow, rode
directly up to the man, and, with a pistol, shot the
wolf that attacked him into the head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for be, having been used to that kind of
creature in his country, had no fear upon him, but
went close up to him, and shothim as above : whereasnonissos e ltUSnl-Z. '25:)

any of us would have. fired at a farther distance,
and have, perhaps, either missed the wolf, or en-
dangered shootingr the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than 1 ; and indeed it alarmed all our company, when,
with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides
the dismallest howling of wolves, and the noise re-
douhled by the. echo of the mountains, that it was to us
as if there had heen a prodigious multitude of them ;
and perhaps indeed there were. not such a few, as that
we had no cause of apprehensions.

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other,
that. had fastened upon the horse, left him immediately,
and tied, having happily fastened upon his head, where
the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth, so that
he had not done him much hurt. The man, indeed was
most hurt: for the. raging creature had hit. him twice, 5- ,
once on the arm. and the other time a little above his ,
knee; and he was just, as it. were, tumbling down by :3?
the disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and
shot the. wolf.

It. is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Pride '0
pistol we all mended our pace, and rid up, as fast as t e
way Swhich was very (litiieult) would give us leave, to
see w rat was the. matter. As soon as we came clear of
the trees, which blinded us before, we saw plainly what
had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the
poor guide; though we did not resently discern what
kind of creature it was he had ki led.

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in
such a surprising manner, as that which followed be- '
tween Friday and the bear, which gave us all (thou 'lt3
at first we were surprised and afraid for him) t e
greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy,

clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does,
z 2

J
which isswit't and light. ; so he has two particular quali-
ties, which generally are the rule. of his actions. First,
as to men, who are not his proper prey. I say, not
his proper prey, though, I cannot say what excessive
hunger might do, which 'as now their case, the
ground being all covered with snow ; yet, as to men,
he does not usually attack them, unless they first at-
tack him: on the contrary, if you meet him in the
woods, though if you do not. meddle with him, he will
not meddle with you; yet then you must take care to
be very civil to him and give him the road ; for he is
a very nice gentleman, he will not go a step out. of his
way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your
best way is to look another way, and keep going on ;
for sometimes if you stop and stand still, and look
steadfastly at him, he takes it for an affront, and sets
all other business aside to pursue his revenge; for he
will have satisfaction in point of honour; and this is
his first quality. The next is, that if he be once at-
fronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he
has his revenge, but follow, at a good round rate, till
he overtakes you.

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when
we had come. up to him, he was helping him oil" front
his horse; for the man 'as both hurt and frighted,
and indeed the last more than the first; when, on a
sudden, we spied the bear come out of the wood, and a
vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I
saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw him ;
but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and
courage in the fellow's countenance. '0! 0! 01'
says Friday, three times, pointing to him ; ' O, mas-
ter! you give me te leave, me shakee the hand with
him, me makee you good laugh.'

1 was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. ' Youuomasoa euusoa. , '25)?

fool you,' said I. ' he will eat you up i' ' Eatee me u ;
liatee me up 1*" says Friday, twice over again. ' lille
eatee him up: me make you good laugh. You all Btu
here . me show you good langh.' So down he sits, an
gets his boots oil' in a moment, and put on a )air off
pmnps (as we eall the flat shoes they wear), and which
he had in his pocket, gives my other servant his horse,
and with his gun, away he tlew, swift like the wind.

The hear was walking softly on, and otfered to med-
dle with nobody, till Friday, coming pretty near, calls
to him, as if the hear could understand him. ' llark ye,
hark ye,' says Friday, ' me sp aikee wit you.' We fol-
lowed at. a distance ; for now being come down to the
(laseoigne side of the mountains, we were entered a
vast. great. forest, where the country was plain and
pretty open, though many trees in it scattered here
and there.

Friday, who had, as we say. the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great stone,
and throws it at him, and hit him just on the head;
but. did him no more harm, than if he had thrown it
against a wall 2 hut it answered Friday's end; for the
rogue. was so void of fear that he did it purely to make
the bear follow him, and ' show us some laugh,' as he
called it.

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he
turns about, and comes after him, taking very long
strides, and shuttling along at a strange rate, so as
would put a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs
Friday, and takes his course, as if he ran towards-us
for help ; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the
bear, and deliver my man ; though I was angry at him
heartily for bringing the hear back upon us, when he
was going about his own business another way; and
especially I was angry that he had turned the bear
upon us, and then run away ; and I called out, ' You
dog,' said I,. ' is this your making us laugh I" Come
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the
creature.' He hears me, and cries out, ' No shoot,
no shoot! Stand still: you get much laugh.' And
as the nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's one,
he turned, on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing
a great oak tree, fit for his purpose, he beckoned us to
follow, and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the
tree, laying his gun down up the ground, at about five
or six yards from the bottom of the tree.

The bear soon came. to the tree, and we followed at
a distance. The first thing he did he stopped at the
gun, smelt to it, but let it. lie, and up be scrambles
into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so mon-
strously heavy. I was amazed at the folly as I thought
it, of my man, and could not for my life see any thing
to laugh at yet, till, seeing the bear get up the tree, we
all rode nearer to him.

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small end of a large limb of the tree, and
the bear got half way to him; as soon as the bear got
out to that part where the limb of the tree was
weaker, ' IIa,'says he, to us, ' now you see me teachee
the bear dance :' so he falls a jumping, and shaking the
bough at which the bear began to totter, but stood still
and began to look behind him, to see how he should get
back; then indeed we did laugh heartily. But Friday
had not done with him by a great deal : when he sees
him stand still, he calls out to him again, as if he had
supposed the bear could speak English, ' What, you
no come farther? Pray you come farther.' So he
left jumping and shaking the bough: and the bear,
just as if he had understood what he said, did come a
little farther: then he fell a jumping again, and the
bear stopped again.

\Ve thought now was a good time to knock him on
the head, and I called to Friday to stand still and we
would shoot. the bear; but he cried out. earnestlv, O
pray ! O pray ! no shoot ! Me shoot by and then.'
He would have said, ' lly and hy.' However, to
shorten the story. Friday danced so much, and the
bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough in-
deed, but still could not imagine what the fellow would
do; for first we thought. he depended upon shaking
the bear oil', and we found the hear was too cunning
for that too ; for he would not go out far enough to be
thrown down, but. clings fast. with his great, broad
claws and feet, so that we could not imagine what
would be the. end of it, and where the jest Would be at '
last.

But Friday put us out. of doubt. quickly ; for seeing
the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would not
be persuaded to come any farther, ' Well, well,' says
Friday, you do come farther, me go, me go; you no
come. to me, me come. to you.' And upon this, he
goes out to the smallest end of the bough, where it
should bend with his weight. and gently lets himself
down by it, sliding down the bough, till he came near,
enough to jump down on his feet, and away he ran to
his gun, takes it up, and stands still. .

' Well,' said I to him, 'Friday, what will you do
now ? Why don't you shoot him i" ' No shoot,' says
Friday, ' no yet, me shoot now, me no kill: me stay,
give. you one more laugh.' And indeed so he did, as
you will see. presently; for when the bear saw his
enemy gone. he comes back from the bough where he
stood; but did itmighty leisurely, looking behind him
every step, and coming backward till he got into the
body of the tree. Then with the same hinder end-
forernost, he came down the tree, grasping it with his
claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely :
at this juncture, and just before he could set his hind
feet upon the ground, Friday stepped close to him,
clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot
him dead as a stone. '

Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not
laugh ; and when he saw we were pleased by our looks,
he falls a laughing himself very loud. ' So we kill
bear in my country,' says Friday. ' So you kill them !'
said I ; ' why ybu have no guns.' ' No,' says he: ' no
gun; but shoot great, much, long arrow.'

This was, indeed, a good diversion to us; but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew : the howling of
wolves ran much in my head; and indeed, except the
noise I once heard on the shores of Africa, of which I
had said something already, I never heard any thing
that filled me with so much horror. .

These things, and the approach of night, called us
off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we should
have certainly taken the skin of this monstrous crea-
ture off, which was worth saving; but we had three

.leagues to go, and our guide hastened us ; so we left
him, and went forward on our journey.

The ground was still covered with snow, though not
so deep and dangerous as on the mountains ; and the
ravenous creatures, as we heard afterward, were come
down into the forest and plain country, pressed by
hunger, to seek for food; and had done a great deal of
mischief in the villages, where they surprised the coun-
try people, killed a great many of their sheep and
horses, and some people too.

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our
guide told us, if there were any more wolves in the
country, we should find them there; and this was a
small plain, surrounded with woods on every side; and
a long narrow defile or lane, which we were to pass to
get through the wood, and then we should come to the
village where we were to lodge.

It was within half an hour of sunset, when we en-
tered the first wood ; and a little after sunset when we
came into the plain. We met with nothing in the first '
wood, except that, in a little plain, within the wood,
which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five
great wolves cross the road, full speed, one after
another, as if they had been in chase of some prey,
and had it in view. They took no notice of us, and
were gone, and out of our sight in a few moments.

Upon this, our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a ready
posture; for he believed there were more wolves a.
coming.

'vVe kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through that
wood which was near half a league, and entered the
plain. As soon as we came into the plain, we had oc-
casion enough to look about us. The first object we
met with, was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor
horse, which the wolves had killed, and at least a
dozen of them at work; we could not say, eating of
him but icking of his bones rather; for they had

eaten u a l the flesh before.
We id not think fit to disturb them at their feast,

neither did they take much notice of us. Friday would
have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by any
means: for I found we were like to have more
business upon our hands than we were aware of. We

were not gone half over the plain, but we began to hear
the wolves bowl, in the wood on our left, in a fright-
fnl manner; and presently after, we saw about a
hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body,
and most of them in a line, as regular as an army
drawn up by experienced officers. l scarce knew in
what manner to receive them ; but found to draw our-
selves in a close line, was the only way. So we formed
in a moment. But that. we might not. have too much
interval, I ordered that only every other man should
tire, and that. the others who had not fired, should stand
ready to give them a second volley immediately,
if they continued to advance upon us; and that then
those who had fired at first should not pretend to load
their t'usils again, but stand ready with every one. a
pistol; for we were. all armed with a fits", and a pair
of pistols, ~ach man : so we were, by this method, able
to fire six volleys, half of us at a time. However, at.
present, we. had no necessity ; for, upon firing the first.
volley, the enemy made. a full stop, being terrified as
well with the noise, as with the fire: four of them
being shot into the head, dropped ; several others were
wounded, and went. bleeding oil', as we could see by the.
snow. 1 found they stopped, but did not innuediatel y
retreat; whereupon remembering that Ihad been told,
that the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of
a man, 1 caused all our company to halloo as loud as
we could: and I found the notion not altogether mis--
taken; for, upon our shout, they began to retire, and
turn about; then I ordered a second volley to be fired
in their rear, which put them to the gallop, and away
they went to the woods.

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and
that we might lose no time, we kept. going; but we
had but little more than loaded our fusils, and put our-
selves into a. readiness, when we heard a terrible noisenomxsos meson. '46:}

in the same wood on our left ; only that it was farther
onward. the same way we were to go.

The night was coming on. and the light began to he
dusky. which made it the worse on our side ; hut the
noise increasing. we could easily perceive that. it. was
the howling.r and yelling of those vile creatures;
and. on a sudden. we perceived two or three troops of
wolves. one on our left. one behind us. and one on
our front: so that we seemed to be surrounded with
them. However. as they did not fall upon us, we kept
our way forward. as fast as we could make our horses
go, whieh. the way being very rough, was only a good
large trot; and in this manner we only came in view
of the entrance of the wood. through which we were,
to pass. at. the farther side of the plain, but we were
greatly surprised, when. coming near the lane. or pass,
we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at
the entrance.

()1) a sudden. at. another opening of the wood, we
heard the noise of a gun ; and, looking that way, out
rushed a horse, with a saddle and hridle on him, flying
like. the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after
him, full speed. Indeed the horse. had the heels of
them; but, as we. supposed that he could not hold at
that rate, we doubted not, that they would get up with
him at last; and no question but they did.

Here we. had a most. horrible sight; for, riding it
to the entrance. where. the horse came out, we. fottn
the carcase of another horse, and of two men devoured
by the ravenous creatures, and one of the men was no
doubt the same whom we. heard fire the gun; for there
lay a gun just by him fired off; but, as to the man,
his head, and the upper part. of his body, were eaten
up.

This filled us with horror, and we. knew not what
course to take; but the creatures resolved as soon, for
they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey;
and l verly believe there were three hundred of them.
It happened very much to our advantage, that. at the
entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there
lay some large timher trees, which had been cut down
the summer before, and I suppose. lay there for car-
riage. l drew my little troop in among these trees,
and placing ourselves in a line, behind one long tree, l
advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree. before
us, for abreastwork, to stand in a triangle. or three.
fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre.

"'0 did so; and it was well we did, for never was a
more furious charge than the. creatures made n ion us
in this place: they came on us with a growling leind of
noise, and mounted the piece of timber (which as I
said was our breastwork), as if they were only rushing
upon their prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems, was
principally occasioned by their seeing our horses he--
hind us, which was the prey they aimed at. I
ordered our men to fire as before, every other man;
and they took their aim so sure, that indeed they
killed several wolves at the first volley ; but there was
a necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those before.

When we had fired our second volley of our fusils,
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they
would have gone. oti', but it was but a moment, for
others came forward again : so we fired two Volleys of
our pistols, and I believe in these four firings, we
killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice
as many: yet they came on again.

I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily ; so I
called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was bet-
ter employed ; for, with the greatest dexterity imagin-noninsos enosos. 965

ahle. he charged my t'nsil. and his own. while we
were engaged; but. as i said. i called my other man;
and giving him 3 horn of powder. I bnde hitn lay n
train. all along the piece of timber. and let it be a
large train. lle did so. and had but just time to get
away. when the wolves came up to it. and some were
got upon it. when l snap ting an nnehnrged pistol elose
to the powder. s'et it on lire. 'l'hose that were upon
the timber were scorched with it. and se\'en ot' thent
fell. or rather jumped in among us. with the force or
the fright of the tire. We distanched these in on in-
stant, and the rest were so frighted with the. light,
which the night. for now it was very near dark. made
more terrible. that they drew hack a little.

Upon which I ordered our last. pistols to be tired of?
in one \'olle. . and after that. we gave a shout: upon
this the wolves turned tail. and we sallied itmttedhttely
upon near twenty lame ones, which we found strug-
gling on the ground, and fell a cutting them with our
swords, which answered our ers'peetation ; for the cry-
ing and howling they made were better understood by
their fellows, so that they all tled and left us.

We had, first and last, killed about threescorc of
them; and bad it. been daylight, we had killed many
more. The field of battle being thus cleared. we made
forward again, for we had still near a league. to o.
\Ve heard the. raVenons creatures howl and yell in t c
woods, as we. went, several times; and sometimes we

fancied we 'saw some of them, but the snow dazzling
our eyes, we were not certain: so in about an hour
more, we none to the town, where We were. to lodge,
which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms;
for it seems that the night before, the wolves and some
bears had broken into the village, and put them in a
terrible fright; and they were obliged to keep guard,
'2 A
night and day, but especially in the night. to preserve
their cattle. and indeed their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill. and his
limbs so swelled with the. rankling of his two wounds,
that he could go no farther; so we were obliged to
take. another guide there, and go to 'l'houlouse, where
we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country.
and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like them. lint
when we told our story at 'l'houlouse. they told us it.
was nothing but what. was ordinary in the great. forest.
at the foot. of the. mountains, especially when the snow
lay on the ground. But they inquired much what.
kind of a guide we had gotten, that would venture to
bring US that way in such a severe season: and told
us, it was very much we. were. not all deVoured; when
we told them how we had placed ourselves, and the
horses in the middle. they blamed us exceedingly, and
told us it. was fifty to one but. we. had all been des-
troyed; for it was the sight ol' the horses that made.
the wolves so furious, seeing their prey, and that at.
other times they are r'ally afraid of a gun; but they
being excessive hungry, and raging on that account,
the eagerness to come at. the horses had made them
senseless of the danger; and that it' we had not, by
the continued tire, and at last by the stratagem of the
train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds
but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we

[been content to have sat still on horseback, and fired
as horsemen, they would not have. taken the horses so
much for their own, when men were on their backs, as
otherwise; and, withal, they told us, that, at last, if
we had stood all together, and left our horses, they
would have been so eager to have devoured them,
that we might have come off safe, especially having our
fire arms in our hands, and being so many in number.uomssos eursos. 267

For my part. I was never so sensible of dangn'r in
my life; for seeing above three hundred devils'eome
roaring and o ion-mouthed to devour us. and hax'ing
nothing to she ter us. or retreat to. I gave myself over
for lost ; and. as it. was. i believe I shall never care to
cross those mountains again: I think i would much
rather go a thousand leagues by sea. though I were
sure to meet with a stortn ouee a week.

I have nothing uueonunou to take notice of in my
passage through l-'ranee; nothing but what other tra-
vellers have given an aeeount ot'. with mneh more
advantage than I ean. I travelled from 'l'hottlonse
to Paris. and. without any eonsiderahle stay. came.
to Calais, and landed safe at "over. the fourteenth
of January. after having had a severe eold season to
travel in.

[was now come to the eeutre of my travels, and
had. in a little time, all my new-discovered estate safe
about me, the hills of exchange which l brought with
me having been very currently paid.

My principal guid', and privy--counsellor, was my
good, ancient. widow. who. in gratitude for the money
[had sent her, thought. no pains too much, or care
too great, to employ for me, and I trusted her so en-
tirely with everything, that. l was perfectly easy as to
the security of my eili'ets: and, indeed, I was Very
happy from the beginning, and now to the end, in the
unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.

And now I began to think of leaving my effects with
this woman, and setting out. for Lisbon, and so to the
.Brazils. But now another scru le came in m way,
and that was religion; for as I tad entertains some
doubts about the. Roman religion, even while l was
abroad, especially in my state of solitud-: so I knew
there was no going to tie. Brazils for me, much less

2 A 2
going to settle there, unless I resolved to embrace the
Roman Catholic religion. without any reserve; except,
on the. other hand, I resolved to be a sacrifice to mv
principles, he a martyr for religion, and die in the ,ln-
quisition: so I resolved to stay at home, and if I could
find means for it, to dispose of my plantation.

To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,
who, in return, gave me notice, that he could easily
dispose of it there; but that, if I thought fit to give
him leave to ofi'er it in my name to the two merchants,
the. survivors of my trustees, who lived in the "mails,
who must fully understand the value of it, who lived
just upon the spot, and whom I knew to be very rich,
so that he believed they would be fond of buying it;
he did not doubt, but I should make four or five thou-
sand pieces of eight. the more of it.

' Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it to
them, and he did so; and in about eight months
more, the ship being then returned, he sent me an ac-
count, that they had accepted the ofi'er, and had re-
mitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight to a
correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my
old man, who sent me bills of exchange for thirty-two
thousand eight hundred pieces of eight, for the estate,
reserving the payment of one hundred moidores a year
to him, the old man, during his life, and fifty moidores
afterward to his son for his life, which I had promised
them ; and which the plantation was to make good as
a rent charge. .

And thus I have given the history of a life of for-'- "
tune and adventure, a life of l'rovidence's checker-
work, and of a variety which the world will seldom
show the like of--beginning foolishly, but closing
much more happily than any part of it ever gave me
leave so much as to hope for.

Anyone would think, that. in this state of compli-
cated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards; and so indeed I had been, if other circum-
stances had concurred: but I was inured to a wander-
ing life, had no family. nor many relations. nor how-
ever rich, had I contracted much acquaintance; and
though I had sold my estate in the lirazils, yet. I could
not keep that country out. of mv head. and had a great
mind to be upon the wing again ; especially I could
not resist the strong inclination I had to see my island,
and to know if the poor 8 ianiards were in bein there,
and how the rogues l llflt left there had used t iem.

My true friend the widow, 'arnestly dissuaded me
from it. and so far prevailed with me, that for almost
seven years she prevented my running abroad: during
which time I took my two nephews, the children of
one of my brothers, into my care. The eldest havin
something of his own, I bred up as a. gentleman, an
gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate
after my decease. : the other I put. out to a captain of
a ship; and after five. years. finding him a sensible,
bold, enterprising young fellow, l put. him into a good
ship, and sent. him to sea. And this young fellow af-
terward drew me. in, old as I was, to farther adven-
tures myself.

In the mean time, I in part. settled myself here : for
first of all I married, and that not either to my disad-
vantage or dissatisfaction; and had three children,
two sons and one daughter. But. my wife dying, and
my nephew coming home, with good success, from a
voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and his
importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in his
ship as a private trader to the East indies. This was
in the year 1691..
In this voyage, I visited my new colony in the
island, saw my successors, the Spaniards; had the
whole story of their lives. and of the villains I left
there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards;
how they afterward agreed, disagreed, united, se a-
rated, and how at last the Spaniards were obliget~ to
use violence with them ; how the were subjected to
the Spaniards; how honestly t to Spaniards used
them; a history, if it were entered into, as full of va-
riety and wonderful accidents, as my own part: parti-
cularly also as to their battles with the Carribeans,
who landed several times upon the island itself: and
how five of them made an attempt upon the main land,
and brought away eleven men and five women pri-
soners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty
young children on the island.

Here. I staid about twenty days, left them supplies
of all necessary things, and particularly of arms, pow-
der, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen which I
brought from England with me: viz. a carpenter and
a smith.

Besides this, I shared the island into parts with
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole,
but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed
on; and having settled all things with them, and en-
gaged them not to leave the place, I left them there.

From thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence
I sent a bark, which I bought there, with more peo-
plc to the island; and in it, besides other supplies, I
sent seven women, being such as I found proper
for service, or for wives to such as would take them.
As to the Englishmen I promised them to send them
some women from England, with a good cargo of
necessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting,
which I afterward could not perform. The fellows
proved very honest and diligent, after they were mas-
tered, and had their property set apart for them. I
sent them also from the. Brazils five cows, three of
' them with calves, some sheep, and some hogs, which,
when I came again, were considerablv increased.

After this. however, three hundred Carribees came
and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and
they fought with that whole number twice, and were
at first defeated and one of them killed : but at last a
storm destroying their enemies' canoes, they famished
or destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and re-
covered the possession of their plantation, and still
lived upon the island. I had some. very surprising in-
cidents, in some new adventures of my own, for several
years more; but now, having lived seventy-two years,
a life of infinite variety, and learned sufficiently to know
the value of retirement and the blessing of endin our
days in peace. I have resolved to harass myse f no
more, and am therefore pre taring for a longer jour-
ney than any 1 have yet. undertaken.
