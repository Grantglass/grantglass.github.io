HIS instructive and entertaining
history was written about one

hundred and fifty years ago, by
a very ingenious and celebrated

 

person, Daniel De Foe. Before he became an
author, he was a hosier, and then a pantile-
maker; but in business he did not succeed,
and he sunk into great distress. He published
many works, of which Robinson Crusoe is the
chief. It is said that be derived the idea of'
this story from the narrative of Alexander Sel-

kirk, a sailor who was left ashore on the island
5
of Juan Fernandez, and was brought away
by Captain Rogers, after he had lived there
by himself for many years. Let us hope that
this tale of wonderful adventures, bitter sufl'er--
ings, and perilous escapes, Will teach our
young friends the advantage of a safe and
quiet home, and cure them of that sad disorder
of the mind, a discontented and restless dis-
position-
OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

fl

own account of himself, was at the
_ age of eighteen a discontented 3nd
~_. most unreasonable young gentleman.

V '5'- 5'7 He had kind parents, a comfortable
home, and all the advantages commonly arising

 

from prosperous circumstances; and yet he was
dissatisfied. He appeared to be weary of good
things, and to desire evil things for the sake of
the change. You will see that he had more
than enough of amazing troubles and disasters
in the course of his life to teach him the value
of common comforts at home. Our first print

represents him sullen and dejected by the fire-
8
side, with all things convenient about himghis
sister has hold of his hand and is endeavouring
by kindness to persuade him into a good humour,
whilst his parents are representing the advantages
be there possessed, and are pointing to the case
of a poor beggar at the door to whom a servant
has been sent with relief; but who in the mean
time endures the pitiless wintry storm and ,
hunger at the same time. Robinson, however,
disregards all that can be said and done to
attach him to his home; he becomes ill-tempered
and reserved, and would you believe it, he forms
the sad resolution of leaving his parents' house
without their leave or knowledge! I quite
expect to find him in some dreadful situation of
distress the next time we hear of him--let us
see.
' V YES, here he is on board a ship in
1' a storm, which is just ready to sink!
""3: They are getting a boat ready for
5 him and the rest of the crew. I
' fear it is too small to take them
every one, I hope poor Robinson will escape
somehow--that is the lad I mean; the Wind has
just blown his hat ofl', do not you see 7--Before
I tell you what became of him this time, I must
explain how he came on board that ship and
where it was to have sailed. The case was this.
Robinson had stated his discontents to some of
his young acquaintances, amongst whom was a
sailor-lad whose father owned a vessel trading
from Hull in Yorkshire to London. This lad
told Crusoe that he would be happy directly if
he would but go to sea--a very great mistake
indeed, which many a boy finds out too late.

 

However, Robinson disliked home and regularROBINSON 03115012. 15

habits so much that he took this bad advice-
ran away from his dear parents and brothers and
sisters without even saying good-bye, and got on
board this vessel one fine autumn evening in
company with his sailor-friend. I am afraid that
neither of these lads told the captain of the ves-
sel the truth, or he would not have taken them,
but so it was: they sailed out of the river Hum-
ber, and very delightful it seemed at first, but in
a few hours the Wind rose and blew most bois-
terously, the waves flew over the ship and tossed
it up and down--Robinson was dreadfully sick
and could not keep his legs. At last the ship
was thrown upon some rocks, which knocked a
great hole'in it, so that they began to sink and
were obliged to take to their boats as I said
before.
ELL, and so as soon as poor Robin-
son and all the people had got into
_ the little boat, the great ship went
t " down! Yes, it sunk down, down,
down, into the sea, till at last even the top of the
mast was covered by the waves. All the corn
and merchandise which were to have been sold
in London for thousands of pounds, and all the
ship that had cost thousands too, with their
boxes of clothes and every thing, were all lost

 

at once and never heard of more. But Robin-
son and the rest of them had no time to think
of those things, for they were afraid every
moment that their little boat with themselves in
it would also go down, the weather was so tem-
pestuous, the sea was so rough, and their boat
was so overloaded. But it pleased Providence
to spare all their lives that time. They arrived
at length at a place called Yarmouth in Norfolk,Pages

Xury suddenly cried out, " O ! master, a ship--
a. ship!" They were both overjoyed at the sight,
which was evidently a European vessel, and now
their chief effort was to make themselves per-
ceived; for the vessel, though in sight, was not
sailing towards them. So they hoisted a white,
flag as high as they could, and at length had the
joy of seeing that they were observed, as the
vessel now altered her course and came towards
them.
" * HEN the ship came up to our ad-

   
  
 

venturers, the captain enquired of
Robinson, in three different lan-
_, guages, who and what he was; but
unhappily, this young man not having improved
his time at school, understood not a word he
said in French, in Spanish, or in Portuguese.
At last a Scotch sailor who chanced to be on
board, found that Robinson was an Englishman,
and so got the needful information out of him;
which when the captain understood, induced
him to take the two young men on board with
all their goods.

The Portuguese captain behaved very well
indeed to his new guests, and offered to take
them where he was going, that was to the Bra-
zils in South America, and to buy his boat at a
fair price of him when he got there. He also
offered to take the boy Xury and employ him in
his ship, which was a great benefit to both.

They had a prosperous voyage to the Brazils.
The captain, who was generous as well as just
refused to take any thing of Robinson for his
passage, and at the same time bought all he had
to sell at a very good price--the boat and all
that was in it, with the lion's skin, produced
him thus a very useful sum of money; the thing
above all things needful in arriving on a foreign
shore.
   

. ND now we find Robinson Crusoe
" in quite a 'new situation and con--
dition in life. Being recommend-
ed by the captain to an honest
resident who was master of a sugar plantation,
be acquainted himself with the manner of culti-
vating that plant, and of making the sugar itself.
At length he purchased some land and set up
planter.-

But Robinson began now to reflect that he
could have done better than this at home, had
he liked to have settled on a farm, or to any
other profession or business. In fact, though
he was succeeding as well as he could expect,
he began to be unhappy and discontented again.
At length when he had been about four years in
the Brazils, and had considerably increased his
property, Robinson Crusoe determined to sell
all off and go to sea again as a merchant; and
what trade do you think he fixed upon now to
carry forward on the seas ?--the slave trade!
-I am sorry to say, that be resolved to sail to the
coast of Africa to purchase poor negroes to work
in the plantations of Brazil.
"'UT our restless adventurer was soon
{if punished for his incurable discon-
' 5 tent, and for his unjust purpose of
enslaving his fellow--men. He sailed
'3 in a good vessel with a crew of

  

fourteen persons, and such articles of traffic as
would enable him to purchase slaves of the
African chiefs. But they had not been many
days out at sea when a violent tempest arose,
such as in the tropical seas is called a tornado;
this drove them far away from their intended
course, and indeed quite out of their knowledge,
so that for twelve days they knew not where
they were nor whither they were going. Whilst
they were in this perplexity and terror, one of
the sailors suddenly called out " Land !" That
meant that he could see land; but Robinson had
no sooner run out of the cabin to look out, than
the vessel struck upon a sand-bank; and theI: again Shipwrecked.
motion being thus stopped, the sea broke over
with tremendous violence, threatening every in-
stant to wash them all overboard and to break
the ship in pieces. At last they did as before,
and as is usual in such cases, they got the boat
down and embarked in her, although they had
little hope that they could thereby escape. At -
length their worst fears were realised; the fatal
wave came which overset their boat and threw
them all into the stormy sea!
V on would now expect an end of the
story, but that you know if they had
all been drowned, no one could have
told about the storm. Yes, one was
saved, and he got to shore without any boat at

  

all. It was Robinson himself, who was thrown
out like the rest of them; but so it happened
that the wave which upset the boat bore him on
its foaming edge, and at length hurled him with
violence on the shore. He had just time to get
on his legs and run higher up before the next
wave came, which would have carried him back
again to the Whelming ocean. Poor Crusoe had
scarcely escaped this danger when he dropped
nearly insensible from the violence, exertion,
and fright he had undergone. When he came
to himself he looked up and thanked God for
his wonderful deliverance. He was the only
one saved out of the whole company; he neverEscapes from Drowning.

saw them afterwards, nor any sign of them, but
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that
Were not fellows.

Robinson cast his eyes to the stranded vessel,
which lay at some distance buffeted by the yet
rolling sea.. It seemed to him a miracle that he 4
could have got on shore.
i 0 our friend Robinson Crusoe is at
length landed all alone on an entirely
unknown shore! What was to be-
come of him now--what should he
do? Can you tell me what you

  

would do in such a case--hunger coming on,
night approaching, and no food or lodging pro-
vided! I rather think you would wish yourself
at home again, as there is no doubt Robinson
did on that Occasion. In fact he soon began to
think that he had but a dreadful deliverance
from a sudden to a lingering death. His condi-
tion was indeed pitiable. He was wet and had
no other clothes, nor any thing to eat or drink,
nor any prospect but that of perishing with
famine or being devoured by wild beasts. He
had no weapon to defend him, or (to enable him
to procure any animal for his sustenance; he
had nothing about him but a knife, and a tobacco
box and pipe, with a little tobacco. He walked
about in very great distress and agony of mind,
and as night came on he had nothing for- it
but to climb up into a thick bushy tree out
of the way of Wild beasts, and here he fell fast
asleep.
:'hHE next morning early Robinson
' ' awoke in his leafy chamber, and
- . rubbing his eyes wondered not a
.1 little where he Was. Hunger soon
reminded him that he had had no supper, and
when he had roused himself completely he could
not tell where his breakfast was to come from.
This was rather a serious predicament--worse
than sitting by his father's fireside at York,
taking rolls and coffee on a rainy morning.
Before Crusoe descended from the tree he
looked out on the ocean. The storm had
abated, and he was surprised to observe that the
wreck of the ship had been thrown higher up
and much nearer the shore. This gave him
some comfort, and he walked as far as he could
towards her, but still found half a mile of water
between the vessel and the land. In a few
hours, however, the tide had ebbed out so far<<* .. _ 1' .. ' Y '
Lima" fi/V 37mm
that he could approach the ship by swimming,
and after having paddled round it for some time,
he at length found a bit of rope hanging from
her side, by which he swung himself up and got
on board. Now he perceived that if they had
all kept the ship that they would all have been
safe, and he would have had companions in his I
exile.
 
 
 
  

HEN Robinson got on board the
.t' vessel, it was a sad sight indeed.
I 31' She was wedged fast, so that the fore
' f '1 part was secured and whole, but the
hind part was greatly damaged and broken,
and she was more than half filled with water.
All the masts, sails and ropes--which are
called the rigging--were gone. Happily, how-
ever, for Robinson he found the provision-
room but little injured, and the chief of the
stores remaining good. 0 with what a relish
did he devour biscuits and bacon, cheese and
salt fish, and how refreshed he was by a drop of
good wine from the neck of a broken bottle,
though in his eagerness be sadly cut his mouth
with the glass! He found indeed that he was
in danger of indulging to excess after his long
fast, and therefore presently set about another
kind of employment. He knew that his very
existence depended on his being able to trans-
port these provisions to the shore for his future
subsistence, but how was this to be done'! there
was no boat, and the remains of the vessel would
not hold together long, strained as it still was by
the force of the sea and wind. He could to be ,
sure swim away as he had done, and he could
put a biscuit or two in his mouth; but it was
needful to hit on some better contrivance than
that--what do you think it could be'.l
0 you know what a raft is? It is a
platform of pieces of timber fastened
together,'and which will be sure to
....7 float, because any single piece would
float by itself. Now it is plain, that if a raft
thus made he put on the water and not over-
loaded, it Will answer in some degree the pur-

  

pose of aboat; and if a man can but keep his
place and position upon it, he may proceed with
it in safety. So Robinson set to work, and
finding plenty of broken timber and scattered
rigging about, he corded a quantity together as
flat as a floor; and having tied to it a rope of
suflicient length to prevent its sailing away, he
contrived, by the help of lines and with great
exertion, to heave it over the ship's side. There
was a splash! So--now the raft has adjusted
itself, and lies pretty flat on the water, but bob-
bing up and down with the waves. But Crusoe
soon steadied it a little with some of the sea-
men's heavy chests, and with casks of provisions
and other things. Whilst he was doing this, the
tide was rising, and he had the unhappiness to
see his coat and waistcoat which he had left on
shore washed away by the sea However, he
found others on board the ship; and having got
as much on his raft, of provisions, utensils, tools,
arms and ammunition, as it could well sustain,
he pushed off, and the sea being tolerably quiet,
he managed to row himself to land. Look at
him in the print; there he is full of business, is
he not?
 

nearly sloped 03' into the sea. He just succeeded
in preventing this, and at length got all his goods
up high and dry on the shore. Oh, how thank-
ful he was--there was food enough and other
comfortable things for a long time to come--no
thoughts of starving now.

His next care was to find a place of lodging
for himself, and of security for his goods. So,
having piled them together as well as he could,
he took a gun and some powder, and ascended a
high hill at no great distance. Then it was that
he discovered this strange spot to be an island,
for he could see the ocean with its waves spark-
ling all round it. The island itself was of course
not very large, nor was it barren; there were
woods and grassy vales, and various animals
skipping about, but he could not discover the
least sign of a human being. You see him there
on the top of the hill in the engraving, and there
are his casks and chests in a heap below. What
has he done with his raft? Oh! there it is, tied'
to a stump driven into the sand!
OBINSON Censor: came down from
i i the hill and walked about to explore
the island further, but was greatly
",f afraid of losing sight of his stores.
So he did not go a great way that
day; but when evening arrived he felt very
much fatigued with his exertions, and began to
wish much for some quiet lodging in which he
might lie secure for the night. However, he
could find none then, and therefore he barricaded
himself round as well as he could with the tubs,
chests, and boards ; and having taken his supper,
passed the night pretty comfortably. In the
morning he again looked towards the ship, and
finding she still remained, he determined to try
and raft over as many more things as he thought
would be useful to him, and, in fact, went and
came on this errand several times, and greatly

 

increased his stores on the island. He also car-
ried on shore with him two cats, which, together
with a dog that swam ashore from the wreck, for
some time composed his household. It was not
to be expected that he should make every voyage
without an accident: on one occasion the raft
and all that was on it was upset and washed
away, and himself narrowly escaped drowning. .
These expeditions were at length put an end to
as he had expected. One morning, when he
awoke after a windy night and looked towards
the sea, the ship had entirely disappeared 3 not a
plank was visible, all had been borne away by
the curling green waves!
3.3 OBINSON CRUSOE, though solitary,
I. was no longer destitute on his little

island. Provisions, drink, clothing,
tools, materials, arms, gunpowder
and shot, with innumerable other
articles, not excepting MONEY! he had supplied
himself with in more or less abundance. You
will ask of what use money could be to him in
an uninhabited island? None whatever, cer-
tainly; but he prudently thought that if ever a
ship came that way, gold would. be of use again.

Still Robinson was Without a habitation. He
had goods but no lodging, and that was rather
awkward; he was also in constant terror of
wild beasts issuing from the woods, which might
eat his provisions, and perhaps himself at last.
So he considered what he should do, and re-
solved to erect himself a tent with the sails and
cordage of the ship, until he could provide him-
self some more secure habitation.

He found that he should soon lose all know-
ledge of the days, months, or years of his
present life, unless he kept some account of
their progress; so he got some long sticks, and
cutting a notch every day, couldvat any time
count them up and find where he was in the
year.
. , OBINSON'S tent would not have pro-
'-' tected him from the attacks of wild
at. beasts, of which he was so much
f afraid, if he had trusted to ropes
and canvas. To fortify himself to
his satisfaction, he enclosed it in a ring fence
made with stakes driven firmly into the ground,
and so high as not to be mounted by men or
animals. He would not even make a door for
himself to enter, lest he should chance to leave it
open, but used a ladder, which he always drew
up after him. So he was secure, and at the
same time solitary indeed. Within this enclo-
sure, or within his tent, he brought all his
various stores and useful articles. This spot
was close under the side or a hill, in which he
scooped out a cave, which he made his cellar.
Now, though this young man was for the
present in much less distress than might have

 

. <<-
been expected, he was by no means happy.
The thoughts of his native land, and the social
comforts he had forsaken without cause, often
brought tears into his eyes; and his utter lone-
liness made him, for the most part, melancholy
and wretched. If he had not been obliged to '
employ himself so much in laborious occupations (
required by his situation, he might have lost his
reason altogether. I trust therefore that none
of my young readers will envy him, however
snug was his tent and cave, and although he was
a sort of monarch over the island he inhabited.
 

and there were countless lands and seas which
had never apparently been visited by men. It
would now be rather difficult to find a solitary
island, or even the rocky summit of a mountain
above the sea, which has not been seen, named,
and laid down in some chart or another.

Our adventurer did not neglect to provide
himself with pen, ink and paper, books, and
nautical instruments, out of the ship's stores;
and these relieved his dulness very much, and
enabled h'im to write his history at full length.
What he says in his narrative about this island
as an unknown country to all the world, might
have been true almost two hundred years ago;
but this would not quite do to write as existing
to the present day. The print shows Robinson
in his tent, writing his history by the light of a
lamp. Poor Robinson! While engaged in this
solitary business, he must often have recollected
the pleasant school-boy days when he sat at his
little desk, at his own quiet home, and wrote his '
themes or letters, little dreaming of the troubles
that awaited him in after times.

i p . long one, we cannot give an account
3' of every thing he mentions in his
' - own history, but must content our-

   

selves with noticing the most interesting circum-
stances.

It happened very fortunately for Robinson
that the island had no savage or venomous beasts
upon it, which was rather surprising for a spot
in the torrid zone. He found indeed wild cats
and wild goats, both of which he tamed, and
made of them a sort of companions. Besides
these, there were birds, some of them good for
food, and parrots, one of which he caught, and
taught it to call him by his name.

His provisions brought from the ship would
not have subsisted him more than a few months,
so that he was very glad to find supplies on the
island of some sort. He had the flesh and milk
of the goats, of whose skins he made himself
clothes; and he found grapes and wild fruits in
abundance. There were, besides, hares and
rabbits, and fish to be obtained occasionally
from the sea. Still he would have wanted corn
victuals, if he had not chanced to shake out one .
of the ship's bags in which a few grains had
remained. These sprang up and in time pro-
duced him all that he required for himself and
his goats. In the print you see him attending
those animals.
E have said that Robinson dug a
cave in the side of the bill. He
; found this so much more cool and

-- - comfortable in the heat of the day
than his tent, that he set to work to enlarge it
for a habitation at certain times. He worked
very hard at this for eighteen days, and had just
congratulated himself on the progress he had
made, when a great misfortune happened which
had very nearly put an end to all his adventures.
The earth from above tumbled down suddenly
and almost buried him beneath it! With much
difl'iculty he extricated himself, and then had all
his work to do over again; taking care now to
prop up the ceiling of his cave as he proceeded.
After this happened an earthquake, which made
poor Robinson quake, accompanied by a storm
which almost tore his tent from the ground.

' But a worse'misfortune than these, and onef'
rs from Illness.

,_ (Jam,
that alarmed him much more, was a dangerous
illness, an ague that attacked him and confined
him to his habitation many days, and which he
thought at one time would have ended fatally
See how deplorable he looks, with no attendants
near but his cats and his Poll-parrot!
T was some time before poor Ro-
binson recovered his usual health
7 and strength; he could do little
but wander slowly about, trusting
to Nature as his only physician.
When, however, he became quite well, he deter-
mined to make a more extensive survey of the
island than he had done before; so he set out
one fine morning with such provisions as he
could conveniently carry.

Wandering up by the banks of a brook, he
found many pleasant meadows, rich and verdant;
and in places were growing many splendid plants

 

. and flowers peculiar to the warm climates. The
chief of these were aloes, sugar--canes, tobacco-
plants and melons. Proceeding further, he came
to woods of mahogany and cedar, with vines and
grapes in abundance. When night came on, he
climbed into a tree as before: and this seems to
be the safest lodging in those countries for tra-
vellers on such occasions. The next morning
he proceeded and found the country still more
luxuriant and delightful, so that he could not
help feeling satisfaction at the thought that it
seemed to be all his own, and that without dis-
pute. Robinson travelled thus some miles, and
at length returned home laden with delicious
fruits.

for the future. So he enclosed a piece of ground,
dug it up with much labour, and sowed the grain
in the proper season. Do you know that the cli-
mate in the torrid zone has only two kinds of
weather to mark the year, the rainy season and
the dry: thus, it is rainy in our spring and autumn,
and dry during our summer and winter. The
first time he sowed his corn, he lost his crop for
want of knowing this: the dry season came, and
it was all parched up, and so perished. I think
Robinson Crusoe must have been very well quali-
fied to write a book of trades, he had to under-
take so many himself. We find him a sailor, fish-
erman, ship-builder, carpenter, farmer, grazier,
butcher, basket-maker, pot and pan maker, miller,

tailor, and twenty other things, and king of the

country at the same time. All this was very cu-

rious, and it is certainly entertaining enough to

read about; but Robinson would rather have been'
engaged in any one of those trades in England

and no king at all, than shut up in his lone island

with nobody but his cats and his parrot to speak

to.--What do you think of the matter?
flag? must now'enquire more particu-
larly how our friend Robinson pro-
ceeded in some of the employments
' >'just mentioned. ----Poor fellow! he
' tells us that he had no pots 01 pans to put and
ca1ry any liquid 1n, nor a basket to take provisions
with him on a journey. Luckily he found some
willow-trees, whose long boughs and tough twigs
enabled him to provide himself with baskets both
light and strong, though not perhaps very neat or
ornamental. He was more troubled to make
' pots and pans, and would have given several
pieces of his useless gold for a good pitcher and
a brown dish, such as in England we can get for
a few pence. However, he set to work; but he
says we should both pity and laugh were we to
see the awkward, misshapen things he made at
first. Why, his pots fell in and his pots fell
out with their own weight; and as for liquors,
they all preferred making the best of their way
out, to remaining confined in such ugly apart-
ments. But at length he found out the method
of forming these vessels better, and of hardening
them too; for, finding a piece of one of them
which had been in the fire accidentally baked as
hard as a stone, he took the hint, and building up
lighted embers round his pots, made them as solid

as he Wished.
OBINSON'S next concern was to pro-
, 1, cure the means of grinding or rather

   
 

whole. To construct a mill to grind
it, was out of the question; though I dare say the
island had both wind and water. It was needful
to devise some more simple machine, and he could
think of nothing better than a pestle and mortar.
He spent many a day endeavouring to find a great
stone big enough to hollow out for the purpose,
but was unsuccessful ; and probably if he had
obtained one, he could not have cut into it. At
last he procured a block of wood hard enough,
which he scooped out with fire and labour. It
was not very difficult to form a pestle, or heater,
with a heavy knob at the end of the same mate-
rial. There hc is, pounding away and quite busy.
I am afraid, with all his labour, his flour was very
coarse and husky, so that his bread and pud-
dings must have set him coughing sometimes.
What would not Robinson have given for a nice
little water-mill for grinding his com? I dare
say he would gladly have given all the gold in his '
possession.
00R Robinson had a laborious time
of it when he turned carpenter; for
7"though he had tiees enough, it cost
5' him weeks of toil to cut one down;

 

and then to make them into boards
witho--ut a saw was sad fatiguing work indeed.
He says he was forty-two whole days making one
long shelf for his cave; for he had to chop each
side flat with his axe, so that you see one tree
made but one board ; but a sawyer would in half
a day have cut out twenty or more. But he had
a more important project in his head than making
a shelf, or even a house. What could it be--did
he wish to build a church, or a castle, or a tower?
Try and think for him, and imagine what it was
he desired most of all, and at all times--yes, more
than all the comforts which a house replete with

every convenience could have supplied him in his
lonely island. Did he wish for books? No.

i
For music? No, he had the music of the birds.
For horses and dogs to hunt? No, he had means
of catching all the Wild animals on his island.

. SUPPOSE you must have guessed by
' _ this time that the thing Crusoe most
f' desired was a ship, or even a boat,
, to hear him, if not to England, at
, ' least to some land where there were

 

human beings to converse with ! Yes, that was
What he longed for--society. How thankful we
ought all to be for kind friends and relatives,
always at hand to aid or cheer us! Solitude is
the greatest punishment almost that can be in-
flicted on us in this life, and so Robinson found
it.

As he walked one day by the sea-side full of
these thoughts. he saw the large boat belonging to
the ship-wrecked vessel lying high up on the
beach, Where it had been cast, bottom upwards.
Now, if half-a--dozen men could but have lent him
a hand for a few minutes, they would have turned
it over and brought it to the sea, so as to have
floated off at high tide. But there was only poor
Robinson, who, although he got levers and rollers
from the wood, found that he could not move the
boat a foot! Then he set himself to dig away
the sand beneath it; and thus indeed he did alter '
the position of the boat, but still he was quite
unable to move it forward; so he was obliged to
give the old boat up after he had spent many days
about it.
 

had one ready for his use. But he thought difl'e-
rently ; and finding that there were no hopes of
managing the ship's boat, be resolved to try and
make one--he that had been seven weeks making
one single board ! But so intent was he on this
scheme, that he did not even reflect on the possi-
bility of conveying the new boat to the sea, from
the wood where the tree was to be felled. He
owns that he acted very much like a simpleton
in all this business. However, to work he went,
andeut down a cedar tree, almost six feet in
diameter--that is, in width straight across at the
bottom. It is most surprising that he could ever
fall such a tree ! He says he was twenty days
hewing and hacking at it to out it down ; fourteen
more getting the top and branches off. Then it
took him a month to shape the outside of the log
into something like the fashion of a boat, and
three months more to hollow it out with fire and '
labour.

So at last his boat was so far finished, and it
was big enough, he says, to have carried six-and-
twenty men ! In fact, he was quite delighted
with it; but does ~it not look odd to see him
admiring it so much, lying as it does in the midst
of a wood, not a bit of rippling ocean to be seen !
OBINSON tells us that he was highly
, delighted with his boat: but soon

L came the sad reflection that it was

1' not in, nor near the water; and it

_ L ' happened, unluckily, that between
the boat and the sea there was a hill! Now he
had no more power to move this boat than the
other, and the distance was greater. It seems
that he never thought of that. At first he tried
to cut the hill away ; but that was rather too much
for him, and there was 'no railway company to
undertake it. Then he thought to dig a canal or
dock to let the water up to the spot; and he cal-
culated that this would occupy him ten or twelve
years at least, there being only two excavators,
his right hand and his left, to perform the work.
This he thought was too much to attempt, and
so he gave up all thoughts of launching this boat,
which had pleased him so highly at first. When
he had finished this boat, he had been four years
on that lonely, unknown island !
-- ND now Robinson tells us a little-
of his condition. His clothes were
a nearly worn to rags; his beard re-
._/ ""5 . sembled that of the goats around
him ; his 'shoes and stockings were long ago
worn out, nor had he a hat to his head. As to
provisions, those obtained from the ship of course
were all gone; and what was worse, his powder
and shot, with which he procured game, were
nearly expended also. His ink too, with which
he wrote a daily account of his affairs, was almost
gone; and this want grieved him as much as the
others, some of which he could in a sort of way
supply. As for clothes, he managed pretty well
with his goat-skins and threads of the same to
botch himself up a suit; nay, more, he made an
umbrella of the same material to defend him from
the heat of the sun: and thus equipped, our en-

graving represents him walking about his island..-
'V In: _

Crusbgm his Dress of Skins.
His chief employments were, cultivating his
fields and garden ; gathering,- curing, and packing
his fruits; attending his tamed animals; procur- '
ing and dressing his food; with various other
operations and labours needful in his situation.
Finding, however, that he had still time on his
hands, his mind strangely reverted to his former
design of escaping if possible from the island.
.-- E therefore set about making a much
V smaller and more manageable boat

 
   
  

or canoe than the former one, and
this task he completed successfully
in about two years. He made a
mast and a sail out of the old ship's stores; and
having launched his little vessel, was delighted to
find that she sailed very well.

In this curious canoe Robinson made several.
short voyages of discovery about the island, and
at length resolved to go completely round it. So
he victualled his ship for the voyage, putting in
two dozen loaves of barley bread, an earthen pot
full of parched rice, a little bottle of rum, half a
goat, and some powder and shot, with mats and
skins to shelter him from the weather. He says
that it was on the 8th of November, in the 6th
year of his reign, or his captivity, that he em-
barked on this voyage, not without some appre-
hensions of the dangers to which he might be
exposed. He took a sort of leave of his various
dumb acquaintances at his departure from them;
See, he is now pushing off from the shore! Take
care, Robinson--your bark is but a frail one, I
fear :--I think you had better keep at home!
   
 
     

Afi" OBINSON, it seems, would sooner en-

: iii counter adventures, and even dangers,
' than have dull ease and safety. He
soon found that though the island
Mat-5' was not large, the ledges of rocks

 

 

about it forced him a good way out to sea, and
he narrowly escaped being thrown upon them.
When he had passed these, he came to a furious
current, that is, a driving rush of water in the
sea, such as you observe at the sluice of a water-
mill. He was now between the rocks and this
current, which he feared would carry away his
boat and overwhelm it. He continued beating
about here for two days, unable to return, the
Wind being contrary, and having only a choice
of dangers during that time. Then he thought
of his quiet but and cave on the island, and the
provision and other comforts there stored up,
and bitterly reproached himself for his restlessmu"

desire of change. He stretched forth his hand

towards the island, and said, " 0 happy, happy

spot,_I shall never see thee more! 0 miserable,
creature, whither am I going?" Now was he
being driven into the wide ocean, in despair of

ever reaching the land again. But just as he had

given himself up for lost, a breeze arose towards
the island. So on be spread his little sail and
plied his oars; and so in'the course of two or -
three hours he regained the island, and falling on
his knees when he had steppedashore, he de-
voutly thanked Almighty God for this great de-
liverance. 'He laid himself down in his cave to
refresh his weary limbs, and was not a little
startled by a voice, which said, " Robinson!
Robinson! where have you been ?"
WKOBINSON answered his parrot very
kindly, and, perhaps for want of
3 other cars, acknowledged to the bird
I ' "9 how very foolish he had been. He

  

1' now made himself more contented
at home, and set about improving his condition.
He made much better chairs and tables, pots and
pans, baskets, and other useful articles, than he
had at first. Then he determined to increase his
stock of goats as his powder and shot got low,
with which he had procured game. So he made
pitfalls for the Wild goats, in which at last he
caught as many as he required. He enclosed for ~
them a spacious meadow, and thus could ma-
nage them without inconvenience. His stock
increased so, that in about two years he had
nearly fifty goats, young and old. So he had
goat's flesh, and milk too, when he pleased.

See him now in his cave, sitting down to
dinner. There is his Poll-parrot on one Side,
looking very knowing, his two cats on the other,
looking very loving, and an old dog at his feet.
I wonder What he has got for dinner? I should
think goat-mutton, roast or boiled, and perhaps
some of his barley bread boiled in milk for a
pudding. Should you not like to dine with him?
, OBINSON wished very much that some
. one could have taken a sketch of
him, in his walking-dress, as he
strolled about the island. He has
' described it so, that the artist has, I
see, accomplished the task. We will explain it
in his own words. " I had a great, high, shape-
less cap, made of a goat's skin, with a flap hang-
ing down behind, as well to keep the sun from
me as to keep out the rain. I had a short jacket
of goat's skin, with long skirts; pantaloons of
the same shaggy material; of which also I had
socks or buskins, that supplied the place of shoes
and stockings. I had a broad belt, in loops of
which hung a saw and a hatchet; another belt,

 

having a pouch, swung over my shoulder, in
which I kept my powder and shot; at my back
I carried a basket, on my shoulder a gun, and
over my head a great clumsy thing made of goat's
skin, like an umbrella, to keep off the sun." So
much for the appearance and condition of our .
friend Robinson Crusoe: we must now attend to
other things, as new events soon opened upon
him. "It happened," says he, " one day about
noon, as I was walking on the shore, that I dis-
cerned, to my unSpeakable surprise, the plain
impression of a man's foot on the sand !"
. w}, oninsorz declares that he stood like
one thunderstruck; he listened. look-
'; ed around, mounted a hill, listened
again, but could perceive nothing
, 4 more. At length he sped home as
fast as his legs would carry him, fearing an
enemy at every turn. He skipped over the wall
of his enclosure and drew the ladder quietly
after him, and passed a sleepless night. Now
again he wished for that undisturbed solitude of
which he .had complained before. He wearied
his brain with conjectures as to who the persons
could be whose foot-marks he had seen, and
whencethey could have come. He continued in
this alarm some days, during which time he
scarcely dared to peep abroad. When he did so,
he saw nothing of any human beings ; but deter-
mined to render his dwelling more secure by
strengthening the fences round his dwelling, and
thus making them answer the purpose of fortifi-
cations to his little castle! He, however, passed
two years more without disturbance of any kind,
and the fear of enemies began to subside, till
again his solitude was his chief afiiiction.
_, V ND now poor Robinson thought he
' might venture abroad again without
apprehension, and was walking near

  

the sea-shore, as before, when a
l sight presented itself, which made his
hair stand on end with surprise and horror. The
shore was spread with skulls, hands, feet, and
other bones of human bodies; and there was a
hole dug in which had been a fire, and these
human bones, be perceived, had evidently been
roasted at it! Cannibals had been there! What
are cannibals? I must tell you--they are savage
and wicked men, who kill and devour one
another! Oh, how dreadful is the thought !--
Now I suppose you no longer wish to dwell on
Robinson Crusoe's island? Barbarous nations
there were in great numbers, who made a con-
stant practice of eating their enemies whenever
they could catch them. Oh, let us be thankful
that our lot is cast in a happy country, where no
such horrid doings are known. I am afraid we
must not say that the dreadful custom of feasting .
on human flesh is even now quite disused in all
parts of the world
OBINSON nearly fainted at the dread-
'. ful sight of these human remains,
I" and was in fact made ill by the ex-

__ :7 cess of his feelings and disgust.
When he regained his home, he endeavoured to
compose himself, and thanked God that he had
been brought up, not with such monsters, but in
civilized society. He was, however, not quite
so much alarmed on account of his own safety as
before; for as he had lived on the island eighteen
years, he knew that it was inhabited by no human
being but himself, and believed that the savages
only used the spot as an occasional retreat, for
the purpose of enjoying their inhuman repast in
greater security. He therefore contented himself
with avoiding generally that part of the island
where the savages had landed, and made himself
as snug and safe as he could in his own dwelling;
he loaded his guns and pistols, and kept much at
home: but one day, mounting the hill above his
cave, he plainly perceived a smoke at no great
distance, and thus it was evident that danger was
approaching him. He peeped through the bushes
a little further on, and saw nine savages dancing 1
round a fire, at which, he doubted not, the flesh
of human beings was then roasting! In a few
hours the savages took to their canoes, and then
Robinson carefully approached the spot they had
left. The remains of their feast were too horrid
to describe.

  

._

"mafia... Hal-
64 He, however, passed a year or two

3- without seeing any more of them.
But now a surprise of quite a difl'erent kind star-
tled him one day as he was musing in his cave.
It was the distinct sound of a ship's gun! He
started up instantly, and mounting the hill, look-
ed out to sea, and saw a flash of fire, soon fol~
lowed by the report of a second gun. Now he
felt convinced that there was some ship in dis--
tress out at sea--for, do you know, that when
they are in very great difficulty and danger out
at sea, and are afraid of being wrecked, they fire
guns every minute to inform any persons who
may be within hearing that help is wanted. Ro-
binson made a fire as a signal, which was soon
answered by another gun; he looked out, and
could just see an object out at sea, but the
weather was too hazy to discern in distinctly.
The next morning he looked out again, and then
saw plainly enough the wreck of a ship, cast away
on the same rocks as those on which himself had '
been thrown many years before!
' "HEN the sea was calm, Robinson
"1 rowed himself to the wreck, and
:- found that not a soul on board was
left alive. He obtained from the
vessel many articles of which he was much in
want, and made many voyages for that purpose

as he had done before.
Another year or two passed away, and Robin-
son continued as solitary as ever; but at length

  
  

it seemed as if he was to have company more
than enough, for he saw five canoes full of
savages approaching the island! He fetched the
telescope vvhich he had obtained from the ship,
and, climbing his hill of observation, he plainly
discerned about thirty persons sitting round a
fire, and two apparently bound ready to he killed!
One of these he presently saw, releasing himself
from his bonds, dart away from his enemies like
lightning towards the woods. With such amaz--
ing swiftness did he run, urged by hopes and
fears for his life, that he left his pursuers far
behind, and rapidly approached the spot where
Robinson was standing, who now thought it time
to interfere. He sprang in betWeen the pursuers '
and the pursued, and firing off, first a pistol, and
then a musket, so desperately alarmed the sa-
vages, who had never heard fire-arms before, and
who saw one of their companions drop dead, that
they immediately took to their canoes, and went
away as fast as they c0uld ply their oars.
" HE young savage who had escaped
' .. . from his enemies was not less
5",- .' alarmed than the rest, and fell flat
h on his face before Robinson, who
'_'gfi,=fldei!1lle , had much ado to soothe him and
to persuade him to rise.

You see this young savage would have been
killed and eaten in a very short time, if he had
not slipped his cords and run away. He seemed
very thankful to Robinson, though of course he
could not make himself understood by words;
and, to make short of it, Robinson found him a
very excellent companion and assistant, when he
had taught him a few things and a few words of ,
English. As it was on a Friday that Robinson
first saw him, he gave him that name, and you
will hear of him now as his man Friday! He
was very clever, expert, obedient, and attached to
his master; he soon learned the use of European, 1:3,!>>141 J.,ufl\.:.;.5.. .333"... {r 3...
implements, and could shoot game with a gun
exceedingly well. Robinson taught him the
principles of religion, made him abhor the savage
practices of his own nation, and, in fact, educated
him and civilized him completely in the course '
of time-
  

SS some years together Without any
particular adventure. It was one
morning in the year which was the
twenty--seventh of Crusoe's captivity in the
island, that Friday perceived a number of canoes
full of savages approaching the island. The
young man was dreadfully frightened, thinking
they were come to seek for him and eat him up;
but Robinson comforted him, and promised to
defend him. When the savages had sat down
on the shore, it was soon evident that they were
come on their old errand, and meditated another
horrid feast. So Robinson and Friday each
took as many guns as they could carry, and de-
termined to put a stop to such dreadful proceed-
ings. They approached as near as they could
without being discovered, and could see plainly
about twenty savages feasting away, and two<<'~ . .. J ', "fifl'jrfi'fi

wretched ones bound ready to be killed. Then
Robinson determined to fire their guns at the
savage men. This they repeated until two or
three of the savages were killed, many wounded,
and the rest most dreadfully frightened, not '
knowing whence this attack proceeded. In great
consternation they jumped up and took to their
boats, leaving their prisoners still bound on the
shore. One of these, it appeared, was a white
man, a Spaniard, who jumped for joy at his de-
liverance, so happy and so unexpected. Who
do you think the other was? I will tell you

presently.
HE other intended victim, thus sur-
, i prisingly released, was an old man,
at whom Friday gazed at first with
-;f intense earnestness, and at length,

 

lushing towards him, clasped 1n his arms his own
father ! It 1s impossible to describe the mutual
joy of parent and child on this occasion. Friday
danced about him and showed the utmost degree
of filial duty and afi'ection. He rubbed his be-
numbed hands, brought him drink and food, and
had the satisfaction of seeing his father's activity
at length restored. Robinson was scarcely less
surprised and pleased at this strange event; and
now questioned the Spaniard, and found that he
too had been cast away, but not on an unin-
habited land. He had lived some time with the
natives, when they were attacked and overpower;
ed by a neighbouring tribe, who took himself and
many others prisoners, who would all have been
devoured had they not been delivered by Robin-
son and his man Friday. Very thankful they
were for their escape, and for the food and shel--
ter Robinson gave them. He might now indeed
call himself a king, having subjects three in
number, who acknowledged his authority: but
we have more events presently to relate.
visitors now poured in on Robin-
}' son. One morning his man Friday
ran and told him that a canoe, such
.5: as he had never seen before, was in
. I' sight and rowing towards them. Ro-
binson 'soon perceived that they were Europeans
---yes--and how great was his joy to find that
they were English too! Yet he had his fears
that these people could be after no good, and
there had been no storm to injure any vessel.
So Robinson kept on his guard, and now saw
plainly an English ship at anchor at no great
distance. The boat drew to shore, the men
landed, and bore on their shoulders three persons
bound as prisoners. Robinson soon found out

 

what was the nature of the case, and being a
man of courage, determined, if possible, to re--
lease these prisoners as he had done the others.
' Whilst, therefore, the sailors were absent ranging181
in the woods, he and Friday approached, and un-
binding the men, who were utterly astonished at
their deliverers, bade them defend themselves
and put arms in their hands. These three with 1
Robinson and his companions made seven in all,
who, finding the sailors in the woods drunk or
asleep, came on them unawares, bound them all
- with cords, and so made them prisoners in turn!
--Was not that well done '1
  
  

CANNOT describe the surprise and
) alarm of these men at finding them-
' , i selves bound fast, and their pri-
soners released; but they were
._ :1? obliged to submit. The fact is,
these sailors were mutineers,----that is, they had
rebelled against the captain and the ofl'icers of
their ship, and had brought them to this island
for the purpose of leaving them to perish; but
you see their violent doings were overruled
against them. They now implored mercy, for
they knew they were in the power of their of-
ficers again and had deserved to die. Their cap-
tain referred all to Robinson, whom they made
judge in this business. He said he could not
promise them what he would do for two or three
days--then they would find out his intentions.
This was very cleverly managed ; for the people
in the ship, wondering that their companions didm

not return, sent another boatful to the island,
leaving only two or three in the vessel. When
Robinson and his men saw them coming, they
hid themselves; and as soon as the men stepped
ashore, they rushed upon them so suddenly and "
with such resolution, that they mastered them
every one, and took possession of both their
boats.
matteis so well that they got pos--
V Xsession of the ship, and granted the
'men thcii lives on condition that the

A, 7] w01st of them should 1emain on the
island, and the others return to their duty and
work the ship hack to England. And so you
see Robinson had an opportunity of returning to
his native land at last. He and his man Friday
took leave of the island and brought the Spa-
niard away with them. Friday's father went back
to his own country, and the rest of the English
sailors took possession 'of Robinson's island with
his permission. He arrived in England after
thirty years' absence, and found very few of his
relatives alive. Robinson was so fortunate as
to dispose of his plantations in the Brazils for a

great deal of money, with which he bought a
farm in England, Friday still continuing hisd.

most faithful servant. I find that Robinson
some years after paid his island a visit, regulated
matters there, and again returned to England,
where he died, at a good old age.

 

THE END.
