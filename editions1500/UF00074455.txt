covered a waywardness of. temper-that gave
much uneasiness to his parents; whilst an
early propensity to the sea rendered his
employment irksome. At length an inci-

1I WAS BORN in the eity
of York, in the year 1632.
' My father's right name
'3 was Krentznn'er, and he
-. had come toEnglnnd from

' ' , s "I" letions were named Robin.
son, so I was named Robinson Kreutznaer.
The English people called it Grusoe, and
after a while we came to write it so.

My father was not rich, but he had
become well to do by trading, and he
wished me to stay, at home and be happy ,
and all the more because both he and my
mother were getting old, and further, be-
cause one of my elder brothers had been

 

   

 

killed in the war with the Spaniards, and
the other had gone away from home and
had not been heard from; but I would be
satisfied with nothing but going to sea,
and my inclination to this led me so
strongly against the will of my father, and
against all the entleaties of my mother
that there seemed to be something fatal in
myperversity, tending directly to the life
of misery which was to befall me. .
One morning, my father called me into
his chamber, where he was sick with the
gout, and talked to me very seriously
about it; He told me that if I staidet
home, I had a prospect of raising my
tor-tunes and living a life of happinessontheunehand,orthe verydespcrateon

of going abroad. But in a. few days my

resolutions were all given up and. I

e.
One day, being at Hull, I met one of my _
companions who was going by sea to Lon-
don, and he invited me so strongly to go
with him that I consulted neither father
nor mother any more, nor so much as sent
them word of it; but leaving them to hear .
0' it as they might, without asking God's
blessing, or my father's, without any con-
sideration of circumstances or consequences,
and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 1st
of September, 1661, I went on board a ship,
bound for London.

Never any young adventurer's misfor

_ tunes, I believe, began sooner or continued

most frightful manner; and, as I had never
been at sea. before, I was most inexpressibly
sick in body, and terrified in mind. I
began now seriously to reflect upon what I
had done, and how justly I was overtaken
by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked
leaving my father's house, and abandoning
my duty. All the good counsels of my
parents came now fresh into my mind; and
my conscience, which was not yet come to
the pitch of hardness to which it has come
since, reproaohed me with the contempt of
advice, and the breech of my duty to God
and my father.

I thought that every wave would swallow
us up, and that every time the ship fell
into the hollow or trough of the sea, it
would never rise again. In this agony of
mindI made many vows and resolutions,

itintonship again while I lived; that I
would take his advice, and never run my-

self into such miseries as these my more.

I had these wise and good thoughts as
long as the storm lasted, and, indeed, for
some time after. But the next day, the
wind abated and the sea. gnaw calmer, and
a fine evening followed. My see-sickness
and my fears disappeemd, and with them
all my thoughts of home and. duty. The
sun rose clear the next morning], and his
benms shining upon the sen which was

looking with wonder upon the son that WM'
so rough and terrible the day before, and.
could be so calm and so pleasant in so little

solutions should continue, my companion
who had enticed me away comes to me

" Well, Bob," says he, clapping: me upon
the shoulder, "how do you do after it? I
warrant you were frightened, \ver'u't was
last night, when it blew but a capful of
wind 2" "

"A capful d'you call it?" said I; "(Mes
a terrible storm.""A storm, you foot 1" replies he; "do you
call that a storm? why, it was nothing at
all; give us but a. good ship and searoom,
and we think nothing of such a squall of
wind as that; but you're but a fresh-water
sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of
punch, and well forget all that."

To make short this sad part of my story,
we went the way of all sailors! ; the punch
was made, and I was made half-drunk with
it; and in that one night's wickedness I
drowned all my repentance, all my reflec-
tions upon my past conduct, all my resolu-
tions for the future. In a word, as the sea

. was returned to its smoothness, so the
' hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears
of being swallowed up by the sea being
forgotten, and the current of my former
desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows
and promises that I made inmydistmss.

ROBINSON C'RUSOE.

I found, indeed, some intervals of refleo
tion; and the serious thoughts did, as it
were, endeavor to return again sometimes;
but I shook them of, and roused myselt
from them, and applying myself to drink-
ing and company, soon mastered the return
of those fits. But I was to have another
trial for it 'still ; and Providence, as in such
cases generally it does, resolved to leave me
entirely without excuse; for if I would
not take this for a deliverance, the next
was to be such a one as the worst and most
hardened wretch among us would confess
both the danger and the mercy.

The sixth day of our being at sea, we
came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind
having been contrary, and the weather
calm, we had made but little way since the
storm. Here we were obliged to. come to
an anchor, and here we lay, the wind col.
tinuing contrary, for seven or eight days,
during which time a great many shipe'from
Newcastle came into the same Roads.

We had not, however, rid here so long _
but we should have tided it up the river, '
but that the wind blew too fresh, and,
afterwe had lain four or five days, blew
very hard. However, the Roads being
reckoned as good as an harbor, the nuchon
ago good, and our ground-tackle very
strong, our men were unconcerned, and not
in the least apprehensive of danger, but
spent the time in rest and mirth, after the
manner of the sea. But the eighth day, in
the morning, the wind increased, an" we
had all hands at work to strike our top.
masts, and make everything snug and close
that the ship might ride as easy as possible.
By noon the sea went very high indeed,
and our ship rode forecastle in" shipped
W

severe! seas, and we thought once or twice
our anchor had come home; upon which
our master-o rdred out the sheetanchor.
The storm grew fiercer and fiercer until
I began to see terrorinthe facesof the
seamen themselves. At first, I was quite
stupid with sickness and fear, and I lay in
the cabin; but now I olsmbered on deck,
and looked about. Two of the ships near us
had cut their masts, and I heard the sailors

say that two more had been blown out to
sea. Finally a great ship foundered before
our eyes, and the master ordered our masts
'-to be cut away. Then came a. cry that we
--hsd sprung a, leak, and we all went to
work at the pumps.

; All our efiorts were uselem; the water
:f'gained rapidly in the hold, and it beeame-
certain that we could not ride out the

'80!!!>> Guns were now fired as signals of

distress, and, the storm somewhat abetting,
a bom_ as put off to us from a ship that
had not been damaged, because she was
light. We had great difliculty in getting
into the boat when it reached us; but we
did it safely and after several hours of
drifting, in danger of being swamped every
minute, we reached the shore, drenched
and destitute. The ship sank soon after
we left her.

 

 

At Yamouth, we were given some money,
and I might easily have gone back to Hull,
but my ill fate pushed me on. With wlmt'
money I had, I made my way to London.
There I fell in with the master of a. ship
bound for the coast of Guinea on a trading
voyage. He took quite' a fancy to me at
once and became my friend. I raised some
forty pounds by corresponding with some
relations, and investing it in trinkets. such

much canvas as our yards would spread, or

the pirate gained upon us, we prepared to
fight, our ship having twelve guns and the
rogue eighteen. About three in the after
noon he came up with us, and bringing to,
by mistake, just athwart our quarter, we
brought eight of our guns to bear on that

what things to buy in London, and then
how to trade them with the natives of
Guinea for g-old dust. On the voyage, he
taught ine the use of the ship's instruments,
by which an account of our course was
taken every day, and I became a navigator
as well as a Guinea trader.

My friend died soon atm- his arrival at
home, but I resolved to go the same voy-
age again on the same ship. This was a
most unhappy voyage, for though I left a
good portion of my money with myfriend's
widow, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes
flan like, an cleared our deck of them
intrice. However, to cut short thismelan-
nholy part of our story, our ship being die
Jabled, and three of our men killed, and
gieight wounded, we were obliged to yield,
tpnd were all carried prisoners into Belles,

"by the captain as his proper prize, and
made his slave, being young and nimble,
and fit for his business. At this surpris-
'mg change of my circumstances, from a
merchant to a slave, I was perfectly over-
whelmed; and now I looked back upon
.my father's prophetic discourse to me, that
:1 should be miserable; which I thought
hams now so efiectnelly brought to pass,
Ethat I could not be worse; for now the
ehund of heaven had overtaken me, and I
was undone. But else! this was but a
game of the misery I was to gothrough.
5i As my new patron, or master, had taken
fine house to his house, so I was in hopes
glint he would take me with him when he
'iwent to sea again, believing that it would
nne time or other be his fate to be taken
{3' a man-of-war, and that then I should
lhe set at liberty. But this hope of mine
has soon taken away; for when he went
to son, he left me on shore to look after his
'litllc garden, and do the con <<on drudgery

"'1 had no one to tad: to, for, though
there were other slaves, not one of them

thought of nothing but my escape. But
for a long time no means of escaping pie
sented itself.

After about two years, my master stayed
at home longer than usual, and two or
threetimeseweek he used to goont
e-fishing in his boat. He always took me
and a young Moresco, besides a Moor, with

 

him, for we made him very merry, and I
was very dexterous in catching fish.

It happened one time, that, going hfish-
ing with him in a calm morning, a fog rose
sothick, that though we were not half a

league from the shore, we lost sight of it;
and rowing we knew not whither, we

labored all day and all the next night; and

when the morning came, we found we had

mum in the warden or grinding grain. I pulled out to sea instead of pulling in for
   
   

Moor to take me and the young Moreseo,
whose name was Xury, and go and cater:
some fish, as he expected some distinguished
company to sup with him. Now, thought
I, is my chance to get my liberty.
Myfirst contrivance was to speak to the
Moor and ask him if we ought not to take
along some food for our dinner; for I told
him we must not presume to eat of our
master's bread He said that was true; so

the shore. However, we got well in again,
though with a great deal of labor and some
danger, and we were all very hungry. But
our master, warned by this disaster, resolv~
edtotakemorecareofhinselfin the
future; and having lying by him the long
boat of our English ship which he had
teken, he resolved he would not go a-fish-
ing any more without a compass and some
provision. So he ordered the carpenter of

 

his ship to build a little cabin in the he brought a basket full of their kind, and

same time, I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, and thus fur-
' nished with everything needful, we sailed
out of the port to fish.

hook I would not pull them up, that he

He, thinking no harm, agreed, and, being
in the head of the boat, set the sails; and,
as I had the helm, I ran the boat out near
a league farther, and then brought her to,
as if I would fish; when, giving the boy
the helm, I stepped forward to where the
Moor was, and making as if I stooped for16

He rose immediately, for he swam like a

hitched a iowling-pieee from the cabin,

  
    

and pointing it at him. said: "You can
swim well enough to reach the shore. If
you try to get in the boat, I will shoot
you." He turned about when he saw I
was determined, and swam toward the
shore, which I have no doubt he leached
in safety.

When he was gone, I turned to the boy,
and said. to him, "Xm'y, if you will be
faithful to me, I'll make you a great man;
but if you will not stroke your face to be
true to me," that is, swear by Mahomet
and his father's board, "I must throw you
into the sea, too." The boy smiled in my
focaandspoksso innocentlydht Ieould

 

 

not mistrust him, and swore to be faithful
to me, and go all over the world with me.

As long as the swimming Moor could
see me, I steered the boat straight out to
sea, for I knew he would tell his master
which way I had gone. But as soon as
I thought the boat was out of his sight,
I turned her head to the south-east.
With a good breue and a smooth sea, at
three o'clock on the afternoon of the next
day, I had no doubt that we were one
hundred and fifty miles from Sallee. At
this fime we were within sight of the
coast, and I knew that we werewere out
of the kingdom of the Moors.

But so afraid was I of being followed
by my late master, that we sailed on
toward the south for five days, without
stopping. At the close of the fifth day,
we anchored at the mouth of a little river;

. but Iwasafioid togo on shore forfearot

the wild heasts,which inhabit that coast
in great numbers. They made hideous
noisa in the night, and sometimes we could
sea creatures bathing on the beach.
Oneotthemswamofitoward the boat,
but ashot from a fowling-piece sent him
quickly back to the shore.

However, we had to go on shore for
water, for we had not a pint left, so, the
next doy,we drew theboatin asclosess
we could, and waded ashore, taking our
fowling-pieces and two jars. I staid by
the boat, while Xury soon found some
water and filled the jars. He also shot a
hare, which we roasted on the shore, and
had quite a feast. .

Several times I was obliged to land for
fresh water, after we had left this place;
andareeinpertieuhr, being early in the
 

morning, we came to an anchor under a
" little point of land. Xury, whose eyes
7 wele more about him than it seems mine
~ were, calls softly to me, and tells me that we
'had best go farther ofi the shore; "for,"

'says he, "look, yonder lies a dreadful
'monster on the side of that hillock, fast
asleep." I looked where he pointed, and
:i'szuv a terrible great lion that lay on the

:side of the shore, under the shade of a
(piece of the hill. I tool: our biggest gun,
and loaded it with a good charge of pow-
der, and with two slugs, and laid it down;
then I loaded another gun with two bul-
lets; snd the third (for we had three
pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets.
[took the best aim I could with the first
piece to have shot him in the head, but he

 

1?

lay so, with his leg raised a little above
his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about
the knee, and broke the bone. He started
up, growling at first, but finding his leg
broke, fell down again; and then got up
upon three legs, and gave the most hideous V
roar that ever I heard. I took up the
second piece inunediately, and though he
began to move off. fired again, and shot '

 

 

him in the head, and had the pleasure to
see him drop.

This was game indeed to us, but this
was no food; and I was very sorry to lose
three ehsrges of powder and shot upon a
creature that was good for nothing to us.
I hethought myself, however, that perhaps
the skin of him might, one way or other,
he of some value to us. So Xury and l
 

went to work with him; but Xury was devour the flesh, making signs to offer me
much the better workman at it, for I knew some. I shook my head, but signified that
very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us I would take the skin, if they would put it
both the whole day, but at last we got off on the shore and go away. This they did,
the hide of him, and spreading it on the and I sent Xury for it. They also left on

 

top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried I the shore a great jar of water and some

it in two days' time,' and it afterwards
served me to lie upon.

After sailing on for twelve days more I
found that the land was inhabited by
negroes,who Jan along the shore and made
signs to us. As I thought them savages, I
did not venture to go on shore. One day
a great leopard ran down among them to
the water, at which they were greatly
frightened. When I shot him, they were
greatly surprised and very grateful. They
Quickly took ofi' the skin and began to

dried roots and corn for which I was
thankful

I sailed on for eleven days more without
going near the shore till I saw the land run
out a great way into the sea. This I took
to be Cape de Verde. 0n sailing out to
the point of the Cape, I saw land for out
to sea which I thought was the Cape de-
Verde Islands. I stepped into the cabin
and was thinking whether I ought not to
sail for the Islands when I heard Xurycry
out: "Master, master, a ship with a sail."
 
 

I rushed from the cabin andfonnqury
lin a great fright, he thinking that it must
needs be a ship of his old master, the
ipirate. I saw, however, that it was a
, Portuguese ship, and I crowded all sail to
ieome up to her, and was soon on board.
- Upon hearing my story, the captain
heifer-ed to take me to the Brazils, whither
e was going, without any pay whatever, and
take all my goods also. He ofieredto
2' 've me a good sum for my boat, which I
S'Mcepted.' He wanted also to buy Xury,
"but I was 10th to sell the boy's liberty as
soon as he had gained it. But as he ofiered
to set him free in ten years and totneat
him well, and, moreover, Xury being will-
ing, I let the Captain have him.
We made a good voyage to the Brazils,
landing in All Saints' Bay in twenty-two
Idays. The generous treatment the captain
gave me, I can never enough remember. He
j would take nothing of me for my passage,

 

Vt

utensils and things as I wanted; which he
did,and broughtthem tomon his nus
voyage

I was now very prosperous and happy,
but I was not to remain so. I often talked

to the planters about me of my voyage to
the coast of Guinea, and how easy it waste
trade with the natives for gold-dust, or
even for slaves which were very dear in

me and proposed, that, as there was noth-

our plantations, they would fit out a ship
to go to the coast of Guinea for slaves, and
that I would take charge of the afiair. Al-I'

especially little looking-glasses, hive;
scissors, hatchets, and the like.

We had very good weather, snd~we
snilednorth,atfirst,along our own coast
We passed the line in about twelve days'
time, and were, by our last observation, in
seven degrees twenty-two minutes north
latitude, when a violent tornado took us
quite out of our knowledge. It blewin
each a, tem'ble manner, that for twelve
days together we could do nothing but
drive, and, scndding away before it, let it
carry us wherever fate and the fury of the
waves directed; and during these twelve
days, I need not say that I expected every
dayto be swallowed up; nor did any in
the ship expect to save their livu

tore we could make out whether it was a
island or the mainland, the ship struck on
the send a long distance from the shore.
Now, we were in a dreadful condition u.
deed, and had nothing to do but to think
of saving our lives as best we could. We
had a boat at our stern just before the
storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder, and in the next
place she broke away, and either sunk or

i was driven off to sea; so there was no hope

from her. We had another boat on board,
but how to get her off into the sea was a
doubtful thing; however, there was no
room to debate, for we fancied the ship'
would break in pieces every minute, and

some told us she was actually broken

already.

In this distress, the mate 'of our vessei
lay hold of the boat, and with the help of
the rest of the men, they got her flung over
the ship's side; and getting all into her, let
go, and committed ourselves, being eleven

 

in number, to God's mercy and the wild
sea; for though the storm was abated con-
siderably, yet the sea went dreadfully hid
upon the shale.
 

And now we all saw plainly that the
boat could not escape, and that we should
bedrowued. As to making sail,we had
none, nor, if we had, could we have done
anything with it; so we worked at the oar

gknew that when the boat came near the
shore she would be dashed in a thousand

was nothing of this appeared; but as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land
looked more frightful than the sea.

At last, a great wave came rolling after
us, overset the boat, and we were all swal-
lowed up in a moment. Nothing can de
scribe what I felt when I sank into the
water; for though I swam very well, yet I

were committed our souls to God in the most
@amest manner.

5 What the shore was, whether rock or
land, whether steep or shoal, we knew not;
the only hope was that we might happen
into some buy or gulf, or the mouth of some
river, \\ here by great chance we might run
jour boat' in under the lee of the land, and

could not deliver myself iron: the waves so
as to draw breath, till that wave having
driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way
on towards the shore, and having spent
itself, went back, and left me upon the land
almost dry, but half dead with the water I
tool: in. I had so much presence of mind,
as well as breath left, that seeing myself
nearer the main land than I expectedlgotupon my feet' and ran.
Another wave soon over-
took me and then another, until I was
dashed against a rock with such force as to
make me nearly senseless.

I held on to the rock, however, until the
wave receded, and the next run I took I
got to the mainland, exhausted and bruised,
and, indeed, more dead than dive.

But I was now landed, and safe on
shore, and began to look up and to thank
God that my life was saved. I walked
about the shore, lifting up my hands, and
my whole being, I may say, wrapt up in
a contemplation of my deliverance; mak-
ing a. thousand gestures and motions, which
I cannot describe; reflecting upon all my
comrades that were drowned, and that
there should not be one soul saved but
myself; for, as for them, I never saw them
afterwards, or any sign of them, except
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes
that were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel,
when, the breach and froth of the sea
being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay
so far off, and considered, Lord! how was

All the remedy that oifered to my
thoughts, at that time, was to get up into,
a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny!
which grew near me, and where I resolved,
to sit all night, and consider the ne.\1.
day what death I should die, for as yet
saw no prospect of life. I walked abou,
a furlong from the shore, to see if I cook

my lodging; and being excessively fatigue-2
 

I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as, I believe, few could have done in my
condition, and found myself morerefreshed
with it than I think I ever was on such an

occasion.

When I waited up it was broad day-
iight, the weather clear, and the storm
abated. so that the sea did not rage and
swell as before; but that which surprised
me more was, that the ship was lifted of
"in the night from the sand where she lay,
by the swelling of the tide, and was driven
up almost as far asthe rock which I at first
mentioned, where I had been so bruised

where I was, and the ship seemingto stand

upright still. I wished myself on board,

that at least I might save some necessary

When I came down from my apartment

the first thing I found was the boat, which

While I was doing thin, I found the tide

lengths, and added them to my raft, with a

great deal of labor and pains. But the -

hope of furnishing myself with necessaries ._

encouraged me to go beyond what I should
have been able to have done upon another
occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear " .

any reasonable weight. My next care was
what to load it with, and how to preserve
what I had laid upon it from the surf of

the sea: but I was not long considering '

this.

I first laid all the planks or boards upon
it that I could get, and having considered
well what I most wanted, I first got three
of the seamen's chests, which I had broken

open and emptied, and lowered them down "

upon my raft; the first of these I filled
with provisions--Vin, bread, rice, three
Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's
\flesh (which we lived much upon), and a
little remainder of European corn, which
had been laid by for some fowls which we
brought to sea with us, but the fowls were
killed. There had been some barley and
wheat together; but, to my great disap-
pointment,I found afterwards that the rats
had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors,
I found several cases of bottles belongin

the mortification to see my coat, shin. and
waistcoat, which I had left on the shore
upon the sand, swim away. As for my
breeches, which were only linen, and open-
kneed,I swam on board inthem and my
stockings.

However, this put me upon rummaging
for clothes, of which I found enough, but
took no more than what I wanted for pre
sent use, for I had other things which my
eye was more upon; as. first, tools to work
with on shore; and it was after long

chest, which was indeed a. veryuseful prize
to me, and much more valuable than a ship-
1ading of gold would have been at that
time. I gotit down to my raft, whole as
it was, without losing time to look into it,

the point where I had landed before, by
which I perceived that there was an in-
draft of the water. This led me to think
that there might be a creek or river there;
and so I found there was.

I steered my raft toward it as well as I
could. At the mouth of the little creek I
came very near snfi'ering a second ship-
wreck, which, I verily believe, would have

<<a>>- broken my heart. The raft ran on a shoal,

 

My next care was for. some ammunition
and arms. There were two fowling-pieces
in the cabin, and two pistols. These I
secured first, with some powder-horns, and
two old, rusty swords. I knew there were
three barrels of powder in the ship and,
with much search, I found them; two of
them were dry and good, and these I got
to my raft, with the arms.

And now I thought myself pretty well
freighted, and I began to think how I
should get to shore with all my things,
having neither sail, oar, nor rudder, and
the least pufi of wind would have overset
my raft. But the sea was calm, the tide
was setting toward the shore, and what
little wind there was, blew in thath
tion. I found, however, two or three
broken oars, and with these I put to sea.

The raft went very well; but I found
that the tide took me some distance from

of powder; and thus armed, I traveled PS0:-

and nearly upset. I held all the things
their places, and when the tiderose a little

- h1gher,1t floated safely off. I landed at
' high tide, when the ywater covered the

bank, and when it receded, the raft was

high and dry.

My next work was to view the country,
and seek a proper place for my habitation.
and where to stow my goods, to seem
them from whatever might happen. When .'
I was, I yet knew not; whether on the,
continent or an island; whether inhabited ,
or not inhabited; whether in danger of
wild beasts or not.

There was a hill not above a mile from
me, which rose up very steep and high,
and which seemed to overtop some other
hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, north
ward. I took out one of the fowling:
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a hon'
discovery up to the top of that hill, where!
after I had with great labor and diflicultyl .
got to the top, I saw my fate, to my giea: '-
afiliction--viz, that I was in an islanc:
environed every way with the sea ni-
land to be seen except some rocks, whicgv>>
lay a great way of, and two small island:-
lees than this, which lay about thre
leagues to the west.
 

 

I found also that the island I was inwas At my coming back, I shot a! 3 gm

believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, the side of a. great wood. I believe it was
of which, however, I saw none. Yet I saw the first gun that had been fired there
abundance of fowls, but knew not their since the creation of the world. I had no
kinds; neither, when I killed them, could sooner fired, but from all partsof the wood
[tell what was fit for food and what not. there arose an innumerable number a
  

 

 

fowls of manyaorln, making a confused
screaming and crying, every one according
to his usual note, but not oneof them of
any kind that I knew. As for the creature
Ikilled,ItookittobeakindoPShawk,its
color and beak resembling it, but it had no
talons or claws more than common. Its
flesh was can-ion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came
back to my raft, and fell to work to bring
my cargo on shore, which took me all the
rest of the day. What to do with myself
at night I knew not, nor indeed where to
rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the
ground, not knowing but some wild beast
might devour me, though, as I afterwards

found, there was really no need for those
fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricaded
myself round with the cheats and boards
that I had brought on shore, and made a
kind of hut for that night 'slodging. As
for food, I yet saw not which way to sup
ply myself, except that I had seen two or
three creatures, like hares, run out of the
wood where I shot the fowl.

I now began to consider that I might
yet get a great many things out of the
ship, which would be useful to me, and
particularly some of the rigging and sails,
and such other things as might come to
land; and I resolved to make another voy-
age on board the vessel. if possible. And
as I knew that the first storm that bleu
must newssarily break her all in pieces, L
resolved to set all other things apart, til] i
got everything out of the ship that I could
get. Then I called a council--that is to
say, in my thoughts--whether I should
take back the raft; but this appeared iru
practicable; so I resolved to go as before,
when the tide was down; and I did so,
., only that I stripped before I went from my ;
' . hut, having nothing on but a chequeredl
shirt, 3 pair of linen drawers, and a pair oil
' pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and;

.\ ll these I secured, together with awe when I came towards it, ran away a: little

ml things belonging to the gunner, particu- distance, and then stood still. She sat very

lnrly

two or three iron crows, and two composed and unconcerned, and looked full

panels of musket bullets, seven muskets, in my face, as if she had a mind to he
and another fowling piece, with some small acquainted with me. I presented my gun

 

to her, but, as she did not understand it,
she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor
did she offer to stir away; upon which I
tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, by the
way, I was not very free of it, for my store
was not great; however, I spared her a bit,
I say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and
ate it, and looked (as pleased) for more;
but I thanked her, and could spare no
more, so she marched off.

Having got my second cargo on shore--
though I was obliged to open the. barrels of
powder, and bring them by parcels, for they
were too heavy, being large melts--I went
to work to make me a little tent, with the
soil, and some poles which I cut for that
purpose; and into this tent I brought
everything that I knew would spoil either
with rain or sun; and I piled all the empty

quantity of powder more; a large bag-full chests and casks up in a. circle round the
of small shot, and a great roll of sheet lead; tent, to fortify it PS10m any sudden attempt,

but this last was so heavy I could not
hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.
Besides these things, I tool: all the men's
clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-
ltop sail, a hammock, and some bedding;
and with this I loaded my second raft, and
brought them all safe on shore, to my very
great comfort.
. 'I was under some apprehension during
my absence from the land, that at least my
provisions might be devoured on shore;
but when I came back, I found no sign of
any visitor; only there sat a creature like a
wild cat, upon one of the cheats, which,

either from man or beast.

When I had done this, I blmkcd up the
door of the tent with some lmanls within,
and an empty chest set up on end without;'ca.'

and spreading one of the beds upon the
ground, laying my two pistols just at my
head, and my gun at length by me, I went
to bed for the first time, and slept very
quietly all night. I was very weary and
heavy; for the night before I had slept
little, and had labored hard all day, as
well to fetch those things from the ship, as
to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds
now that ever was laid up, I believe, forone
man; but still I was not satisfied. for-while

 

 

the ship stood upright in that posture, I
thought I ought to get everything out of
her I could. So every day, at low water, I
went on board, and brought away some.
thing or other; but particularly the third
time I went, I brought away as much of
the rigging as I could, as also all the small
rope and rope twine I could get, with a
piece of spare canvas, which was to mend
the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of
wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought
away all the sails, first and last; only that

as much at a time as I could, for they were
no more useful to me for sails, but as mere
canvas only.

But that which comforted me more still,
was, that at last of all, after I had made
five or six such voyages as these, and
thought I had nothing more to expect from
the ship that was worth my meddling with
---I say, after all this, I found a great hogs-
lread of bread, three large runlets of run)
or spirits, a box of fine sugar, and a. barrel
of fine flour; this was surprising to me, be
cause I had given over expecting any more
provisions except what was spoiled by the
water. I soon emptied the lrogshead of the
bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel,
in pieces of the sails, which I crrt out; and,
in a word, I got all this on shore also,
though at several times.

The next day I made another voyage, and
now, having plundered the ship of what
was portable, I cut up the cable in pieces
that I could lift, and gathered all the iron
work that I could move. I cut up the
yards and made a raft to take it all ashore,
but when I got into the little cove, the raft
upset and my load all went to the bottom
However, when it was low water, I got the
most of it out.

If it had remained calm, I verily believe
that I would have cut up the whole ship
and got it ashore. The twelfth time that
I went on board, I found some money and
some knives. The former was of no worth
to me, but I took it, and as the wind begin
to rise I hurried on shore. It blew very
hard that night, and in the morning then
was no more ship to be seen.

I now began to think of securing myseli

I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring against wild beasts and savages, by build
 

 

ing a dwelling, and I resolved to make me
both a tent and a cave, and I set about
finding a more healthy and suitable spot
than where I then was.

-I consulted several things in my situa-
tion, which I found would be proper for
me: first, health and fresh water; secondly,
shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly,
security from ravenous creatures, whether
man or beast; fourthly, a View to the sea,
that if God sent any ship in sight, I might
not lose any advantage for my deliverance,
of which I was not willing to banish my
expectation yet.

In search of a place proper for this, I
found a little plain on the side of a rising
hill, whose front towards this little plain
was steep as a house side, so that nothing
could come down upon me from the top.
On the side of the rock there was a hollow
place, worn a little way in, like the en-
trance or door of a cave; but there was
not Jeally any cave, or way into the rock,
at all.

On the flat of the green, just below this
hollow place, I resolved to pitch my tent.

 

 

end of it, descended irregularly every way,
down into the low ground by the sea-side.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-
circle before the hollow place, and in this
halfcircle I pitched two rows of strong>
stakes, driving them into the ground till
they stood very firm, the biggest end being
out of the ground above five feet and a
half, and sharpened on the top. The two "
rows did not stand above six inches from
one another.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I
had cut in the ship, and laid them in rows,
upon one another, within the circle, be-
tween these two rows of stakes, up to the

I have already observed how I brought
all my goods into this pale, and into this
cave which I had made behind me. But I
must observe, too, that at fits:- this was a
confused heap of goods, which, as they lay
in no order, so they took up all my place.
I had no room to turn myself; so I set my

As long as my ink

nal of all that happened to me, of uhieh I
will now give a part, for much that I wrote
at that time I have already told, and need
not repeat.

Samba,>> 30, mill--I, poor, miserable
Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked, dur-
ing a dreadful storm, in the oiling, came on
shore on this dismal, unfortunate island,
which I called "The Island of Despair ;"
all the rest of the ship's company being
drowned, and myself almost dead.

All the rest of the day I spent in allliet-
ing myself at the dismal circumstances I
was brought to; viz,I had neither food,
house, clothes, weaprm, nor place to fly to;
and, in despair of any relief, saw Nothing
but death before me: either that I should
be devoured by wild beasts, or perish by
starvation.

Oct. 25.--It rained all night and all
day, with some gusts of wind; during
which time the ship broke in pieces, the
wind blowing a. little harder than before,

and was no more to be seen, except tte
wreck of her, and that only at. low water.
I spent this day in covering and securing
the goods which I saved, that the rain
might not spoil them.

Oct. 26.---I walked about the shore
almost all day, to find out a place to fix
my habitation, greatly concerned to secure
myself from any attack in the night, either
from wild beasts or men. Towards night
I fixed upon a proper place, under a rmrk,
and marked out a. semicircle for my on.
campmont, which I resolved to strengthen
with a work, wall, or fortifieation, made of
double piles, lined within with cables, and
without with turf.

From the 2(llh to the 30th,I worked
very hard in carrying all my goods to my
new habitation, though some part of the
time it rained exceeding haul.

my tent into the rock, to make room for of ashovel or spade; the handle exactly
any further conveniency.

Mia--Three things I wanted exceed-
ingly for this work, Viz, a. pickaxe, a
shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so I
dcsisted from my work, and began to con~
eider how to supply that want, and make
me some tools. As for the pickaxe, I
made use of the iron crows, which were
proper enough, though heavy; and the
next thing was a shovel, or spade. This was
so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I
could do nothing efi'ectually without it; but
what kind of one to make I knew not.

Nov. 18.--'1'he next day, in searching
the woods, I found a tree of that wood,
or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call
the iron-tree, for its exceeding hardness; of
this, with great labor, and almost spoiling
my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home,
with difficulty enough, for it was exceed-
ingly heavy. The excessive hardness of
the wood, and having no other way, made
me a long while upon this machine, for I

 

shaped like ours in England, only that the
boaxd part having no iron shod upon it at

 

bottom, it would not last me so long; how
ever, it served well enough for the use:
which I had occasion to put it to; but
never was a shovel, I believe, made after
that fashion or so long making.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a
basket, or a whm-lharrow. A haskct I
could not make by any means, having no
such things as hvig's that wuuld bend to
make \\'ickc1'-w:n'e--at least, none yet found
out; and as to the. wln-elhm'row, I fancied
I could make all but the wheel; but that
I had no notion of: neither did I know
how to go about it; besides, I had no
posfilflo way to make iron gudgeons for ihe.
spindle or axis of the wheel to run in: so
I gave it over, and so, for carrying away

Dec. 11.--This day I went to work and
got posts pitched upright to the top, with
boards across over each top, and in a week
I had the roof secured.

another, so that I catched it and led it home
by a string. When I had it home,I bound

lived, and the leg grew as strong as ever.
By nursing it so long, it grew tame and
would not; go away. This led me to think
of tanning more goats.

I found a. kind of wild pigeons, which
build, not as wood pigeons in a tree, but
rather as house pigeons, in the holes of the
rocks; and taking some young ones, I on
deavored to breed them up tame, and mu
so; but when they grew older they flew '11
away, which perhaps was at first for \mul
of feeding them, for I had nothing to give
them; however, I frequently found their
nests, and got their young ones, which were

very good meat.42

 

And now, in the managing my household
affairs, I found myself wanting In many
things, which I thought at first it was im-
possible for me to make; as, indeed, as to
some of them it was: for instance, I could
never make a cask to be hooped. I had a
small runlet or two, as I observed before;
but I could never arrive to the capacity of
making one by them, though I spent many
weeks about it; I could never put in the

which was generally by seven o'clock, I
was obliged to go to bed. I rememberu
the lump of beef-wax with which I made
candles in my African adventure; but I lla-l
none of that now. The only remedy I ha!
was, that when I had killed agoat, I sum]
the tallow, and with a little dish made of
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I
added a wick of some oakum, I made m>>
a lamp; and this gave me light, though nu;
a clear, steady light like a candle.

In the middle of all my labels, it hnp
pened that, rummaging my things, I found
a little bag. which had been filled with can
for the feeding of poultry. What little n:-
nminderof corn had been in the bag was
all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing
in the bag but husks and dust; and being
willing to have the bag for some other use.
I shook the husks of corn out of it on one
side of my fortification, under the I'm-k. _

heads, not join the staves so true to one an-
other as to make them hold water; so I gave
that also over.

In the next place, I was at a great loss
for candles; so that as soon as it was dark,

saw some few stalks of something glut.
shooting upon the ground, which I film-in" .
mightbe some plant I had not soon. But
was smprised when, after a little long!
time, I saw about ten or twelve ears con-f -
out, which were perfect green barley,
the some kind as our English barley.

It is impossible to expwss the astonir
meat and. confusion of my thoughts on d
occasion. I had hitherto acted upon not,
ligious foundation at all; indeed, I it

chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases
God, without so much as inquiring into the
end of Providence in these things. But
after I saw barley grow there in a climate
which I knew was not proper for corn, and
especially that I knew not how it came
there, it startled me strangely, and I began
to suggest that God had miraculously caused
this grain to grow without any help of seed
sown.

This touched my heart a little, and
brought tears out of my eyes, and I began
to bless myself that such a. prodigy of
Nature should happen upon my account;
and this was the more strange to me, be-
cause I saw near it still, all along by the
side of the rock, straggling stalks of rice,
and which I knew, because I had seen it
grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I carefully saved the earsof this corn,.

you may be sure, in their season, which
was about the end of June; and laying up
every corn, I resolved to sow them all
again, hoping in time to have sufficient to
supply me with bread. But it was not
till the fourth year that I would allow
myself the least grain of this corn to eat,
and even then but sparingly; for I lost all
that I sowed the first season, by not
observing the proper time; for I sowed it
just before the dry season, so that it never
came up at all.

Besides this barley, there were twenty
or thiity stalks of rice, which I preserved
with the same care, and whose use was of
the same kind, or to the same purpose,
via, to make me bread, or rather food;

found ways to cook it up without

But to return to my Journal:--
April 16.--I finished the ladder; so I
went up the ladder to the top, and then
pulled it up after me, and let it down on
the inside. This was a complete enclosure
to me; for within I had room enough, and
nothing. could come at me from without,

unless it could first mount my wall.

 

The very next day after this wall was
finished, I had almost had all my labor,
overthrown at once, and myself killed.'
The case was thusz--As I was busy in the
inside of it, behind my tent, just in the
entrance into my cave, I was terribly
frightened with a most dreadful surpris-
ing thing indeed; for, all on a sudden, I
found the earth came tumbling down from
the roof of my cave, and from the edge of
the hill over my head, and two of the posts
I had set up in the cave cracked' in a fright
ful manner. I was heartily scared; and for.'
fear I should be buried in it, I run forward
to my ladde1, and not thinking myself safel
there neithe1, I got ovel my wall PS01 fear
of the pieces of the hill, which I expected
might roll down upon me. I was no sooner
stepped down upon the firm ground, than
I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake;
  

 

hurricane of wind. The sea was lashed to
foam; and trees were torn up by the roots,
and, in short, it was a. dreadful storm.

In about three hours the wind abated,
but the rain continued all night and all the
next day. As there were no more shocks,
I climbed over the wall and went into my
cavetoescape the rain,but still in great
fear that it would fell upon me.

This led me to a resolve that I would
find a new place for my home, where an
earthquake could not harm me, and I find
this in my journal:

for the ground I stood on shook thlee
times, with such shocks as would have
overturned the strongest building that
could be supposed to have stood upon the
earth; and a. great piece of the top of the
rock, which stood about half a mile from
me, next the sea, fell down with such a
terrible noise as I never heard in all my
life. I perceived also the verysea was put
into a violent motion by it.

I was so amazed with the thing itself,
having never felt the like, or discoursed
with any one that had, that I was like one
dead or stupefiod; and the motion of the

was tossed at see. But the noise of the
falling of the rock awahed me as itwere,
and reusing me from the stupefied condi-
tion I was in, filled me with horror, and I
thought of nothing then, but the hill fall
ing upon my tent and all my household
goods, and burying all at once.

_ When I found there were no more shocks,
I began to take courage, but I was for a
long time afraid to get over the wall for
fear the hill would fall on me. To make
my situation worse, the rain began to fall
down in torrents, and there came a terrible

of the wreck had broken itself down ; that

several pieces of the ship seemed to lie

the first I had seen, which, it seems. was
only my misfortune; for had i happened
to be on the other side of the island, I
might have had hundreds of them every'

brought them on shore also with the tide.

May 9.----Went to the wreck, and with
the crow made way into the body of the
wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened
them with the crow, but could not break
them up. I felt also a roll of English
lead,and could sfiritbutitwastooheavy

Ila/y 15.---I carried two hatchets, to try
if I could not cut a piece of the roll of
lead, but as it lay about a foot and a half
in the water, I could not make any blow to
drive the hatchet.

May 16.--It had blown hard in the
night, and the wreck appeared more broken
by the force of the water; but I stayed so
long in the woods, to get pigeons for food,
that the tide prevented me going to the
wreck.

I continued this work every day to the

It was the 15th of July that I began to

grapes hanging in great clusters from the
branches of the trees. I staid there all I

some four miles farther. Here I found a

When I came home from this journey, I
contemplated with great pleasure the fruit-

of. the situation; the security from storm
on that side of the water, and the wood;
and concluded that I had pitched upon a
place to fix my abode, which was by far
theworst part of the country. Upon the
whalel began to consider of removing my
habitation, and to look out for a place

equally safe as where now I was situate, if
possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of
the island.

This thought ran long in my head, and
I was exceedingly fond of it for some time,
the pleasantness of the place tempting me;
but when I came to a nearer view of it, I
considered that I was now by the seaside,
where it was at least possible that some-
thing iuight happen to my advanwe;
and that the same ill fate that brought
me hither, might bring some other uu-
happy wretches to the same place; and to
enclose myself among the hills and woods
in the centre of the island, was to antiei~
pate my bondage, and to render such an
afiair not only improbable, but impossible;
and that therefore I ought not by any
means to remove.

However, I was so enamored with
this place, that I spent much of my time
there for the whole remaining part of the
month of July; and though, upon second
thoughts, I resolved as above not to remove,
yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and
surrounded it at a distance with a strong
fence, being a double hedge, as high as I
could reach, well staked, and filled between
with brushwood; and here I lay very
secure, sometimes two or three nights to
gether, always going over it with a ladder
as before; so that I fancied now I had my
country house and my sea-coast house; '

The 8111 of August, I found the grapes I
had hung up were perfectly dried, and
indeed were excellent good raisins of the

trees, and it was very happy that I did so.
for the rains which followed would have
spoiled them, and I had lost the better 98052

a! my winter's food; for I had above two
hundred large bunches of them. No sooner
had 1 taken them all down, and carried
most of them hometo mycave, but it began
to rain; and it rained, more or less, every
day, till the middle of October, and some-
times so violently, that I could not stir out
of my cave for several days.

 

 

In this season Iwas much surprised with
the increase of my family. I had been con-
cerned for the loss of one of. my cats, who
ran away from me, and I heard no more
tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she
came home about the end of August, with
three kittens. I afterward came to be so
pestered with cats, that I was forced to
kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and
to drive them from my house as much as
possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26th,
incessant rain, so that I could not stir, and
was now very careful not to be much wet.
In this confinement, I began to be strait
fined for food; but venturing out twice, I
one day killed a goat; and the last day,
which was the 26th, found a very large
sartoise, which was a treat to me, and my

...._...-.~..

foodwas regulated thus :---I ate a blush ol
raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner,
broiled (for, to my great misfortune, I had
no vemel to boil or stew anything), and
two or three of the turtle's eggs for supper.

Sept. 30.---I was now come to the un-
happy anniversary of my landing. I cast
up the notches on my post, and found
I had been on shore three hundred and
sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn
fast, setting it apart for religious exercises,
prostrating myself on the ground with tie
most serious humiliation, confessing my
sins to God, acknowledging his righteous
judgment upon me, and praying to him to
have mercy upon me through J esns Christ;
and having not tasted the least refreshment
for twelve hours, even till the going duwu
of the sun, I then ate a biscuitcnke and
bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing
the day as I began it. I now set of! everyl
seventh day as the Sabbath day.

My ink gave out about this time, and I
gave up my journal. After a time I learned
how to divide the rainy season from t
dry season, but at first the lack of th'
knowledge came near costing me dear,f .
I sowed my grain before the dry sea ' _
and not a. stalk came up. Fortunatem
hsdnotsown itaannd I sowed the f
grains left before the rainy season and'
grew very well, though it was several year,
before I had enough to make a crop.

After I had found, by experience, the
consequences of being abroad in the '
Itook care to furnish myself with pm!
sions before hand, shat I might not '

as much as possible during the wet mon ,r
    

In this time I found much employment,
and very suitable also to the time, for I
found great occasion of manythings which
I had no way to furnish myself with but
by hard labor and constant application;
particularly, I had tried many ways to
'makemyulfahmketbutall the twigs I
' could get for the purpose proved so brittle
that they would do nothing.
Itcameintomymind that thetwigs of
that tree from whence I cut my stakes that
grew might possibly be as tough as the
sallows, willows, and osiers in England,
and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the
next day I went to my country-house, as I
called it, and cutting some of the smaller
twigs, I found them to my purpose asmuch
as I could desire. During the next season,
I employed myselfin making,aswellas
: could, a great many baskets, both to

  

can-yearth or lay up anything," I had
occasion; and though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them safiv
ciently servicable for my purpose; and
thus, aftemardaI took care never to be
without them; and as my wicker-wan
decayed, I made more, especially strong,
deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of
sacks, when I should come to have any
quantity of it.

I now resolved to travel quite across to
the other side of the island, so, taking a.
hatchet with my gun and (log, and a larger
quantity of" powder and shot than usual,
and puttingagreatbunchofmisinsand
two biscuit cakes in my pouch, I began
my ioumey.

I saw abundance of parrots, and fain
would I have caught one, if posihle, to
have kept it to be tame, and taught it tospeak to me. I did, after some painstak-
ing, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it
down with a stick, and having recovered
it, I brought it home; but it was some
'years before I could make him speak;
however, at last, I taught him to call me
[by my name very familiarly.

,Hm .. =,

  

As soon as I came to the seashore, I was
surprised to see that I had taken up my
lot on the worst side of the island, for
here, indeed, the shore was covered with
innumerable turtles, whereas, on the other
,aide, I had found but three in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number
of fowls of many kinds, some of which I
had not seen before, and many of them
very good meat, but such as I knew not
the names of, except those called penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased,
but was very sparing of my powder and
shot, and therefore had more mind to ldll
a she-goat, if I could, which I could better
feed on; and though there were many
goats here, more than on the other side of
the island, yet it was with much more
difiiculty that I could come near them.

I confess this side of the countrywas

ROBINSON ORUSOE.

much pleasanter than mine; but yet I had
not the least inclination to lemove, for, as
I was fixed in my habitation, it became
natural to me, and I seemed all the while
I was here to be as it were upon a jour.
ney, and from home. However, I trav-
eled along the shore of the sea towanls
the east, I suppose about twelve miles, and
then setting up a great pole upon the shots
for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again.

I took another way going home, and

. . became bewildered and lost, so that I had

to go back to my post and start again. In

this journey, my dog surprised a kid, which

I caught and led by a string till I came to
my bower, where I left him, securely tied
I cannot express my satisfaction when I
came to what I called my home and threw
myself in myhammock. I had been gone
a month, and it all appeared so comfortable
that I resolved never to leave it for so long
a time again, while I remained on the
island.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel
how much more happy the life I now led
was, with all its miserable circumstances
than the wicked, abominable life I led all
the past part of my days; and now having
changed both my sorrows and my joys:
my very desires altered, and my delight:
were perfectly new tram what they we!
at first coming.

Before, as I walked about, either on my
hunting, or for viewing the country, the
anguish of my soul at my condition wouli
break out upon me on a sudden, and my
verylleart would die within me, to think
of the woods, the mountains, the deseflsl
was in, and how I was a prisoner, loclwd
        
  

would go of, and the grief having ex-l
hausted itself would abate.

But now I began to exercise myself.
with new thoughts. I daily read the Wordl
_of God, and applied all the comforts of it
to my present state. One morning, being

up with the eternal bars and bolts of the
ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, with
out redemption. In the midst of the
greatest composures of my mind, this
would break out upon me like a storm,
and make me wring my hands. and weep

 

like a child. Sometimes it would take me very sad, I opened the Bible upon these
in the middle of my work, and I would sit words, " I will never leave thee, never for-
down and sigh, and look upon the ground sake thee." Immediawa it occurred that
for an hour or two together; and this these words were to me; why otherwise
was still worse to me, for if I could burst should they be directed in such a manner,
out into tears, or vent myself by words, it just at the moment when I was mourning
 

over my condition, as one forsaken of God
and man? " Well, then," said I, "if God
does not forsake me, of what ill conse-
quence can it be, or what matters it, though

 

the world should all forsake me seeing, on
the other hand, if I had all the world, and
should lose the favor and blessing of God,
mere would be no comparison in the loss?"

From this moment I began to conclude
1: my mind that it was possible for me to
be happy in this forsaken, solitary condi~
u-m; and I was going to give thanks to
God for bringing me to this place. Iknow
not what it was, but something shocked my

 

 

 

mind at that thought, and I durst not
speak the words. " How canst thou become
such a hypocrite," said Leven audibly, "to

day. Also, it is to be considered, that in
the middle of the day, when the sun was
in the zenith, the violence of the heat was
too great to stir out; so that about four
hours in the evening was all the time I
could be supposed to work in, with this
exception, that sometimes I changed my
hours of hunting and working, and went
to work in the morning, and abroad with
my gun in the afternoon.

While indoors, during the rains, I talked
much to my parrot, which now learned her
own name and seemed to repeat it for my
diversion, as it pleased me greatly.

I was now in the months of November
and December, expecting my crop of barley
and rice. The ground I had dug up for

  

a------_..
of losing it all again by enemies of sever-a)
sorts, which it was scarcely possible to keep
from it; as, first the goats, and wild cr

and at the end of all my harvesting, I
* found that out of my half-peck of seed I
had near two bushels of rice, and above
two bushels and a-half of barley; that is
,tosay,bymyguess,for1had no measure
'at that time.

I had long studied, by some meansor
other, to make myself some earthen vessels,
which. indeed, I wanted sorely. I did not
doubt but if I could find out any clay, I
might botch up some such pot as might,
being dried by the sun, be hard enough
and strong enough to bear handling, and
to hold anything that was dry, and re-
quired to be so; and as this was necessary
in preparing corn, meal, 8w, which was
' the thing that I was upon, I resolved to
make some as large as I could, and fit only
to stand like jars, to hold what should be
put into them.

It would make the reader pity me,or
rather laugh at me, to tell how many awk-
ward ways I took to raise this paste; what
odd, misshapen, ugly things I made; how
many of them fell in, and how many fell
out--the clay not being stifl enough to
bear its own weight; how many cracked

by the over-violent heat of the sun, being -

set out too hastily; and how many fell to
pieces with only removing, as well before
as after they were dried; and, in a word,
how, after having labored hard to find the
clay--to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
.home, and work it--I could not make
above two large earthen ugly things (I can-
not call them jars) in about two months
labor. '
However, as the sun baked these two
- very dry and hard, I lifted them very
gently up, and set them down again in two

 

:39

great wicker baskets, which I had made on
purpose for them, that they might not
break.

Though miscarried so much in my design
for large pots, yet I made several smaller
things with better success; such as little

round pots, flat dishes, pitchers and pipkins,
and anything my hand turned to; and the
heat of the sun baked them strangely hard.

:

 

But all this would not answer my end,
which waste get an earthen pot to hold
what was liquid, and bear the fire; which
none of these could do. It happened after
some time, making a pretty large fire for

cooking my meat, when I went to put it

out after I had done with it, I found a
broken piece of one of my earthenware ves>>
sels inthe flre.burnt as hard as a stoneM

- and red as a tile. Iwasagreenblysm'prised
to see it, and said to myself that certainly
they might be made to burn whole, if they
would burn broken. '

This set me to-study how to order my
fire so as to make it burn me some pots; I
had no notion of a kiln,such as the potters
burn in, or of glazing them with lead,
though I had some lead to do it with; but
I placed three large pipkins, two or three

 

pots, in a. pile, one upon another, and placed
my firewood all round it, with a heap of
embers under them. I plied the fire with
fresh fuel round the outside and upon the
top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot
quite through, and observed that they did
not crack at all; when I saw them clear
red, I let them stand in that heat about
five or six hours, till I found one of them,
though it did not creek, did melt or run;
for the sand which was mixed with the
clay melted with the violence of the heat,
and. would have run into glass if I had
gone on. So I slacked. myfire gmdually till
the pots began toubate of the red color,
end watching them all night that I might

ingI hadthreeverygood (I will not say

one them perfectly glazed with the running

After this experiment, I wanted no son;

were very indifferent, as any one may sup ,
pose when I had no way of making them,

but as the children make dirt pies, or as r.-

woman would make pies that never learned
to raise paste. '

I now thought to dig out a stone, and 1
make myself a mortar; but, after searching
a long while I could find no stone haul,
enough," all the rocks on the island were
soft and crumbling. I got instead a great 7
block of hard wood, and with much labor ,
I rounded the outside, and then, with the,

served as hearths. In there I built hot

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece

impossible to heave it up with my little

making it, and with my having much more
convenience for it than any of the Negroes
or Indians; but not at all considering the
particular inconveniences which I lay
under more than the Indians did, viz.,
want of hands to move it into the water
when it was made.

I went to'work upon this boat the most
like a fool that ever man did, who had any
of his senses awake. I pleased myself
with the design, without determining
whether I was ever able to undertake it;
not but that the diflicnlty of launching my
boat came often into my head; but I put
a stop to my inquiries into it, by this
foolish answer which I gave myself: "Let
me first make it; I warrant I shall find
some way to get it along when it is done."

This at length set me-

BOBINSON OR USOE'.

 

This was a most preposterous method;
but the eagerness of my fancy prevailed,
and to work I went, and felled a cedar.
tree. I question much whether Solomon
ever had such a one for the building the
Temple of Jerusalem. It was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part, and four
feet eleven inches diameter at the end of
twenty-two feet; after which it lessened
for a while, and then parted into branches.
It was not without infinite labor that I
felled this tree. I was twenty days hack-
ing and hewing at it at the bottom; I was
fourteen more getting the'branches and
limbs and the vast spreading head of it cut
off, which I hacked and hewed through
with my axe and hatchet. Afterthis, it
cost me a month to shape it to something
like the bottom of a boat. It cost me
near three months more to clear the inside,
and work it out so as to make an exact
boat of it. This I did, indeed, without fire,
by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint
of hard labor, till I had brought it to be a
very handsome perisgua, and big enough
to have carried six-and-twenty men.

When I had gone through this work,l
was extremely delighted with it. The
boat was really much bigger than ever I
saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of
one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke
it had cost, you may be sure--for there
remained nothing but to get it into the)
water; and had I gotten it into the water,
I make no question, but I should have
begun the maddest voyage, and the most
unlikely to be performed that ever was
undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the
water failed me. It lay about one hun-84

dred yards from the water, and not more;
but the first inconvenience was, it was up
hill towards the creek. Well, to take
away this discouragement, I resolved to
dig into the surface of the earth, and so
make a declivity. This I began, and it
cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but
who grudge pains that have their deliver-
anon in view t); but when this was worked

 

tlnough,and this difficulty managed, it was,

still much at one, for I could no more stir
the canoe than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground,
and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to
bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I
could not bring the canoe down to the
water. I began this work, but upon cal-
culating the amount of digging and what
I could do in a day, I found it would take
twelve years to filfijh it, so I was obliged
to abandon it.

In themiddle of this work I finished my

fourth year in this place, and kept my anni-'

versary with the same devotion, and with
as much comfort as ever before; for, by
a constant study and serious application of
the Word of God, and by the assistance of
His grace, I gained a difiierent knowledge
from what I had before I looked now
upon the world as a thing remote, which I
had nothing to do with, no expectation
from, and, indeed, no desire about; in a

word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, '

nor was ever likely to have.

The next thing to my ink being wasted,
was that of my bread, I mean the biscuit
which Ibrought out of the ship. This I
had hnshanded to the last degree, allowing
myself but one cadre of bread a. day for
above ayear; and yet I was quite without

bread for a year before I got any corn of
my own.

My clothes, too,bcgan to decay mightily ;'
as to linen, I had had none for a good
while, except some shirts which I had found
in the chests of the other semen, and
which I carefully preserved; because many
times I could bear no other clothes on but
a shirt; and it was a very great help
to me that I had, among all the men's
clothes of the ship, almost three dozen
of shirts. There were also several thick
watch-coats of the ssamen's, which were
left behind, but they were too hot to wear;
so I set to work, tailoring, or rather, indeed,
botching, for I made most piteous work of
it However, I made shift to make two or
three waiscoats, which I hoped would servo
me a great while; as for breaches or
drawers, I made butavery sorry shift till
afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skim
ofa'll the matures that I killed,I mean
fem-footed ones, and' I had hung them up
stretched out with sticks in the sun, by
which means some of them were so dry and
hard that they were fit for little, but other;
it seems, were very useful. The first thing
made of these was a great cap for my heal
with the hair on the outside, to shootoi
the rain; and this performed so well, that
after, I made me a suit of clothes wholly at
those skins. I must not omit to acknow-
ledge they were wretchedly made; for if I

Afterthis, I'spent a great deal of time
.ndpeinstomakeanumbrells. Iwas,in-
deed, in great 'need of one, and had a great
mind to make one. I had seen them made
in the Brazils, where they are very useful
in the great heats which are there, and I
felt the heats every jot as great here, and
greater too, being nearer the equinox; be-
sides, as I was obliged to be much abroad,

it spread, but if it did not let down too,
and draw in, it would not be portable for
me any way but just over my head, which
would not do. However, at last, as I said,
I made one to answer. I covered it with
skins, the hair upwards, so that it east of
the rain like a penthouse, and kept of!

outlin the hottest of the weather with

l .

 

it was a most useful thing to me, as well
for the rams as the heats. I took a world
of pains at it, and was a great while before
I could maln anything likely to hold: nay,
after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled
two or three before I made one to my mind.
But at last I made one that answered indif-
fsrently well; the main difficulty I found
was to make it to let down. I couldmsks

greater advantage than I could before in
the coolest.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my
mind being entirely composed by resigning
to the will of God, and throwing myself
wholly upon the disposal of His providence.
This made my life "better than sociable, for
when I to regret the want of conver-
sation, I would ask myself whether this=--

eonversing mutually with my own thoughts,
and (as I hope I may say) with even my
Maker, by ejaculations and petitions, was
not better than the utmost enjoyment of
human society in the world?

I cannot say that, after this, for five
years, any extraordinary thing happened to
me, but I lived on in the same course, in
the same posture and place, just as before.
The chief thing I was employed in, besides
my yearly labor of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins--of both which
I always kept up just enough to have
auficient stock of the year's provision
beforehand--I had one labor, to make me
a canoe, which at last I finished; so that,
by digging a canal to it of sixfeet wide
and four feet deep, I brought it into the
creek, almost half a mile.

In building this boat I was wiser than
in building my larger one, and I built it
small enough to get to the sea. I was near
two years in building it, but I never
gmdged my labor, in hopes of having a
boat to go of to sea at last.

However, though my little periagna was
finished, yet the size of it was not at all
answerable to the design which I had in
View when I made the first; I mean of
venturing over to the mainland, so that
design was given over for the present. As
I had a boat, my next design was to make
a tour round the island.

For this purpose, I fitted up a little mast
in my boat, and made a sail to it out of
some of the little pieces of the ship's sails
which lay in store. I tried the boat, and
found she would sail very well. Then I
made little lockers or boxes at each end to
put provisions, ammunition, etc, to be

kept dry, either from rain or the spray or
the sea. I made also, a little, long, hollow
place where I could lay my gun, making a
flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella at the stem, to stand
over my head like an awning. All now
being pied>> I loaded my ship for the voy-

age, putting in two dozen loaves of barley
bread, an earthen pot full of parched
rice, a little bottle of rum, and half agoat,
powder and shot for my gun, and two
large coats, one to lie upon and one to
cover me in the night, and thus I set sail.

When I came to the east side of the
island, I found a great ledge of rocks lie
out about two leagues into the sea, and be-
yond that a shoal of sand lying half a
league more. I was afraid to go so farout
to sea, for fear I could not get back again,
so I anchored my boat, and, taking my
gun, went on shore and climbed a big hill,
to get a view of the other side of the
ledge.

From the hill I perceived a strong and
intricate current, which would be very
likely to prevent me from being able to
make the island again. And, indeed, had
I not got first upon this hill, I believe it
would have been so; for there was the
same current on the other side of the
island, only that it set off at a farther dis-
tance, and I saw there was a strong eddy
under the shore; so I had nothing to do
but to get out of the first current, and!
should presently be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days, because,
the wind blowing pretty fresh at E.S.E.,
and that being just contrary to the current,
made a great breach of the sea upon the
point; so that it was not safe for meta

, ' ' I had no prospect be-

for that was calm' enough, but of starving
from hunger, I had, indeed, found a ton
toiss on the shore, as big almostas I could
lift, and had tossed it into'the boat; and I
had a great jar of fresh water, that is to
:say, one of my earthen pots; but what
was all this to being driven into the vast
ocean, where, to be sure, there was no
shore, no mainland or island, for a thous-
and miles at least?

And now I saw how easy it was tor the
providence of God to make the most mis-
erable condition that mankind could be in
worse. Now I looked back upon my deso
late, solitary island as the most pleasant

. place in the'world, and all the happiness
my heart could wish forwas to be there
again. I stretched out my hands to it,

' with eager wishes. "0 happy desertl"
said I,"I shall never see theemors. 0
miserable creaturel whither am I going?"

I still worked hard to get my boat out
of the current. About noon, a breeze
sprang up from the B. B. E, which cheered
my heart a little, and especially when, in
about half an hour more, it blew a pretty
smaILgentle gale. Bythistime,I had
got at a frightful distance from the island;
and had the least cloudy or hazy weather

   

standing away to the .north as much a
possible, to get out of the current. ,

I made such good headway that I soon
found an eddy which carried me about a
league on my way back. The 'wind con-
tinuing fair, I continued to near the island
and soon get to land. When I was on
shore, I fell on my knees and gave God
thanks for my deliverance. After which, I
drew my boat into a little cove under some
trees, and laid me down to sleep, being
quite spent with the fatigue of the voyage,
which I resolved not to repeat.

I was now at a great loss which way to
get home with my boat. I had run so much
hamdwdknewtoomuehof the case,to'
think of attempting it by the way I went
out; and what might be at the other side I
knew not, nor'had I any mind to run any
more ventures. So I resolved, on the next
morning, to make my way westward along
theshore, andtosee if therewas nocreek.
where I might lay up my frigate in safety,
soastohave her agaimif I wanted her.
In about three miles, coasting the shore, I
came to a very good inlet or bay, about a
mile over, which narrowed till it came to a
very little rivulet or brook, where I to

trsvelled on foot to that shore; so, taking

nothing out of 'my boat but my gun and
umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I
began my march. The way was comfort-
able enough after such a. voyage as I had
been upon, and I reached my old bower in
the. evening, where I _:Eound everything
standing as I left it.

I got over the fence, and laid me down
to rest my limbs, for I was
very weary, and fell asleep.
But judge you, if you can,
what a surprise I must have
heen in when I was awaked
out of my sleep by a voice,
calling me by my name sev-
eral times: "Robin, Robin,
Robin Crusoe! poor Robin
Crusoe! 11th are you,
Robin Crusoe? Where are
you? Where have you
been 2"

Iwas so dead asleep at
first, being fatigued with
lowing the first part of the
day and walking the latter
part, that I did not awake
thoroughly; and dozing be-
tween sleeping and waking,
thought I dleamed that
somebody spoke to me; but
as the voice continued to
repeat, "Robin Crusoe!
Robin Crusoe !" at last I
begin to awake more per-
fectly, and was at first
dreadfully flightened, and
started up in the utmost
"Wmation. No sooner
were my eyes open, but I

 

saw my poll sitting on the top 01 the
hedge, and immediately knew that it w",
he that spoke to me; for just in such
bemoaninglnnguage I had used to tal'r
to him and teach him.

However, even though I knew it was the
parrot, and that indeed it could be nobody
else, it was a good while before I could
compose myself. Holding out my hand,I70

island. I had the lives of all my subject,
at absolute command; I could hang, draw,

my thumb, as he used to do, and continued give life and liberty and take it away, and

talking to me, " Poor Robin Crusoe l and
,how did I come here! and where had 'I
been 2" just as if he had been overjoyed to
eeeme again; andsoIcan'ied him home
along with me.

I had now enough of rambling to sea for
some time, and enough to do formany days
to git still and. reflect upon the danger I

 

had been in. I would have been very glad
to have had my boat again on my side of
the island; but I knew not how it was
practicable to get it about. As to the east
side of the island, which I had gone round,
I knew well enough there was no ventur-
ing that way; my very heart would shrink
and my very blood run chill, but to
think of it; and as to the other side of the
island, I knew there was a current there
quite as dangerous.

I began to think now what I should do
'for goat's flesh when my powder should be
gall gone. To make provision for this, I set
traps, and caught some young kids, which
I tamed, keeping them in alarge enclosure,
securely fenced about. It would have
made a stoic smile to see me and my little
family sit down to dinner. There was my

no rebels among all my subjects. Then to
see how like a king I dined too, all alone,
attended by my servants! Poll, as if he
had been my favourite, was the only per~
son permitted to talk to me; my dog, who
was now grown very old and crazy, sat
always at my right hand; and two cats,
one on one side the table, and one on the
other, expecting now and then a bit from
my hand, as a mark of special favor.

I wanted the use of my boat very much,
but I was very 10th to run any more risk
at sea. One day I resolved to go by land
to the little hill on the other side where I
had observed how the shore lay and the
current set, and so I started, following the
edge of the shore. Had any of the people
of England met me at that time, I should
either have frightened them or raised a
great deal of laughter. .

I had a great, high shapelees cap, made
of goat's skin, with a flap hanging down
behind, as well to keep the sun from me as
to shoot the rain ofi from running into my
neck; nothing being so hurtful in these
climates as the rain upon the flesh under
the clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the
skirts coming down to about the middle
of the thighs, and a pair of open-knead
breeches of the same. The breaches were
made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose
hair hung down such a length on either
side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the
middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes 1
had none, but had made me a pair of some

majesty, the prrnce and lord of the whole things, I scarce know what to call them.likebmkinstoflapmmylegsandlaoe

on either side like ashes, but of a
most barbarous shape, as indev' wereall

the rest of my clothes.

'I had on a broad belt of goat's skin
dried, which I drew together with two
thongs of the same, instead of buckles;
and in a kind of a frog on either side of
this, instead of asword and dagger, hung
a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side,
one on the other. I had another beltnot
so broad, and iastened in the same manner,
which hung over my shoulder; and at the
end of it, under my left arm, hung two
pouches, both made of goat's skin too, in
one of which hung my powder, in the
other my shot. At my back I carried my

 

ROBINSON ORUSOE'.

 

my head a great, clumsy, ugly goat'skin
umbrella, but which, after all, was the
most necessary thing I had about me next
to my gun. '

When I reached the hill, I found the sea
quite still, which convinced me that the
current was formed by the ebb and flow
of the tide. StillI resolved to leave the
boat for use on that side of the island, and
to make me another host to use on my
home side.

It happened one day, about noon, going
towards my boat, I was exceedingly sur-
prised with the priut of a man's naked foot
on the shore, which was very plain to be
seen on the sand. I stood like one thun-
derstruck, or as if I had seen an appan

basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over Iition. I listened, I looked around me, but
it

 

[could hem nothing, nor see anything; I
went up to a rising ground, to look far-
ther; I went up the shore, and down the
shore, but it was all one; I could see no
other impression but that one. I went to
it again to see if there were any more, and
to observe if it might not be my fancy;
but there was no room for that, for there
was exactly the print of a foot--toes, heel,
and every part of a foot. How it came
thither I knew not, nor could in the least
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering
thoughts, like a man perfectly confused
and out of myself, I came home to my for-
tification, not feeling.
as we say, the ground
I went on, but terri-
fied to the last de-
gree, looking behind
me at every two or
three steps, mistaking
every bush and tree,
and faucying every \.
stump at a distance ' i

how many various '
shapes my afirighted 5' "
imaginationrepresent- ,
ed things to me in;
how many wild ideas '
were formed every
moment in my fiancy,
and what strange un.
accountablewhimseys
came into my thoughts
by the way. i

When I came to
my castle (for so I
think I called it ever

after this), I fled into it like one pm
sued. Whether I went over by an
ladder, as first contrived, or went in ill
the hole in the rock, which I called a
door, I cannot remember ; for never frigh ted
hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with
more terror )f mind than I did to this
retreat.

I had no sleep that night, but Jay
trembling with fright and thinking who or
what it could be that had visited the
island. I fancied all sorts of things, but
finally concluded that some of the savages
of the main land had been there, and this74

did not in the least allay my fear, for after-
wards I was in constant dread that I
should meet them. When milking my
goats or gathering my fruit, if I heard the
least noise, I was ready to drop every-
jthing and flee to my house.

I Now I began sorely to repent that I had
dug my cave so large as to bring a door
through again beyond where my fortifica-
tion joined to the rock. Therefore Ire-
solvcd to draw me a second fortification, in
the same manner of a semicircle, at a dis-
tance from my wall, just where I had
planted adouble row of trees about twelve
years before. These tnees having been planted
so thick before, there wanted but few piles
to be driven between them, and my wall
would be soon finished. So that I had
now a double wall; and my outer wall
was thickened with pieces of timber, old

 

cables, and everything I could to,
of to make it strong, having in it sex

little holes, about as big as I might I

\Vhile I was doing this I thought much
the safety of my goats ; so I made a sh :
encioslue in a retired part of the island,
and removed to it ten she-goats and two
hegoats and left them there.

One day as I wandered more to the west

rt of the island, being on a bill, I thought

saw a boat far out at sea, but I was not
sine. On coming down from the hill, I
'was confounded and amazed to see the
shore spread with skulls and other bones of
human bodies. There was a. place where
a the had been made, and a circle dug in
the earth, where I supposed the savage
wretches had sat down to their inhuman
feast. When I recovered from my horror
at such a sight, I began to thank God that
I was cast ashore upon a part of the island
that was not visited by the cannibals.

III this frame of thankfuluess, I went
home to my castle, and lmgau to be much
easier now, as to the safety of my circum-
stances, than ever I was before: for I
observed that these wrctehes ucvercameto
this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not warning, or
not expecting, anything here; and having
often, no doubt, been up in the covered,
woody part of it, without finding anything
to their purpose. I knew I had been here
now almost eighteen years, and never saw
the least footsteps of human creature there
before; and I might be eighteen years
more as entirely concealed as I was now, if
ldid not discover myself to them, which I
had no manner of occasion to do; it being
my only business to keep myself entirely
concealed where I was, unless I found a
better sort of creatures than cannibals to
make myself known to. Yet I entertained
Rich an abhon-ence of the savage wretches
that I have been speaking of, and of the

 

 

wretened inhuman custom of their devour-
ing and eating one another up, that I con-
tinued pensive and sad, and kept close
within my own circle for almost two years
after this. "'hen I say my own circle, I
mean by it my three plantations, viz., my
castle, my country-seat (which I called my
bower), and my enclosure in the woods;
nor (lid I look after this for any other use
than as an enclosure for my goats; for the
aversion which nature gave me to these
wretches was such, that I did not so much
as go to look after my boat in all this time,
but began rather to think of making meanother; for I eould not think of ever
making any more attempts to bring the
other boat round the island to me, lest I
should meet with some of those creatures
at sea; in which case,if I had happened to
have fallen into their hands, I knew what
would have been my lot.

Night and day, I could think of nothing
now but how I might destroy some of
these monsters, and, if possible, save the
victim they should bring hither to destroy.

" I believe the reader of this will not
think it strange if I confess these anxie-
ties, these constant fears I lived in, and
the concern that was now upon me, put
an end to all invention, and to all the
'contrlvances that I had laid for my future
accommodations and conveniences. I had
the care of my safety more now upon
hands than that of my food. I cared not

me. For this reason, I removed that part

afinthern solstice (for winter I cannot call
at}, was the particular time of my harvest,

if the fields, when, going out early in the
ebming, I was surprised with seeing a
right of some fire upon the shore, at a dis-

 

7D

 

tance from me of about two miles towards
the end of the island where I had observed
some savages had been, as before, and not
on the other side, but, to my great afllio-
tion, it was on my side of the island.

I was, indeed, terribly surprised at the
sight, and stopped short within my grove,
not daring to ' go out, lest I might be sur-
mind; and yet I had no more peace say, my muskets, which were mounted
within, from the apprehensions I had upon my new fortifications, and all my
that if these savages, in rambling over pistols, and resolved to defend myself to
the islmd, should find my corn standing the last gasp--not forgetting seriously to

or cut, or any of my works, they would commend myself to the Divine protection.
and earnestly to pray to God to deliver

me out of the hands of the barbarians.
And in this posture I continued about
two hours, and began tohe impatient for
intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to
send out. I was not able to bear sitting
in ignorance any longer; so setting up my
ladder to the side of the hill, and the:
pulling the ladder after me, I set it up
again, and mounted to the top of the hill,
and pulling out my perspective-glass, I laid
me down flat on the ground, and began to,
look for the place. I presently found
there were no less than nine naked sav-
ages sitting round a small fire they had;
made, not to warm them. for they had no
need of that, the weather being extremely
hot, but, as I supposed,to dress some of
their barbarous diet of human flesh which
they had brought with them, whether alive
or dead I could not know.

they had hauled up upon the shore; and

with horror, the marks of their dreadful

I was so filled with indignation at this
sight, that I began to ponder how I could
destroy them ' when they should come
again. I went often to the hill to look for
them, and if they had come, I should eer-
tninly have'attacked'them. But more than
a year elapsed and I saw no signs of them,
and I lived on very comfortably. 'In the

There had been a storm of wind on day,

and a very foul night it was after, it. As

with very serious thoughts about my pres-

noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a siuvprise of a. differ-
ent nature from any I had met before; for
the notions this put into my thoughts were
of another kind. I started- up in the
greatest haste, and; in a trice, clapped my
ladder to the middle place of the rock, and
pulled it after me; and; mounting it the

wood I could get at hand, and, making a-
good, handsome pile, I set it on file upon,
the hill. The wood was dry, and blazed
freely; and. though the wind blew very.
hard, yet it burned fairly out, so that I
was certain, if there was any such thing as
a ship, they must need see it, and no doubt
they. did; for as soon as my fire blazed up,
I heard another gin: and then several

of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest,

And now the thought so pressed upon
me night and day that I must go 0E tothis
wreck, that, at last, I loaded my boat with
everything necessary and ventured to sen,
after making a careful study of the dan-
gerous currents.

When I came close to the ship, a dog

But there was no sign of any living

After this eventfl'hved easy enough for

near two years, but I thought constantly

of how I should get away :Eromthe island.
One night I dreamed that one .of the vie>>

' timso'fthe cannibalsran away'fromthem

and came .to me. "New," thought I, in
my dream, "I may venture to the mom
land, for this savage will 'be my pilot."
After this dream, I watched every day for

' the cannibals; determined to captlu'e one of

their victims.

I had watched thus for ithon'ta year md
a half, when I saw one morning no 'less
than .five canoes on shore, and there were
about thirty of the savages dancing around
afire. While 'I looked,I saw two miser
able metches ' ' 'i'rom the both.
One was "knocked down immediately an
out up for their cookery, While the other:
was left standing by himself 'till the;

, would be ready for him.

This poor wretoh, seeing himself a little
atzliberty, and unbound, started away from

. them. and ran with incredible sw'iftnem
 

 

Along the sands, directly towards me. I
was dreadfully frightened, when I perceived
him run my way; and especially when, as
I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole
body. However, my spirits began to re-
cover when I found that there was not
above three men that followed him: and

still more was I encouraged, when I found WW1: which

that he outstripped them exceedingly in
running.

There was between them and my castle,
the creek; but he made nothing of it, but,
plunging in, swam through in about thirty
strokes, landed, and ran with exceeding
strength and swiftness. When the three
persons came to the creek,I found that two
of them could swim, but the third went no
Jfarther, and soon after went softly back
again. It came very warmly upon my
thoughts that now was the time to get me
a servant, and perhaps a companion. I
immediately ran down the ladder, fetched

myself in the way between the pm

at them. But I beckonedwith my hand to

rushing at once upon the foremost, I
knocked him down with the stock of my

the N. W. side of the island, which, it
seems, was their side).

By this I understood that my man.
Friday, had formerly been among the
savages who used to come on shore on

   

' ROBINSON O'RUSOE.

 

the farther part of the island, on the said
man-eating occasions that he was now
broughtfor: and, some time after, when
I took the courage to carryhim to that
side, being the same I formerly mentioned,
he presently knew the place, and told me
he was there once, when they eat up
twenty men, two women and one child.
He could not tell twenty in English, but
he numbered them, by laying so many
stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell
them over.

I asked Friday a thousand questions
about his country, and he told me all he.
knew. He said his 'sort of people were
called Caribs; but further west there were
white~bearded men like me, and that they
had killet " much mans ;" by all of which,
I knew-:he meant the Spaniards whose
cruelties in America. had spread over the
whole country, and were remembered from
father to son. As the time passed away,
I talked much to Friday about God and
the Saviour, and I verily believe that he
became a better Christian than I was.
When he could understand me well I told
him of the coimtries of Europe, and how
I came to be on the island. When I
showed him the ship's boat which was
now falling to pieces on the shore, he told
me that such a boat had come ashore in
his country with seventeen white men in it,
and that these white men were then living
with his people.

It was after this some time, that being
upon the top of the hill, at the east side of
the island, Friday, the weather being very
serene, looked very earnestly towards the
main land, then fell to dancing and cried:
"Oh, joy! oh, glad! there see my country-l
Meet me to thinking whether I could
Dfmke the voyage with Friday, or send

'ill there.

However, I had a farther designthst he
knew nothingof, and that was to make a

must and a sail, and to fit her with an.

anchor and cable.

 

Alter all this was done, I had my man
Fridav to teach us to what belonged to the
nnngation of my boot; for, though he
knew very well how to paddle the canoe,
he knew nothing of what belonged to a
sail and a rudder; and was the most
amazed when he saw merwork. the boat to
and again in the sen. by the rudder; and
how the sail g1'hbed',nnd' filled this way or
that way, as the course we soiled changed.
However, with a little use I made all these
things familiar to him, and he became an
expert sailor, except that as to the com-
pass 1 could make him understand very
little of that.

By the time I had the boat finished the
rainy season was upon us, and we had to
keep within doors. When we began to go
out again, I sent Friday down to the shore
one day to find a turtle. In a short time

Upon this they begged that I would let
tnem stay on the island, to which I gave
my consent. Then I told them my whole
history, and how: had managed every-
thing. I left them all my firearms and
about a barrel and a half of gunpowder,
and [prevailed upon the captain to give
them two barrels more and also some gar-
den seeds. I gave them also the bag of

and mother were deeds? d all my family
except two sisters and two children of one
of my brothers. The captain gave to the

 

owners a. handsome account of my saving
the ship, and they made up a purse of
nearly PS200. With this money I resolved
to go to Lisbon and see if I could get any
news from my plantations in Brazil. I
accordingly took shipping and arrived in
Lisbon safely, Friday accompanying me,
and proving a most valuable servant. Here
I found my old friend, the captain, who
took moon the coast of Africa. He was
an old man now, and he told me he had
not been to the Brazils for nine years, but

as he fired upon them and would not sub-
mit, the mate shot him dead. The next
day his body was hung up at the yard-
arm as a warning to the rest.

When the captain came back, he told
me he had brought me some little refresh-
ments, such as the ship afiorded, Upon

this, he called aloud to 1the boat, and bade '

his men bring the things ashore that were
for the governor; and, indeed, it was a
present as if I had been one that was not
to be carried away along with them, but
as if I had been to dwell upon the island
still, and they were to go without me.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles
full of excellent cordial waters, six large
bottles of Madeira wine, two pounds of
excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces
of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork,
with a bag of peas, and about a hundred-

before me, and I told them I had got a full
account how they had run away with the
ship, and were preparing to commit further
robberies. I let them know that by my

  
  
 
 
 

weightof biscuit. He also brought me a ;;" -'- i" '

box of sugar, 1. box of flour, a bag full of .

lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and
abundance of other things. But besides
these, he brought me six new clean
shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair
of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one
pair of stockings, and a very good suit of
clothes of his own, which had been worn
but very little: in a word, he clothed me
from head to foot. It was a very kind and
agreeable present, as any one may imagine,
to one in my circumstances; but never was
anything in the world of that kind so
unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was
to me to wear such clothes at their first
putting on.

After dressing in my new clothes, so as
to look more like a real governor than in
my goat skins, I had'all the rebels brought

see that their new captain had received the

wanted to know what they had to say why
I should not execute them as pirates. as
they could not doubt but I had authority
to do.

One of them answered that they had
nothing to say but this, that when they
were taken, the captain promised them
their lives. and they humbly implored my
mercy But I told them I knew not what
mercy to show them; for as for myself I
had resolved to quit the island with all mythe boat before 'it was dark; and, indeed,
they were heartily tired themselves also,
by the time they came back to us.

When they came back to the boat in'

the dark, and found it high on the shore of
the creek, and their two men gone, they
began to complain that they wene on an
enchanted island.

I made the man they had left in the
boat, who was now one of us, call them
by name, to try if I could bring them to
e parley. So he calls out as loud as he
could to one of them, " Tom Smith! Tom

that the boat being gone up a good way

answered my end to a tittle. I ordered
Friday and the captain's mate to go over

half a mile distance, and halloo out as loud
as they could; and that as soon as ever

should return it again; and then keeping

we should be undone still, for they would

Yet all these things had no efiect upon
me, or at least not enough to resist the
strong inclination I had to go abroad again.
In particular, the desire of seeing my new
plantation on the island, and the colony I
left there, ran in my head continually. I
dreamed of it all night, and my imagine
tion ran upon it all day; and my fancy
worked so steadily and strongly upon it
that I talked 'of it in my sleep.

My wife, finally, told me very seriously
one night, that she behaved there wane-e
powerful impulse of Piovidence upon no

brought me a little out of the vapors, and
I began to think seriously of my folly,
and to give up my thoughts of going
away. I resolved to divert myself with
other things, andto engage in some busi-
ness that might effectually tie me up from

any more excursions ofthis kind; for I
found that thing return upon me chiefly
when I was idle, and had nothingto do.
To this purpose, I bought a little farm in
the county of Bedford. I had a little
house upon it, and the land about it, I
found, was capable of improvement.
In a word,I wentdowntomyiaxmsettled

thoughts were entirely taken up in manag-

wre was capable of directing.

It was-now the beginning of the year
1698, when my nephew, whom I had
brought up to the sea, was come home
from a short voyage to Bilboa. He came
to me, and told me that some merchants of
his acquaintance had been proposing to
him to go a. voyage forthemtotheEast
Indies, and to China, as private trade:

This so exactly hit with my temper that
I consented, but told him I would go no
further than my own_ island. He argued 1
against this, but to little purpose. How
ever, I and my man Friday went on board'
in the Downs, on' the 8th of January, 1693.
I took with me the frame of a sloop that
could be easily put together. I also took
with me some servants whom I pnrposed
to leave on the island, among them two

carpenteas,' a smith, a very handy in
 

    

genione fellow, who could do many things,
sndatailor. In my cargo was an abun-
dance of cloths and wearing apparel, beds,
bedding, and household stufi, particularly
kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter,
limes, etc, and near'almndred pounds more
in iron-work, nails, tools of every kind,
inplee hooks, hinges, and every necessary
thing I could think of;

I carried also a hundred spare arms,
muskets, and fusees; besides some pistols,
s. considerable quantity of shot of all
lifesthree or four tons of lead, and two
pieces of brass cannon; and, because I
knew not what time and what was

barrels of powder, besides swords, cnt
lessee, and the iron part of some pikes and
halberte. So that, in short, we had a large
magazine of all sorts of stores; and I
made my nephew carry two small quarter
deck guns more then he wanted for his
ship, to leave behind if there wesoccasion;
that when we came there, we might _build

. We set out on the 5th of February from
Ireland, and had a very fair gale of wind
lor some days. As I remember, it might
be about the 20th of February, in the even-
ing late, when the mate, having the watch,
came into the round-house, and told us he
saws flash of fireand hearda gunfired.

 

This made us all run out upon the quarter-
deck, where we saw a very great light,
which we concluded must be some ship
on fire at sea; and as, by our hearing the
noise of guns just before, we concluded
that it could not be far of, we stood
directly towards it. In about half an hour's
sailing, the wind being fair and the weather
clearing up a little; we could painlydis
new that itwasagreat shiponfire.

ROBINSON C'RUSOE.

I immediately orde'zed that five guns
should be fired, one soon. after another,
that, if possible, we might give notice to
them that there was help for them at hand,
and that they might endeavor to save
themselves in their boat; for though we
could see the flames of the ship, yet they,
it being dark, could see nothing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only

 

 

driving as the burning ship drove, waiting
for daylight; when, on a sudden, to out
great terror, though we had reason to
expect it, the ship blew up in the air; and
in a few minutes the rest of the ship sunli-

There were two priests among them, one
much older than the other. This old priest
went stark mad, but the young one was
very calm, and after he had fallen on his
knees and given thanks, he did much to
quiet the others. In a little more than a

I shall trouble nobody with the little in-
cidents of wind, weather, currents, etc, on
the rest of our voyage; but, to shorten my
story, shall observe that I came to my old
habitation, the island, on the 10th of April,
1695. It was with no small difficulty that
I found the place; for, as I came to it, and
went from it, before, on the south and east
side of the island, coming from the Brazils,
so now, coming in between the main and
the island, I did not know it when I saw it.

We went on shore on several islands,
but, none for my purpose; only this I
learned by my coasting "the shore, that l
was under one great mistake before, viz,
that the continent which I thought I saw
from the island I lived in, was really no
continent, but a long island, or rather a
ridge of islands.

Thus, coasting from one island in an-
other, at length I came fail-on the south
side of my island, and presently knew the
  

very countenance of the place ; so I brought
the ship safe to an anchor, broadside with
the little creek where my old habitation
was. '

As soon as I saw the place, I called for
Friday, and asked him if he knew where
he was? He looked about a little, and,
presently clapping his hands, cried, " Oh,

"Well, well," says I, "Friday, you don't

 

know; but shall we see anyone else,
then 'r'" The fellow, it seems, had better
eyes than I, and he points to the hill just
above my old house; and, though we lay
half a league 03, he cries out, "Me see,
me see, yes, yes, me see much man there,
and there, and there!"

 

yes; oh, there--oh, yes; oh, there!" point-
ing to our old habitation, and fell dancing
and capering like a mad fellow; and I had
much ado to keep him from jumping into
the sea, to swim ashore to the place.
"Well, Friday," says I, "do you think
we shall find anybody here? and do you
think we shall find your father?" "No,
'10." says he, shaking his head, "no see
him more; no, never more see him again.
be long ago die; he much old man."

As soon as Friday told me he saw
people, I caused the English ancient to be
spread, and fired three guns, to give them
notice we were friends; and immediately
ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me;
and went directly on shore, taking with
me the young friar. We had, besides.
about sixteen men well armed, if we laid
found any new guests there which we did
not know of: but we had no need A
weapons. 'l

m

 

As we went on shore, the first man I
fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard
whose life I had saved. I ordered nobody
to go on shore at first but myself; but
there was no keeping Friday in the boat,
for the afiectionate creature had spied his
father at a distance, and if they had not
let him go ashore, he would have jumped
into the sea. He was no sooner on shore,
but he flew away to his father, like an
arrow out of a bow. It would have made
any man shed tears, in spite 'of the firmest
resolution, to have seen the first transports
of this poor fellow's joy when he came to
his father: how he embraced him, kissed
him, stroked his face, took him up in his

arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay
down byhim; then stood and looked a.
him for a quarter of an hour together;
then lay down on the ground, and stroked
his legs, and kissed them, and then got up
again, and stared at him; one would have
thought the fellow bewitched. But it
would have made a dog laugh the next
day to see how his passion ran out another

I way. In the morning, he walked along the

shore again with his old father, several
hours, always leading him by the hand, as
if he had been a lady; and every now and
then he would come to the boat to fetch
something or other for him, either a lump
of sugar, 9. dram, a biscuit cake, or some
thing or other that was good. In the
afternoon, his frolics ran another way; for
then he would set the old in on down upon
the ground, and dance about him, and!
make a thousand antic postures and gea-
tures; and all the while he did this he
would be talking to him, and telling him
one story or another of his travels, and of
what happened to him abroad, to divert
him. In short, if the same filial afi'ectiou

many trees, and'in ten years' time they
were grown so big, that, in short, the place
was inaccessible, except by such windings
and blind ways as they themselves only,
who made them, could find.

I asked him what put them upon all

there was need enough of it, when they

had given me an account how they had
 

passed their time. Nothing that ever befell
him in his life, he said, was so nfilicting to
him at first, as the disappointment when he

As to the three barbarians (so he called
them) that were left behind, and of whom,
he said, he had a long story to tell me, the
Spaniards all thought themselves much
better among the savages, only that their
number was so small; "and," says he, " had
they been strong enough, we had been all

answered, I was afraid of it when I left
them there, and nothing troubled me at
my panting from the island. but that they
were not come back, that .5. might have put
them in possession of everything first, and
left the others in a state 05 subjection, as
they deserved.

\Vhile I was saying "is, the man
came whom he had sent back, and with
him eleven more. In the dress they were
in, it was impomible to guess what nation
they were of; but he made all cluf' both
to them and to me. First he turned to
me,- and pointing to them, said, "These,
sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe
their lives to you," and then turning to
them, and pointing to me, he let them
know who I was; upon which they all
came up, one by one, not as if they hall
been sailors, and ordinary fellows, but
really as if they had been noblemw. and I
a monarch.

their afiairs; but as for the Englishmen,
they did nothing but ramble about the
island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises;

island in safety.

The only just thing the augues did was
that, when the Spaniards came ashore, they
gave my letter to them, and gave them

gave them the long paper of directions

One of the Englishmen returned Ien
briskly, "What had they to do there? than
they came on show without leave; and
that they should not plant or build upon
the island; it was none of their ground.'
"Why," said the Spaniard, very calmly,
"Seignior Inglese,'they must not starve.'

They had taken three prisoners, as I

as slaves they did well enough. But they

because the fellow'hnd not ,done some
thing right which he bid him do, drew a
hatchet out of a. frog-belt, in which he
wore it, and fell upon the poor savage to
kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was
by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous
7 cut in his shoulder, placed himself between
him and the savage. The fellow, being
enraged the more at this, struck at the.
Spaniard with his hatchet, when the
Spaniard knocked him down with a shovel.
The two other Englishmen rushed on the
Spaniard, and the other Spaniards coming
40 the rescue, a sharp fight ensued, and
then the three Englishmen were taken
prisoners. . s i .
Some of 'the Spaniards were then for
putting them to death; but the merciful
governor decided that they should be
' turned away to live by themselves, and
forbidden to come Mar them under pain

 

 

of beingshot. He gave them groin and
provisions and all else that they needed,
except arms and ammunition, and they
went and builded huts on a. remote part of
the island. Here they lived for nearly a.
year, "then they came in one day and
asked for a canoe and arms, and said they
would go over to the mainland and seek '
their fortunes The Spaniards gave their
arms and ammunition and some tools. andhaving baked bread enough to serve them

and a great basket of dried grapes, a pot
of fresh water, and a young lddelive, they
boldly set out in the canoe for a. voyage
over the sea, where it was at least forty
miles broad; The Spaniards called after
them, "Ban ueyajol" and no man ever
thought of seeing them any more.

  

But after Wound-twenty days' absence
they ell came back, and upon being ques~
Boned told of their adventures. They had
reached what they thought the main land
Ind found it only an island. The savages
mhed down to the shore to fight them, so
they did not land. They landed, however,

treated. 01: that island, they were told

our isldnd'a'nd then had them bound in

Upon hearing such a remarkable story, all
went over to the huts to look at them.
Here they eat, all of them stark naked.
["ixstpthere were three men, lusty, comely
fellows, welleh'apedfitra'ght and fair limbs,
about thirty and thirty-five years of age;
and five women, whereof two might be
from thirty to forty; two more not above

_ four or five-and-twenty; and the fifth,e
tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seven-
teen. The women were well-favored,egree-
able persons, both in shape and features,
only tawny; and two of them, had they
been perfectly white, would have passed
for very handsome women, even in London
itself.

Only one of them, a woman, could

.nnderstand Friday's father, but through
her we soon made them understand that
they were not to" be eaten, nor even killed.
At this, when we untied them, they all
fell to dancing, and then they all bega

 

n to
take up things to signify that they would
work. As there were five women and
five Englishmen, the Spaniards let these
last each choose one for a wife, which they
did. And now each one built a hut for
himself, the two honest ones in one place,
and the three rogues in another.

Some time after this, five or six canoes
ot savages came on shore. Our men kept
within doors till the canoes were gone,
and then it was discovered that they had
left three of their number behind, and
they lay under a tree fast asleep. After

prisoners; and they did so. The poor
fellows were strangely frightened when
they were seized upon and bound; and
afraid, like the women, that they should be
murdered and eaten for it "eems those
people think all the world do Do they do;
but they were soon made easy as to that.
One of them run away to the woods-
and was never seen again. He probabl'
 

escaped with some canoes that came ashore
soon after.

The first testimony they had that this
fellow had given intelligence of them was,
that, about two months after, six-- canoes of
savages came rowing along the north side
of the island, where they never used to

:ome before, and landed about a mile from
the habitation of the two Englishmen,

their huts and then scattered about the
island. A number of them coming- up to
the hollow tree, the two Englishmen fired
and killed all but one. Among the killed

When our men came out from the tree,

the savage who was not killed began to
make piteous moans for his life, so they
tied him to a tree and ran on to their
wives. Soon after, the other savages went
away as they came. It was five 01- six
months before they saw any more of the

 

savages, when, on a sudden, they wer;

go with them to their wars, and in one of
them the Spaniard, whom I had rescued,
was taken prisoner. They were very
grateful to me for sending for them, and
were very polite and kind in every way.
So I called them all together one day, and
showed them the stores I had brought,

and Was going to leave them, for I had

not come to take them away. First, I
asked them, one by one, if they. were
willing to stay, and would give up all

animosities, one to another. And each -

told me he would.

Will Atkins, with abundance oPS frank- i -

ness, said they had met with affliction
enough to make them all sober, and ene-
mies enough to make them all friends;
that, for his part, he would live and die
with them; that they had done nothing to
him, but what his own mad humor made
necessary; and,that he would ask them
pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and
bmtish things he had done to them; and
as for going to England, he cared not if
he did 'not' go thither these twenty years.

\ We went back, and after a while Will
Atkins and his wife came in. Upon ques-
tioning him, he told me that he had tried
to talk to his wife about God. She would
not believe him at first, because she could
not understand why he did not worship so

him that he realized what a great sinner he
had been, and he had resolved to be if>>

and I carried him a way which none knew
but myself, and where the trees were very
thick, when, coming to the edge of the ..
wood, 1 saw Atkins and his tawny wife : .in-
sitting under the shade of a, bush, very
eager in discourse, pointing up to the sun,

said so, the man fell into transports of
passionate joy.
Having now-done with the island, I left
them all in good circumstances, and in a
flourishing condition, and went on board
my ship again on the 6th of May. I prom-
ised to send them farther relief from the
Brazils, and particularly I promised to
send them some cattle, such as sheep, hogs
and cows. Astothe two cows and calves
which I brought from England, we had
been obliged to kill them at sea, for want
,of hay to feed them. '
about three days after We had sailed,
_ whilewe were becalmed, a great fleet of

canoes were seen approaching us. I had the
ship brought to an anchor; the boats were
put overboard and manned, for I was afraid
only that they would set the ship on fire.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed
to be struck with wonder and astonishment,
as at a sight which doubtless they had
never seen before. They came up, how

ever, very near to us, and seemed 'to go

about to row mnnd us; but we called to
our men in the boats not to let them come
too near them. .Our men beckoned with
their hands to keep them back, which they
understood very well, and went back; but
at their retreat about fifty arrows came on
board us from these boats, and one of our
men in the long-boat was wounded. How-
ever, I called to them not to fire by any
means; but we handed down some deal
boards into the boat, with which they made
a kind of fence to cover them. The)-' not be; so we went on.

of the sloop I had bought, and'that it was
my design to send some supplies to the
people on my island, he ofiered to attend
to it for me.

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished
the sloop in a very few' days; and I gave

Though the people thereon fierce ant

as knives, scissors, etc, for some fat bu!-
locks.

It happened one evening, when we went
on shore, that a greater number of their
people came down than usual, but all very
friendly and civil; and they brought sev-
eral kinds of provisions, for which we
satisfied themwith such toys aswe had,

the women brought us milk and roots,

and all was quiet, and we made us a little
tent or hut of some houghs, and lay on
shore all night. But I was not so well
satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and
I spread the sail on the bottom of the host,
and lay all night in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning, we
heard one of our men make a terrible noise
on the shore, calling out for God's sake to
bring the boat in, and. come and help
them. At the same time I heard the fire of
five muskets, which was the number of
guns they had, and then three'times over;

were in America, where I had to do with

swain and his party were resolved to make
a visit to the Indian town, where these
dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked
me to go along with them; and if they
could find them, as they still fancied they
should, they did not doubt of getting a
good booty; and it might, be they might
find Tom Jefi'y there; that was the man's
name we had lost. . .

I positively refused it, and rose up, for I
was sitting on the ground, in order to go
to the boat. One or two of the men began
 

an opportune me to go; and, when I re-
fused, began to grumble, and say they were
not under my command, and they would go.

would all leave her. I sent for the captain,
and told him it would be so hard for him

left me, with all my good" and with plenty
of money. '

Here I met an English merchant, and to
gether we bought a ship and made trading
voyages to the Spice Islands-and to China
with great profit. We then sold our shin

a Dutch ship came into port, and the man
who claimed to be the captain offered to

the crew left her, which we thought very
strange, but we afterwards learned that
they had mutinied and murdered the cap-
tain, and after sailing-for a while aspirates
had sold the ship to us. We picked up
some English and some Dutch sailors, and
resolved to go to China again.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds
obliged to beat up and down a great while
in the Straits of Malacca. and among the
islands, we were no sooner got clear of
those difficult seas, than we found our ship
had sprung a leak, and we were not able,
by all our industry, to find out where it
was. This forced,us to put into the river
of Cambodia. While 'we were here, and

going often on shore for refreshment, there
comes to me one day an Englishman, and
he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board
an English East India ship, which rode in
the same river, and speaking English,
" Sir," says he, " you are a stranger to me,
and I to you ; but I have somethiugio tell
you that very nearly concerns you."

I looked steadfastly at him a good while,
and thought at first I had known him, but
I did not. " If it very nearly concerns
me," said I, "and not yourself, what moves
you to tell it to me i" "I am moved,"
says he, " by the imminent danger you are
in, and, for ought I see, you have no know-
ledge of it." "I know no danger I amin."
says I, "'but that my ship is leaky, and I
cannot find it out; but I intend to lay her
aground tomorrow, to see if I can find it"
" Do you know, sir," said he, " the town 0i
bamnoiu'a lies about fifteen leagues up this
nver; and there are two large English sh'ms
about five leagues on this side, and three
Dutch?" I turned short upon him, and
' said: "Sir, I wish you would explain
yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I
have to be afraid of any of the Company's
ships, or Dutch ships. What can. they
have to say to me 2" " Well, sir," says he,
"if you think yourself secure, you must
take your chance; I am sorry your fate
should blind you against good advice; but
assure yourself, if you do not put to sea
immediately, you will the very next tide
be attacked by five long-boats full of men,
and perhaps, if you are taken. you will be
hanged for a pirate."
This led me to question him further, and
I found that he himself took usfor pirates,
knowing the story of the killing of the
captain and the seizing of the ship by the
meal who- sold her to us. As soon as I

 

reached the side of the ship, my partner.

told me he had stopped the leak, and we
weighed anchor and 'set sail at once. It
was not'lon'g before we found ourselves
shed by five boats. As they came up
and were making to board us, we poured
in a broadside upon them which sank one
heat, and running out our two long guns,
we kept firing till'the rest gave up the
chase. We picked up three of their men
and went on our way, and reached the
coast of Cochin China. As We did not find
the ship so perfectly tight and sound as we
desired, we resolved while we were at this
place to lay her on shore, and take out
what heavy things we had on board, and
clean bar bottom, if possible, to find out
where the leaks were.

 

 

The inhabitants, who had never been
acquainted with such a sight, came won-
dering down the sho1e to look at us; and
seeing the ship lie down on one side in
suchO a manner, and heeliug in towzmls the
shore, and not seeing our men, who were
at work on her bottom with stages, and
with their boats on the offside, they pre
sently concluded that the ship was cast
away, and lay inst 011 the ground. On this -
supposition, they all came about us in two
or three hoixls' time, with ten or twelve
large boats, intending, no doubt, to have
come on board and plundered the ship, and
if they found us theie, to have cmricd us
away PS01 slaves to their king, or \1 hatever '
they call him. ,

When they came up to the ship, and
began torow round her, they discovered
us all hard at work on the outside of the
ship's bottom and side, washing, and grav
ing and stopping, as every seafaringr Munknows how. They stood for a while gaz-
ing at us, and we, who were a little sur-
prised, could not imagine what their de-
sign was; but being willing to be sure, we
took this opportunity to get some of us
into the ship, and others to hand down
arms and ammunition to those that were
at work, to defend themselves with, if
there should be occasion. And it was no
more than need--for they agreed, it seems,
that the ship was really a wreck, and that
we were all at work endeavoring to save
her. Upon this, they took it for granted
we all belonged to them, and away they
came directly upon our men.

Our men, seeing so many of them, began
to be frightened, and cried out to usto
know what they should do. I immediately
called to the men to come on board; and
the few who were on board worked with

boats could do as they were ordered, before
the Cochin Chinese were upon them; and
two of their boats boarded our long-boat,
and began to lay hold of. the men as their
prisoners.

The first man they laid hold of was an
English seaman, a stout, strong fellow. He
grappled the pagan, and dragged him out

i their boat into ours, where, taking him
by the ears, he beat his head against the
boat's gunnel; and, in the meantime, a
Dutchman took up a musket, and with the

.-. i buttend of it so laid about him, that he

knocked down five of them. But this was
doing little towards resisting thirty or forty

' men, who began to throw themselves into

the long-boat, where we had but five men
in all to defend it; however, the following,
accident, which deserved. our laughter,
gave our men a complete victory.

Our carpenter being prepared to grave
the outside of the ship, as well as to pay
the seams where he had caulked her to stop
the leak, had got two kettles just let down
into the boat, one filled with boiling pitch,
and the other with resin, tallow, and oil,
and such stufi as the shipwrights use for
that work; and the man that attended the

he could do so very well, and that there
was a. great Dutch ship gone up that way

for a Dutch ship was now our terror. The
old man found me a little confused and
under some concern when .he named a
Dutch ship, and said to me," Sir, you need

"0h, sir," says he, "don't be concerned; I
do not know that there have been any

one, which was seen, as I hear, in the Bay
of Siam, about a month since; but you may

fit for the work. , She was not built-for a
privateer, but was run away with- by a rep-

. rebate crew that was on board, after theeap-

tain and some of his men had been mur-
dered." " Why, then," said I, " they deserve
death." "Nay," said the old man, "they
do deserve it, and they will certainly have
it, if they light upon any English or Dutch
ship; for they have all agreed together,
that if they meet that rogue, they'll give
him no quarter."

After more conversation, I told him the
whole story of how we got the very ship
that he was talking of. He was greatly
surprised, but he said we did well to go to
Nanquin, for if we fell into the hands of
the English or Dutch at that time they
would listen to no explanation. He ad-
vised that we sell the ship at Nanquin and
buy a Chinese junk, and promised to assist
us at both sale and purchase. He promised,
too, to see the Dutch and English masters
and explain all, so that the new owners of
the ship should not have the same trouble
that we had.

While these things were passing between
us, by way of discourse, we went forward
directly for Nanqnin, andjn about thirteen
days' sail came to an anchor at the south-
west point of the great Gulf, where, by the
way, I came by accident to understand that
two Dutch ships were gone the length be
fore me and that I should certainly fall into
their hands. I consulted my partner again
in this exigency, and he was as much at 0
losses I was, and would very gladly have
been safe on shore almost anywhere; how-
ever, I was not in such perplexity neither,
but I asked the old pilot if there was no
creek or harbor which I might put into
  

and pursue my business with the Chinese
mvately, and be in no danger of the
enemy. He told me if I would sail to the
southward about forty- two leagues, there
was a little port called Quinchang, where
the fathers of the mission usually landed
'mm Macao, on their progress to teach
the Christian religion to the Chinese, and
where no European sh lis ever put in. We
resolved to go to this place, and weighed
it once.

We did not come to the other port (the
wind being contrary) for five days; but it
was very much to our satisfaction; and I
_was joyful when I set nry foot on shore,
'lee'ilving, and nry partner too, that if it
were possible to dispose of ourselves and
efiects any other way we would never set
one foot on board that unhappy vessel
ins-e. And indeed, I must acknowledge, that
i all the circumstances of life that ever I

    

I"

 

had any experience of, nothing makesman
kind so'completely miserable as that of be-
ing in constant fear. Well does theScriptme
say, "The fear of man bringeth a snare ;"
it is a life of death, and the mind is so er

tirely oppressed by it, that it is capable o.
no relief. Providence began here to clear
up our way a little; and the first thing that
oflered was, that our old Portuguese pilot
brought aJapan merchant to us, who in>>
quired what goods we had; and, in the

 

first place he bought all our opium, and
gave us :1 very good price for it, paying us
in gold by weight, some small pieces 02
their 0er coin, and some in small wedgq
of ten or twelve ounces each.

The Japan merchant would not buy the
ship, but he made-1m offer to hire her to
take home his wares. I had a young man
with me who offered to go in the ship to
lookaftermyintemets,and toaseonnt 1w
   

 

everything to me, which he did. The
Japan merchant treated him very fairly,
sending him with goods to the Manillas,
where he treated with the Spaniards and
brought back cloves and other spices.
Having got a good acquaintance at
Manilla, he got his ship made free ship,
and the governor of Manilla hired him to
go to Acapulco, on the coast of Mexico.

 

He made the voyag : to Acapulco very
happily, and there he sold his ship; and
having there also obtained allowance to
travel by land to Porto Belle, he found
means, somehow or other, to get to Jamaica
with all his treasure; and about eight years
after came to England, exceeding rich.

We were now on shore in China: if I
thought myself banished, and remote from
my own country at Bengal, where I had
many ways to get home for my money,
what could I think of myself now, when
I was got about a thousand leagues farther
0E. We went ten days' journey to the
city of Nanquin, a city well worth seeing,
indeed. They say it has a million of people
in it; it ismgularly built, the streets all
exactly straight, and cross one another in

great advantage But when I came to
compare the miserable people of these
countries with ours, their fabrics, their
manner of living, their government, their
religion, their wealth, and their 'glory, as
some call it, I must confess that I scarcely
think it worth my while to mention them
here.

We had made the acquaintance of a
Spanish priest, called Father Simon, who
was going to Pekin, and upon his invite>>
tion, we accompanied him. We were
fifteen days reaching the great city,
through a country infinitely populous.
Though very poor, the people were very
proud; and my friend Father Simon and
Iused tobemerrytoseethebeggarly
pride of these people. For example,
coming by the house of acountry gentle-
man, as Father Simon called him, about
ten leagues off the city of Nanquin, we
had first of- all the honor to ride with the
master of the house about two miles. The
state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixot-
ism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty.I
His habit was very proper for a merry-I
andrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging
sleeves; tassels, and cuts, and slashes almost
on every side. It covered a tafiety vest, asl
greasy as a butcher's, and which testified
that his honor must be a most exquisite
eleven. His horse was but a poor, starved,
hobbling'creature, and he had two slaves
following him on foot to dn've the poo
creature along. He had awhip in hishan
and he belabored the beast as fast abou

spoke good French and a. little English.
And indeed this old man was a most useful
implement to us everywhere: for we had
not been above a week at Pokin, when he
came laughing: "Ah, Seignior Inglese,"
says he, "I have something to tell which
rill make your heart glad." In short, he
told as there was a great caravan of Mus

preparing to set out on their journey by

tunity to go with them.

I confess I was g1 eatly surprised with
this good news, and had sc'srce power a

turned to him." How do you know this i"
said I; "are you sure it is true?" " es,"
says he; "'I met this morning on the street
an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian,
who 1s among them." We then went ta
consult together what was to bedone; an( .
I asked my partner what he thought of the
pilot's' news, and whether it would suit

I with his affairs? He told me he would do

' goodvoyage here, if he could invest it in

China silks, wrought and raw, such as
might be worth the carriage, he would be
content to go to England, and then make
his voyage back to Bengal by the Com-
pany's ships

The old pilot was of so much service to
us that We agreed'to pay him a good price

to accompany us, to which he consented,

and we soon made our arrangements to
start with the caravan.' ~
it was the beginning of February, our
style, when we set out from Pekin. My
partner and the old pilot had gone express
back to the port where we had first put
in, to dispose of some goods which we had
left there; and l, with aChinese merchant
went to Nauquin, where I bought ninety
pieces of fine dmnasks, with about two hun~
dred pieces of other very fine silks of sew
eml sorts. some mixed with gold. Besidel
this, We bought a. very huge quantity <<1
16?

 

raw silk, and some other goods, our cargo
amounting, in these goods only, to about
three thousand five hundred pounds ster-
ling; which, together with tea and some
fine calicoes, and three camels' loads of
nutm'egs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen
camels {or our share, besides those we rode
upon; which, with two or three spare
horses. and two horses loaded with pro-
visions, made us. in short, twenty-six
camels and horses in our retinue.

The company was very great, and, as far
.as I can remember, made between three
and four hundred horse, and upwards of
one hundred and twenty men, very well
armed, and provided for all events. The
company consisted of people of several
nations; but there were about sixty of
them merchants of Moscow: and to our
particular satisfaction, five of them were

Scots, who appeared also to be men of
great experience in business, and of very
good substance. '

When we had travelled one day's jour-
ney, the guides, who were five 3: number,
called all the gentlemen and merchants----
that is to say. all the passengers except the
servants--to a great council. as they called
it. At this council, eve'.y one deposited
a certain quantity of money to a common
stock, for the necessary expense of bu} ing
forage on the way, where it was not other-
wise to be had, and for satisfying the
guides, getting horses, and the like; and
here they constituted the journey, asthey
call it,viz., they named captains and officers
to draw us all up. and give the word of
command. in case of an attack. and give
every one their turn of command.

In two days more we passed the great

aChins wall, made for a fortification against
the Tartan; and a very great work it is,
going over hills and mountains in a need-
less track, where the rocks are impassable,
and the precipices such as no enemy could
l'pomi'nly enter, or indeed climb up. They
tell us its length is near a thousand English
miles, but that the country is five hundred
in a straight measured line, which the wall
hounds, without measuring the windings

  

and Immings it takes. It is about four
fathoms high, and as many thick in some
places.

caravan was in passing the gate), to look at
it on every side, near and far ofi--I mean

it was s most excellent thing to keep out
the Tartar-s; which he happened not to
understand as I meant it,.and so took it for
a compliment; but the old pilot laughed,

speak in colors." "In colors 1" said I;
"what do you mean by that t" "Why,
you speak what looks white this way, and

anoth'br. You tell him it is a good wall
to keep out Tartars; you tell me by that
it is good for nothing but to keep out
Tartars. I understand you, Seignior
Inglese; but Seignior Chinese understands
you his own way." "Well," says I, "sei'
gnior, do you think it would stand out an
army of our country people, with a good
train of artillery? or our engineers, with
two companies of miners? Would they
not hatter it down in ten days, that an
army might enter in battalia? or blow it
up in the air, foundation and all, that there
should be no sign of it left ?" "Ay, ay,"
says he, " I know that."

Soon afterthiaas apartyofushad
left the caravan to hunt wild sheep, we
met about forty Tartars, and as soon
as they saw us, one of them blew a
kind of horn very loud, but with a bar-
barous sound. We all supposed this was

to call their friends about them, and so it
ins; for, in less than ten minutes, a. troop
of forty or fifty more appeared, at about
a mile distance; but our work was over
first, as it happened.

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow
happened to be with us, and as soon as he
heard the horn, he told us that we had no
thing to do but to charge them imme-
diately, without loss of time; and drawing

   
    

    

 

us up in aline, he asked if we were re-
solved. We told him we were ready to
follow him; so he rode direI-tly towards
them. As soon as they saw .5 advance
they let fly their arrows, which, however,
missed us, very happily. It seems they mis-
took not their aim, but their distance; for
their arrows all fell short of us, but with
so true an aim, that had we been about
twenty yards nearer, we must have had
several men wounded, if. not killed.

Immediately we halted, and though it
was at a great distance, we fired, and sent
them leaden bullets for wooden arrows,
following our shot full gallop, to fall in
among them sword in hand. As soon as
we came up to them we fired our pistols in
their faces, and then drew; but they fled
in the greatest confusion imaginable.

We wanted two days' journey of the
city of Naum, on the frontier of tho
 

 

Chinese Empire, when we met messengers '

from the governor to tell all caravans to
halt .till they had a guard sent for them;
for thata body of Tartars, making ten
thousand in all, had appeared in the way,
about-thirty miles beyond the city. Ac-
cordingly, two days after, we had two hun-

to pack up to continue my journey with a
caravan that was soon to start, and I won-
dered why the prince could not go with
me. But my wonder was over when I
. entered upon that subject with the person
I have mentioned. "Consider, first, sir,"
said he, "the place where we are; and,
secondly, the condition we are in. We are
surrounded with stronger things than bars

neither pass undiscovered by the road, nor
subsist by any other way; so that it is
vain to attempt it." However, I prevailed
upon him to make the attempt to escape

with me. We did not start till June, and,
after much hrudship and fatigue we finally
entered Europe, having passed the river
Kama, which in these parts is the boundary
between Europeand Asin. The first city
on the European side was called Soluy
Kamskoi, which is as much as to say, the
great city on the river Kama; and here we
thought to see some evident alteration in

little better than the savages of America;
their houses and towns .full of idols, and
their way living was wholly barbarous,
